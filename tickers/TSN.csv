we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [operator instructions] the first question comes from ben bienvenu with stephens, inc. please go ahead.
ben bienvenu -- stephens, inc. -- analyst
hey, thanks. good morning, everybody.
dean banks -- president & chief executive officer
good morning, ben.
ben bienvenu -- stephens, inc. -- analyst
i've got two questions. one about guidance, and then second, kind of bigger picture strategic question. first on guidance, i want to focus in on the chicken guidance, given that -- i think most of the other elements of your guidance makes sense, but i wanted to probe on chicken. i understand the view around rising grain costs. and i know it's a relatively low stocks to use, that's going to be a particularly tight environment this year. just to those out though with what chicken prices have done year-to-date, i'm curious around what's embedded in your outlook as it relates to chicken prices for the year relative to grain costs?
and then also relative to last year, which was tumultuous for the industry and for you. you've had some unusual charges and costs last year that, in some ways, artificially suppressed your chicken margins. so maybe talk about that relative to your view and your guidance this morning that chicken margins will be lower year-over-year?
dean banks -- president & chief executive officer
sure, ben. first off, thanks for the question. thanks for the interest in the company. as you saw in the slide presentation, we are making substantial investments toward improving the chicken business overall. first off, in being employer of choice, we're making investments in operational performance and really getting our fill rates up to ultimately service our customers. those are not bullets on slide; those are actions that are actively taking place. and as we said before, we're one of the world's largest chicken businesses, so it's going to take some time for those activities to materialize into our operational performance overall.
as it relates to pricing, as we've said before, a lot of the pricing in the company happens -- for poultry happens in the first and second quarter. we've made substantial progress there and are satisfied with how it's coming together.
ben bienvenu -- stephens, inc. -- analyst
okay. so, just as a quick follow-up on that. when we look at kind of commodity chicken market, i guess we need to assume a more tempered impact of the dynamics in that market on your chicken sales prices to square up with your guidance in your release this morning. is that a fair characterization?
dean banks -- president & chief executive officer
the industry as a whole is certainly facing a number of headwinds with grains, with transportation costs, labor, etc. we're managing those. some of that's uncontrollable. with vaccinations, we will see foodservice recovery, but it's effect on, i'm not going to project.
ben bienvenu -- stephens, inc. -- analyst
okay. fair enough. my second question is kind of bigger picture. on the renewable diesel industry and the projected growth in that industry that's growing rapidly, it's having even already a pretty meaningful impact on rendered animal fats and rendered animal fats pricing. i know you guys are a large ringer in the chicken operation. i'm curious, one, how you think you're positioned relative to that bigger picture, structural demand driver? and two, you can comment on how actively you are involved in being a feedstock provider to any producers?
dean banks -- president & chief executive officer
sure. a few things there. rendering is a fantastic part of our business and gives us, certainly, some improved margins that we can make full use of whatever animals are entrusted into our care. it also gives us a lot of flexibility in production. so the purchase of api that we made a few years ago has turned out to be great for the business. you may also know that we've made an investment in a joint venture with jacob stern in our beef and pork business to take a lot of the byproduct and make that ready and more ready for renewable diesel. that's a great partnership and progressing well.
we do see strong demand for all of the animal byproducts that could be going into that space, and we think it's a promising part of the business.
ben bienvenu -- stephens, inc. -- analyst
great. and best of luck. thank you.
dean banks -- president & chief executive officer
thank you.

the next question comes from adam samuelson of goldman sachs. please go ahead.
adam samuelson -- goldman sachs -- analyst
yes. thanks. good morning, everyone.
dean banks -- president & chief executive officer
good morning.
stewart f. glendinning -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
good morning, adam.
adam samuelson -- goldman sachs -- analyst
good morning. so i guess, just continuing on the chicken business. and i'm just trying to make sure i'm thinking about the moving pieces here properly. is the outlook -- the revised outlook for profits to be down year-on-year. is that, solely a function of grain? is there some of the absorption of the incremental covid costs? has your underlying productivity kind of expectations changed in a material way, kind of thoughts on just mix? so i'm just trying to make sure i understand how the view has evolved since you gave the outlook in november, and maybe comment on some of those buckets?
dean banks -- president & chief executive officer
so, certainly, like i said in the previous answer, we are investing heavily and getting that business back on track. and we do expect foodservice recovery to help with some of the historical deleveraging we've seen there, as we convert business from back to foodservice. stewart, do you want to add anything?
stewart f. glendinning -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
yes, that would be great. look, in the presentation, we shared with you some specifics on where we're working in chicken. we wanted you to be clear that we understand where the challenges are and where we are making changes.
with respect to the change in forecast, you're right. i mean, the biggest change is grains. i mean the change in pricing and grains have been nothing less than enormous. and that is going to weigh on the business. so, that's a simple -- the easiest answer.
adam samuelson -- goldman sachs -- analyst
okay. that's all very helpful. and then as we think about maybe beyond this year, i'm just -- with the grain environment is what it is, those things will work themselves out one way or the other. either pricing in the industry will move higher over time or grains will actually -- will get back into surplus at one day. help me -- has the view on kind of through-cycle profitability in the chicken business changed? or how do you think about kind of where the opportunity really is? i mean, the business has had a -- been in a lot of different places from a profitability perspective in the last five, seven years. and i think we're all kind of struggling to calibrate a little bit where the portfolio is currently structured. it can really get to in a normal market environment when it's executing properly.
dean banks -- president & chief executive officer
yes, i think we described before that we do expect the operational improvements that we're making to materialize in the second half of the year and really, really show up in 2022. again, with being one of the largest poultry businesses in the world, it takes some time to get those operational improvements back on track. we put donnie king in place. have a very strong team there that are really on top of the things that we know that we need to improve to be where we want to be.
the long-term supply/demand dynamics in the classic poultry cycles, i'm not necessarily going to comment on. but i will say that our ability to value up our portfolio into our retail businesses and to add features and attributes that bring new households into our brands and into our poultry business, like you've seen with air fried are nothing short of exceptional. i think that gives us a real advantage in the future to expand upon -- to make the business not only competitive, but winning in the space.
adam samuelson -- goldman sachs -- analyst
okay. i appreciate the color, dean. i will pass it on. thank you.
dean banks -- president & chief executive officer
thank you.

the next question comes from peter galbo of bank of america. please go ahead.
peter galbo -- bank of america -- analyst
hey, guys. good morning. thanks for taking the question.
dean banks -- president & chief executive officer
good morning.
peter galbo -- bank of america -- analyst
maybe to pivot a little bit to prepared foods. the slide, i think it's 15, in the deck is helpful in understanding, kind of, some of the input costs and understanding that maybe as foodservice comes back that there's a little bit of a negative mix. but i wanted to shift the conversation to pricing ability there within prepared foods maybe on the retail side, as you're seeing this level of deep levels of inflation. is there anything you've done or anything you've seen in your internal research that would say consumer elasticities are different this time around, whether it's due to higher savings rates or people being stuck at home, even in a post-covid world that you feel like your ability to pass along pricing in prepared food this time might be easier just given some of the dynamics of the consumer that have changed? and then i have a follow-up as well.
dean banks -- president & chief executive officer
i would say that we do see higher consumer interest in spending on food. i think that's benefited a couple of our businesses. prepared foods is one, beef is another. just very, very strong demand. and again, our flexibility from retail to foodservice is going to allow us to step-in and meet consumers wherever they are.
some of the costs that we incur, we can happily pass along to customers, some we can't. and we do see rising input costs there. but we're very, very well-positioned with the portfolio to meet consumers where they are and make sure that we're able to take care of them.
peter galbo -- bank of america -- analyst
okay. and maybe just one on chicken, and maybe to ask adam's question in a bit of a different way. looking at the three kind of pillars you guys have outlined for improving chicken, i mean those are all helpful from our perspective. but i guess what's tough is, it's hard for us to view this from an outside perspective and understand if things are actually going right underlying. so, is there any way for us to track how these improvements are going from an external basis or anywhere you would want to steer for us to know that you're on the right track?
dean banks -- president & chief executive officer
i'd say that what you can do is take a look at our historical financial performance, see where we're going. a lot of the market indicators related to our retail product performance is indicative of us being able to gain customer traction there. and then you can probably look back at the historical foodservice performance with some rough estimates and see that when we pick up foodservice, when that volume comes back. and we can pick our volume back up with the operational improvements that we put in place are going to help us deleverage or fix the deleverage and operate at a higher level.
peter galbo -- bank of america -- analyst
okay. thanks very much, guys.
operator
the next question comes from ken goldman of jpmorgan. please go ahead.
ken goldman -- jpmorgan -- analyst
hi. good morning. and megan, welcome. i wanted to ask about the beef guidance improvement. i know it's not officially quantitative, but the tone is better. and i just wanted to ask how much of that is from underlying fundamentals getting a little bit better versus the change in comp period results and the gain from your cattle supplier issue? i just wanted to get a sense of what the underlying, i guess, dynamics are there?
dean banks -- president & chief executive officer
generally, the dynamics are very good for the business and the team is managing those dynamics extremely well. there's very strong demand in really all channels, including exports. and from a supply perspective, it's really clear that we've seen a slight downtick of about 1% in breeder stock, but the cattle supply remains strong for the business. and as we've said before, it's a spread business. so, the operational component, the teams are nailing; and the dynamics for the industry are actually looking attractive.
ken goldman -- jpmorgan -- analyst
thanks. and then, my follow-up is, a little more than 10 years ago, grain prices were even more volatile than they are now. at that time the chicken industry reacted in part by changing some of its pricing dynamics. so, i think some agreements went from once a year to maybe adjusting a few times a year. i know you have dozens of pricing mechanisms and agreements probably, understanding it. but in general, do you have the desire, the ability to amend some of your contracts, so that you get a little bit closer to cost-plus across the board in chicken or something effectively like that?
i guess the reason i'm asking is, i think the stock's multiple sometimes is held back by unpredictability. and the more that you can -- not have to worry about grain, because there's an adjustment mechanism for your chicken prices are better. just curious about your thoughts along those lines.
dean banks -- president & chief executive officer
yes. there's a variety of mechanisms that we use in managing input costs. we've talked about the hedging and forward strategy, where when we sign agreements we do try to lock in the price for those agreements to fix the margin. as it relates to market pricing, as we've described before, there's a lot of different mechanisms, some cost-plus, some market based, etc. i can't really give any input on how we would consider changing pricing mechanisms for obvious reasons.
ken goldman -- jpmorgan -- analyst
okay. thanks, dean.
dean banks -- president & chief executive officer
no problem.
operator
the next question comes from ken zaslow of bank of montreal. please go ahead.
ken zaslow -- bank of montreal -- analyst
hey, good morning, everyone.
dean banks -- president & chief executive officer
good morning, ken.
stewart f. glendinning -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
good morning, ken.
ken zaslow -- bank of montreal -- analyst
my first question is, you said that 60% of your capital spending is going to growth. in an environment where you're a little struggling with your operational efficiencies, particularly in chicken, why not dedicate more resources to that to ensure the margin structure gets to where you want to do on an operational basis rather than focus on growth? just a philosophical question, i guess.
dean banks -- president & chief executive officer
yes, ken, i wouldn't necessarily conflate those two things. i think, first of all, on the chicken side, all resources that are necessary to help bring that business back are being deployed there. so, absolutely, no shortage of investment there. but when you look across the portfolio, there are a number of places where we have opportunity to grow our business by adding capacity. you think about our case-ready plant that is opening in utah. we've got a number of opportunities in prepared foods. and we recognize that unless we put ahead to meet that capacity, we're going to be in a place where we miss out on sales.
ken zaslow -- bank of montreal -- analyst
okay. and then, my follow-up question is, what is your ability to realize the higher pricing in chicken? it sounds like -- i understand the feed cost side, even on the operational side, but it sounds like we're seeing breast prices move. we're seeing leg prices move. wing prices are pretty substantially higher. and yet, it doesn't seem like you're fully incorporated. is it just because of the contracts have to kind of get through and we'll start to see that by the end of the year or into next year? how do you think about that? just the realization of pricing seems a little bit more delayed than i would have thought.
dean banks -- president & chief executive officer
we are obviously gaining from the market prices. we do have some buy versus growth strategy, where we do buy breast meat in the market, etc. i can't really comment on pricing looking forward. so, i can't comment there.
stewart f. glendinning -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
ken, the only thing i'd say is that, to dean's earlier comments, we have a wide range of pricing mechanisms. some of those are, as we've shared in the past, fixed over a longer period of time. clearly, those are not going to move as quickly. others are spot. and we'll respond quickly as the market rises.
i wouldn't discount, obviously, the fact that my earlier point, which is that the move in grains is pretty substantial. and i wouldn't overlook either the increase in transportation costs that we're seeing in the marketplace. so, it's -- there's a number of factors there that are going to play out in the p&l.
ken zaslow -- bank of montreal -- analyst
great. i appreciate it. good luck.
operator
the next question comes from ben theurer of barclays. please go ahead.
ben theurer -- barclays -- analyst
yes. hey, good morning, dean, stewart, and thanks for taking my question, and congratulations on surprisingly strong quarter. two quick ones. so first of all, within the broader concept of chicken, and obviously your investments in new plants, so just to understand and if you could maybe reiterate what you said about three months ago. so clearly, there's still going to be the start-up cost to consider, right? and that's part of your guidance, just to be clear, what you said three months ago to have this properly reflected in the model, is that correct?
stewart f. glendinning -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
yes, that's correct. i will just give you a little bit of update on that. i did say, at the time that i thought that the start-up in humboldt was going to cost about $100 million. that's coming in a little less expensively now and we think it's going to run about $75 million in the year.
ben theurer -- barclays -- analyst
okay. perfect. that's a good update. and then just following up a little bit on the beef segment and what you came to obviously there. and i mean, it really looks like it's going to be a very profitable year. but how do you think about the beef business more in the medium-term? i mean, clearly, it's been on a profitable basis and on a strong run rate over the last couple of years now. last year was by far exceptional. you expect another very, very strong year in 2021 with the updated guidance. but where do you think this is going to turn out more like in a normalized run rate? how do you think cattle suppliers are going to work through? and where do you think there might be a little bit of a headwind if grain prices were to stay high to reflect also maybe higher cattle prices? and how can you prepare for that?
dean banks -- president & chief executive officer
so, we do see that cattle -- well, feeder stock has a slight downtick and could decline overtime. herd supplies are actually still very, very strong into the foreseeable future. and what is also quite good for the business is that demand is very strong. and so, we feel like the business is positioned good for the long-term. we're not setting long-term margin guidance for the business, but we feel like the dynamics do look positive into the foreseeable future.
ben theurer -- barclays -- analyst
okay. perfect. i'll leave it here. thank you very much.

the next question comes from alexia howard of bernstein. please go ahead.
alexia howard -- bernstein -- analyst
good morning, everyone.
dean banks -- president & chief executive officer
good morning, alexia.
stewart f. glendinning -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
good morning.
alexia howard -- bernstein -- analyst
hi, there. so, coming back to the prepared foods business, the margin obviously improved very nicely this time around. you mentioned that you pulled back on marketing spending. i'm just wondering, is that from -- assuming that that comes back, and i'd like to hear what your plans are for marketing spending going forward. is that -- is this kind of the margin run rate that we might expect on that business? or is there still lumpiness that could play out there?
dean banks -- president & chief executive officer
a few things that i would just emphasize. you are correct that we will continue to reinvest in marketing and advertising as needed. there's been such strong demand in stripping production in many ways. and so, we've pulled that cost back for the time being. it will ultimately return. we won't be getting projections necessarily on how much that will return to.
the other thing to keep in mind is just from a mix perspective, we've been thrilled at having consumers go to retail outlets in order to get our food. we will see foodservice recover. and from a mix perspective, that will come in probably at a slightly lower margin. and therefore, we do know that prepared foods will have some normalization as foodservice ultimately recovers with vaccination rollouts, etc.
alexia howard -- bernstein -- analyst
okay, great. and then as a follow-up, on the pork side of the business, can we talk about the strength of the export markets at the moment? you've talked about that in recent quarters, particularly given the african swine fever dynamic. as we see the swine herd in china kind of get back to not quite normal levels but moving in that direction, do you think that that whole dynamic of african swine fever pushing up global pork prices is -- what innings are we in, i guess, is question? are we more than halfway turned down at this point? i imagine we are.
dean banks -- president & chief executive officer
it's hard to project, to be honest. we still hear reports of asf in china. we also do know that they're making aggressive measures to build a commercial herd there and making some progress toward that. we've seen global redistribution protein-related to asf cases in germany and vietnam and others. that continues to play itself out generally positively. we see very strong demand for pork, which is helping offset some of the increase in hog prices. and so far, the business is performing well.
projecting asf is very difficult. we've seen historically it takes decade plus to recover from asf in certain markets. and so, we hesitate to call whether or not we're halfway through that.
alexia howard -- bernstein -- analyst
thank you very much. i'll pass it on.
dean banks -- president & chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
the next question comes from michael piken of cleveland research. please go ahead.
michael piken -- cleveland research -- analyst
yes. good morning. i just wanted to get a flavor on the pork side of the business. are you doing anything in terms of trying to prepare for california's prop 12, which is supposed to take effect next year?
dean banks -- president & chief executive officer
so, we're obviously aware of the legislation. we are looking at the impacts on the business, but otherwise can't comment.
michael piken -- cleveland research -- analyst
okay. and then, i guess, just kind of shifting gears over back to the beef side a little bit. i know you mentioned that you think there's going to be adequate availability of cattle. what are your expectations in terms of as we progress through the year in terms of kind of the cattle weights, the grading? and does that have any impact on your mix if weight come off between the choice select, or is it relatively -- are you guys relatively indifferent if there's any changes in the way it's kind of moving forward?
dean banks -- president & chief executive officer
whether it's weather or grains, we will always be looking for the high-value and the most valuable cattle in the market. it's not really -- at this point, not really the time we can project out. impacts from that, although our team has done a phenomenal job at buying in the marketplace and making sure that we get the right cuts, and we can put those out in the highest margin, highest value. we have invested substantially in our portion business. we have capacity coming online in a couple of places in this year next. and i think that's going to actually continue to support both beef and pork in those businesses as we continue to add value and really meet the customers where they want to buy them with the portions and pieces that they want.
michael piken -- cleveland research -- analyst
okay. thank you.
operator
and just to reiterate, is there time for one last question today?
dean banks -- president & chief executive officer
one last question.
operator
thank you. that question will be from michael lavery of piper sandler. please go ahead.
michael lavery -- piper sandler -- analyst
thank you. good morning.
dean banks -- president & chief executive officer
good morning.
stewart f. glendinning -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
good morning.
michael lavery -- piper sandler -- analyst
i wanted to touch on the international piece of the business. and i guess maybe understand how much, if any of the gross capex is there, is directed there? and where you see the biggest opportunities internationally, either from an organic growth perspective or potentially interest in m&a?
dean banks -- president & chief executive officer
as we've said before, the international markets are where we see the majority of protein demand growth coming from going forward. we're really proud of our teams embracing the one tyson concept and looking at how we can use our global footprint to take, whether it's variety meats in the u.s. and export those and have those valued up into the global marketplace.
the acquisitions that we've made internationally are really helping us both in further processing product that's exported from the u.s., but also in really taking advantage of synergies related to different skill sets, functions, innovation that we've established globally.
so, the international business is a continued focus for ours, and we will continue to invest capital from an organic perspective. and we are always looking for acquisitions. you've seen the recent announcement that we are partnering with malayan flour mills. there'll be more deals like that and others to come.
stewart f. glendinning -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
the only other thing i'll just add on top q is specific on the capex, michael. we have announced investments in plants in both asia as well as in europe. so yes, specific money is going there to build out new capacity to meet the demand that we see.
michael lavery -- piper sandler -- analyst
okay. that's great. thanks. and just a follow-up on the jimmy dean plant-based patty. could you just touch on some of your thinking using the jimmy dean brand with plant-based? and what the consumer insights were behind that? and how you think about that launch?
dean banks -- president & chief executive officer
sure. that brand has just tremendous value to the customer. and if you've been to a retail grocery store and look at the freezer, the breadth and depth of that portfolio resonates with just a variety of customers. plant-based protein, not only do we have a phenomenal substrate or innovation there, but we think that that brings another customer to that freezer aisle and complements our business. and so, it was a very thoughtful approach and you'll see more of that to come.
michael lavery -- piper sandler -- analyst
and so i think you just alluded to this at the very end, but there'll be -- we should look for more plant-based options to come as well?
dean banks -- president & chief executive officer
yes. our investments in plant-based protein are continuing to show velocities and results that we would expect, so we'll continue to be investing in that area.
michael lavery -- piper sandler -- analyst
thank you very much.

good morning and welcome to the tyson first quarter fiscal 2021 earnings conference call. [operator instructions] please note, this event is being recorded.
i would now like to turn the conference over to megan britt, vice president-investor relations. please go ahead.
megan britt -- vice president of investor relations
hello, and welcome to the first quarter fiscal 2021 earnings conference call for tyson foods. on the call today are dean banks, president and chief executive officer, and stewart glendinning, evp and chief financial officer.
we have prepared presentation slides to supplement our comments, which are available on the investor relations section of the tyson website and through the link to our webcast.
during this call, we'll make forward-looking statements regarding our expectations for the future. these statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions which may cause actual results to differ materially from our current projections. please refer to our forward-looking statement disclaimers on slide 2, as well as our sec filings for additional information concerning risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our projections.
please note that references to earnings per share, operating income and operating margin in our remarks are on an adjusted basis unless otherwise noted. for reconciliations of these non-gaap measures to their corresponding gaap measures, please refer to our earnings press release.
i'll now turn the call over to dean.
dean banks -- president & chief executive officer
thank you, megan. we are pleased to have you as a new member of our tyson foods family and appreciate your leadership. i want to thank everyone listening for your interest in tyson foods. and i want to thank our 139,000 dedicated team members who come to work every day to help keep each other safe and feed the world. your work is raising the world's expectations for how much good food can do.
earlier today, we released our first quarter results for fiscal 2021. we delivered strong operating earnings performance, exceeding $1 billion in operating income for the quarter. this performance was driven by higher earnings in our prepared foods, beef and chicken segments, and demonstrates our effectiveness in addressing customer and consumer needs, while continuing to manage the ongoing effects of the global pandemic. i am exceptionally proud of our global team for their contributions to the strong result.
fundamental to our results are the considerable investments that we have made to safeguard the health, safety and wellness of our global team members. this remains our top priority.
we also continue to monitor consumer trends. the pandemic spurred changes in consumer demand patterns and created new operational complexities for our team. we have risen to the challenge that these changes have created, we flexed our footprint to adapt to shifting channel demand, scaling retail production up dramatically and innovating with attractive retail offerings.
our investments into insights, innovation and r&d are helping us win with consumers. as demonstration, we now have delivered 10 consecutive quarters of retail volume growth across our core business lines.
as we navigate continued market volatility, we're focused on operational excellence and disciplined cost management. during the quarter, we realized cost savings and progressively improved our order fulfillment results.
we are also on track relative to our stated capital allocation objectives and have prioritized key growth investments to diversify our asset base. looking forward, i am confident that our team is executing on the right priorities to meet our commitments and drive shareholder value creation.
turning to slide 4. team member health and safety is and will continue to be our top priority. we have an intense focus on team member wellbeing as a fundamental driver of engagement and satisfaction across our enterprise.
this quarter, we announced the hiring of a chief medical officer. we welcomed dr. claudia coplein in january, and look forward to her additional leadership and ensuring that our organization continues to remain vigilant and aggressive toward overall team member wellness.
we have also hired 200 new nurses and administrative staff, bringing the total occupational health staff to almost 600 team members. with these resources, we're advancing our health and safety priorities to support our vaccine rollout and build our wellness programs.
we're also opening seven pilot health clinics for team members and their families this year to increase their access to healthcare in the communities where we operate. i'm exceptionally pleased to report that our advanced preparations and investments have allowed us to start covid-19 vaccinations on a limited basis as vaccines have become available.
we have extended our ongoing partnership with matrix medical, a leading clinical services provider to prepare for broad vaccine distribution and to ensure that u.s. team members are educated across multiple languages about the covid-19 vaccine. this is part of our ongoing effort to ensure our team members have information and access to the best protections available.
in addition to supporting vaccine deployment, we continue to use testing as a major component of our covid-19 monitoring strategy and part of our health and safety measures to protect team members. we are testing thousands of team members every week and currently estimate that we have tested more than half our workforce.
our always-on testing strategy is another proactive step in our efforts to search for and fight the virus. the result of our proactive approach has been a dramatic reduction in covid-19 occurrence within our plants; a strong accomplishment given the surge in cases nationally.
as we look forward to the prospect of recovery in the months ahead, we have an incredible opportunity through our leading position in sustainability and social responsibility to drive a more sustainable future for our company and our planet.
we are excited for the upcoming publication of our annual sustainability report later this spring, which will show continued progress across our three key focus areas, including empowering people, conserving natural resources and cultivating innovation in agriculture.
as i consider our impact on these important objectives, i'm very proud of how our teams continue to drive progress and their tireless efforts toward a lasting change.
since february of 2020, tyson has donated nearly 90 million meals to 800 relief efforts in our communities, and we will continue to support those local communities where help is needed.
we will also improve our environmental footprint as we feed the world. in fact, we were the first across our peer group to announce greenhouse gas reduction targets that were accepted by the science-based targets initiative, a bold commitment to achieving a 30% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030.
we are also committed to leading in the advancement of animal welfare outcomes with transparency. to this end, we recently partnered with the university of arkansas division of agriculture to fund research and animal welfare and commercial broiler farms, which will guide industry efforts to continuously improve welfare for the birds entrusted to our care.
these initiatives, and many more to come, solidify tyson's position as a leader within this space, and our consistent progress is being recognized.
we ranked number one in the food production category on the 2021 fortune magazine world's most admired companies list. this is our fifth consecutive year in a row to receive that recognition.
turning now to slide 6. while we've experienced an operating environment that has seen pockets of volatility over the past few quarters, we are starting to see consumer behavior stabilize within the retail and foodservice channels. our diverse protein portfolio continues to be well positioned to support current consumption patterns.
consistent with our experience last year, continued strength in at-home consumption is delivering historically higher retail and ecommerce sales. we continue to outperform peers with stronger retail volume growth.
our total tyson and core business lines have posted 10 consecutive quarters of growth and four straight quarters of double-digit expansion, continuing to outpace total food and beverage.
volumes in core business lines were up nearly 14% during the latest 13 weeks and 19% during the latest 52 weeks. our growth during these periods was driven in large part by our ability to bring incremental households into our brand and product lines.
total tyson household penetration reached 81%, and we continue to see an increased number of shopping trips that included a tyson product, up 11% versus a year ago. as consumers increase their reliance on, low to no contact buying methods during the quarter, we experienced ecommerce sales growth of 89% in the latest 13 weeks compared to last year. this equated to approximately $330 million of sales through our ecommerce channel partners.
we expect ecommerce channels to remain very relevant, moving forward, as consumers maintain and shift to convenient, low to no contact buying methods.
foodservice volumes were still down relative to pre-covid-19 levels, but our channel and category mix sets us up well for a recovery as nationwide vaccination efforts are expected to drive more away-from-home protein consumption occasions.
it's important to note that some food service operators have adapted very well to the current environment and have embraced drive-through and take-out. many of these operators are not seeing the volume declines others have, and some are even outpacing historical pre-covid-19 performance.
winning with consumers by meeting their needs is core to our strategy and new innovations are a big part of that. turning to slide 7, we're excited to share some new product launches that are showing signs of early success.
our air fried chicken lines has been in market for just over a year and is already showing great momentum with very strong repeat purchase rates. we're proud of how our innovation capabilities help us meet consumers' health and wellness needs, and have driven new buyers to the category. approximately 11% of volumes from the air fried lines' initial launch period were generated by new consumers.
jimmy dean, one of our iconic billion-dollar brands recently extended into the breakfast burrito category, a natural progression for an industry-leading product line rooted in convenience and tasty offerings across breakfast occasions. we're seeing strong incremental jimmy dean volumes from this product offering, as well as solid repeat purchase rates.
and just last month, we launched new alternative protein offerings, under the jimmy dean label, including the plant-based patty croissant, which is already exceeding our original demand forecast.
recognized and trusted brands like jimmy dean provide a powerful platform to offer plant-based options, which is an illustration of our one tyson strategy in action. each of these exciting product launches reaffirms tyson's ability to bring innovative and on-trend products to market as part of our overall growth strategy. this innovation engine creates synergies across not only the retail channel, but also food service.
turning to slide 8, we are also making progress on several other key strategic areas that will create long-term shareholder value. first, the core part of tyson's strategy is operational excellence. we strive to produce high-quality products with efficient operations and top-notch customer service. we are working aggressively to realize improvement opportunities, especially in our chicken segment.
later in the call, stuart will share additional detail, on our actions to improve operating results in the chicken segment.
in general, through our ongoing financial fitness, we are pursuing significant cost savings opportunities across our business. next, we are making the organic investments necessary to meet growing global protein demand.
our international platform increasingly provides an opportunity to grow overall sales and margins by leveraging our global production capabilities to reach an international customer base. we're using our one tyson framework to identify synergy opportunities and to maximize the value from farm-to-table at a global level.
because of our existing depth of experience in protein production, brand management and global customer relationships, we believe we have the right recipe for growth and the right to win in these attractive international markets. overall, we estimate that approximately 60% of our capital expenditures are going toward growth objectives.
an area of increased investment is value-added capacity expansion and automation technology, which will support increased sales, high-efficiency processing and better customer service, among others. in addition, we're using technology to improve employee health and safety, animal well-being and environmental management.
lastly, our capital allocation priorities build financial strength, allowing us to continue to invest in our business and return capital to shareholders. we have disciplined processes to ensure that investments we make optimize our returns and drive long-term shareholder value. we're also committed to return capital to shareholders. our business performance has allowed us to increase our dividend per share each year for the last nine years.
i'd like to move now to a review of our first quarter fiscal 2021 performance for the total company, which is captured on slide 9. we delivered sales of $10.5 billion in the quarter, slightly down versus the same period last year. volumes were lower primarily due to reduced foodservice volumes, partially offset by higher retail volumes. note also that the $320 million charge related to our poultry litigation accrual was recorded as a reduction of sales in the quarter.
we delivered operating income of over $1 billion during the quarter up 24% versus the same period a year ago. the company experienced strong operating income performance in beef and prepared foods, while the pork segment softened and the chicken business showed signs of improvement. total company operating income margin was 9.5%.
this strong performance resulted in $1.94 in earnings per share for the quarter, an increase of approximately 28% versus the same period last year. in line with our focus on team member health and safety, we incurred $120 million of direct incremental covid-19 cost during the first quarter. these costs have not been adjusted out of our results and include items such as ppe, testing, medical partnerships, product downgrades, donations as well as enhanced employee pay and benefits.
overall, our business performed well during the quarter, while showing profitability and operational improvements on a year-over-year basis in key areas. our retail business has seen continued strong performance as a result of our depth of brand and product offerings. based on our growing share positions and increasing presence within consumer shopping carts, we believe we're well-positioned for continued strength at retail.
we're also partnering with our foodservice customers to ensure they are prepared to meet increasing channel demand as the covid-19 vaccination rollout continues and consumers gradually become more active away from home.
finally, i'm proud of how our team and business performed, but we certainly still have growth and execution opportunities ahead that we are actively pursuing.
i will now turn the call over to stewart. he will share our detailed financial performance before i return to provide closing remarks.
stewart f. glendinning -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
thanks, dean, and good morning, everyone. starting with prepared foods. sales were $2.1 billion for the quarter, roughly flat versus the same period last year, reflecting higher retail and lower foodservice sales. total volume was down 9%.
segment operating income was $266 million for the quarter, up 48% versus prior year. this substantial improvement in profitability was driven by strong retail performance, lower commercial spending as a result of continued strength in retail demand and lapping of issues experienced as a result of our erp rollout last year.
offsetting these improvements were higher costs related to commodity price increases and other input cost inflation, along with covid-related costs and impacts on our manufacturing efficiency.
as demand gradually normalizes post-covid, we expect higher levels of commercial spending in order to meet our category growth objectives and negative mix impacts from higher foodservice volumes. as this shift occurs, we expect some benefits from improving fixed cost deleverage as volumes increase back to historical levels.
operating margins for the segment were 12.6% for the first quarter, an improvement of more than 400 basis points versus the comparable period. we're also happy to see our business operations stabilizing in key areas, which has allowed us to improve our service levels as well as fill rates with our customers.
moving on to our chicken segment. first quarter results show an improved operating income relative to the same period last year. segment sales were $2.8 billion for the quarter, down 14% versus prior year, in large part because of a $320 million reduction in sales from the poultry litigation accrual. volumes were down 7% relative to the same period last year, primarily due to lost foodservice sales, but were offset by bright spots in our retail value-added categories as well as strong sales to certain national account qsr chains.
sales and volumes continue to be impacted by both channel shifts and intermittent operational issues resulting from the pandemic, including higher absenteeism at our production facilities.
segment operating income was $104 million for the quarter, up 33% versus the same quarter last year. the operating income improvement was driven by price increases on certain products and cost-saving initiatives as we continue working to improve the competitiveness of our chicken operations.
we also saw a positive impact from derivatives of approximately $70 million in the quarter. operating margins for the segment improved 90 basis points to 3.3% for the first quarter.
we are driving actions in three areas within our chicken business in order to restore top tier performance: being the employer of choice, improving operational performance, and our relentless focus on serving our customers' needs.
higher levels of absenteeism and turnover have created inefficiency in our operations as they leave us short of team members to fully stop our plants and also drive higher levels of overtime pay. as a result, we're implementing a range of measures designed to enhance the attractiveness of our production-related roles, including the increased pay and the use of automation and technology to supplement some of the more difficult and high turnover jobs.
next, our process flow in the plant has not been optimal, and we've been working steadily to correct this. clearly, the disruptions caused by covid have not helped, but we're starting to see improvement and expect that to continue during the year. this will be the source of considerable savings over time.
lastly, covid channel shifts and volatile demand have negatively impacted our order fulfillment rates. changes we've made to plant operations in response to covid are yielding improvements, and we expect that further improvements will result as we reduce our staffing gaps and drive operational flow improvements. this is, of course, in addition to the benefits expected, as foodservice begins to recover.
moving to the beef segment. first quarter results show an improvement relative to the same period last year. segment sales were approximately $4 billion for the quarter, up 4% versus the same period last year. key sales drivers include strong domestic and export demand for beef products with volumes up 5.6%, for the quarter. segment operating income was $528 million for the quarter, up 45% versus prior year.
operating income improvement was driven by higher volumes as we lapped the prior year impacts of our finney county plant fire. we also realized a $55 million gain related to recoveries from the cattle supplier fraud, offset by higher covid-related operating costs. these higher costs were mostly driven by bonuses paid to our frontline team members. note also, that the comparable period last year was revised down by $68 million associated with the cattle supplier fraud, affecting the year-over-year comparison. operating margins for the segment improved 370 basis points to 13.2% for the first quarter.
now, let's move on to the pork segment on slide 14. first quarter results show a softening relative to the same period last year. segment sales were $1.4 billion for the quarter, up about 4% versus the comparable period last year. these sales drivers for the segment included lower volumes as a result of temporary idling of one of production facilities offset by strong demand. volumes were down 3% for the quarter relative to the same period last year.
segment operating income was $116 million for the quarter, down 40% versus the comparable period. operating income degradation was driven by production inefficiencies, the temporary idling of the previously mentioned production facility and covid-related operating costs.
we also experienced higher live animal costs, which was not fully offset by price. operating margins for the segment declined by 590 basis points to 8.1% for the first quarter.
moving to slide 15. i'll share the quarterly results impact on certain cash flow and balance sheet metrics. operating cash flow totaled $1.4 billion, up nearly $500 million versus the prior year. liquidity strengthened to $4.2 billion as of january 2, 2021.
gross debt-to-adjusted-ebitda of 2.6 times was down slightly compared to prior year-end. and on a net debt basis, we were at 2 times aided by the strong cash flows in this quarter. net interest expense totaled $108 million. our adjusted effective tax rate was 23.5%. capital expenditures came in at $289 million. we paid $159 million of dividends during the quarter and purchased $17 million of shares related to our employee stock plans.
turning now to a discussion on our financial outlook. clearly, an important headline this quarter is the sharp rise in grain costs. grain futures for 2021 have continued to strengthen due to diminished stocks to use expectations for corn and soybeans and strong export demand, particularly from china.
we expect hedging and pricing actions will allow our team to mitigate some grain cost impacts moving ahead. but at this time, it is difficult to estimate just how much can be mitigated through those actions.
as a reminder, $0.10 per bushel move in corn price or a $10 per ton move in soybean meal translates into an approximate change of $25 million in cost of goods sold.
we've also seen some recent inflationary pressure in our freight costs, largely due to a shortage of drivers. in our international and export businesses, these freight dynamics are manifesting themselves through increased container costs. our team's efforts to mitigate future freight and transportation risks will continue to ensure our products are shipped efficiently and effectively to meet customer needs.
lastly, looking at our assumptions related to the adequacy of live animal inventory, live cattle inventories remain ample to support our beef business, and we believe hog inventories will remain adequate despite a small decrease in supply.
having said that, both cattle and hog futures have moved higher since october, and we're working to minimize the impact to our business, particularly in the prepared foods segment, where retail prices do not move as dynamically.
slide 17 captures our financial outlook for fiscal 2021. we expect to deliver annual revenues at the top end of our previous range of $42 billion to $44 billion, supported by our strong first quarter performance. we also expect our directional annual guidance versus last year of improved operating margins in prepared foods and lower operating margins in pork to hold.
at current grain prices, operating margins in chicken will likely be lower than prior year. because of stronger-than-expected performance in beef and current market conditions, we expect beef to deliver an operating margin similar to last year's 10.1% or marginally lower. key risks of this guidance include freight rates as well as labor availability and costs across all segments, grain costs in the chicken segment, raw material costs for our prepared foods business and continued export market strength.
we are revising our capital expenditures outlook to $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion as we continue to build capacity across our network. as we noted last quarter, the majority of the spend will be toward capacity expansions in chicken, case-ready beef and pork, prepared foods and international.
net interest expense is expected to be lower than our previous outlook at approximately $430 million, which reflects a recent term loan repayment of $750 million that occurred during our second quarter. our outlook on effective tax rate is unchanged, but we will continue to monitor the potential implications of legislation from the new administration. our expectations related to liquidity are unchanged, although we expect our liquidity to decrease from $4.2 billion at the end of the first quarter based on the term loan repayment as well as our seasonally higher cash usage during our second quarter.
finally, we have continued to invest in health and safety and well-being of our team members. and our covid-related costs, which totaled $120 million in the quarter are now expected to be approximately $440 million for the year. it remains to be seen what portion of these costs will be permanent.
now, i'd like to turn the call back to dean.
dean banks -- president & chief executive officer
thanks, stewart. in summary, our multi protein portfolio delivered strong first quarter results that will create the fuel for disciplined investments and higher margin, higher growth opportunities ahead, and we will seek opportunities to remove unnecessary costs and invest in the right areas.
our retail performance is showing tremendous strength, and our operational flexibility positions us well for a gradual recovery in foodservice volumes. we remain focused on fostering a culture of health, safety and wellness, and protecting our team members through workplace protections and a leading covid-19 monitoring program as well as our vaccine preparations.
i'm energized by our team's commitment to delivering healthy, safe and accessible protein to global consumers, their ability to continuously innovate and their ongoing emphasis on operational execution.
we're optimistic about the continued success of tyson foods, as our diverse portfolio has us well positioned for long-term sustainable growth.
and with that, i'll now turn the call back to megan.
megan britt -- vice president of investor relations

[operator instructions] and our first question will come from ben theurer of barclays. please go ahead.
benjamin theurer -- barclays -- analyst
hey, good morning, and thank you very much for taking my question. so maybe donnie, that's one for you. just wanted to follow-up on the initiatives within chicken. and i mean, clearly, you've laid out very much detailed -- the plan on how to work on improving and get back to that mid to -- mid-single-digit, high-single-digit operating income margin. now more short-term, if we take a look at the cost headwinds; corn, soy, i mean, obviously, that's significantly impacting, how do you feel about your ability to negotiate on pricing with what you usually have on your negotiated and contract pricing with customers? just considering that the overall environment seems to be very inflationary, so do you have -- do you see any flexibility around the pricing mechanisms in the short-term? thank you.
donnie king -- group president poultry & chief operating officer
thanks for the question. short answer is, yes. we have obviously locked in some pricing early before we saw the run-up in grain that we've been having non-stop conversations with all of our customers around the installation need for pricing, and they have been very responsive. we've had a lot of really good results in, let's call it, mid-contract and having conversations with those customers. remember, our relationships with our customers; it is a relationship, it is not a transactional event for us, and we've vested as they have through the years. and so they've been very supportive. they certainly understand the inflationary need. and i think we will be quite successful in this endeavor.
benjamin theurer -- barclays -- analyst
okay, perfect. and just to kind of look ahead, i mean, where do you think are low-hanging fruits in terms of operating efficiencies to bring margins back up from the headwinds? like really what's in your hand? what have you identified since you took over a more serious review of the business a couple of months ago? and where do you think of low-hanging fruits and the bigger challenges to bring that back to that 5% to 7% margin range you've talked about?
donnie king -- group president poultry & chief operating officer
sure. well, let me start with this. we started the fiscal year. we had one objective and that was to simply be the best chicken company as we move forward. and we obviously recognized that's not where we were and -- or where we are. and so we began to work on that. and as we get into -- as we got into this, we started seeing good results, particularly in q1. however, in january, we still -- the recovery slowed down driven by volume constraints due primarily to chicken availability from an unexpected decline in hedge.
the winter storm uri affected our operations broadly, a significant event. we essentially lost a week across our entire poultry enterprise and more broadly across the rest of the businesses as well. as a result of these supply shortages, we compensated with outside meat purchases, which has driven our cost up as market price rallied sharply, particularly after the first quarter. at the same time, cost inflation accelerated with the grain and the highest in the last six years. wage increases and freight cost also impacted us. and as i mentioned earlier, we contracted a large share of our portfolio in the fall and early winter before the prices began to increase materially.
we're continuing to deal with turnover and absenteeism, and -- but what i would tell you, despite these headwinds, the fundamentals of our business looking forward are actually quite good. customer and consumer demand is strong. sustained demand in retail and foodservice recovery with ongoing chicken sandwich promotions. so the outlook alongside the operational improvements that we're making and the pricing opportunities that we have are quite good.
so -- but very specifically, i think about this business and the seven levers of this business or this business model, and the levers are price. we simply need to be -- to get paid fair market value. we certainly can't eat all the inflation that we're experiencing now. we've got to get volume back under us. our business is growing and we got to get the harvest numbers back up for our business, and we have to continue to get more fp capacity online. we've had a great improvement in mix. we're still struggling with absenteeism. and then we need to make sure our spend is in balance with the volume at which we are processing.
and finally, we need to return our live production spreads -- our historical spread to the industry. we need to regain those spreads. so what i can tell you is we know where we are really and we're not happy with where we are, and we fully understand that we can't talk our way through our poor performance. we do have a great plan in place to be the best chicken company, and we've made great progress and we'll accelerate that in the back half of the year. i'll tell you we have a great team in place. everybody knows what they're doing. and we're not afraid. we're not discouraged. we're a little bit delayed from the some of the winter and some of the activities inflation in q2, but we're very optimistic about this business as we move forward.
dean banks -- president & chief executive officer
and i just want to add, just a compliment to donnie and the team. we had committed in previous calls to have visible operating metric improvement at the end of the second quarter. and everything we've seen early in the quarter and coming out of the previous year, we have seen those operating improvements materializing. it's unfortunate that we're experiencing all the headwinds, but i'm proud with how donnie and the team in managing those headwinds and the operating improvements they made, which will become visible as we navigate the headwinds coming.
benjamin theurer -- barclays -- analyst
okay, perfect. thank you very much, donnie, dean, for the comments. congrats.
donnie king -- group president poultry & chief operating officer
thank you.

the next question comes from ken goldman of j.p. morgan. please go ahead.
ken goldman -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
hi. thank you. good morning.
dean banks -- president & chief executive officer
good morning.
ken goldman -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
i wanted to make sure i understood guidance. when you say that the results in a particular segment are likely to be higher or lower than the prior year, i think you're talking about operating margin because that's what it says in the slide, and that's what you've historically done. but in your prepared remarks, i thought you said profit or earnings. i just wanted to clarify whether it's margin or earnings or both when you're talking about those terms?
stewart f. glendinning -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
yes. ken, stewart here. absolutely it's percentage from a rate -- return on sales. and as you've pointed out, that's what you see in the slide.
ken goldman -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
great. thank you for that. and then as a quick follow-up, can you talk a little bit about some of those hatch issues that you mentioned? how structural are those? how much of those related -- are related to some of the weather that we saw? i'm just trying to get a sense of your outlook for those.
donnie king -- group president poultry & chief operating officer
sure. great question. we think some of them are structural. in our program, we changed one of the males that we were using in our business and great broiler performance, but we're not seeing those maternal characteristics such as egg production and hatch, namely hatch. and so we've got some of those issues going on. but in terms of the weather, it's a little hard in february with the uri, with the impact of that, with all the power outages and so forth. we had egg sitting on a farm without power. so we saw a loss of embryos as a result of that. so from february into march, think about this, those animals that were -- those chicks that were impacted also went through the grow-out cycle and they had issues as they went through there.
so the initial impact was very expensive, but you think about the knock-on effects of that. it's -- those persisted all the way through april, and we're just now clearing ourselves of that. but the other side of this or the view of this is they are -- in terms of hatch, it is improving. it will improve marginally as we move over. as we elevate -- if you think about our business and our breeder performance, we have a spread from the best to the worse. so just elevating and tightening that spread will give us improvement.
seasonally, we will get a little bit of improvement, and the knock-on effects from the winter storm will give us a little improvement. so we're not going to be all the way bright. it will take us time to work, the males that we're changing out. we'll have a new male in place every day or let's call it fall, but it will take a full year to see this come back to bright. but we're confident in that. and so that's where we are.
ken goldman -- j.p. morgan -- analyst

the next question comes from alexia howard of bernstein. please go ahead.
alexia howard -- bernstein -- analyst
good morning, everyone.
dean banks -- president & chief executive officer
good morning.
donnie king -- group president poultry & chief operating officer
good morning.
alexia howard -- bernstein -- analyst
okay. so two questions from me. the first one. you talked about pork operational inefficiencies, i was just wondering if you could clarify what those problems were and how quickly you expect them to be resolved? and then i have a follow-up.
donnie king -- group president poultry & chief operating officer
thanks. great question. in terms of the issue, it's -- think of it in terms of a staffing issue impacting capacity. if i think about our pork business, it's been taking us about six days to do five days worth of work because turnover absenteeism. the other part of that is, in terms of the performance, is related to not having skilled people in place. and so we've not been able to give mix optimization in terms of maximizing the cut-out. all those variety meats, all those components that are highly attractive from a margin perspective. we are short staffed right now in our pork plant. we are working on things that you might would expect in terms of work schedules. we're looking at wages in all of those cases. and we are also investing in terms of automation and technology to try to alleviate these more difficult and higher turnover jobs.
alexia howard -- bernstein -- analyst
great. and then as a follow-up, could you give us a quick sort of update on the current status of the african swine fever situation in china? is that -- we didn't hear anything about that this time around. i know that you think that it's probably going to continue to have an impact on the global meat supply and demand balance for some time. but are we getting through to the other side of that or it is having less of an impact on your export business for example?
dean banks -- president & chief executive officer
yeah. so first off, the case is not just in china, but what we've seen in germany has really disrupted global protein flows, similar protein with [indecipherable] for asia. china -- early reports where they were having some success of repopulating, but our latest research shows that that's really not happening anywhere near the pace that they hold. so we still see really strong exports going into china to cover that gap.
alexia howard -- bernstein -- analyst
great. thank you. best of luck.
donnie king -- group president poultry & chief operating officer
okay. i would add to that just that china is still at the pork deficit. there are new herd losses from asf, which is slowing their recovery. so based on the numbers i saw quoted from rabobank recently, they will be flat to about 2020.
alexia howard -- bernstein -- analyst
great. thank you very much. i'll pass it on.

our next question comes from adam samuelson of goldman sachs. please go ahead.
adam samuelson -- goldman sachs -- analyst
hi, thanks. good morning, everyone.
dean banks -- president & chief executive officer
good morning, adam.
donnie king -- group president poultry & chief operating officer
good morning.
adam samuelson -- goldman sachs -- analyst
good morning. i wanted to maybe tie together some of the comments that you've given on the chicken business through the call already. as we think about the balance of this fiscal year and the kind of pathway to that -- to 5% to 7% margins, maybe can you help us think about where we would be kind of at the end of september at the end of fiscal '21 in terms of some of the live productivity issues? where you'd hope to be from a labor and attrition perspective? kind of where you think you will be on kind of price versus feed kind of balance by the end of the fiscal year? and the 5% to 7%, just help us think about -- you talked about as the medium term target, what do you think the timeline realistically is to get back there?
donnie king -- group president poultry & chief operating officer
sure. so as i think about the -- and let's start with the hatch issue. i covered off a number of those things in terms of -- it will be improving sequentially. but we're changing out the male that quite frankly we made a bad decision on. and we will not be all the way bright till, let's call it, mid-year of '22, but we will sequentially get better between now and then in hatch.
so it will help us in supply and supply that we quite frankly need today. we are too dependent on the outside purchase of meat right now. and we've -- the market has run up there. so it's -- the ability to pass on that cost in the marketplace is next to impossible. and so we need to get our own animals in place. and by the way, that outside purchase is predominantly breast meat, but we have good sales for the back half of the chicken. all the rendered products that came with that, of course, you see the wing markets that are well over -- that are over $3 right now. but in terms of getting to the 5% to 7% -- and when i say 5% to 7%, i'm talking about 5% to 7% in a business that's growing, growing top-line, growing bottom line.
and so we got to staff the plants. i mean, that's an imperative here. and we have to compete with the very best. and competing in this example is we need to have a cost structure that is best in class, and quite frankly, we haven't had that. but we're well on the road. we have -- much like we did in 2008, we have a path forward. we're looking at those big rocks. most of them would be in the labor yield spend. volume is certainly a big component of that as well. and we've got to service customers better.
quite honestly, we have not serviced our customers well in almost two and a half years. i talked about the sap cut over and then covid of last year. and so we got to do that better for our customers, and that certainly helps us. and then that puts us in a position to continue to grow our business. we've been very successful right now with the growth in the business. and when we service the customer in full all the time across all channels then we get the opportunity to grow our business at even a higher rate.
so all those things are -- all those things that would get you to the 5% to 7% and growing, but it's the fundamental. it's the fundamentals of the business that we have to get in order. and we're very much aware of those. we're very much aware of where our gaps are to each one of those cost components. and so -- and we've got a good team working on. so more to come.
dean banks -- president & chief executive officer
one other point i wanted to make related to the hatch issue is that it's a bit of a double-edged sword. and that not only we're buying protein in the market to service or further process customers, but in the primary processing, our plant is not running full, has some deleveraging. and so will you'll see us in the coming quarters as we get hatch fixed, we increase capacity in our facilities, we'll absorb some of that deleveraging and get back to operating metrics and operating performance that come along starting that.
adam samuelson -- goldman sachs -- analyst
that color is really helpful. and then maybe a follow-up question i think for stewart just thinking on the capital allocation front. you're at your kind of long-term kind of leverage target of two times at the end of the second quarter, maybe just help us think about kind of deploying incremental cash flow from here? and i think in your prepared remarks, i think any reference to m&a i was interested kind of is talk about optimize the portfolio didn't seem kind of -- to have aspirations for a lot of offensive of m&a, but maybe just help us think about cash deployment from here?
stewart f. glendinning -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
yeah, sure. well, look, i mean i'll tell you, we feel really good about our options here. if you think about our capital allocation in three big plants; first, we've been focused on building financial strength, and that's certainly true as you pointed out. our debt-to-ebitda ratio is looking good. we do have more debt coming due later this year. and of course, we have a term loan that's outstanding. so it's about $1 billion between those two.
then think about investing in the business. m&a is opportunistic, but of course, we have and we'll continue to be pretty disciplined there from a return standpoint. where you have seen increased capital deployment has been around capex. we did earlier this year guide that we would be as high as $1.5 billion. we haven't been able to get some of the projects away as quickly as we have wanted, but you might take away from that early guidance that we have an appetite to invest behind our company in organic kinds of investments. and we have a lots of strong opportunities in automation and then other profit improvement areas in our business. and notably, lots of opportunity for us to invest in new capacity in our business.
we've got a number of new plants coming online. in the prepared remarks, we talked about six different sites in our international business where we're investing in new capacity. donnie spoke about a couple of new plants coming online in the u.s., humboldt has come online. so more capital is going against capacity and that is needed for a growing business. and then lastly, of course, 10 years of dividend growth, we have not been shy to share that cash with shareholders, and we expect to continue to do that in the future. so i think step back, we've got a well thought out and well balanced approach to capital allocation.
adam samuelson -- goldman sachs -- analyst

the next question comes from ben bienvenu of stephens. please go ahead.
ben bienvenu -- stephens -- analyst
hey, good morning, everybody.
dean banks -- president & chief executive officer
good morning, ben.
ben bienvenu -- stephens -- analyst
i want to ask about the prepared foods segment. your commentary makes perfect sense just given the raw material cost inflation that we've seen. i'd love to hear some commentary on the cadence of pricing that you expect to realize. what you're looking at from a competitive standpoint and demand elasticity standpoint in that business? and how we should be thinking about kind of the realization of margin recovery in that business relative to raw material cost and pricing increases?
dean banks -- president & chief executive officer
sure. i'll take first shot at this and then past it over. we still see tremendous continued retail strength in prepared foods. and with 11 straight quarters of growth in our core business lines, we're able to commend a strong presence there. and as it relates to pricing, we are obviously experiencing high input costs from the core business and that will ultimately get passed on. most of our pricing in retail specifically, we're in position where we interact with our partner customers quite frequently and they see what we're experiencing there and we're able to pass some of that on. we are -- we do expect in the next half to be increasing that spend. it's going to be a requirement obviously to remain competitive in the marketplace. those investments have paid off in the past. taking you to -- as you read and heard, 81% household penetration, that's something where we can leverage long-term.
in prepared foods -- the other thing to really keep in mind is that foodservice is coming back. so we've mentioned that 75% of the areas which recover are recovered at about 75%. while we've seen about a 10% drop out in restaurants, those are getting backfilled with those kitchens and variety of other creative models and ultimately addition to restaurants to fill that void. we think that business is going to recover strong. it's a lower margin business. so we'll see that balancing out not only due to throughput in the restaurants, but also channel filling as we get prepared for the full recovery.
and i think i mentioned about foodservice is that, please keep in mind, it's obviously regional and it's very different across channels. so clearly we've not seen a recovery in k-12 that we'd expected. and some areas of the world that impact our business, specifically in europe, they're still buckling under the pressures of covid. so foodservice hasn't recovered quite as much as we'd want.
so with that, i'll hand it over to stewart to talk about margin outlook.
stewart f. glendinning -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
yeah. look, the only thing i would add to what dean has said is that our expectations for price recovery in the second half are already included in the guidance. of course, philosophically, we believe as a company that raw material costs ultimately will be passed along. and therefore, you should think about seeing more to come next year. but the current expectations around pricing are built in our guidance.
ben bienvenu -- stephens -- analyst
understood. okay, great. my second question is just around the buy versus grow strategy in chicken. and in particular, you talked about the hatchability issues and that how that should resolve some of your issues over time related to the need to buy breast meat on the outside market. what role does humboldt play, if any, in that equation? and as it relates to humboldt, is that on time, on budget? what are the latest qualitative or quantitative commentary points that you could offer us?
donnie king -- group president poultry & chief operating officer
sure. great question. humboldt -- let me start with it. humboldt is a fresh chicken plant. as we look at that business, it's a growing category for -- predominantly, for our retail customers. so we started in the late april with fp-type products flowing through humboldt. it will be july, late july before we actually are harvesting in the animals in the humboldt. it will be incremental. it will help us from a flexibility of our footprint. there is humboldt -- or actually across our fresh portfolio help us de-clog and streamline some of our operations.
now the question around buy versus grow, we still support buy versus grow. we'd still get program and we will continue to use that. what i've tried to portray is that we move two quarter on the buy instead of growing our own. and we were late, quite honestly, to be able to get the animals down and growth, but we started this year. if you look at the q1 numbers, we were seeing pretty nice performance in q1 and then we get into january and hatch really hit us and then the storm in february. and so we're still processing all of that to understand what it means. but long-term, we will be fine. but buy versus grow is still a good strategy. we're just over dependent upon it right now.
if you think about the marketplace, historically, the market would be around $1.10, $1.20 maybe even inching up from there. for jumbo boneless skinless breast meat, as of friday, it was $2.11. so pretty significant increase in the market. and so trying to get pricing around that going to be -- that's a little tricky, but certainly all our models would indicate that growing. it would be the right course in this market environment.
dean banks -- president & chief executive officer
one other thing just to add to donnie's answer. just thinking about humboldt specifically, as a reminder, there is a start-up cost for humboldt, which is about $60 million in the year with most of that in the second half. so just keep that in mind for your models.
ben bienvenu -- stephens -- analyst
okay. thanks very much.

the next question comes from ken zaslow of bank of montreal. please go ahead.
kenneth b. zaslow -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
hey, good morning, guys.
dean banks -- president & chief executive officer
good morning.
donnie king -- group president poultry & chief operating officer
good morning.
kenneth b. zaslow -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
just two questions. one is on the beef side, how long do you think that the cattle supply relative to the packing will be in this situation, because i understand that there has been -- the cattle from last year hasn't been fully killed? so this positive environment, how long does it last? and then obviously into 2022, you're still in a good environment. just want a comment on that and then i have a follow-up.
dean banks -- president & chief executive officer
sure. we're projecting and observing ample cattle supply through the end of the year. and as we're continuing to setup our plants and increase production, we're going to continue to work through that. but everything looks strong through the end of the year and into '22. donnie, do you want to add any color?
donnie king -- group president poultry & chief operating officer
sure. i will add a little bit too. there is obviously a higher grain costs on the beef side and then of course the drought conversations which could impact [indecipherable] retention which could portend some longer term negative implications. but based on everything we see, throughout '20 into '22, at least halfway of what we can say today, there will be ample cattle supply.
kenneth b. zaslow -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
great. and my second question. donnie, if i look back in 2008, how do you compare and contrast this six on the chicken operation versus then? and again, if you kind of do that compare and contrast, it seems like there is a real linear path to those type of margins that you once got back in the 2009 '10 period? and i'll leave it there, and i appreciate it.
donnie king -- group president poultry & chief operating officer
thanks. well, there are lot of similarities. the good news bad news is that we've been down this road before. if i look at some of the differences -- if i go back to 2015, for example, our volume -- our harvest volume in pounds sold is flat to 2015. so that's problem one. if you think about in this timeframe, we purchase keystone, which i think it was like 4.5 million chickens a week from that. so we've essentially rationalized that volume through all of our locations.
our capacity utilization is in the low-80s from harvest perspective. so if you -- i mean, if you look at the numbers today, if you look at a 20% opportunity on top of that with all the latent capacity, there is a lot of upside from a cost perspective as you look at them. at the same time, our volumes remained flat and our operational costs have risen, let's call it, a 5% cagr. we are on flat volume, and quite honestly, our customers aren't willing to pay for our inefficiencies and we don't expect them to.
we've seen pretty significant price increase if you think from 2015 to 2021. it looks like probably half of -- $500 million worth of price decreases because of the market dynamics. and we've had a couple of special event. the sap cut over in 2019 and then covid-19 in 2020. so a long story short there is. we got a higher cost and we get lower volume. and you can put together very simplistically what we have to do to get this business right, to get it to 5% to 7%. and then -- and i say 5% to 7%, that's where we're going. but i want to point out that it's 5% to 7% and growing our business, meaning fp business. it could be meat, it would mean harvesting animals to support that business. and so we think we've got a lot of upside, and the future looks a lot brighter than it does today.
kenneth b. zaslow -- bmo capital markets -- analyst

the next question comes from peter galbo of bank of america. please go ahead.
peter galbo -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
hey guys, good morning. thank you for taking the question.
dean banks -- president & chief executive officer
good morning, peter.
peter galbo -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
good morning. stewart, the operating income range -- first of all, very helpful. thank you for including that. just a question there. it looks like kind of in the front half of the year your sales price mix was more than double the cogs inflation, and obviously, you're expecting that to reverse pretty materially in the second half of the year. just is there any view to help us understand the magnitude of how much price will recover on the cogs side in the back half as you think about it on an enterprisewide level?
stewart f. glendinning -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
maybe just a couple of things to point out. first of all, you really point out that the mix of the big impact, nice to go, perhaps a little bit more detail is an acute in the segment detail in note 14, because you're going to be able to take away from that chart that a heavy influence on this number is beef. and that is why you're going to see the movement looking like you're getting a coverage, which you are in total. but when you break it down at the business level, you're going to see a very different dynamic obviously in prepared foods, dean covered that for the back half of the year.
only other thing i'd point out just as a modeling tip is the cost of grains has gone up substantially. and even since the beginning of this quarter, you will see the grain has shot up. think back to the data that we gave you during the prepared remarks for grain costs in the first quarter were sort of $10 million or so higher than last year. in the second quarter, we were $135 million higher than the same quarter last year. that's reflecting that higher cost of grain coming through. yes, we're hedging, but you need -- those hedges sort of roll. so the further you get out, at some point you start actually taking that higher cost of grain, and that's what you're seeing as you look through those numbers.
so the second half of the year is going to be bearing grain costs that are a lot higher and our ability to offset that will be dependent on donnie's set price recovery. but we've given you our best estimates in the guidance that we've laid out. there are some areas of fairly significant inflation in the back half.
peter galbo -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
got it. no, that's helpful. and donnie, maybe just to kind of dot the eye on chicken, i just wanted to understand if the labor problems that we're now reading about pretty consistently across all industries are really incremental to what you had been experiencing over the past six months to a year and how you kind of see that labor picture, particularly in chicken, and how you see that labor picture, i guess, shaping up? when we would expect it to maybe start to alleviate a little bit, at least from your perspective?
donnie king -- group president poultry & chief operating officer
well, if i look at the time horizon over the last year, it's -- i wouldn't -- i would say it would be improved somewhat to, let's call it, the height of covid. we are able to staff plant. we are pretty close to staffing. this absenteeism that we are seeing is really unusual for us. and -- but if i look at prior to covid, we're probably something in order of five, let's call it, maybe 50% more absenteeism what we experienced prior to that.
and so there is not a magic bullet here. we're looking at all kinds of things, trying to generate worker-driven solutions. we talked about wage and we quoted our wage rates that we have today. and -- but we're also looking at different shift model so that our workforce, they wants us to be able to tell them exactly when they start to work and exactly when they get off, and very few are interested in a six day week or a surprised based on customer consumer demand. of course we're investing heavily in terms of automation and technology to try to eliminate the more difficult higher turnover jobs. but i would say across chicken, beef, pork, prepared, in terms of -- it takes about six days right now to get five days worth of work done. and so it's impacting capacity and costs.
dean banks -- president & chief executive officer
peter, one other thing i'd mention is, it's just not -- we wouldn't want to avoid mentioning the impact of stimulus. and that's ultimately going to wind down and should have a positive impact on our ability to recruit. and also further something donnie said, we have invested heavily into automation. and some of the tougher to staff is portions of the facilities, we can take that talent and redeploy to other parts of the facilities. you'll see that coming in the second half of the year.
peter galbo -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst

good morning, and welcome to the tyson foods second quarter 2021 earnings conference call. [operator instructions]
i would now like to turn the conference over to megan britt of investor relation. please go ahead.
megan britt -- vice president of investor relations
hello and welcome to the second quarter fiscal 2021 earnings conference call for tyson foods. on the call today are dean banks, president and chief executive officer; donnie king, group president poultry and chief operating officer; and stewart glendinning, evp and chief financial officer. we have prepared presentation slides to supplement our comments, which are available on the investor relations section of the tyson website and through the link to our webcast.
during this call we will make forward-looking statements regarding our expectations for the future. these statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions, which may cause actual results to differ materially from our current projection. please refer to our forward-looking statement disclaimers on slide 2 as well as our sec filings for additional information concerning risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our projection. please note that references on earnings per share, operating income and operating margin in our remarks are on an adjusted basis unless otherwise noted. for reconciliations of these non-gaap measures to their corresponding gaap measures, please refer to our earnings press release.
i'll now turn the call over to dean.
dean banks -- president & chief executive officer
thank you, megan. before we get started, i'd like to welcome donnie king to the earnings call and congratulate him on his recent promotion to chief operating officer. i would also like to thank our 140,000 team members for their continued efforts and resilience. they are what makes this company an incredible place to work, and i'm proud of their focus on raising the world's expectations for how much good food can do.
earlier today, we released our second quarter results for fiscal 2021. we delivered a solid operating earnings performance, recording $739 million in adjusted operating income for the quarter, which represents a 43% increase relative to the same period last year. we delivered $1.34 in adjusted earnings per share with 68% increase from the same period last year. these results were reinforced by our solid performance in retail, our continuing efforts to ensure the safety of our team members, our partnership with customers to enable recovery and our focused execution to overcome inflationary headwinds. our results in the quarter reflect our continued focus on team member health and safety. this is our top priority, and i'm proud of the progress that we have made on our comprehensive safety, health and wellness agenda along with our recent vaccine deployment efforts.
we also saw improvement in the foodservice channel during the quarter. we've been working closely with our customers to support foodservice recovery. as consumer demand patterns continue to create operational complexities, we've taken action to make our organization more responsive to demand signals and customer needs to accelerate our speed to market. agility is increasingly important as we look to extend the gains that we have achieved in the retail channel. we continue to drive retail volume growth across our core business lines, delivering growth, and the recent quarter is particularly notable as we are now comparing to a prior quarter that included some benefit from initial covid-19 pantry loading.
as we navigate market volatility and rising inflationary pressures, we're focused on operational excellence and disciplined cost management. our balance sheet is strong and we continue to invest in our business. we have prioritized capacity expansion and automation technology investments and have significantly increased our capital allocated to both of these areas. as an example, our humboldt production facility in tennessee has recently commenced operations, and our team shipped the first salable product in late april.
to support growth in case-ready beef and pork, we are also excited for the reopening of our columbia, south carolina plant as well as the grand opening of our eagle mountain utah plant, both occurring later this year. we are expanding capacity in our international operations and have six sites where new capacity is currently under construction, positioning our international business for continued growth and profitability in the future.
as we look at the balance of the year, we realized that we have a challenging second half ahead as inflationary pressure has continued to build. we also have several bright spots, notably, our performance in the retail channel and the continued strength in our beef segment. looking past the inflationary headwinds that are impacting our input costs, i'm confident that our team is executing on the right priorities to meet our commitments and drive shareholder value creation.
turning to slide 4. team member health and safety is and will continue to be our top priority. through our partnership with matrix medical and our local communities, over 42,000 of our team members have been vaccinated since february. as of today, we've offered on-site vaccination clinics at over 100 locations in more than 30 states. we've also launched a pilot project to enhance health and wellness of our team members. this involves the opening of seven clinics that will enable team members and their families to receive easier access to high quality healthcare services. our first facility opened recently in newbern, tennessee.
turning now to slide 5. our total tyson and core business lines have posted 11 consecutive quarters of volume and share growth. notably, our team delivered volume growth in q2 despite the unusually strong demand associated with pantry loading that occurred during the comparable quarter last year. sales volume for tyson core business lines are up 12.7% and total tyson is up 8.5% in the latest 52 weeks. our share growth has been the strongest in breakfast sausage, hot dogs, frozen value-added poultry and frozen protein breakfast.
our growth during these periods was driven in large part by our ability to bring incremental households into our branded product lines. total tyson household penetration reached 81% for the latest 52 weeks. also, consumers continue to rely on low to no contact buying methods. as a result, we experienced e-commerce sales growth of 105% in the latest 13 weeks compared with last year. this equated to approximately $425 million of sales through our e-commerce channel partners.
turning to slide 6. innovation is important to our success in both retail and foodservice channels, and we've continued to invest in the launch and scaling of new product innovations. on this slide, we have three examples of how our product innovation is tied to meaningful consumer insights. in a recent survey, nearly half of americans expressed dissatisfaction with available plant-based options for the grill. this insight spurred our recent nationwide raised & rooted launch, which includes three new products to meet increasing demand for plant-based protein options.
we're also excited for our recent launch of alternative protein offerings in the europe and asia pacific markets, which will support growing global demand for protein. for jimmy dean breakfast nuggets, our another example of our ability to pair brand and category leadership in frozen breakfast with our unique production capabilities to deliver protein-dense offerings that complement tyson's current product portfolio. finally, annual servings per capita for breaded chicken sandwiches at restaurants are up 14%, and our products in this space have enabled us to capitalize on the growing popularity.
moving to slide 7. as we continue to navigate complex consumer dynamics overall, we're closely monitoring several factors to effectively engage with our customers and consumers in support of the overall recovery. protein has remained relevant throughout the pandemic with 54% of consumers indicating a deliberate intend to increase protein intake within their daily diet and 20% indicating that they are consuming animal protein more often than they were a year ago. in addition to overall protein consumption, we are closely monitoring reopening and recovery patterns. approximately 76% of the u.s. states are now at 70% or more capacity for in-restaurant dining.
with vaccine rollouts and consumer mobility improving, away from home traffic is gradually increasing on a sequential basis. currently, qsr and c stores are leading the recovery as consumers are very comfortable with ordering takeout. while we are seeing some challenges in our international markets, progress against covid domestically should continue to improve consumer confidence and mobility in the second half.
the u.s. economy is improving rapidly in part due to government stimulus. while we expect some degree of elevated retail consumption to remain post-covid, our success in growing retail share and driving relevant innovation will allow us to meet the strong demand for protein and serve our customers across all channels.
i'll now turn the call over to donnie to walk us through the segment operating results in detail.
donnie king -- group president poultry & chief operating officer
thanks, dean. i will start with the chicken segment performance captured on slide 8. sales were $3.6 billion for the second quarter, up 5%. overall volumes were down in the quarter, primarily due to covid-related production inefficiencies. severe winter weather also impacted volumes, operating costs and production efficiencies in the quarter. average sales price was up substantially during the period due to the favorable mix and the benefit of higher retail volume. our reported price improvement also reflects actions that we've taken to cover the inflationary pressure we have experienced from higher grain, labor and freight costs. despite our efforts in the quarter, we did not fully offset the inflationary impacts as a substantial portion of our business is contracted on a fixed annual price basis with terms negotiated and locked ahead of the recent surge in grain costs.
adjusted operating income was $6 million during the second quarter and $110 million for the fiscal year-to-date. then versus both comparable periods, fiscal year-to-date operating income was negatively impacted by $145 million of higher feed ingredient cost as well as $95 million of increased grow-out expenses and outside meat purchases.
for the second quarter, feed ingredients were $130,000 million higher, while grow-out expenses and outside meat purchases were $60 million higher. segment performance also reflects net derivative gains during the second quarter of $40 million and $110 million for the fiscal year-to-date, both versus the respective comparable periods. these gains are associated with realized gains as well as open positions.
last quarter we shared our imperatives for improving chicken operating results, which are captured on slide 9. our goal has not changed. we remain committed to restoring top-tier performance. the first imperative is related to being the employer of choice. despite implementing pay rate increases, we continue to deal with elevated absenteeism and turnover. we are implementing a range of initiatives to improve the team member experience and achieve the status of the employer of choice, including flexible work schedules and a competitive wage rate. at this time, we estimate our average base pay plus benefits for domestic production workers is valued at over $22 per hour.
the second imperative relates to our strategy to improve overall operational performance. although we have made some progress improving our plant performance, we're not where we planned to be at this stage. our strategy to improve our operational performance includes restoring our production volume to full capacity. however, we've struggled to raise the harvest to full capacity due to upstream supply issues, including issues caused by lower hatchability rates. consequently, we have offset raw material shortages with outside meat purchases at a higher level than we had historically.
with the recent move in market prices, our cost disadvantage from outside purchases has widen. to compensate for cost headwind, we are working to recover our historical vantage on live costs, reduce the number of hams we are sourcing in the open market and to increase our plant efficiency as we gradually store volume over the balance of the year. the final imperative relates to serving our customers. our focus is to deliver the highest levels of service to our customers, especially with respect to order fill rates.
when our customers are successful, we are successful. we are sustaining share gains in retail value-added as we start to lap the covid-19 surge and are also leading foodservice recovery and growth. at the same time, our sales team is working to recover raw material and supply chain cost inflation via pricing. to sum all these imperatives is a restoration of our chicken business to top-tier competitiveness and the coveted position of being our customers' go to supplier. acknowledging the uncertainty associated with the continued covid-19 recovery, we are increasingly confident in our ability to bring our adjusted operating income margin back to at least 5% to 7% range over time.
moving to prepared foods. sales were $2.2 billion for the quarter, up 4% relative to the same period last year. total volume was down 4% in the quarter as growth in the retail channel was offset by a reduction in foodservice volumes. sales growth outpaced volume growth driven by the partial pass through of raw material costs, lower commercial spending and better sales mix.
segment operating income was $217 million for the quarter, up 14% versus prior year. for the first half, operating income was $483 million, up 30%. operating margins for the segment were 10% for the second quarter, an improvement of 80 basis points versus the comparable period. improvement in operating income was driven by the mixed benefit a strong retail performance, lower commercial spending and pricing pass-throughs which more than offset higher operating and raw material costs.
in the second half, demand is expected to remain elevated at retail with volumes continuing to exceed pre-covid levels and foodservice showing sequential improvement. overall, we're seeing an accelerating inflationary environment that is creating a meaningful headwind for prepared foods in the back half of the year. we're seeing raw material costs up over 15% as well as increases in logistics, packaging and labor. to offset inflationary pressure, we're focused on pricing, revenue management, commercial spend optimization while ensuring the continued development of brand equity through marketing and traits pork.
moving to the beef segment. segment sales were approximately $4 billion for the quarter, up 2% versus the same period last year. key sales drivers include the strong domestic and export demand for beef products with average sales price up 7.5% for the quarter. sales volume for the quarter was down due to severe winter weather and production inefficiencies related to the challenging labor environment.
segment operating income was $445 million for the quarter. operating income improvement was driven by strong global demand for beef products and a higher cut-out, which were partially offset by higher operating costs. operating margin for the segment improved 790 basis points to 11% for the second quarter. our beef segment performance has been driven by favorable supply and demand dynamics, which look to persist deeper into the year.
on beef supply, slightly higher domestic production for the calendar year is being more than offset by lower imports and higher exports, resulting in lower projected domestic availability for the full year. adequate supply coupled with continued strong domestic and export demand will sustain cut-out values in our strong segment results.
now let's move on to pork segment on slide 12. second quarter results reflect the benefit of strong retail demand and higher exports, which were more than offset by higher hog cost and operating expenses. segment sales were $1.5 billion for the quarter, up 17% versus the same period last year. key sales drivers of the segment included higher average sales price due to stronger demand, partially offset by lower volumes due to production inefficiencies. average sales price increased by over 17% while volumes were down slightly relative to the same period last year.
segment adjusted operating income was $67 million for the quarter, down 28% versus the comparable period. overall operating margins for the segment declined by 280 basis points to 4.5% for the quarter. the operating income decline was driven by lower volumes, higher hog costs and increased labor and freight costs. to improve our operating income results for the segment, we have implemented several actions to alleviate production constraints and to improve our volume throughput.
as we look ahead, we are closely monitoring hog supply estimates. recent usda projections show a historically sharp drop in hog supplies. the sharp decline in supply and strong demand for certain pork items have pushed the cut-out 59% from the end of december. as it stands now, pork cut-out is at the highest level for this time of year since 2014. looking at the overall calendar year, lower projected 2021 pork production and continued robust consumer demand are expected to support hog prices at well above 2020 levels.
finally, slide 13 captures some highlights related to our international business. we continue to invest behind our international platform, which provides an opportunity to grow our sales and our margin by leveraging global production capabilities to feed consumers abroad. we're using our one tyson framework to identify opportunities to maximize the value of our products and capabilities from farm to table at a global level. our existing depth of experience in protein production, brand management and global customer relationships creates the right recipe for growth and positions us with the right to win internationally.
i'll now turn the call over to stewart to provide additional detail on our financial performance.
stewart f. glendinning -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
thanks, donnie. turning now to a summary of our total company financial results. we're pleased with our year-over-year growth in sales, adjusted operating income and earnings per share. we performed well despite the challenging operating environment that spend tough labor availability, significant inflationary pressures in raw material cost, global supply chain challenges and an evolving demand backdrop.
adjusted operating income was up 43% during the second quarter due to strong performance in our beef business along with growth in prepared foods earnings, partially offset by softness in chicken and pork. for the first half of fiscal 2021, we delivered adjusted operating income growth of 32%. adjusted eps grew nearly 70% during the second quarter driven by higher operating income. fiscal year-to-date adjusted eps was up 41% on a year-to-date basis.
slide 15 bridges our total company sales for the first half. ongoing retail strength drove much of our sales results. we delivered growth across all our reporting segments in the retail channel. overall, retail accounted for $700 million in sales improvement during the first half and over $260 million in the second quarter versus comparable periods.
moving to foodservice. sales declined over $400 million in the first half compared to the same period last year, but improved $69 million in the second quarter. foodservice recovery was most evident during the second quarter in higher chicken and prepared foods sales versus the same period last year. our foodservice mix in chicken indexes to qsrs, which saw volumes above pre-covid levels during the period.
in prepared foods, we're seeing recovery in foodservice foot traffic and strong sales into the distribution channel. exports were up over 5% versus the comparable period, led by beef where sales improved nearly $100 million for the first half. china is a key driver of beef exports strength. lastly, we've seen some strength in industrial, particularly in pork as renewable fuels continue to drive growth in fat and oils demand. in addition, the pace and shape of foodservice recovery will affect the composition of our channel and segment sales in the second half of the fiscal year.
slide 16 shows the bridge for adjusted operating income for the first half. lower volumes, primarily from production inefficiencies in foodservice, were $100 million headwind on gross margin in the first half. price mix benefited during the first half and price recovery of raw material cost inflation, improved mix, strong beef segment performance and continued retail strength across segments.
adjusted operating income was burdened by $664 million in cost of goods sold pressure for the period. this amount reflects significant raw material and supply chain cost inflation. of the total feed ingredient, grow-out costs and outside meat purchases associated with the chicken segment, contributed $240 million of pressure. other large contributors included freight and labor costs. year-to-date, sg&a benefited from the $54 million loss in fiscal 2020 compared to a $55 million gain in fiscal 2021 associated with the cattle supplier fraud and certain reductions in freight spend and travel costs.
slide 17 captures our financial outlook for fiscal 2021. given continued strength in the beef segment and our expectations for ongoing foodservice recovery, we are raising our sales guidance for the full year. we now expect to deliver annual revenues in the range of $44 billion to $46 billion. this guidance reflects our expectation of partial price recovery relative to continued feed ingredient and supply chain cost inflation.
at the segment level, we expect our directional annual guidance of lower operating margins in chicken and pork versus the prior year to hold. because of stronger than expected performance in beef and current market conditions, we are raising our guidance on the beef segment. we now expect segment earnings to be up versus prior year.
finally, we are lowering our guidance in prepared foods due to back half inflationary pressures and now expect the segment's earnings to be flat versus the prior year. de-risk to this guidance include freight rates, labor cost, grain costs in the chicken segment, raw material costs for our prepared foods business and continued export market strength along with price volatility in commodity meats.
our capital expenditures outlook of $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion remains unchanged, though we now expect to be at the lower end of the range. net interest expense is expected to be lower than our previous outlook at approximately $420 million. this update reflects an incremental term loan repayment of $750 million relative to our prior guidance that resulted in the early payout of our $1.5 billion term loan, offset by $500 million of new indebtedness associated with a new bilateral term loan facility.
our outlook on effective tax rate is unchanged. we will continue to monitor the potential implications of any new legislation, but do not currently expect to see impacts to our adjusted rate this fiscal year. our expectations related to liquidity are also unchanged. as we noted last quarter, liquidity decreased from $4.2 billion at the end of the first quarter, ending the second quarter at $2.6 billion. finally, covid-related costs which totaled $95 million in the quarter are now expected to be approximately $365 million for the year.
turning to slide 18. with our strong operational performance through the first half of 2021, we've seen an increase in operating cash flow. we have prioritized deleveraging through the first half consistent with our priority to maintain a strong balance sheet with financial flexibility. investing organically in our business has been an important priority, which will increase our production capacity and our market capabilities as well as modernize our operations while providing strong returns.
we will continue to explore parts to optimize our portfolio through m&a. we have a disciplined approach, which focuses on returns and generation of shareholder value. finally, we're committed return cash to shareholders through dividends and buybacks. in short, we view the cash generation capabilities of this business as both strong and diverse, and we expect our deployment to deliver strong shareholder returns.
now i'd like to turn the call back to dean.
dean banks -- president & chief executive officer
thanks, stewart. to close our prepared remarks, i just want to make a few comments about our priorities for the second half. looking at the work ahead of us, we are focused on improving operating margins, growing above the market and driving sustainable return for shareholders. to improve our operating margins, we are driving enterprisewide operational excellence, working aggressively to restore our competitive position in our chicken segment and structuring our teams to operate at the speed of the market.
to grow above the market, our team is focused on working closely with our customers to enable foodservice recovery and support ongoing retail demand. we've also increased investment in value-added capacity expansions and automation technology, which will support increased sales, high efficiency processing and more agile customer service. lastly, the strength of our balance sheet will allow us to continue to invest in our business and return capital to shareholders consistent with our stated priorities.
and with that, i'll now turn the call back to megan.

[operator instructions] our first question today comes from peter galbo from bank of america. please go ahead with your question.
peter galbo -- bank of america -- analyst
hey, guys. good morning and thank you for taking the questions.
donnie king -- president and chief executive officer
good morning, peter.
stewart f. glendinning -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
good morning.
peter galbo -- bank of america -- analyst
donnie, maybe we could just start reiterating the back half 2022 chicken outlook of 5% to 7%? and, i guess, just based on your prepared comments a lot of things are starting to move slowly, but in the right direction. so, i guess, the question is just what prevents that from getting pulled forward a bit? is it just that these hatch-related issues just take much more time, the automation of them kick in until later into 2022? or has something else changed incrementally, and maybe really around the labor picture, has it gotten worse kind of since last time we spoke?
donnie king -- president and chief executive officer
thanks for that question. peter, let me start with this, as we think about -- as we look forward, the fundamentals of our business look good going forward. we have strong retail and foodservice demand. we haven't changed our approach. chicken is our top priority for me and for our company. we continue to execute our plan. that hasn't changed. and that starts with staffing our plants and servicing our customers. and we have to be the most competitive chicken business. but we also want to grow the business. we are committed to top-tier performance. we're committed to the 5% to 7% aoi by mid-fy'22 that we talked about earlier. and we're committed to becoming the most sought-after place to work. and we talked a lot about that in the prepared remarks. we've increased wages and this includes the benefits up to $22 an hour. we've instituted flexible work schedules and shifts. we're piloting child care and on-site health clinics for our team members and their families. we're solving transportation problems for our team members. we're investing heavily in automation and technology and trying to automate those most difficult and higher turnover jobs.
i talked last time this so you understand the basis of this. the seven levers of our business in chicken are: price, volume, mix, labor, yield, spend and live. and so, let me touch on each of those for a moment. in our live operations, the plan to improve hatch is well underway. the new males will be in place by this fall as we talked about in 2q. we will see harvest capacity increase by mid-fiscal 2022. so here's kind of the formula, that's better hatch equals more birds, which equals more volume, which equals better service, which equals a better cost structure, which equals better performance and ultimately, better results for us. but until then, to your point and your question, we are improving hatch and harvest volume now. even these headwinds, we are better than an average company by a sizable margin in our live production area. and we'll get sequentially better between now and mid-2022.
if i look at spend, we talked a lot last time about outside purchases and stewart mentioned earlier that we've decreased that by 25%, although at a higher price. the thing that is challenging now is, we're paying a lot over time because of the inefficiency associated with labor, which is absenteeism and turnover. we've had inflation on all inputs. we believe grain and our cost of goods will crest in early q4, in fact, it has, based on the forward-looking curve. this is in our cost of goods. we've seen great improvements in our cost management and our execution by our team. much of that has been masked by inflation.
and then go to labor. labor is our single biggest issue we face. not only in chicken, but also in our other businesses. we've increased wages and created flexible shifts, child care on-site clinics. the delta variant has been a disruptor. we were on a good trajectory and then the delta variant showed up and we've taken a step back as a result of that. we've got plans to mitigate that. but the health and safety of our team members are our highest priority. we are more inefficient than we have historically been. certainly, a big part of what we have to solve, but essentially it takes us six days to get five days worth of work. i will tell you that the execution has improved sequentially through the year.
our volumes up in the quarter. that's head, that's weight, that's our finished good sales. volume is negatively impacted by harvesting below plan, which we talked about as a result of hatch. we started this year with a plan to grow the business and grow our head and grow our sales. but our byproduct and export sales are our biggest misses from a volume perspective. we will see volume increase between now and 20 -- mid-2022. that's in hatch, that's in head harvest and that's in volume through our plants.
from a mix standpoint, we've added volume. value-added volume is very strong. that's ready-to-eat product that's park, wright product, that's our frozen value-added branded products. that's the heart and soul of our business in chicken. we are at capacity with strong retail and foodservice demand. as stewart referenced earlier, we're adding lines and plans to address very strong demand.
our pricing is up 16% in the quarter. most of this increase came in june and even more in july. we worked with our customers, and they've been very responsive. our relationships are very strong with our customers. we've been successful in getting pricing. grain, also at the same time, has continued to escalate and pricing will certainly lag the cost in this scenario. we're just simply asking for fair market value for these products.
but long story short, yeah, we are executing better. we are performing better. we have a great deal of inflation led by grain, but we've gotten pricing around us. and so, as we move into every month and quarter from here, i would expect us to be sequentially better, and that 5% to 7% that we talked about by mid-2022, we're committed to that and we stand with that number.
peter galbo -- bank of america -- analyst
great. thanks, donnie. that's very helpful. just all of the detail there. and then just for the follow-up question. stewart, i guess, what's changed in your prepared comments around prepared foods? last quarter i think you had talked about the inflation coming through, maybe it's accelerated a bit, but then you'd be kind of turning on map spending in the back half of the year and maybe that wasn't the case in 3q and more so in 4q. so, is there just a change there? and maybe when can we expect that to start to flow through more? thanks.
stewart f. glendinning -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. thanks. look, we did turn map on in q3. it was one of the sort of downward levers as we've had to dial back in the retail space. so, it's already running through the numbers. it was earlier in the year where you saw the benefit. in the back half of the year, you're going to see the increases. and that's part of what's in our guidance.

and our next question comes from ken zaslow from bank of montreal. please go ahead with your question.
kenneth zaslow -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
hey. good morning, guys.
donnie king -- president and chief executive officer
good morning.
kenneth zaslow -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
just a quick follow-up. the parent stock is being rolled out fairly quickly, which is actually positive. can you talk about how confident you are that it will take and that there will not be any issues that the hatch rates and the productivity will be in line with your expectations? and just if there are any risk and how you see it? that's my first question.
donnie king -- president and chief executive officer
sure. thanks, ken. based -- as you know, we talked about the fact that this would be phased in starting and completing by, let's call it, fall. that work is underway. we have converted some of the male stock and we've seen some results associated with that. everything we have seen thus far would be in line with what we expected. and we see no reason to expect any disruption from that. so from that standpoint, everything looks good. it looks like it's on track to deliver what the timing that we talked about thus far.
kenneth zaslow -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
great. just flipping to the other side, beef business. for the last year or so, between covid and unfortunately, your fire, it seems like there has been a lot of cattle that just hasn't been dead as quickly as people may have expected. so, although we may be going through an underlying contraction. there seems to be a lot more cattle out there through -- probably at least through the winter, and if not, through 2022. would you agree with that? would you kind of put parameters around that? how do you see that?
and then as a follow-up to that would be the export side with china and japan, the trade policies that seems to be -- and the shortage of australian's beef, that seems like there is a duration to the export picture as well. and then i'll leave it there and i appreciate your time, as always.
donnie king -- president and chief executive officer
you bet. ken, let me say this, and i think your view of beef where we had ample cattle supplies and where we had really strong demand, we were constructed in the middle based on the labor availability and i talked about this in chicken earlier, but in our beef business it essentially takes us six days to get five days worth of work. so, the inefficiency associated with that allowed cattle to back up on the ranch and in feedlots. so here's what we know as we look into 2022. cattle supplies are expected to be down about 0.5%. june cattle on feed is projected to be up 1.9%. there has been some herd liquidation in the west and northern plains, which according to cattlefax about 33% of the us cow-calf production is in this drought area. but 2022 is looking good. is it going to be at the same level in which we were -- where we are at 2021? probably not. i don't think it will be that good. i think it will be better than historical returns. but -- and i'm talking that 1% to 3%, which we talked about forever. it will be north of that, we think. but we think all-in-all beef will have a very nice year in 2022.
in terms of export, to the other part of your question, asian growth is still solid. us grain-fed beef is preferred around the world. and as you mentioned, key global beef suppliers are rebuilding herds in australia and brazil and canada. so all of that is true. and so, strong export demand for us, as well as domestic.
kenneth zaslow -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
okay. i appreciate it as always.
donnie king -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.

our next question comes from ben theurer from barclays. please go ahead with your question.
benjamin theurer -- barclays capital -- analyst
thank you very much. good morning, donnie and stewart. first question is on what your plans are within the prepared foods business just more structurally? so clearly, we're seeing how pricing is coming through and impacting your beef, pork results, but that obviously puts a lot of pressure on prepared foods and you just talked about the input cost pressure by the end of the year. so, so far we're running at about a 9.5% range, but you've always talked about like this 10% to 12% range. so, what is it -- what keeps you away from being more aggressive from pricing within the prepared foods business to really pass on more of that internal inflationary pressure you're seeing on the ingredients side just to bring it back to the low-teens levels because i think guidance as well for the year is just below that 10% level? just to understand what needs to be seen in the market so you're going to be able to put pricing through?
donnie king -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. that's a great question, ben. we're still very proud of our prepared foods business. and if i look at the detail behind this, demand is expected to remain elevated. retail orders, for example, are up 30% versus pre-covid levels. foodservice is showing sequential improvement as well. we have seen accelerating and unprecedented inflation. so, what do you do about that? well, we are -- we have significant foodservice pricing already in the market. our retail pricing will be in the market by september 5. if inflation is up about 14% during our 3q and 9% year-to-date, we've had -- just like other businesses, we've had labor and absenteeism and turnover in the business that we have a number of open positions, so that certainly has made us inefficient. and so, we've got aggressive pricing going on -- aggressive revenue management and commercial spend management will help mitigate a portion of these inflationary impacts. we'll have to get more price, but we're comfortable that over time that our prepared foods is a double-digit business for us and it's just a -- costs are hitting us faster than we can get pricing at this point.
benjamin theurer -- barclays capital -- analyst
okay. perfect. and then my follow-up question is around the capital allocation and you've mentioned m&a would be one of the opportunities. so, could you -- without obviously going into specifics, but could you explore a little bit of where you think you would have to invest? is it on the international business? is it investing into new facilities or just acquiring new facilities for broaden the footprint in a certain segment? just to understand a little bit where your focus would be from an m&a perspective.
stewart f. glendinning -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. i'll -- stewart, i'll pick that up. i think just in this -- in terms of the specifics from m&a, i don't think we would talk to what specific places we're going to put the money. but let's just talk about overall our view of capital allocation. first of all, we really feel great about the current position of our balance sheet. our liquidity was $3.4 billion coming out of the quarter, that was before we took the receipt of the $1.2 billion from pet. and we did repay about $500 million worth of debt subsequent to the end of the quarter. so the balance sheet is very healthy.
from an investment standpoint, one of the things that we talked about, both in the prepared remarks and in last quarter is that, we expect to invest behind our business. we have significant opportunity to invest in expanding our capacity. and i spoke this morning about international, that will be a growth area for us. the capex that's going into the international space new facilities will expand their capacity by 30% when compared to last year. that's a big deal. and i think when you look at the rest of our business, donnie spoke this morning about automation, and you're seeing that both across prepared foods, as well as in our chicken business, which will certainly help our labor. it will help our efficiency.
and then you look at where we're putting money just behind in terms of new facilities. and humboldt has gone live. we've got a new case-ready facility in utah, that will be coming online shortly, as well as one in south carolina. so, we've got a pretty active internal agenda. if something on the outside presents itself that we think it makes sense for our investors, then we're going to -- we'll obviously take a look at that. but hopefully, that gives you a flavor for where we're investing our money.
benjamin theurer -- barclays capital -- analyst
okay. perfect. thanks, stewart.
operator
and our next question comes from robert moskow from credit suisse. please go ahead with your question.
robert moskow -- credit suisse -- analyst
hi, thank you. i've got a couple of questions. just one on the retail side, donnie, you said that pricing is having trouble keeping up with the inflation, but you do have an increase coming in september. to what extent does that fully offset all the inflation you've seen? of course, you need another price increase right after that because it's an upward sloping curve.
donnie king -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, robert. i mean, what you said -- i mean, you quoted everything i said earlier, but with retail, with the branded portfolio, it can take a little bit longer to get pricing in. we typically don't disclose that kind of information about when we would do it. but here's generally the way we think about this is that, when raw materials, when inputs go up pricing has to go up, particularly in an environment where we have such rapid and accelerating inflation. we have little choice but to go and to -- we certainly have to be competitive, but we certainly have to get pricing to cover the increase in inputs and we're doing that and we're doing that very methodically. we're looking at all the metrics around that as we do that, but we're doing it in a very responsible way. and noelle o'mara and her team are managing that around the clock.
robert moskow -- credit suisse -- analyst
okay. so, it sounds like it -- well, i'm not sure what that means, donnie, like if the inflation that you experienced in the middle of this year is being offset by pricing on september 5 like you say, but it sounds like inflation continues to rise. is that it? can i say that that's a fair statement?
stewart f. glendinning -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
so maybe just a couple of things. i'm going to just jump in and give you a couple of facts here. actually, if you looked at inflation, the biggest driver for prepared foods has been the input cost of commodities and, of course, for prepared foods that mostly is pork. you got that. of course, along with the increase in map spend, which i referred to latest.
so, in terms of thinking about price, i mean, what donnie saying is, when we think that price -- that commodities are going up or any inputs are going up, we're going to match that with pricing. that pricing may not follow exactly the track of input inflation. but you also need to think about how that input inflation can move along. while we've got labor cost increases, which is going into our workforce, you should think about those as more permanent, of course. but you have seen the cycles around commodities and you'll have to take a view of what you think pork -- the cost of pork will do over the price -- over the course of next year. if pork comes off then that'll will be a help to us. if pork doesn't come off, then i think donnie's point is that, we will continue to take price to match the nature of the cost that's coming to us.
robert moskow -- credit suisse -- analyst
okay, great. that -- i appreciate it. on foodservice, obviously, continued sequential improvement and then big improvement versus year ago. how are your customers viewing the next three to six months? do they view reopening pace continuing to accelerate or are there concerns about delta variant kind of slowing things down? and to what extent are you back to 2019 levels in terms of foodservice?
donnie king -- president and chief executive officer
foodservice, from everyone i've talked to, based on these -- what we see from a demand perspective is very strong. we're at or near across all businesses in some or even above from foodservice from, let's call it, pre-covid levels in 2019. so, i don't know that anyone fully understands what's going to happen with the delta variant. but there are certainly some concern about that. but everyone i talk to in foodservice is optimistic about the future and for their businesses, in particular.
robert moskow -- credit suisse -- analyst

ben bienvenu -- stephens inc. -- analyst
hey, thanks so much. good morning, everybody.
stewart f. glendinning -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
good morning, ben.
ben bienvenu -- stephens inc. -- analyst
i want to ask about the decision to mandate the covid vaccines in your facilities. and really from the standpoint of knowing that labor is exceptionally tight, does that create a dynamic where it potentially makes labor more tight or is the net impact of that gives enough certainty around your ability to have continuity and running your facilities that in some ways that kind of ring fences the labor dynamic when you think about trying to get the chicken margins back up and managing your plants that target the utilization rates?
donnie king -- president and chief executive officer
sure. thank you, ben. as we've talked a lot, even in our prepared remarks today, but they didn't just start today. the health and safety of our team is our highest priority. if you go back and look, even in the beginnings of the pandemic, tyson did a number of things to protect our team members. in fact, i would tell you, we did everything we knew to do to protect our team members. that was our highest priority. from mask mandates, to barriers within plants, to social distancing, to staggering shifts, to temperature sensors, and health screenings prior to go into work every day, we did everything that we need to do. with the new vaccine, it's a new tool. we believe that vaccine is the most effective thing, the most effective tool available today. we've studied the data. we've researched it to the nth degree and we're confident in doing that. and so, we mandated that because we thought it would be irresponsible not to do that and irresponsible not to protect our team members in every way that we could.
now, there could be some short-term impacts, but i think they certainly will be offset by a long-term benefit in doing this. and so, that's the position that we have taken and it's out of a just an abundance of caution and care for our team members.
ben bienvenu -- stephens inc. -- analyst
okay. thanks for that. my second question is on the chicken business. you talked about the critical path to achieving the margin targets you have for middle of next fiscal year. could i ask about it from a capacity utilization standpoint? i know you have humboldt coming online and ramping up the capacity. in years past, i think your utilization rate has been 89%, 90% or so. when you think about the full-year for 2022, is that too high of a watermark to hit on capacity utilization? or should we think about maybe you're getting back to that level by the end of fiscal 2022? how should we think about the ramp of getting back to those utilization rates?
donnie king -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. great question, ben. a couple of things with respect to that, when we started fiscal 2021, we had plans in place to increase our harvest head based on capacity utilization, based on demand that we already had. and with the hatch issues, certainly, that created a shortfall in terms of head for our business and then we go outside and start buying. as we've changed this male out and we are starting to see results of that, that will ultimately end up in more head for us to harvest and which is exactly our plan to -- we already have that product sold. but i would expect, as we move into 2022 and beyond that you'll see our capacity utilization increase at tyson from a harvest perspective, and all of that will be in service to supporting our value-added branded portfolio.
ben bienvenu -- stephens inc. -- analyst
okay. thanks. and best of luck.

adam samuelson -- goldman sachs -- analyst
hi, thanks. good morning, everyone.
stewart f. glendinning -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
good morning.
donnie king -- president and chief executive officer
good morning.
adam samuelson -- goldman sachs -- analyst
so, i guess, my first question is really maybe on that last point, donnie, around capacity utilization in poultry. and i'm just trying to think about how quickly and how far you could push it? i mean, if i'm looking the last 10-k based on a five-day week, the poultry business was at 84% kind of operating rate in fiscal 2020. i'd imagine it probably was leaking lower than that in fiscal 2021 given some of the hatch issues. and i'm trying to just dimensionalize, i mean, where do we think that's actually going? you guys are about 20% of the industry. so, if there is a meaningful change in your own internal production and hatch, i mean, it starts to have some meaningful impact at the industry level in terms of available live supply. any way you help frame that?
donnie king -- president and chief executive officer
sure. adam, i think you described it very well. and in a lot of way you even answered this. you talked about based on what you saw that it was 84%. well, obviously, 84% capacity utilization in a protein business is not a good number. we acknowledge that. i mean, it certainly has cost implications for your product and in fact, it can keep you uncompetitive in that space. so, we acknowledge that. so, there is a number of -- we need a number of head, if you -- you can do the math on how much outside meat we're purchasing based on volumes and you can -- you could probably convert that to head. i mean, one of the things that we could -- the quick math would tell you that being able to run those products through our plants and being able to debone those chickens and go into our further process assets and at the same time, get credit for all the byproducts through our ingredient solutions group and then have the ability with our one tyson approach to be able to sell export leg quarters and pause and so forth, along with just the further processing volume increases that we would get, all of that adds up to a much better cost scenario and a much better performance in our chicken business.
adam samuelson -- goldman sachs -- analyst
okay. that's really helpful. and then a follow-up on kind of an unrelated topic. california has their prop 12 mandate, supposedly coming into effect on january 1, and has implications in terms of the pork that supplied into the california market. and wondering kind of how if at all we should be thinking about the impact of that both to your pork and prepared foods businesses into next year.
donnie king -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. great question, adam. as we look at prop 12, yeah, it's about 4% of total production. that's not significant for us today. tyson is currently aligning incentivizing suppliers where appropriate. we can do multiple programs simultaneously, including prop 12. so, it's not something we were excited about, but we can align suppliers and we can certainly provide the raw material to service our customers in that way.
adam samuelson -- goldman sachs -- analyst

well, there is a pretty significant increase and a pretty significant cost increase associated with that. but in a lot of respect, the market is doing its job. based on the availability of labor, it is being in shorter supply. it's going up. and i don't see any reduction in that. we believe we're at a good place. we believe we are at the top of the market, if you will, in terms of jobs similar to this. we certainly are very competitive in all the communities where we have assets producing protein. so, we're comfortable where we are, but it certainly an increase. but in order to get people into your production location, it's more than just wage. and i want to make that clear. we have to do other things and i outlined a number of those things that we're doing around child care, transportation, on-site clinic, providing a safe place to work and flexible shifts and number of shifts in a week. it's a combination of all of those things. and doing all those things well. and so, when you hear us talk about being the most sought-after place to work, those are the type things that we have to do in order to be able to service our customers and to grow our business.
alexia howard -- sanford c. bernstein & co. -- analyst
great. and as a follow-up, just a quick one. of the $325 million in incremental covid costs expected this year, you talked about a certain proportion of that becoming permanent. can you quantify that?
stewart f. glendinning -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. alexia, it's stewart. look, first of all, we feel good about covid sequentially going down $55 million or so in the quarter. so that's about half. we've seen this sort of progressive, but the progression is sort of in 50%. but i would think, over the course of the year, the structural costs are going to be counted in around $200 million or more. so, just -- but understand that's in our run rate, right? so anything that could become structural, you're already seeing, it's flowing through the numbers, i wouldn't think about that in terms of all of a sudden that's going be added to next year. a lot of that is the -- are the other labor increases that donnie was talking to.
alexia howard -- sanford c. bernstein & co. -- analyst
very helpful. thank you very much. i'll pass it on.

operator
good morning, everyone, and welcome to the tyson foods third quarter 2021 earnings conference call. [operator instructions] please also note that today's event is being recorded.
at this time, i'd like to turn the conference call over to megan britt, vice president of investor relations. ma'am, please go ahead.
megan britt -- vice president of investor relations
hello and welcome to the third quarter fiscal 2021 earnings conference call for tyson foods. on the call today are donnie king, president and chief executive officer; and stewart glendinning, evp and chief financial officer. we have prepared presentation slides to supplement our comments, and these are available on the investor relations section of the tyson website and through the link to our webcast.
during this call, we will make forward-looking statements regarding our expectations for the future. these statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions, which may cause actual results to differ materially from our current projection. please refer to our forward-looking statement disclaimers on slide 2, as well as our sec filings for additional information concerning risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our projection.
please note that references to earnings per share, operating income and operating margin in our remarks are on an adjusted basis, unless otherwise noted. for reconciliation of these non-gaap measures to their corresponding gaap measures, please refer to our earnings press release.
i'll now turn the call over to donnie.
donnie king -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, megan. as many of you know, i've been a tyson team member for close to four decades. and in that time, i've led every business segment. we've always believed in our mission and the vision of john w. tyson, who founded this company nearly a century ago because he wanted to find a better way to feed a growing country. today, on my first earnings call as ceo, i am incredibly proud to stand alongside our team members to continue that legacy. it's an interesting time to be in this industry and we have a leadership team that together can capitalize on the strengths of this company and the opportunities ahead.
let's begin with the view of our overall performance this quarter. first, our retail performance. 12 consecutive quarters of retail share gains in our core business lines is driven by strength of our brands, along with solid execution from our team. we are in a market that has demonstrated strong demand for protein and people are reaching most for brands they trust. our $1 billion brands tyson, jimmy dean and hillshire farms have driven strong share growth with consumers buying more than ever before. second, we saw in the third quarter growing volume in foodservice channel, as reopening and recovery continue. we saw an uptick from outlets nationwide reflected in our sales, which we were up $1.3 billion for the quarter. our broad production and distribution network is well positioned to meet this growing demand.
third, the diversity of our portfolio demonstrated its value during the quarter, led by beef, we delivered an exceptional result as the strong us and export demand, coupled with ample cattle supply, supported elevated margins in that business. fourth, we continue to build financial strength. this quarter, we used higher operating cash flow to reduce debt. the steps we've taken positioned us with a very strong balance sheet and high levels of liquidity.
and finally, we are investing in future growth across our portfolio. we're in the process of bringing 12 new plants online globally to address capacity constraints and growing demand. in all, tyson delivered a strong quarter. as we look to the future, we want to build on these strengths.
let's look at how we plan to do that. first, we have built a solid footing to drive consistent results. our strength include a diverse portfolio, well-known trusted brand, scale in meaningful markets and an exceptionally strong balance sheet. second, labor is our number one challenge. so, we have continued our focus on improving our team member experience, without compromising their health and safety. we are accelerating efforts to make tyson the most sought-after place to work because we know how important team members are to our business. one of the way that we're doing this is to accelerate our investments in automation and technology. this not only helps us to eliminate more difficult, hard-to-fill task, but also reskill our labor profile to enable their contribution to more value-added activities.
third, we are actively working to recover volume from pandemic lows. and in doing so, improve the reliability we offer our customers. dynamic and evolving channel demand continues to create operational complexities. we took steps earlier this year to make our organization more responsive to demand signals and to accelerate our speed to market by getting our sales teams closer to their customers. there is more to do, however, and so our work here continues.
fourth, our focus on operational excellence and disciplined cost management is especially important during periods of continued market volatility and increasing inflationary pressures. as you will hear today, we continue to be laser focused in making progress in restoring the competitiveness of our chicken segment. we are also accelerating actions across our enterprise to become more operationally excellent. finally, we will continue to optimize our balance sheet, which will give us optionality as we prioritize the delivery of shareholder value.
turning to slide 5. we improved our sales and earnings performance this quarter. the results demonstrate the benefit of our multi-protein, multi-channel portfolio. sales improved 25% in third quarter and 8% year-to-date, reflecting improved volumes, which were up 10% for the quarter and flat year-to-date. it also reflects effective pricing strategies in all of our segments during this inflationary environment. we delivered strong operating earnings performance, resulting in approximately $1.4 billion in operating income for the quarter. this represents an 81% increase compared to prior year and translates to $2.70 in earnings per share. our earnings reflect our three key priorities: one, to be the go-to supplier for customers and consumers; two, to be the most sought-after place to work; and three, to be operationally excellent.
we want to be the most sought-after place to work. this starts with an unrelenting focus on safety, every minute, every shift, every day. health and safety have been and will continue to be our top priority. we have a history of using all the tools at our disposal to protect our team members and the vaccine is no different. as many of you will have seen, last week we announced that tyson will require covid-19 vaccinations for our entire us workforce by november 1. we do this now because the delta variant is more contagious and getting vaccinated is the single most effective thing people can do to protect themselves, their families and their communities. we have raised wages in many markets to ensure we're competitive and are exploring other ways to make tyson the most sought-after a place to work in the communities where we operate. for example, we are piloting child care facilities at some of our plants and we have opened medical clinics to make healthcare more accessible to team members and their families. finally, we are accelerating investments in automation and advanced technologies to make team members' jobs easier. we look forward to providing more detail on automation and technology roadmap at our upcoming investor day.
we're taking aggressive actions to add new capacity to meet demand, adjust our product mix by plant, and match our portfolio more closely with customer and consumer needs. we're listening to our customers and are committed to improving reliability of supply. in the third quarter, we improved volume levels across all segments. in prepared foods, we continue to optimize our product portfolio, remove processing and supply chain complexity and prioritize products with the highest demand resulting in lower cost and better service to our customers.
in beef, ample cattle supply, heavier animal weights, and strong demand have driven volumes higher year-to-date. in pork, our volumes are up year-to-date versus pandemic lows. we are pleased to have additional capacity coming online at eagle mountain in utah and columbia, south carolina, both facilities are expected to grow our pre-packaged beef and pork products.
in chicken, volume declined year-to-date despite improved foodservice demand led by qsrs. we also saw sustained retail demand, including the frozen value-added poultry category, limited capacity and persistent labor challenges have impacted customer fill rates in this segment. however, our new plant in humboldt, tennessee continues to ramp-up production, including harvest capacity. this ramp-up is helping us improve customer fill rates. chicken remains a top priority for me and for our company. we continue to execute against our roadmap to bring operating income margin to at least the 5% to 7% range by mid-fiscal 2022. our goal has not changed and we remain committed to restoring top-tier performance. we are making progress. the first imperative is to be the most sought-after a place to work. i've outlined the investments we're making to enhance our team member experience in my earlier comments.
the second imperative is to improve operational performance. last quarter, we highlighted the impact of lower hatch rates on our chicken operations. we have begun to deploy new male parent stock, where this stock has been deployed, hatch rates are improving. we expect a full rollout of this breeder stock to be complete this fall with harvest capacity improvements occurring by mid-fiscal 2022. our rate of outside meat purchases has declined 25% versus last quarter and will continue to decline as hatch rates and utilization improve. we have identified opportunities to reduce mix complexity across our chicken footprint, which will help us operate more efficiently.
the final imperative is to service our customers on time and in full. we're pleased by the continued share performance of our value-added products like tyson chicken nuggets, crispy strips and air fried. we gained share during the third quarter and the last 52 weeks. looking ahead, we expect further growth and as a result, we're investing in line upgrades and increased capacity drive branded product growth. we have increased prices to help offset significant raw material and supply chain cost inflation. pricings improved nearly 16% in the quarter versus the comparable period last year. we will staff our plants, service our customers, grow our business and be the best chicken company, period.
part of being customer-centric means being as efficient as possible and taking cost out where you can, without compromising our ability to execute against our strategic and operational priorities. we have ongoing efforts across the business to reduce costs. but we must also find new innovative ways to be better and stronger. this means investing in advances like automation and artificial intelligence to deliver productivity gains and competitive advantage. we have already delivered strong productivity gains in fiscal year 2021. across our business, we are looking to build upon the strength of those actions in the months and years to come, which we will detail at the investor day later this year. these improvements come at a time when we are investing heavily in capacity expansions across segments to better partner with our customers and meet long-term demand.
i'll now turn the call over to stewart to walk us through our financial results in detail.
stewart f. glendinning -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thank you, donnie. let me turn first to summary of our total company financial results. sales were up approximately 25% in the third quarter. volumes were up 9.7%, primarily due to strength in retail and the ongoing foodservice recovery. average sales price was also up about 17%, largely due to strong results in our beef segment, the mix benefit from retail volume and the partial recovery of raw material inflation in net sales price. operating income was up 81% in the third quarter due to continued strong performance in our beef business. chicken and prepared foods also improved their respective segment earnings, while pork earnings were down versus the comparable period a year ago. year-to-date, operating income for the total company improved by 49%.
earnings per share grew 93% in the third quarter due largely to strength in operating income, specifically within our beef segment. eps was up 61% on a year-to-date basis. we performed well despite a challenging operating environment that span tough labor availability, significant inflationary pressures on raw material costs, global supply chain challenges and an evolving demand backdrop.
slide 11 bridges our total company sales on a year-to-date basis. we delivered growth in the retail channel along all reporting segments, which in aggregate accounted for more than $1 billion in sales improvement over the year-to-date period and more than $300 million in the third quarter versus the respective comparable periods.
moving to foodservice, sales improved by approximately $1.3 billion in the third quarter, leading to a year-to-date improvement for the channel of nearly $1 billion compared to the same period last year. exports were up over 18% versus the comparable period, led by beef, where sales improved by more than $350 million on a year-to-date basis. asia has been a key driver of beef export strength. we've also seen some strength in industrial, particularly in beef and pork.
and finally, year-to-date sales grew $79 million or approximately 6% in our international business. this business is a growth priority for tyson and we continue to invest to develop further capacities and capabilities in new markets to meet growing global consumer demand for protein products. current capacity expansions across seven international locations are expected to dramatically increase our fully cooked production capabilities. these investments are fully aligned to our strategic growth priorities and when complete, will enhance our international processing capacity by close to 30% versus fiscal 2020. overall, we're pleased with the company's top line growth year-to-date. we are carefully managing the current inflationary pressures through pricing actions, as well as commercial and operational excellence, with emphasis on productivity and cost. we know that our price recovery efforts relative to inflation must be matched by equal aggressiveness on productivity.
slide 12 bridges year-to-date operating income. production inefficiencies and low labor availability resulted in total company volumes roughly flat to the comparable period a year ago. however, we are encouraged by the volume improvement we are seeing across our segments in the third quarter. price mix benefited substantially in the year-to-date period from price recovery of raw material cost inflation, improved mix, strong beef segment performance and continued retail strength across segments. operating income was partially offset by $2.2 billion and increased cost of goods sold for the period, reflecting meaningful inflation in raw material and supply chain costs. feed ingredients, labor, packaging and freight are all key components of this cogs increase, which we're working to mitigate.
on a comparative basis, sg&a benefited from the $56 million loss in the year-to-date fiscal 2020 period as compared to a $55 million gain in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 associated with the cattle supplier incident. this was in addition to certain reductions in trade spend and travel costs.
moving into the chicken segments' results. sales were $3.5 billion for the third quarter, up 12%. volumes were also up in the quarter due to continued strength in retail, improving demand through foodservice and segmentwide operational improvements. these were partially offset by covid-related production inefficiencies. average sales price was up 15% in the quarter due to favorable mix, sustained retail volume and strong supply and demand fundamentals.
our reported price improvement also reflects actions we took to cover the inflationary pressure seen from higher grain, labor and freight costs. our conversations with customers on widespread inflationary pressures have been productive. and we'll continue to partner with customers to ensure we receive a fair return on our products while working to deliver service levels and fill rates that meet or exceed their expectations.
operating income was $27 million in the third quarter and $137 million on a fiscal year-to-date basis, both stronger than comparable periods a year ago. this represents an operating margin of 1.3% year-to-date. fiscal year-to-date operating income was negatively impacted by $410 million of higher feed ingredient costs, as well as $210 million of increased grow-out expenses and outside meat purchases.
for the third quarter, feed ingredients were $270 million higher, while grow-out expenses and outside meat purchases were $110 million higher. segment performance also reflects net derivative gains during the third quarter of $125 million and $235 million on a year-to-date basis, both versus the respective comparable periods. these results are associated with realized gains, as well as open positions.
moving now to prepared foods. sales were $2.3 billion for the quarter, up 14% relative to the same period last year. total volume was up 4.5% in the quarter with strength in the retail channel and continued recovery in foodservice. sales growth outpaced volume growth, driven by the pass-through of raw material costs, lower commercial spending and better sales mix.
segment operating income was $150 million for the quarter, up over 3% versus the prior year. year-to-date operating income was $633 million, up 23% versus the prior year period. operating margins for the segment was 6.5% for the third quarter, a decline of 60 basis points versus the comparable year-ago period. the slowdown in segment operating margins versus the same quarter last year were driven by significant increases in raw material input costs. however, on a year-to-date basis, our operating margin of 9.6% was up 170 basis points versus last year, driven by favorable pricing and lower commercial spend.
demand for the balance of the year is expected to remain elevated at retail, with volumes continuing to exceed pre-covid levels and foodservice continuing to recover. during the third quarter, core business lines experienced volume share growth of 90 basis points, while dollar share grew 70 basis points. we continue to believe that the ongoing inflationary environment will create a meaningful headwind for prepared foods in the upcoming quarter. raw material cost, logistics, ingredients, packaging and labor are all challenging our cost of production. to offset inflationary pressure, we're focused on pricing, revenue management, and commercial spend optimization, while ensuring the continued build of brand equity through marketing and trade support.
moving to the beef segment. segment sales were over $4.9 billion for the quarter, up 36% versus the same period last year. key sales drivers included strong domestic and export demand for beef products with average sales price up 12% for the quarter. we had ample livestock available in the quarter, driven by strong front-end supplies. mounting drought conditions in the western united states cattle growing region, as well as elevated cost for grain also drove some cattle supply liquidation. we have good visibility into cattle availability through fiscal 2022 and currently believe it will also be sufficient to support our customer needs. sales volume for the quarter was up year-over-year due to continued strong demand in contrast to a soft comparable period a year ago, driven by lower production volumes.
we delivered segment operating income of $1.1 billion for the quarter. this improvement was driven by strong global demand for beef products and a higher cut-out, which were partially offset by higher operating costs. operating margins for the segment improved 520 basis points to 22.6% for the third quarter. while our beef segment experienced tremendous results on a year-to-date basis, we're still not at optimal levels of capacity throughput within our beef plants due to labor challenges. meanwhile, drought conditions and elevated grain prices are creating incremental costs and risks for cattle producers. until these conditions stabilize and within the constraints i had mentioned, we will work to maximize our beef processing capacity to provide a reliable outlook for our livestock farmers and adequate product supply for customers and consumers.
now, let's move on to the pork segment on slide 16. third quarter results reflect higher hog costs and operating expenses that weren't fully offset through pork cut-out. segment sales were $1.7 billion for the quarter, up 54% versus the same period last year. key sales drivers for the segment included higher average sales price due to strong demand, partially offset by a challenging labor environment. average sales price increased more than 39% while volumes were also up relative to the same period last year.
segment operating income was $67 million for the quarter, down 37% versus the comparable period. overall, operating margins for the segment declined by 570 basis points to 3.9% for the quarter. the operating income decline was driven by higher hog costs and increased labor and freight costs. at the end of this calendar year, lower projected 2021 pork production and strong consumer demand are expected to support hog prices well above 2020 levels.
slide 17 captures our financial outlook for fiscal 2021. given the continued strength in our beef segment and ongoing inflationary pressures that are partially being recovered through price, we are raising our sales guidance for the full-year. we now expect to deliver annual revenues in the range of $46 billion to $47 billion. at the segment level, we expect our directional annual guidance to hold. key risks to this guidance include freight rates, labor cost and availability, grain costs in the chicken segment, raw material costs for each of our businesses and continued export market strength along with price volatility in commodity meats.
we're slightly revising our outlook on effective tax rate to approximately 22.5%. we'll continue to monitor the potential implications of new legislation, but we do not currently expect to see impacts to our adjusted rate this fiscal year. while our expectations related to liquidity are also unchanged, liquidity during the third quarter improved substantially to $3.4 billion and has since benefited from $1.2 billion of pre-tax proceeds from the divestiture of our pet treats business in early july.
finally, we expect our covid-related costs, which totaled $55 million in the quarter to be approximately $325 million for the year. as a reminder, some of the costs that were previously described as covid-related, have evolved to become structural.
turning to slide 18, in pursuit of our priority to build financial strength and flexibility, we have substantially delevered our business over the past 12 months, reducing leverage to 1.7 times net debt to adjusted ebitda. investing organically in our business will continue to be an important priority and will help tyson increase production capacity and market capabilities. each of these levers individually and in aggregate will support strong return generation for our shareholders. we will also continue to explore costs to optimize our portfolio through m&a through the lens of value creation and shareholder return.
finally, we are committed to return cash to shareholders through both dividends and share buybacks. in short, we view the cash generation capabilities of this business as both strong and diverse, and we expect our capital allocation framework to deliver solid returns for our shareholders in the future.
and with that, i'll turn the call back to donnie.
donnie king -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, stewart. to close, our priorities are clear, being the most sought-after place to work, being our customers' go-to supplier and doing so while driving operational and functional excellence across all areas of our business. there is a lot to be excited about. we look forward to discussing where we're headed during our upcoming investor day and hope you can join us.

we'll do. we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [operator instructions] the first question will come from ben bienvenu with stephens. please go ahead.
ben bienvenu -- stephens -- analyst
hey, thanks, good morning. everybody.
donnie king -- president and chief executive officer
good morning.
ben bienvenu -- stephens -- analyst
just want to ask within the commentary on the guidance, the productivity savings of $300 million to $400 million for this year and $1 billion by the end of 2024, could you talk about how much of that you expect to be realized on a net basis to the bottom line? and how much of it might be reinvested back into the business to drive growth?
stewart f. glendinning -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
so, ben. good morning, stewart here. look, we're kind of drive for as much of it is possible to the bottom line, but keep in mind that our assumptions around what's going to drop to the bottom line are already embedded in the guidance that we've given you by segment. but that's the short story.
ben bienvenu -- stephens -- analyst
okay, perfect. and then if i look at the balance sheet your, even with a pretty substantial increase in capital expenditures for 2022 you're going to have a cash build potentially. though i know stewart you noted some commentary on the business, the working capital being a use of cash in 2022. could you talk about what you expect that use of cash to look like so that we can get a sense of what the cash balance at year end looks like. and then along the same lines, you talked about reinvestment in m&a what is your prioritization of that relative to potentially share repurchase given that you've up the authorization there?
stewart f. glendinning -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
okay. right. let me unpack that a little bit. so yes, look, we're super please with the way the year has worked out. this is really a diverse portfolio that's delivered a great result and that's driven the, the increase in cash. so sitting at 1.2 times leverage. we've got $1 billion of debt that will come through this year, we are planning to pay that down we also as you called out are going to have a much larger expenditure on capex, which is going to be great for our investors.
and, as our business grows, that's going to consume some more working capital, regular working capital. in addition to that, we've got a number of one-off payments that we expect to pay out this year which are pretty meaningful and that's -- to characterize that is around $1 billion of deferred taxes related to the cares act, taxes that are owed on the sale of the pet business as well as some payout of the litigation accruals that you've seen in our books.
ben bienvenu -- stephens -- analyst
okay.
stewart f. glendinning -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
m&a, maybe your the last question on an m&a versus buyback. look, it's a normal course, we don't comment on any specific m&a but we've shared the levers in our business. we have successfully pulled all those levers over the last number of years and i think that's been to good effect. we don't imagine that we're going to change that this year.
ben bienvenu -- stephens -- analyst
okay, fair enough. great, thanks. and look forward to catching up with you guys at the investor day.
stewart f. glendinning -- executive vice president and chief financial officer

the next question will come from benjamin theurer with barclays. please go ahead.
benjamin theurer -- barclays -- analyst
good morning, donnie, stewart.
donnie king -- president and chief executive officer
good morning.
benjamin theurer -- barclays -- analyst
thanks for taking my question. congrats on the results now. just to unfold one thing, and maybe you can help us a little bit on what you're planning into 2022. so clearly, it feels like a lot of your growth in the quarter was impacted by lack of labor, be it in beef, be in pork. i mean you've pointed out in the segment commentary, there was a lot around labor shortage and we know you've been investing in people, but what do you have to do looking into 2022 to overcome these, these headwinds on the labor market. just in order to get actually the volume out do you want to get out because it seems like you have the assets, but you don't have the people to process, is that a fair assumption?
donnie king -- president and chief executive officer
let me take that those stewart and good morning. labor has been very challenging throughout the year, but as we've mentioned in the script earlier, we are seeing a light at the end of this tunnel, we're seeing our ability to get plant staffed, i think from a poultry perspective. for example we are almost fully staffed since november1, we've made great progress across prepared foods and our beef and pork businesses. so we're gaining on that post the close of our vaccine mandate.
so we're very optimistic about '22. but in addition to having a labor shortfall, which is constrained capacity, we've also had just capacity shortfall in some key categories. for example, ready to eat products that would be for the more value-added poultry and also for prepared foods. and again, we're just now bringing on two new case-ready beef and pork plants to enable us to have more capacity in there in a start-up mode.
so yes, the labor has been a challenge. we see-- we're seeing progress, we're very excited about '22 from that perspective. we believe we've got the worst behind us and we're looking forward to that, but we're also we've got 12 new plants going or under construction to deliver more capacity and we have strong demand for that. and so we look forward to what that would deliver for us not only this year but also in the coming years.
benjamin theurer -- barclays -- analyst
okay. and then within prepared foods, i mean clearly we're seeing the headwinds from the input cost most here and just you holding back a little bit on pushing through price with that operating income margin adjusted down to a little less than 2%. now, the guidance for next year basically implied something flat. does that mean on over the course of the year we should just think about still headwinds in the first half and as pricing comes through in the second half we're going to see that picking up a little bit or how should we think about the cadence of margins into 2022 in the prepared foods business.
stewart f. glendinning -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
i'll make a couple of comments, and i'll pass that onto our to our experts noelle o'mara, who leads our prepared foods businesses and so it's you characterized much of it, we're trying to absorb the rapid inflation predominantly in pork products and meat and as we go with this branded portfolio that we have to the marketplace, it's no different than any other cpg company has dealt with. you're trying to balance share and price and it takes, it takes a little bit of time.
unlike the commodity portion of our business, beef and pork and it takes a lot more time to get that executed. we're looking for ways, always looking for ways to try to expedite that process, but it takes a bit to be able to get customers aligned to be able to get promotional and those activities align but let me stop with that and i'll pass it over to noel to add some color as well.
noelle o'mara -- group president of prepared foods
sure. thanks, donnie. ben, as we mentioned demand continues to be incredibly strong across the portfolio. our q4 performance was impacted because of the inflationary environment accelerating faster than anticipated. despite the unprecedented inflationary headwinds, the actions that we took in the second half of '21 and the beginning here of '22 i expect will allow us to offset the headwinds and drive sequential improvements in profitability.
benjamin theurer -- barclays -- analyst

i guess donnie. and well, i'd like to get your thoughts on this just as you're taking a lot more pricing in prepared and i guess across the rest of the portfolio. just what are you seeing from a consumer perspective in terms of trade down or elasticity still kind of holding or i should say holding as at an inelastic level or are you starting to see just some of that roll through and how do you think about in the '22 as prices continue to go up.
noelle o'mara -- group president of prepared foods
sure. let me take that. so demand continues to be strong across the portfolio in both retail and foodservice. we're pleased with the market performance we're seeing despite the price increases, elasticity has been less than historical models we just projected. we're seeing penetration and by rate increases versus pre-covid levels across categories, as donnie referenced, we've had our 13th consecutive quarter of share growth. but we'll continue to learn and adapt as long as capable.
peter galbo -- bank of america -- analyst
that's helpful. thank you. and then donnie, just in terms of the productivity plan and the capex, is there a way for us to think about it, you gave some helpful detail on the slides. but just to think about it by segment?
donnie king -- president and chief executive officer
well, it's. let me start peter with saying, it applies to all segments and in the first part of the program has to do with operational and functional excellence and quite frankly that is, that is really doing better -- our jobs better taking out waste, removing bureaucracy and that's primarily targeted against our finance, human resources and procurement groups, it's executing at a much higher level. there is another component that is digital solutions and that's about $250 million in recurring savings and that's more on the operational side of supply chain planning, logistics and warehousing so you can think of that in that bucket and that's across all businesses. in fact the first two across all businesses.
and then third automation, leveraging robotics and technology and we're spending a significantly to get the portion of the $2 billion in capital that we're spending, our a disproportion amount of that is going against capacity expansion in these 12 plants that we talked about over the next three years. but in addition to that, it's to put automation and technology and to eliminate difficult higher turnover jobs. think for example, debone automation, whether beef or white meat or dark meat. think about it in terms of material handling and you would see more of that from in our prepared foods group and then you've got, if we think about outside the united states then we just have a i'd say a plethora of automation and technology and a digital footprint as we build those plants up outside the us.

the next question will come from nore norton [phonetic] with j.p. morgan. please go ahead.
nore norton -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
hi, good morning. we want to get some additional color on some of the chicken initiatives you discussed. you talked about optimization efforts, increasing the harvest capacity by 10% and over what timeframe are you thinking, you'll be able to achieve that level of capacity expansion. and does the run rate ebit margin of 5% to 7% already contemplate that higher fixed cost leverage from these efforts?
donnie king -- president and chief executive officer
great question. let me, i'll start out and then and give you some very top line stuff in a flip it over to david bray, who leads our poultry group. think of this in terms of the 5% to 7% being a waypoint and we've communicated that we think by the middle part of '22 that's where we will be. that's not the goal, that's the way point and we backed into that, but if you think about those building blocks that are necessary to get there and beyond. it's really starting with volume and we've talked a lot about the hatch issue that we've had and the male and -- but as we move into '22, we are already seeing great results remember, this male we put in, is not new to the world, it's one we've used and delivered great results for years.
so we have a great deal of confidence in that, but it's also -- efficiency is about running plants at capacity and not having to go to the outside and buy as much boneless skinless breast meat as we have in '21. and then labor, i mean, i mentioned earlier that we're back to near complete staffing and we're seeing some really, really good result from that and our team is excited in terms of just the efficiency and improvement we've seen since completing our vaccine mandate on november 1, but this comes down to an execution story and volume is absolutely critical to getting us to the way point 5% to 7% but also in terms of taking us into the future. and with that let me flip it over to david, he may add a little more color to that?
david bray -- group president of poultry
yes, just a little bit of color donnie. thank you very much for the opportunity. and again, i think it is critical for us to state that volume is a critical pillar for that but we also have a very structured success program that we've built across our organization where we're focused on being the most sought-after place to work where we're focused on servicing our customer, growing our optimal products and brands and performing with the best. hatch is a component of that and again we are seeing sequential week-over-week improvement and feel good about the plan that we have in place relative to hatch.
but we are also working on other imperatives within our business and a lot of this really began within the q4 timeframe. we are increasing our investment in dark meat debone capacity. there was also significant price investment or improvement that we realized within the quarter. and ultimately, we're optimizing our plant efficiency ahead of our increased harvest. improvements are coming from price, mix, volume, spend and labor. in short, we are driving operational excellence across our poultry segment and we are aligned on that plan. i'll tell you we have the right plan and we have the right people to make sure that we execute on the fundamentals of our business.

the next question will come from alexia howard with bernstein. please go ahead.
alexia howard -- bernstein -- analyst
good morning, everyone.
donnie king -- president and chief executive officer
good morning.
alexia howard -- bernstein -- analyst
so can we all first of all about the labor cost implication for the longer term. i mean you're obviously spending presumably rising wage rates and so on. how much do you expect the entire labor cost to be above pre-pandemic level once all the dust is settled. and then i have a follow-up.
donnie king -- president and chief executive officer
thank you for the question. i would tell you that as we stated, we have to win with team members. we have to be the most sought-after a place to work. and we've done a number of things already to try to do that. it's the recognition that the workforce today, they have many, many options in there. there are few people chasing the number of jobs that are actually out there. and so as we've talked, internally, we're not trying to solve the labor problem for america. we are trying to solve for tyson foods and we want to give people an option, we want to give them a better option.
and we think the key to staffing plants, but more importantly, being able to service customers and execute at a high level absolutely starts with people. so the $24 an hour, it includes a number of things but it is the benefit to go with that. we've had to enhanced a number of those things, do things like scheduling different suits meaning multiple shifts are being very creative in each location. childcare is a component of that we've experimented with, on-site health clinics is another we've experimented with, but we're trying to be creative and trying to make sure that we're positioned well to have a place people want to come to work and we see that as being critical to our future success.
and so that's what we're doing $24 an hour. i would tell you that's may be leading in the marketplace. but it's, i think it's also a competitive wage and so we want to be on the leading side of that. and so that is our intent. that's how you can think about as we think about labor going forward, we see that is the cost of inflation and the cost of labor going forward.
alexia howard -- bernstein -- analyst
great, thank you. and just as you look out to fiscal '22, what do you see as the biggest uncertainties and risks this year, it sounds that you're fairly confident in the chicken margin recovery, but across the business. what you see as the biggest uncertainties from this perspective today?
donnie king -- president and chief executive officer
sure. i would tell you that in all my years of being in this business. there are always risks that come up. the one thing i am certain of is as we get into '22 we will there is going to be something happen we hadn't anticipated. if you go back to this time a year ago, we had- we thought we had a pretty solid plan around in poultry around grain pricing -- or pricing relative to grain and then we saw a tremendous increase in the cost of grain and we were sitting with fixed pricing on so much, so those types of things happen.
what i can tell you and why we're excited is that, we've adjusted our model, our pricing model, and so that we de-risk it not only for us but also for our customers, so that when there is inflation then we in a position we can adjust pricing with those customers and our relationships with them we're really second to none and these have been really good conversations, it's been a win-win approach in these conversations and we're proud of that and it starts with that relationship with the customer.
so we've moved and de-risk our model relative to pricing and inflation and that we believe puts us in a better position. in terms of labor. i don't know how to anticipate a new covid variant or something that the vaccine might not protect against. but i can tell you that we took a bold action to do everything we need to do to protect team members and we saw it as an investment and a de-risking of our business just by having a vaccinated workforce, and so that we believe that's one less thing we'll have to deal with this year. that's one less thing we're seeing in terms of complexity to our business.
alexia howard -- bernstein -- analyst
great, thank you very much. i'll pass it on.

the next question will come from adam samuelson with goldman sachs. please go ahead.
adam samuelson -- goldman sachs -- analyst
yes, thank you good morning everyone.
donnie king -- president and chief executive officer
good morning.
adam samuelson -- goldman sachs -- analyst
so may be just a bit of a clarification question on the guidance and as we think about kind of what embedded in the segment margin assumptions, can you help us think at the total company level, what level kind of non-raw material inflation is assumed for things around logistics and labor and packaging to -- in there? as well what is assumed on a year-on-year basis for feed costs in the chicken segment?
donnie king -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, adam. i'll start with it, and i'll pass it over to stewart, he can cover may be in greater detail on some of those non-grain. we positioned our sales from a poultry perspective as well as from a prepared foods perspective, so that we can respond to inflation, whether it be grain, labor, transportation, warehousing cost, which are the biggest ones packaging, packaging and ingredients that all going up in price as well. in fact, i would, it might be easier for me to tell you what hasn't seen -- what component hasn't seen inflation in this past year. but we think we've got our model positioned to adjust for that.
around pricing and responsiveness and we don't expect customers to pay for inefficiencies. but we'd like to think that we have relationships with customers that allow us to be able to take to them part of our inflation that we see in the marketplace and be able to pass that on ultimately to the consumer. and so that's the way we thought about our model. that's how we've adjusted our model and it's been a year-long really a year-long we've doing that and we are in a pretty good place right now.
with respect to chicken. i think based on today's current level of inflation we have currently caught up with the inflation with pricing across the chicken segment. we're putting that pricing in place in prepared foods and of course our commodity business the beef and pork those respond more rapidly to inflation and so those are working as designed as well. stewart, would you like to add any color to them?
stewart f. glendinning -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
sure. donnie. adam. just a couple of points to make here. so first of all, you had a question earlier on about the savings, you know that's the $300 million to $400 million is coming through as a benefit in the year. we shared with you that obviously volume is increasing, so you're going to see some increase from volume. and of course, we're continuing to pass through price and have the benefit of some mix. when you look at the line of the business, keep in mind and actually, you look at the cost. keep in mind the guidance around beef which is lower than last year. right.
and therefore beef. you should expect to see both cut out and you should expect to see the cattle cost increase and that's going to be part of it. perhaps a couple of other things to keep in mind there are ingredient cost that are outside of grains, things like cooking oils, you've seen the price of oil that has increased, distribution is up and we've had 13 strong quarters of share gain in our prepared foods business and that business will likely invest money behind our brands this year to make sure that kind of momentum continues. so that that's probably a run through the big guidance.
adam samuelson -- goldman sachs -- analyst
all right. that's really helpful. and then on the productivity, you talked about -- look it's a bit more of a gross productivity, actually you hope to capture as much as you can to the bottom line or it's used to reinvest, but can you help frame kind of the scope of the spend that productivity is going after. obviously, it wouldn't have that much impact on some of the direct raw materials in terms of the feed ingredient or cattle hog that you buy what's the right denominator to think about the scope of the savings from $1 million over a couple of years?
stewart f. glendinning -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes, i mean it's complicated in our business of course because you've got all the commodity meat inputs. if you had to pull those off. but i don't know that i've got a great number to put to you -- to give that what i would go back to is your starting point, which is that you we hope that it's drop the [indecipherable] not a hope strategy actually. we have a very strong game plan here to drive these costs to the bottom line and they are part of -- they are part of our equation for next year. and you'll see that, and that's part of our guidance, the shape of next year looks good. i mean prepared foods and chicken both showing improvement, strong improvement from the fourth quarter. beef still expecting a very strong year despite lower numbers than we had this year. so i think the shape of things looks good. those savings are embedded in the in the forecast that i gave you.
donnie king -- president and chief executive officer
so, if i may answer add one more thing to that have this -- every one of these savings that we've talked about over the next three years, we have a program management office and we track that to the bottom line. we have built that into our '22 plan and if you look at the out years of '23 and '24, we've also built that into operating income. we did not count it unless we could show it hitting the operating income line of the business. this is, we did -- we've done our work here to make sure this was not a slide of hand but a true delivering of results and more importantly delivering of a much, much better process all the way around.
adam samuelson -- goldman sachs -- analyst
i appreciate all the color. i'll pass it on. thank you.
donnie king -- president and chief executive officer

the next question will come from ken zaslow with bank of america -- montreal.
ken zaslow -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
good morning, everyone.
donnie king -- president and chief executive officer
good morning, ken.
ken zaslow -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
just have a couple of jobs apparently. bank of america, bank of montreal, but a couple of questions. you said you cover, you actually covered cost with pricing on the chicken business as of now. help me understand, so does that mean that the issues right now are really operational issues and then as you move into the new year, you're going to price on top of that as your pricing contracts come to anniversary, is that how to think about it or did i misunderstand?
donnie king -- president and chief executive officer
i think it ken. thanks. i think it's probably more of a point in time. my comment was, as of today, we have, we are now -- we have our pricing at a point where it covers the cost of inflation. we've also had during the quarter most recent quarter, we've had issues with the labor availability inefficiencies associated with that. but we are now staffed. so as -- i mentioned that in terms of a go forward position. we will be fully staffed and again i'm speaking of chicken here, but will be fully staffed. we will be far more efficient, david and his team are laser-focused on the executional excellence in the business and we're seeing great progress in that and noelle and her team in prepared are doing exactly the same thing. so we're optimistic going forward, we believe the worst is behind us and we're excited about what we're seeing in our q1 and what we'll see for the year, it's very much in line with what we project.
ken zaslow -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
so just to understand it, what is for the next year or two is really in your control, as you've trying to align more with industry on the pricing and the cost structure on the cost not the cost structure but it's more right now it is internal improvements that will drive the next year or two versus you are now relatively capturing what the market is giving to you on the pricing versus the corn side, is that a fair assessment?
donnie king -- president and chief executive officer
it's fair and largely accurate. the other thing i would add about that is in some of the more branded part of the portfolio. there is typically a lag between inflation and this point we're able to get pricing and we're looking constantly at ways to try to shorten that cycle with our customers. so think of that as being the differentiator there, but i would tell you much of what we have to do in the way we structured our model, executional excellence, and i call that out specifically in the script so will be top of mind to all of us across all businesses and functions at tyson.
ken zaslow -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
if i could squeeze in one more and then i'll leave it there.
donnie king -- president and chief executive officer
sure.
ken zaslow -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
when you put in the capital spending, that you're doing and i know we all have to think about 2022. but when we think about 2023, 2024. what do you think the returns on that would be and does that inhales either the stability of your model or the growth algorithm of your model as you are now deploying enough capital that it's almost an acquisition right, you're not actually making acquisition but you're putting enough capital there should be a return on that and may be something changes in 2023-2024 and i will leave it there and i appreciate your time.
donnie king -- president and chief executive officer
yes. i will start with that and stewart may want to add something to it, but the spend that we have the return on that invested capital, we certainly understand that we've had a few issues in delivering that over the past, but i will tell you that return on invested capital is a part of the entire leadership team score card. so, we are proving those dollars are spent against a demand that is known and a return that is known and so we feel very confident about the returns on those businesses and so we're not concerned about the fact that we're going to get a really good return on that investment. in fact, we think it's versus other options is a, is a much better return so, but it's still ours, we ultimately you still have to execute.
stewart f. glendinning -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes, ken, just a couple of things. so first of all, we're targeting double-digit returns and let us shape for you the guidance as we move forward so you get the timing of that right. but i mean we have strong returns here. in terms of the algorithm, it's going to do two things for us. first of all it's bringing some of the savings we're talking about in $300 million to $400 million. it is providing a better and safer workplace for our team members and let's not forget that there is going to be a considerable expansion of capacity here particularly in the international business on a percentage basis. so that is going to fuel that future growth. so we feel great about it. the numbers are big. but one thing about internal capex, you know exactly where you're putting the money, you know exactly what you're getting for it.
ken zaslow -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
great, i appreciate guys. take care.

good day and welcome to the tyson foods fourth quarter earnings conference call. [operator instructions]
i would now like to turn the conference over to megan britt, vice president of investor relations. please go ahead ma'am.
megan britt -- vice president of investor relations

please refer to our forward-looking statement disclaimers on slide 2 as well as our sec filings for additional information concerning risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our projections. please note that references to earnings per share, operating income and operating margin in our remarks are on an adjusted basis unless otherwise noted. for reconciliations on these non-gaap measures to their corresponding gaap measures, please refer to our earnings press release.
i'll now turn the call over to donnie.
donnie king -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, megan. i'll start by saying that the safety of our team members continue to be our top priority and i'm very pleased that we now have a team in the us that is fully vaccinated. as we focus on meeting the needs of our customers and consumers, vaccination is the best way that we can protect our team members from the impacts related to covid-19 and ensure business continuity.
earlier today, we reported strong fourth quarter and fiscal year 2021 results. we delivered double-digit sales and earnings growth in a challenging year. our performance was supported by continued strength in consumer demand for protein. our retail core business lines which include our iconic brands tyson, jimmy dean, hillshire farm and ball park have driven strong share growth in the retail channel delivering 13 quarters of consecutive growth. continued recovery in the foodservice channel led by qsrs also supported our strong results.
overall, we saw our volume recovery in the second half from the pandemic lows to finish the fiscal year only slightly down. we are taking several deliberate actions by segment to improve our volumes including investing behind capacities, brand and product innovation and our team members. our investments in team members include our successful vaccination mandate as well as automation and technology initiatives that i'll discuss in a moment. the construction of the 12 new plants that we've mentioned previously are progressing well and once complete will enable tyson to address capacity constraints and growing global demand for protein. these new capacities include nine chicken plants, two case-ready beef and pork plants and one new bacon plant.
in parallel to our actions to improve volume, we have also work to recover inflation through pricing, achieving a 13% price improvement for the fiscal year and a 24% increase for the fourth quarter. in this dynamic environment, we will be aggressive in monitoring inflation and driving price recovery activities. and the diversity of our portfolio showed its value again this quarter as demonstrated by earnings, performance in our beef segment supported the delivery of a strong fiscal year earnings results.
our performance has allowed us to build financial strength. our balance sheet is strong, resilient and provides tyson the optionality needed to pursue strategic growth priorities. and to that point, our investment in future growth across our portfolio continue. we demonstrated resilience in fiscal year 2021 and we are entering fiscal 2022 with tremendous momentum. our results demonstrate the dedication of our global team, the importance of our diverse portfolio strategy and our ability to meet consumer demand across proteins, channels and meal occasions.
now turning to financial results, let me give you some highlights overall. i was pleased with both a strong quarter and full year. sales improved 20% in the fourth quarter and 11% during the full year. our sales gains were largely driven by higher average sales price. average sales price trends reflect successful pricing strategies during the ongoing inflationary environment, but we still have opportunities specifically in prepared foods where we delivered softer results than anticipated. like many other companies, we were faced with a range of higher levels of inflation notably higher grains, labor, meat and transportation cost.
our teams have worked together with our customers to pass along that inflation through price increases. on volume, we saw improvement in the second half relative to the same period last year. volumes were up 3% for the second half or nearly 350 million pounds. although we are working diligently to achieve optimal throughput across our segments, labor challenges are still impacting our volumes and ability to achieve optimal mix across our processing footprint. having said that, we're taking aggressive active actions as a team to address labor constraints and we're seeing improvements. we delivered solid operating income performance, up 26% during the fourth quarter and 42% for the full year. this performance was largely due to strength in our beef segment where continued strong consumer demand and ample cattle supply have driven higher earnings. overall, our operating income performance translated to earnings per share of $2.30 for the fourth quarter, up 35% and $8.28 for the full year, up 53%.
looking at our results on volume, we are taking aggressive actions to optimize our existing footprint, add new capacity, adjust our product mix by plant and match our portfolio more closely with customer and consumer needs. for the fiscal year, our volume was down slightly. customer demand during the fiscal '21 outpaced our ability to supply products, but we're working aggressively to fill that void. we recognize how important service levels are to our customers and we're committed to improving our fill rates and reliability of supply.
with respect to supply, we have focused on ensuring our ability to maintain business continuity and our team has been resilient in the face of numerous supply chain challenges. as we look toward fiscal '22, improving volumes will be key to delivering against our commitments. we expect to grow our total company volumes by 2% to 3% next year, outpacing overall protein consumption growth. a large percentage of that growth will come from the chicken segment and across our business we're working to optimize our product portfolio, remove complexities, enhance capacities and pursue operational improvement initiatives to deliver against these volume growth objectives.
moving now to slide 6, we acknowledge the challenging and competitive labor environment and it is no secret that we want to be the most sought after place to work. we fully understand that this starts with an unrelenting focus on safety, every minute, every shift, every day. the health, safety and wellness of our team members has been and will continue to be our top priority. so i'd like to take a minute to stop and commend our team members and our leadership team for doing their part to keep themselves, their colleagues, their families and their community safe, which has helped us reach our vaccination goals. the vaccines and investments in covid-19 protection measures are certainly not the only actions that we've taken to become the most sought after place to work.
to ensure that every tyson team member feels as though they can bring their true and complete self to work each day, we've invested behind diversity, equity and inclusion efforts and we also understand the importance of a strong compensation offering and we believe that we hold a leadership position in this space. we have raised wages and across our business today, we pay an average of $24 per hour, which includes full medical, vision, dental and other benefits like access to retirement plan and sick pay, and we will continue to explore other innovative benefit offerings that remove barriers and make our team members lives easier.
we're also accelerating investments in automation and advanced technologies to make existing roll safer and easier while reducing cost. we're confident that our actions will increase tyson staffing levels and position us for volume growth. relating to operational excellence and market competitiveness, today we are announcing the launch of the new productivity program designed to drive a better, faster and more agile organization that is supported by culture of continuous improvement and faster decision-making.
the program is targeted to deliver $1 billion in recurring productivity savings by the end of fiscal '24 relative to fiscal '21 cost baseline. these savings are included in the guidance expectations that stewart will share in a moment. execution of the effort will be supported by our program management office that will ensure delivery of key project milestones and report on savings achievements connected to three imperatives.
the first is operational and functional excellence and is targeted to deliver greater than $300 million in recurring savings. this includes functional efficiency efforts in finance, hr and procurement that are focused on applying best practices to reduce cost. the second is digital solutions, which is targeted to deliver more than $250 million in recurring savings. we'll achieve this goal by leveraging new digital solutions like artificial intelligence and predictive analytics to drive efficiency and operations, supply chain, planning, logistics and warehousing. for example, we're using technology to ensure that our shipments are optimally loaded to say freight cost and enhance customer service levels.
in many ways the pandemic has already accelerated our push to more digital footing and our commitment in this space will continue that focus. the third is automation. we will leverage automation and robotics technologies to automate difficult and higher turnover positions. for example, we have substantial opportunity to automate the debone process within our poultry harvest facilities using the combination of both third-party and proprietary technologies.
chicken remains the top priority for me personally and for our company. we continue to execute against our roadmap to bring operating income margin to at least the 5% to 7% range on a run rate basis by mid fiscal '22. our goal has not changed and we remain committed to restoring top-tier performance. the first imperative is to be the most sought after place to work. i've outlined the investments we're making to enhance our team member experience in my earlier comments. this will ensure that we have the right levels of staffing to fulfill our customer orders on time and in full. the second imperative is to improve operational performance. critical to improving operational performance is maximizing our fixed cost leverage, which means having enough birds in our internal networks to run our plants full. by reconfiguring and optimizing our existing footprint, we can increase our harvest capacity by more than 10% without building another plant.
in addition, we have clear initiatives to remove complexity from our plant, reduce transportation and handling and minimize waste. our operational improvements will unlock significant unused capacity in our network and take advantage of the fixed cost leverage. each of these initiatives will support leading operational performance from our chicken business in the future. hatch rates have impacted our ability to do this and we've shared the initiatives underway to correct this. our new male rollout is progressing as planned and we believe we've hit the inflection point that will lead to sequential improvements through the entirety of fiscal 2022.
the new male rollout at our pellet [phonetic] farms is nearly complete and we continue to observe improved hatch rates associated with these new males. we've also mentioned how strengthened spot prices for commodity chicken products throughout the fiscal year has put our buy versus grow program at a relative disadvantage versus history. from q3 to q4, we again reduced our rate of outside purchases this time by nearly 30%. the final imperative is to service our customers on time and in full. tyson's branded value-added product offerings have continue to gain share during both the fourth quarter in the latest 52 weeks and new capacity expansions will help us maintain momentum.
inflation has clearly had an impact on the business. our commercial teams have successfully pursued inflation justified pricing delivering top line growth for the business to offset the cost increases. as rates of inflation continue, so with our pricing actions with an equivalent level of instances [phonetic] on disciplined operational execution and volume throughput. we will staff our plants, service our customers, grow volumes and be the best chicken business. the plan we have in place is still the right plan and our level of confidence, conviction and excitement as a team continue to grow.
looking forward to fiscal year 2022, i feel confident in our ability to drive value creation. we have strong consumer demand, a powerful and diverse portfolio across geographies and channels and the team that is positioned to take advantage of the opportunities in front of us. our priorities are clear, winning with customers and consumers, winning with team members and winning with excellence in execution. with these priorities as our guide, we are taking aggressive actions to accelerate our growth relative to the overall market, improve operating margins and drive strong returns on invested capital.
we are committed to our team members with a focus on ensuring their health, safety and well-being as well as ensuring an inclusive and equitable work environment, every shift, every day, every location with no exceptions. we have shown that we are willing to take bold actions in support of this commitment. second, we are working to enhance our portfolio and capacity to better serve demand. this includes increasing the contribution of branded and value-added sales by focusing our product portfolio and by adding capacity to meet demand. we expect our volume to outpace the market in the intermediate term. third, we are aggressively restoring competitiveness in our chicken segment. this starts by returning our operating margin to the 5% to 7% level by the middle of fiscal 2022.
fourth, we are driving operational and functional excellence and investing in digital and automation initiatives. this is at the heart of our new productivity program. we are working diligently to drive out waste, minimize bureaucracy, enhance decision making speed across the organization.
finally, to address expected demand growth over the next decade, we're using our financial strength to invest in our business through both organic investments and strategic m&a. on capital loan, we expect to invest $2 billion in fiscal year '22 with a disproportionate share focused on new capacity and automation objectives. tyson has the right portfolio, the consumer-driven insight and the scale and the capabilities to win in the marketplace across proteins, channels and meal occasions. we also have the financial strength to invest behind our business to accelerate growth and to maintain our momentum. i look forward to sharing with you our progress as we work through the year and i'll be sharing more details with you at our investor day in a few weeks.
i'll now turn the call over to stewart to walk us through our financial results in detail.
stewart f. glendinning -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thank you, donnie. let me turn first to a summary of our total company financial results. we're pleased to report a strong overall finish to the year. sales were up approximately 20% in the fourth quarter largely a function of our successful pricing initiatives that we've pursued to offset inflationary pressures. volumes were down 4% during the fourth quarter primarily due to labor challenges hampering our efforts to fully benefit from strong retail demand and recovery in foodservice. fourth quarter operating income of nearly $1.2 billion was up 26% due to continued strong performance in our beef business. for the full year, operating income improved to nearly $4.3 billion up 42%. driven by the strength in operating income, fourth quarter eps grew 35% to $2.30 with the full year up 53% to $8.28.
slide 11 bridges our total company sales for fiscal year '21. sales dollars were up across all segments as you can see the most substantial sales dollars benefit came from the beef segment which saw market conditions that led to a wider than historical cut out margin. at the same time, we sought price increases across the business to offset the high levels of inflation we faced. looking at our channel result, sales of retail drove over $1 billion of top line improvement versus last year even after exceptionally strong volumes in the comparable period. improvements in sales through the foodservice channel drove an increase of $1.6 billion and our fiscal year export sales were nearly $1 billion stronger than the prior year as we leveraged our global scale to grow our business.
slide 12, bridges year-to-date operating income which was about $1.3 billion higher than fiscal 2020. as i mentioned previously, volumes were down slightly during the year primarily result of a challenging labor environment. our pricing actions and strength in the beef segment led to approximately $5.6 billion of sales price mix benefit, which more than offset the higher cogs price-mix of $4.6 billion. we saw inflation across the business, notable areas where in wages, grain cost, live animal costs and pork, meat cost and prepared foods and freight costs across the enterprise.
incremental direct covid-19 costs were favorable by approximately $200 million during the year although our total spending at $335 million was still substantial. the decrease was driven primarily by cycling one time bonuses that were paid last year and a large portion of that was reinvested in permanent wage increases for our team members this year. lower one-time bonus costs were partially offset by higher testing and vaccination cost incurred during fiscal 2021. while these costs are expected to reduce in fiscal '22, we will continue to spend against initiatives to keep our team members safe. and finally, sg&a was over $100 million favorable to prior year, which was largely a result of a net benefit associated with the beef supplier fraud [phonetic].
now moving to the beef segment. segment sales were over $5 billion for the quarter, up 26% versus the same period last year. key sales drivers included strong domestic and export demand for beef products. offsetting higher sales prices were higher cattle costs, up more than 20% during the fourth quarter. we had ample livestock available in the quarter driven by strong front-end supplies and we have good visibility into cattle availability through fiscal '22 and currently believe it will also be sufficient to support our customer needs. sales volume for the quarter was up year-over-year due to continued strong demand in contrast to a soft comparable period a year ago driven by lower production volumes.
we delivered segment operating income of $1.1 billion or 22.9% for the fourth quarter. this improvement was driven by strong global demand for beef products and a higher cut-out which were partially offset by higher operating costs. while our beef segment experienced strong results during the quarter and fiscal year, we are still not at optimal levels of capacity throughput due to labor challenges, which we expect to normalize over the course of fiscal '22.
now, let's move on to the pork segment on slide 14. segment sales were over $1.6 billion for the quarter, up 30% versus the same period last year. key sales drivers for the segment included higher average sales price due to strong demand and increased hog costs, partially offset by a challenging labor environment. average sales price increased more than 40%, our volumes were down relative to the same period last year. segment operating income was $78 million for the quarter down 52% versus the comparable period. overall, operating margins for the segment declined to 4.7% for the quarter. the operating income decline was driven by higher hog costs and increased labor and freight costs.
moving now to prepared foods. sales were $2.3 billion for the quarter, up 7% relative to the same period last year. total volume was down 5.7% in the quarter with strength in the retail channel and continued recovery in food service more than offset by labor challenges. sales growth outpaced volume growth driven by inflation justified pricing and better sales mix. during the fourth quarter, retail core business lines experienced their 13th straight quarter of volume share growth driven by consumer demand for our brands and continued strong brand execution by our team. operating margins for the segment were 1.7% or $39 million for the fourth quarter. a slowdown in segment operating margins versus the same quarter last year was driven by significant increases in raw material input costs that we were not able to fully recover through price during the quarter.
for the full year, operating income margin was 7.6% or $672 million. as we mentioned last quarter, the ongoing inflationary environment created a meaningful headwind for prepared foods during the fourth quarter. raw material cost, logistics, ingredients, packaging, labor have increased our cost of production. we've executed pricing, revenue management and commercial spend optimization initiatives while ensuring the continued development of brand equity through marketing and trade support. we expect to take continued pricing actions to ensure that any inflationary cost increases that our business incurs are passed along. pricing has lagged inflation, but we expect to recover those cost increases during fiscal '22.
moving into the chicken segment's results. sales of $3.9 billion for the fourth quarter, up 21%. volumes improved 1.3% in the quarter as strong consumer demand offset both labor challenges and the detrimental impact of a fire at our hanceville rendering facility. our teams have been focused on streamlining our plans to deliver higher volumes and we expect to deliver substantial volume improvements in fiscal '22 as the hatch rate recovers and we operate our plants more efficiently. average sales price improved over 20% in the fourth quarter and 11.4% for the fiscal year, compared to the same periods last year. this increase is due to favorable product mix and price recovery to offset cost inflation. our pricing has admittedly lagged our realization of cost inflation, but we made tremendous progress in the last few months to close that gap and are now seeing those benefits. we have restructured our pricing strategies given our experience in fiscal '21 to ensure that we have the flexibility to better respond to market and inflationary conditions.
chicken experienced an operating loss of $113 million in the fourth quarter. the segment earned $24 million representing an operating margin of 0.2% for the fiscal year 2021. operating income was negatively impacted by $945 million of higher feed ingredient cost, grow-out expenses and outside meat purchases. for the fourth quarter, feed ingredients were $325 million higher than the same period last year. segment performance also reflects net derivative losses of $75 million during the fourth quarter, which was $120 million worse than the same period last year.
turning to slide 17. in pursuit of our priority to build financial strength and flexibility, we have substantially de-levered our business over the past 12 months, reducing leverage to 1.2 times net debt to adjusted ebitda as we paid down $2 billion of debt while growing our earnings and cash flow. investing organically in our business will continue to be an important priority and will help tyson increase production capacity and market capability. each of these levers will support strong return generation for our shareholders. we will also continue to explore positive -- optimize our portfolio through m&a through the lenses of value creation and shareholder return.
finally, as our track record has demonstrated, we are committed to returning cash to shareholders through both dividends and share buybacks. we're pleased to announce that last week our board approved $0.06 increase to our annual dividend payment now totaling $1.84 per class a share.
let's now discuss the fiscal '22 financial outlook. we currently anticipate total company sales between $49 billion and $51 billion which translates to sales growth of between 5% and 7%. we expect 2% to 3% volume growth on a year-over-year basis as we work to optimize our existing footprint and run our plants full. our new productivity initiative is expected to deliver $300 million to $400 million of savings during fiscal '22 driven by operational and functional excellence initiatives, the rollout of digital solutions across the enterprise and extensive automation projects that are currently underway.
now as we look at the organic growth opportunities ahead for our business, we expect a meaningful increase in capex spending to pursue a healthy pipeline of projects with strong return profiles. we currently anticipate capex spending of approximately $2 billion during fiscal '22, an increase of roughly $800 million. this investment will support our initiatives to meet global protein demand growth into the future, allow us to gain share and will deliver strong financial returns for our shareholders. excluding the impact of changes from potential tax legislation, we currently expect our adjusted tax rate to be around 23%. we anticipate net interest expense of approximately $380 million because of intentional deleveraging during fiscal '21.
liquidity is expected to significantly exceed our target, while net leverage is expected to remain well below 2 times net debt to adjusted ebitda. it is important to note though that over the last two years, working capital has been a source of cash. we don't expect this to be the case in fiscal '22. moving forward, our business growth will require increased working capital, which combined with deferred tax payments under the cares act taxes on the gain of the pet treats divestiture, litigation settlements and other discrete items will lead to a substantial use of cash during fiscal 2022.
now let's look at how each of our segments will contribute to that total company performance. prepared foods is expected to deliver margins during fiscal '22 of between 7% and 9%. we will remain disciplined and agile in our pricing initiatives to ensure that any additional inflationary pressures are passed along to customers, while also working diligently to deliver productivity savings to reduce costs. we expect the beef segment to continue to show strength due to prolonged industry dynamics leading to segment margins of between 9% and 11%. we expect the front half of the year to be meaningfully stronger than the back half as industry and labor conditions are expected to normalize part way through the year.
in chicken, our operational turnaround is working and we still expect to achieve run rate profitability of 5% to 7% by the middle of the year. we expect this will be achieved through sequential quarterly margin improvements during the first half of the year resulting in full year margins that fall between 5% to 7% although expected at the lower end of that range.
in pork, we expect similar performance during fiscal '22 to what we accomplished during fiscal '21 equating to a margin of between 5% and 7%. in international and other, we expect margins of 2% to 3% as capacity expansions and strong global demand support volume growth and improved profitability. our segments individually and in aggregate have clear and compelling role within tyson's portfolio strategy. they deliver diverse counter cyclical performance that supports the company's long-term earnings objectives and delivers strong value for shareholders.
i'll now turn the call back over to megan for q&a instructions. megan.

[operator instructions] and our first question will come from adam samuelson of goldman sachs. please go ahead.
adam samuelson -- goldman sachs -- analyst
yes. thank you. good morning, everyone. so i guess my first question, just maybe taking the quarter and the kind of updated kind of view of fiscal '22 kind of broadly.
can you help us frame kind of the areas where the margin expectations for the year have maybe incrementally inched up on a point estimate basis and some of the drivers? is that really reflecting the strong fiscal first quarter? is that a more constructive view of pricing and price cost balance over the balance of the year? just help us think about how your outlook has evolved relative to what you give -- given initially in november.
donnie king -- president and chief executive officer
ok. well, let me start off with and tell you that we really got off to a good start in q1. and there are a number of factors with q1 and what we saw in q1 and our optimism as we look to the balance of the year. we've adjusted a number of pricing mechanisms to be more variable in nature.
we've seen prior to elasticities, for example, in prepared foods being less or lower than what they have historically been, which is exciting there. we've been able to maintain volume in this inflationary environment. inflation, as we see it will continue -- is continuing to move up. we're really excited about our productivity program relative to the whole company.
we're anticipating $300 million, $400 million, and we're on track through q1 relative to that. just doing what we do better and we talk about becoming a more agile, faster decision-making organization. essentially, that's all about the process and being better, faster, and making decisions with greater speed at lower levels within the organization. but because of our vaccination position, we've now moved past the surge of the omicron spike, as we call it, which occurred predominantly in the first three weeks of january, and we're back to normal levels.
we think our vaccine mandate served us well and making that commitment and really making our team members' health and safety and their families and communities our highest priority has served us through the new variant. we've seen better absenteeism and turnover throughout the organization. we think labor will be available, will be much greater in the balance of the year. and we certainly have capacities coming online with head and harvest and chicken and further processing capabilities, value-added capabilities in prepared and chicken.
and we've got labor going back into beef and pork plants, and we'll be able to improve those mixes as well as increase the harvest capacity.
adam samuelson -- goldman sachs -- analyst
all right. all right. that color is really helpful. and i guess just a quick follow-up.
on capital allocation, you stepped up the buyback in the fiscal first quarter. it was something that was notably absent from the kind of multiyear view at the analyst day in december. and i was wondering if you could just help us think, stewart, maybe just cadence on buybacks going forward? should we think about it being more ratable, more opportunistic? just certainly have the balance sheet capacity to make it more ratable, but i'm just trying to think about how to bring that expectation going forward.
stewart glendinning -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes. look, thanks for that, adam. if you go back to investor day, we were really focused on being able to point to the strong growth story that sits in front of our tyson's future. and part of that was a pretty significant allocation of increased capital to capex spending and various capacity expansion.
so it was an intention to leave stock buyback to the end, but stock buybacks have been forecast n history, and they will be in the future. the one thing we've said is that we do look each year to try to buy back the dilution. and after that, it will be more opportunistic. but growth is a focus for our company.
adam samuelson -- goldman sachs -- analyst
ok. all right. that's all. very helpful.
i'll pass it on. thank you.
operator
the next question comes from peter galbo of bank of america. please go ahead.
peter galbo -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
hey, guys. good morning. thanks for taking the questions. i guess first question for donnie.
and i believe david is on the line as well. donnie, you've spoken in the past, and it's been helpful just on how buy versus grow gets put at a disadvantage, particularly when spot prices move, you've made some strides to lower kind of at meat purchases here on a sequential basis. but just in the month of january with where spot prices kind of moved, how should we think about that impact on chicken and on the overall turnaround maybe just in the short term here?
donnie king -- president and chief executive officer
ok, peter. i'll tell you. i'll start, and then i will let david make a few comments. but over the last year or so, we've been -- the recovery for our chicken business has been a priority.
specifically, as it relates to buy versus growth, the fact of the matter is, we became too dependent on the buy portion of the model. and we forgot to grow chicken, which hurt us from a capacity utilization perspective, and those additional pounds flowing through our business really impacted our fixed cost leverage. so we tilted too far on the buy portion of this. and over the last year, as we have been building the breeding stock and getting past the hatch issue that we talked about so much last year, we're now in a better position to get more head through our processing and harvest facilities and which will give us more breast meat at a much more attractive price point versus the buy in the marketplace right now.
we have not totally abandoned the buy portion and do not anticipate totally abandoning that, but there's a smaller percentage of our overall needs that we will go to the market to secure. but we're on plan with what we intended to do. and with that, david, why don't you add a little bit.
david bray -- group president, poultry
yes. i think -- peter, thank you for the question. i think one way also to look at this is we will buy outside meat to the extent it is the right financial decision. from our standpoint, we will continue to manage against what is right as whether buy versus grow.
but generally, outside meat purchases are going to be used to supplement what we're doing when it's the right financial decision. and as what donnie -- as donnie stated, volume is critical. it's one of the big levers of what we are going to accomplish in fy '22 to grow the animals ourselves into processes, and that will make us much more efficient.
peter galbo -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
got it. ok. and donnie, in both your comments, prepared remarks, and stewart, you both commented on restructuring the pricing strategy to be more variable in nature, particularly in chicken. i'm just curious, what percentage of that business now is tied to more of the spot market versus kind of where you had been historically? i think that would be just helpful for us as we think about how to think about the new business going forward.
david bray -- group president, poultry
yes. so i would tell you, within chicken specifically, i would tell you, we have restructured our pricing approach, and that's really in large part, thanks to our commercial organization as well as the great customer relationships that we have across both our retail and foodservice networks. i would tell you today, we are significantly more variable pricing versus fixed. and again, we're not even utilizing fixed rate within our conversations.
every contractor program that we have is either tied to grain, tied to market value and we will continue to use that. pricing was up significantly in chicken in the q1 time frame of over 20%, and a large part of that was because of the variable programs that we put in place.
operator
the next question comes from ken goldman of j.p. morgan. please go ahead.
ken goldman -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
hi. thank you so much. i wanted to ask, it's obviously extremely early and this could lead to nothing, but there have been a couple of cases of avian influenza, obviously not in the poultry industry. i'm just curious, are you seeing anything? are you doing anything on your part to take extra precautions against this? i think you're probably one of the most up-to-speed companies in the world in terms of already taking those precautions.
so maybe you're already there. i'm just trying to get a sense of what you see the industry doing and if there's been a lot of changes since the last time title came around.
david bray -- group president, poultry
yes. absolutely. thank you. and yes, the usda has reported that this high patent variant has only been found in the wild bird population.
and it's really been within the east coast of the united states. i would tell you more specifically to what tyson is doing versus what the industry is doing is, but we have a very robust biosecurity measures in place across all of our facilities, and that includes testing every flock for avian influenza. in addition, at tyson, we have heightened our biosecurity measures in all of our facilities on the east coast. some of those things that we've done are we're reducing number of trips that we're taking to farms.
we're actually taking extra time and doing more cleaning of our vehicles that do go to the farms, but we are ahead of this and have been watching it very closely.
donnie king -- president and chief executive officer
i would add to this that we are -- we have in our biosecurity programs, we have green, which is just normal business; yellow, orange, and red, which are progressive. on the east coast, as dave mentioned, we are in the orange category at this point. so a lot of attention and a lot of watching. i saw the case over the weekend in florida, which i think now is five states, which we have seen avian influenza.
ken goldman -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
ok. that is helpful. and then i wanted to also ask, you had you obviously still have a plant-based alternative business -- not obviously, the biggest part of your business at this point. but it was a little bit of an initiative for you a couple of years ago and still mentioned from time to time.
we've heard some of your competitors and peers out there talk about how demand has slowed for that part of the business. i'm just curious what your take is on the industry in general, how much of -- has your optimism waned at all for that? just want to get a sense of how you see that current balance between animal-based and alternative-based needs.
donnie king -- president and chief executive officer
sure. well, i mean, we're still in the plant-based protein business. we still like it. consumer demand continues to be good.
we've seen a lot more growth on the -- domestically in foodservice than retail of late. but across retail and foodservice, we continue to see growth. now that's off a very small base, as you might imagine. but we're continuing to see growth.
but for us, with our presence outside the united states, in europe and china, and also in southeast asia, we also have plant-based products in those markets that are doing really, really well also. so we're still excited about the plant-based business and when consumers prefer that, we want to have the opportunity to be able to provide that for them and are currently and are growing. and let me ask noelle if there's anything she'd like to add to that.
noelle omara -- group president, prepared foods
sure. just as a build, we want to be leaders across all the proteins that consumers seek. and we know that consumer interest in adoption is growing in this space. and we'll continue to be guided by the consumer needs and the opportunities and -- you see the raised & rooted products that we've launched domestically.
we continue to have opportunities internationally, and we'll continue to ensure that we are participating with consumer interest and adoption growth.
ken goldman -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
thank you so much.

the next question comes from ben theurer of barclays. please go ahead.
unknown speaker
good morning, and this is anthony hernandez on behalf of ben theurer. my question is regarding prepared foods, and you basically performed in line with guidance during this last quarter. the decrements, the long-term target of 10% to 12%. how do you see the potential in the purpose of pricing to recover margins within this year and also next fiscal year?
noelle omara -- group president, prepared foods
i can give you a bit of context to what we're currently seeing. so demand continues to be strong across both retail and foodservice driven by our strong equities in our diverse portfolio. and as you said, we're pleased with the market performance that we're seeing despite the price increases, which is really due to the strength of our brands and the strong partnership and relationships that we've built with our customers. elasticity has been less than the historical models that donnie has mentioned, but it's clearly something that we're watching closely.
and so we're constantly reviewing our pricing and revenue management strategies as the landscape changes, both continue to take thoughtful approaches on those critical levers. as you also heard in the comments, we're taking significant actions to transform our cost base and we're creating good momentum there. and so on the year, we continue to feel good about the 7% to 9% range that we've given, and we believe we have the right building blocks in place on our path to deliver sustainable double-digit margin.
unknown speaker
ok. thanks a lot.
operator
the next question comes from ken zaslow of bank of montreal. please go ahead.
ken zaslow -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
good morning. just two questions. one is automation. can you talk about the progress and what anecdotal evidence you've seen, how much has been actually done? and is it changing your yields? just some framework to the automation story would be helpful.
donnie king -- president and chief executive officer
well, automation is -- i've talked about it in a great deal in our productivity program, i talked about at investor day, that we anticipate over the next three years as that be worth about $450 million to us. so we're spending significant amounts of capital on that. stewart talked about in his opening remarks about the $2 billion of capex for capacity. but a great deal of the money is being spent is on automation and technology that we are deploying.
i would tell you, in our q1, we are on track. we had a number of different projects, and we've moved from a -- have really moved from a project to project to more of a programmatic approach where we attack common things across our production footprint, for example, could be deboning across all chicken, could be like palletizing, for example, an automation that's available there across the entire enterprise, material handling-type things, but all of these are in terms of priority or the more difficult, harder to staff jobs. and so i would tell you, in short, we are on track. we will deliver $300 million to $400 million in productivity savings, and some of that is coming from the automation piece.
to the best of my knowledge, we've not disclosed how much is coming from each sector, but we're moving as quickly as humanly possible, as quickly as the supply chain will allow us to get new pieces of equipment, and so forth.
ken zaslow -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
great. my second question is on hatchability. we haven't really seen it in the data -- on the public data, but you're saying that you're moving faster than you've expected on the hatchability. can you talk about what you're actually seeing in your operation? and when do you think it will actually translate to the numbers in the publicly available data? and just kind of give us a little bit of what you've actually done to move that hatchability up to where you are actually ahead of schedule? and i guess --
david bray -- group president, poultry
absolutely, ken. thank you. i think first and foremost, we do need to say that we are ahead of what we had expected from a q1 standpoint related to our overall hatch. i'll also share with you that -- and again, this is everything specific to tyson.
i mean really i won't speak to and cannot speak to what's happening within the industry. we understand we ended fy '22 with a growth mindset. we really demonstrated that within q1 where we grew our volumes 3.6%. as we enter '21, i can tell you, we are up in egg sets.
we are up in both chicks placed as well as overall breeder production. our plan is to continue to grow like we did for the -- in q1 for the balance of '22. our hatch is a critical component to that.
donnie king -- president and chief executive officer
i would add this piece of context to that, ken, that in '22, we have this -- we've -- where we intersect in publicly benchmark data. we have crossed that line with competitors, the industry at large with our hatch.
ken zaslow -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
that's great. thank you very much.
operator
the next question comes from ben bienvenu of stephens. please go ahead.
ben bienvenu -- stephens inc. -- analyst
hey. thanks, and good morning, everybody. so i want to ask, in your presentation that you issued concurrent with the results this morning, you noted on the pork business that there's a continued opportunity around mix, i hope that you could elaborate a little bit on that. and then also to the extent that you think about that as a component of your chicken business, i know repricing contracts, hatchability, and plant productivity are all kind of the highlight items associated with improving that business.
where does mix stand and the opportunity to margin up the chicken business?
donnie king -- president and chief executive officer
ok. let me start broadly, and then i will let shane speak a few details around pork and there are similarities with that. but for example, in the pork business, the labor availability in pork and chicken has been the single biggest challenge that we've had over the last two years in the pandemic. capacity utilization has been better in pork than it has been in chicken.
labor and capacity utilization is continuing, it has been good in pork and continues to get better. the thing that has hurt us to some degree on both pork and chicken is mix or capturing some things like of harvest in chicken or pause or similar specialty products in pork. we've just not been able to fully optimize that. for example, in pork, maybe the inability to debone a ham versus selling a whole ham.
and those are the type of things. but as we enter '22 in both businesses, we're in a much better position in terms of labor improving, and we still have some ways to go, but we see improving mix and capacity utilization across all businesses. and i'll let shane speak to -- maybe do a few more things in pork.
shane miller -- group president, fresh meat
yes. thanks, donnie, and you hit on most of it there. but i think the other thing to add to this, too, is as we think globally here, tyson is a global company and we're servicing a lot of companies and countries across the globe. and the key to this is being able to balance that with our domestic business and looking at what we have from a throughput and a labor perspective.
so labor has been a challenge. we'll get in the animals through the facility, but it's the further processing we're doing on the back end of the plant that's been a bit of a challenge. so staying focused on optimizing our labor usage and maximizing throughput and contribution when we look at it on a labor per man-hour basis has been the key.
ben bienvenu -- stephens inc. -- analyst
ok. that's great. and then my second question is related to export demand. you called out in the presentation as well around beef that port congestion and labor shortages impacted the business.
export demand has been exceptionally strong for beef in particular. i'm curious about your outlook for this year for continued export demand? and then for chicken, i know that there's a mix challenge that perhaps weighed on leg quarters domestically. but with this very strong crude backdrop, i would think that would also benefit export demand for domestic leg quarters. so can you talk a little bit about exports and your outlook for that across all the businesses for the balance of the year?
shane miller -- group president, fresh meat
yes. so i'll take the beef question. so the u.s. is a leader in global beef production, and it's centered around our superior taste and quality.
and the producers that we're partnering with in this country are doing a phenomenal job of bringing quality to the marketplace. so global consumers are increasingly preferring u.s.-produced beef, and we're seeing stronger global demand as a result of that. port congestion on the west coast, as you mentioned, has been an issue, and it's impacting not only the short-term international demand but also fulfillment on orders that have taken prior to this. and that's really what we've been focused on is implemented strategies and options to not only diversify shipping ports, but also to mitigate our risk as we go forward.
but we continue to see very good interest coming out of asia, especially for our high-quality yield and beef. and a good example around that is china. china has become the no. 3 destination for u.s.
beef. and tyson has a competitive advantage with not only our direct business, but our international business unit that we have in in-country there in china. so significant resources in country, a lot of customers demand in beef, and we feel real good about 2022 and going forward.
david bray -- group president, poultry
to answer your question relative to what we're seeing within poultry, very similar to his comments that shane was making about the demand remains extremely strong. and i would tell you that it's really not a demand and price are really not the issue. we're dealing with the same port congestion in the poultry organization. but that really underscores the need for us as an organization to make sure that we are upgrading our mix and to utilize those in domestic use.
a lot of work being done right now relative to leg orders and cutting those of the drum and thighs and using them within alternate channels domestically. we are targeting both deli and foodservice for some of those opportunities.
donnie king -- president and chief executive officer
let me add one comment to this, that i try to remind everyone. in addition to all the things that both shane and david have said, i would remind us of the one tyson approach, which is our international business unit that we have in china. and with leg quarters and pork and beef products and prepared foods product as well. when we export those commodity-based products outside the united states, in many cases today -- or in most cases today, we take them in and further process chicken leg quarters and the like into value-added branded products into china in an approach we call one tyson.
and then we're able to sell it and capture an additional margin on top of all that, eliminating a number of activities and hands touched in the middle of the process. so i'll leave it at that.

donnie king -- president and chief executive officer
all right. thank you.
operator
the next question comes from rob moskow of credit suisse. please go ahead.
rob moskow -- credit suisse -- analyst
hi. i have a couple of questions. one, i think easy to answer and maybe one that's not so easy. so i'll start with the first.
you talked about being able to get fair value for transportation surcharges. a lot of your branded food peers can't seem to recoup those charges. so why is yours different? is it easier in fresh meat than it is in branded foods to charge the customer for that surcharge? and then i'll wait and ask another one.
donnie king -- president and chief executive officer
let me start with that one. let me start with simply saying that freight costs are up 32% for us. i talked about some of the technology we use to -- in my opening remarks, where we would intersect between our private fleet, contract fleet outside carriers and try to optimize how we do that. and we've seen a lot -- we've had a lot of success.
it took a lot of the inflation happened so rapidly. it took a bit to get on top of that. but thus far, we have been successful in being able to get the transportation and we've asked our customers to pay us for that and pay us for freight, and we've been successful in doing so.
rob moskow -- credit suisse -- analyst
so is it -- go ahead.
donnie king -- president and chief executive officer
-- not able to do that.
rob moskow -- credit suisse -- analyst
so is it easier in one part of the business than it is in another part of the business, like easier in fresh and not so easy in branded?
donnie king -- president and chief executive officer
not -- as i look around the room and all those leading the businesses, i don't think if you're a branded portfolio versus a more commodity-oriented business, i don't think that really matters. what we tried to do with our customers is say, freight is freight and the price of the product and the price of the product, and we don't -- we try not to blend the two. and so i don't -- i wouldn't say one is any easier than the other. but i think the fact of the matter is what -- this freight being up 32%, that's what it cost to get the product moved and delivered to a customer, and we're asking our customers to pay for that.
anything to add?
shane miller -- group president, fresh meat
yes. i was going to say -- this is shane. the only thing i'd add on to that is if you think of it regionally, too, there are certain markets that are a little more difficult to shift into versus others. so you got to think about backhauls and what your cost mechanism is going to be to recover that, too.
so that would be the only other component i'd add on to what donnie said.
rob moskow -- credit suisse -- analyst
ok. great. here's the second question. the industry has been dealing with a labor shortage for a long time.
it's unclear when it's going to get better. in the past, i remember hearing that tyson and others have found pockets of international immigrants, communities to source, to improve their labor utilization in certain facilities. is that -- is your access to international immigrants compromised in the current environment, more so than it has in the past? and is there something that the industry can do to gain access to more people from international locations in a legal fashion?
donnie king -- president and chief executive officer
well, you're right. labor has been a challenge for a bit now. we looked at this in terms of trying to solve for tyson. and our approach has been to try to create a better place for people to work, a better work experience with less turnover and less absenteeism with just keeping team members safe.
in our first quarter, we paid $50 million in bonuses to our team members for no reason other than to say thank you for choosing tyson. thank you for being on our team. and we've had to do a number of things like piloting child care and subsidized child care, onsite clinics. and we've also are investing with our strong balance sheet heavily in terms of automation to take away some of those more difficult jobs.
now our workforce, to be clear, is made up of a number of different immigrants and people from all over the world in different nationalities and so we've benefited through the years like many others have of having such a diverse workforce. and so we continue to pursue those things like afghan refugees. we tried to be available with -- and working with the government in terms of having availability and we've worked with communities in terms of trying to build or define housing to support that, to make it easier. i mean, we're doing all kinds of things along that line to be able to make it easy to do business with tyson, easy to go to work for tyson and do it all the right way.
and so that's been our approach. i know of no magic or no pool of people anywhere that we are targeting to try to take care of the labor situation. we're trying to solve it by doing a number of things to make us a better place to work.
rob moskow -- credit suisse -- analyst

the next question comes from michael lavery of piper sandler. please go ahead.
michael lavery -- piper sandler -- analyst
good morning. thank you.
donnie king -- president and chief executive officer
good morning, michael.
michael lavery -- piper sandler -- analyst
you touched on elasticities a little bit, and i realize they've held up quite well. we've heard that from a lot of companies. but just curious how you think about some of your assumptions for that going forward? and especially just with pricing up as strongly as it is, that's a few multiples of what wage growth looks like. so just curious what your planning assumptions are for how that unfolds over the rest of the year? and maybe a little bit color by segment, if you can.
donnie king -- president and chief executive officer
noelle? would you like to start with that?
noelle omara -- group president, prepared foods
sure. so as i mentioned, we're constantly reviewing pricing and revenue management strategies, and it is a dynamic environment. and as the environment continues to evolve, we'll be very thoughtful about our approaches. pricing is just one of the levers in our toolkit.
we look at productivity and cost opportunities and other levers to ensure that we have all the pieces coming together to best grow our brands and create business continuity and profitability. and so maybe the other aspects that i would point to is that we have a broad and diverse portfolio with a range of price points to ensure that we have offerings that meet a variety of consumer needs and price pack architecture also becomes critical in these inflationary times, and you see that focus for us across the business.
donnie king -- president and chief executive officer
yes. i would add this to what noelle said, we have seen a lot of inflation. but i would remind you that cost of food in the u.s., while it is higher, is still very attractive relative to the balance of the world. labor costs have been up 20%, cattle costs are up -- have been -- they're up 22%.
grain has been up 29%. this year in freight, i mentioned earlier, is up 32%. we're not asking customers or the consumer ultimately to pay for our inefficiencies. we're asking them to pay for inflation.
and the rest of what we do is we try to find ways to be more productive, to lower cost and increase throughputs, and so forth. and we feel good about our ability to do a lot of that while serving our customers.
michael lavery -- piper sandler -- analyst
the inflation headwinds are obviously clear and certainly a driver of the pricing. but just maybe expect some of your assumptions on the elasticities. maybe, at a very high level, do you assume they revert to more normal levels or that they can hold at sort of what we're seeing currently?
donnie king -- president and chief executive officer
they are where they are right now. and i know that's not a very good answer. i mean there is a price point where it could be impactful. but at tyson, we play across the spectrum from the most value-added products to the most commodity of commodity products and we meet the consumer wherever they are on the value chain.
and so we intend to continue to grow our business and serve those consumers wherever they are.
michael lavery -- piper sandler -- analyst
ok. great. and i just want to follow up on the chicken pricing and understand some of the flexibility that you've implemented. and maybe just understand if it's meant to allow for more upside or if it drives more volatility.
is it flexible in both directions? or does it have any sort of floors that just mostly allow for easier increases?
stewart glendinning -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
absolutely. thank very much. and again, there's flexibility both going up and there's flexibility going down. our partners in both retail and food stores understand what those metrics are.
and we will go up and we will go down based on how we put our programs together. but the biggest piece of it is the fact that it is much more variable today than it has been at any point in time.

good morning, and welcome to the tyson foods first quarter 2022 earnings conference call. [operator instructions] please note this event is being recorded. i would now like to turn the conference over to megan britt, vice president of investor relations. please go ahead.
megan britt -- vice president of investor relations

during this call, we'll make forward-looking statements regarding our expectations for the future. these statements are subject to risks, uncertainties, and assumptions, which may cause actual results to differ materially from our current projections. please refer to our forward-looking statement disclaimers on slide 2 as well as our sec filings for additional information concerning risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our projections. please note that references to earnings per share, operating income and operating margin in our remarks are on an adjusted basis unless otherwise noted.
for reconciliations of these non-gaap measures to their corresponding gaap measures, please refer to our earnings press release. i'll now turn the call over to donnie. 
donnie king -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, megan, and thank you to everyone for joining us for the call today. earlier today, we announced our first quarter fiscal 2022 results. tyson foods once again delivered strong financial results. i would like to start by thanking our team members for their dedication to herculean efforts this quarter as we managed a complex and dynamic operating environment.
at our investor day, i shared our plan to grow our top and bottom lines aggressively over the next three years. this meant eps growth of high single digits relative to a 2019 baseline and volume growth ahead of the market. our results this quarter put us firmly on that path. we achieved double-digit sales and earnings growth, both of which were driven by ongoing demand strength, productivity savings, and improving execution across our segments.
our diverse protein portfolio, omnichannel capabilities, leading brands, and value-added products contributed to our results. strong performance in our beef segment, earlier-than-expected recovery in prepared foods, and improvement in chicken and pork all supported strong earning results. our retail core business lines, which include our iconic brands, tyson, jimmy dean, hillshire farm, and ball park maintain their volume share position even as we work through price increases to address inflationary pressure. and our foodservice focus 6 product lines grew share year over year in broad-line distribution.
this growth was driven in large part by value-added chicken, which outperformed industry recovery and breakfast sausage where we were seeing improved fill rates. importantly, and despite the continued impact of covid-19, our volumes improved slightly across the company relative to the same quarter last year. chicken was a bright spot, where we saw our volumes improved 3.6%. while this is a good start, we are not where we want to be on volume.
so we're taking actions segment by segment to improve our volume performance. these actions include investing in our team members, in additional capacity, and in brands and product innovation. as discussed at investor day, we are also in the process of building 12 new plants. each of these is progressing and each will enable tyson to address capacity constraints and meet the growing global demand for protein.
bottom line, we're committed to improving our total company volumes during the year. we're also making sure that our pricing incorporates inflationary cost pressures on our business. in the quarter, our cost of goods sold was up 18% relative to the same period last year. we are seeing higher costs across our supply chain, including higher input costs, such as feed and ingredients.
we're also managing the higher cost of labor, transportation due to strong demand and limited availability. with these higher costs, we work closely with our customers to achieve a fair value for our products. as a result, our average sales price for the quarter increased 19.6% relative to the same period last year. this helped us capture some of the unrecovered costs due to the timing lag between inflation and price.
finally, our balance sheet and overall liquidity position are strong, providing optionality to pursue strategic growth priorities and invest in growth across our portfolio. we have a disciplined approach to deploying capital to support capacity expansion while achieving improved returns on invested capital. our first-quarter results clearly demonstrate that we are making progress on our growth objectives, that we remain focused on outpacing the overall market, improving operating margins, and driving strong returns for our shareholders. while we're growing our business, we are mindful of our corporate responsibilities around environment, social, and governance goals.
for example, we committed to investing in and supporting our communities in rural america and around the world. last year, tyson foods donated more than 16 million pounds of protein, the equivalent of 64 million meals to fight hunger. we're incredibly proud of this work and the people that make it possible. tyson is a great company with a great team doing great things, and i'm pleased that this was recognized just last week by fortune magazine, who announced that for the sixth year in a row, tyson foods was no.
1 in our sector in their rankings of the world's most admired companies. now let's look at a few financial highlights from the first quarter. our results included double-digit top and bottom-line growth. we delivered solid operating income performance, up 40% for the quarter.
this performance was broad-based across segments where continued strong consumer demand and effective pricing to mitigate the impact of inflation drove higher earnings. on volume, we are up slightly. and while we're working to achieve optimal throughput across our segments, labor challenges are still impacting our volumes and the ability to achieve optimal mix across our network. compared to pre-pandemic levels, our volume performance is outpacing our peer set.
in retail, despite substantial market pressures, core business lines held share in the first quarter, led by strong performance in lunch meat, hotdogs, snacking, and bacon. we also realized strong e-commerce results with tyson foods outpacing total food and beverage growth in our core lines gaining share in the quarter. still, customer demand continues to outpace our ability to supply products. so we have targeted actions in each segment to improve volumes.
this is key to delivering on our commitments. to realize our volume goals, we must be able to fully staff our plants across the company. we continue to take meaningful action toward becoming the most sought-after place to work. for example, we provided our hourly team members with more than $50 million in bonuses during the first quarter.
we are piloting subsidized and on-site child care and we are adjusting schedules to flex with workforce needs. these actions are bearing fruit as we see some improvement on the labor front. and while we have seen some labor challenges during the omicron surge, we are generally seeing lower turnover in absenteeism. we saw chicken volumes grow 3.6% in the quarter, driven by strong fundamental demand and improved live production.
what is important to note is that we grew ahead of the market and gained market share. in prepared foods, volumes were down 2.6% in the first quarter. about half of the decline was related to pet treats divestiture. we expect to sequentially improve these results over the remainder of fiscal year '22 as we take actions to expand and improve capacity utilization.
in beef, volumes were down 6.2%, driven by labor shortages previously mentioned. in addition, port congestion has also dipped in export volumes in the segment. we expect these headwinds on volume to normalize over the course of fiscal 2022. in pork, we have sequentially improved our capacity utilization.
we are still working to optimize the mix. in international/other, while we are starting from a relatively small base, our investment in capacity, innovation, and brands are supporting our market share growth objective. overall, we expect to grow our total company volumes by 2% to 3% in fy '22, outpacing protein consumption growth. chicken remains a top priority and we continue to execute against our road map to achieve an operating income margin of 5% to 7% on a run-rate basis by mid-fiscal '22.
i remain confident we will meet this goal. in the first quarter, we've started to see profitability improvement resulting from our actions. for example, we're investing aggressively in automation and technology to help us address some of the most hard-to-fill roles. this is not a series of projects but is a well-planned program with automation designed to use common designs and equipment across our plants to optimize cost, maintenance, and asset utilization.
the second imperative is to improve operational performance and critical to improving performance is maximizing our fixed cost leverage, which means having enough furs to run our plants full. since september, we've seen an improvement in our hatch rate ahead of our expectations. we continue to expect full recovery in this year. we were pleased with our volume growth in the quarter and expect further improvements as we grow our harvest capacity utilization from an average of 37 million head per week in fy '21 to 40 million head per week by year end.
we've noted previously that strength in spot prices for commodity chicken products put our buy versus grow program at a relative disadvantage. we have reduced our reliance on outside meat accordingly. we will staff our plants, service our customers, grow our volumes and be the best in the business. the plan we have continues to be the right plan and our commitment to winning with our team members, winning with our customers and consumers, and winning with operational excellence is delivering results.
last year, we announced the launch of a new productivity program designed to drive a better, faster, more agile organization that is supported by a culture of continuous improvement and faster decision-making. the program aims to deliver $1 billion in recurring productivity savings by the end of fiscal '24 relative to a fiscal 2021 cost baseline and has three critical focus areas, which are operational and functional excellence, digital solutions, and automation. we're making some good progress on this front. i spoke just a minute ago about our investments in automation, but we've also attacked other issues.
in prepared foods, we're making use of supply chain, digitization, and advanced analytics. our digital manufacturing platform allows us to analyze real-time data to take actions to optimize process conditions that drive better yields, lower costs, consistent quality, and increased output. in transportation and logistics, we have established ongoing optimization of the mix and allocation of our private fleet, dedicated fleet, and third-party fleet, mitigating inflationary pressures and supporting better on-time deliveries to our customers. in addition, we continued the expansion of our direct shipment program, reducing miles driven, and product touches in our supply chain.
as a result of projects like these, we're on track to deliver $300 million to $400 million of savings in fiscal 2022. we shared at our investor day that we are taking actions to accelerate our growth and drive disciplined return on invested capital. the five imperatives on this slide show how we will achieve our commitments and drive value creation. this starts first with our commitment to our team members with a focus on ensuring their health, safety, and well-being as well as ensuring an inclusive and equitable work environment.
we are proud of our covid-19 vaccine policy implemented last year in the u.s. and of the broader investments that we have made to keep our team members, their families, and our communities safe. because of our policy, our team members are better protected and the cases we do see have been mild or asymptomatic, resulting in an extremely low number of hospitalizations. we are strongly encouraging boosters and are hosting clinics to make it easier for our team members and their families to get boosted.
second, we are working to enhance our portfolio and capacity to better address demand. this includes increasing the contribution of branded and value-added sales. as a result, we expect our volume to outpace this growing market. third, we are aggressively restoring competitiveness in our chicken segment.
this starts by returning our operating margin to the 5% to 7% level by the middle of fiscal 2022. fourth, we're driving operational and functional excellence and investing in digital and automation initiatives. this is at the heart of our new productivity program. we're working diligently to drive out waste, minimize bureaucracy and enhance decision-making speed across the organization.
fifth, to address projected demand growth over the next decade, we are using our financial strength to invest in our business. on capital alone, we're expected to invest $2 billion in fiscal year '22 with a disproportionate share focused on new capacity and automation objectives. and we continue to return cash to shareholders. during the quarter, we returned over $500 million in dividends and share repurchases.
to wrap it up, we are committed to winning with our team members, customers, and consumers as well as winning with operational excellence. i'm more excited about the future of tyson foods with each passing day. and i will now turn the call over to stewart to walk us through our financial results in detail.
stewart glendinning -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thank you, donnie. let me turn first to a summary of our total company financial results. we're pleased to report a strong overall start to the year. our sales were up approximately 24% in the first quarter, largely a function of our pricing initiatives to offset inflationary pressures.
volumes were also up slightly, although impacted by continued labor challenges. looking at our sales results by channel, retail drove almost $350 million of top-line improvements versus last year. improvements in sales through the foodservice channel drove an increase of $1 billion and our export sales were nearly $333 million stronger than the prior-year period as we leveraged our global scale to grow our business. first-quarter operating income of $1.4 billion was up 40% relative to the same quarter last year due to increased earnings in beef, pork, and chicken.
driven by the strength in operating income, first-quarter earnings per share grew 48% to $2.87. higher operating income led to higher adjusted earnings per share compared to the same period last year. and first-quarter eps also benefited from lower net interest expense and taxes. slide 10 bridges year-to-date operating income, which was $407 million higher than fiscal 2021.
volumes were up slightly during the year, primarily a result of improvement in chicken, pork, and international/other, offset by declines in beef and prepared foods. declines in beef and prepared foods were largely due to continued labor challenges in those segments. our pricing actions led to approximately $2.1 billion in sales and price/mix benefits during the quarter. which offset the higher cost of goods sold of $1.6 billion.
we saw continued inflation across the business, in some instances, up 20% to 30%. notable examples were labor, grain costs, live cattle and hog costs, and freight costs. and finally, sg&a was $88 million unfavorable to the same period last year, which was largely a result of cycling a $55 million benefit recorded last year for the recovery of cattle. moving to the beef segment.
segment sales were more than $5 billion for the quarter, up 25% versus the same period last year. sales growth was driven by continued strong demand for beef products, which has supported higher average sales price. partially offsetting higher sales prices were higher capital costs during the first quarter versus the comparable prior-year period. we had sufficient livestock available in the quarter driven by strong front-end supplies.
we have good visibility into cattle availability through fiscal year 2022 and continue to expect it will also be sufficient to support our customer needs. we delivered segment operating income of $956 million, up 81% versus the prior comparable period. this improvement was driven by strong global demand for beef products and a higher cutout, which were partially offset by higher operating costs. our operating margin of 19.1% was notably higher than the same quarter last year but was down on a sequential basis versus the last two quarters as cost increases led to a narrowing of the spread.
now let's move on to the pork segment on slide 12. segment sales were over $1.6 billion for the quarter, up 13% versus the same period last year. key sales drivers for the segment included higher average sales price due to strong demand and increased hog costs, partially offset by a challenging labor environment. average sales price increased 12.8% and volumes were slightly higher relative to the same period last year.
segment operating income was $164 million for the quarter, up 41% versus the comparable period. overall, operating margins for the segment improved to 10.1% for the quarter. the operating income improvement was driven by higher spreads in the business. moving now to prepared foods.
sales were $2.3 billion for the quarter, up 10% relative to the same period last year. total volume was down in the quarter with strength in the retail channel and continued recovery in foodservice more than offset by labor and supply chain challenges. sales growth outpaced volume growth driven by inflation-justified pricing. during the quarter, retail core business mines maintained share, driven by consumer demand for our brands and continued strong execution by our team.
operating margins for the segment were 8% or $186 million for the first quarter. the decline in segment operating margins versus the same quarter last year was driven by significant increases in raw material and other input costs that we were not able to fully recover through price during the quarter. raw material costs, logistics, ingredients, packaging, and labor have increased our cost of production. our pricing lagged inflation, but we expect to recover cost increases during fiscal 2022.
in addition to pricing, we've executed productivity, revenue management, and commercial spend optimization initiatives while ensuring the continued development of brand equity through marketing and trade support. moving into the chicken segment's results. sales were $3.9 billion for the quarter, up 37%. volumes improved 3.6% in the quarter due to strong consumer demand and increased life production.
our teams have been focused on streamlining our plants to deliver higher volumes and we expect to deliver substantial volume improvements in fiscal 2022 as hatch recovers, and we continue to look for ways to operate our plant more efficiently. average sales price improved around 20% in the first quarter compared to the same period last year. this increase is due to favorable product mix and price recovery to offset cost inflation. on pricing, we made tremendous progress toward driving our pricing mechanisms toward more variable structures and are now seeing those benefits.
we restructured our pricing strategies given our experience in fiscal 2021 to ensure that we have the flexibility to better respond to market and inflationary conditions. chicken delivered adjusted operating income of $117 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2022, representing an operating margin of 3%. operating income in the quarter was negatively impacted by $185 million of higher feed ingredient costs. now turning to slide 15.
as part of our capital allocation approach, we focused on building financial strength, investing in our business, and returning cash to shareholders. in pursuit of our priority to build financial strength and flexibility, we used improved earnings to retire debt in fiscal year 2021 and expect to do the same this year. continued strength in our earnings this quarter have further improved our leverage ratio to 1.1 times net debt to adjusted ebitda. investing in our business for both organic and inorganic growth will continue to be an important priority and will help tyson increase production capacity and market capabilities.
this will support strong return generation for our shareholders. finally, as our track record has demonstrated, we are committed to returning cash to shareholders through both dividends and share buybacks. we finished the quarter with a powerful balance sheet and continued capital allocation optionality. let's now discuss the fiscal '22 financial outlook.
we are maintaining our total company sales guidance of $49 billion to $51 billion, although we expect to perform at the upper end of the range. in support of our sales growth, we still expect a 2% to 3% volume growth on a year-over-year basis as we work to optimize our existing footprint and run our plants full. looking at aoi margin target ranges for our segments, in chicken, our operational turnaround is working and we still expect to achieve a run rate profitability of 5% to 7% by the middle of the year. we expect full-year margins that also fall between 5% to 7%.
prepared foods is expected to deliver margins during fiscal '22 of between 7% and 9%. based on our first-quarter performance, we now expect the full-year margin performance in prepared foods to be at the upper end of the range. in beef, we are maintaining our aoi margin at 9% to 11%, but we expect to perform at the upper end of the range. also, we expect the front half of the year to be meaningfully stronger than the back half as industry and labor conditions are expected to normalize partway through the year.
in pork, we expect similar performance during fiscal '22 to what we accomplished during fiscal '21, equating to a margin of between 5% and 7%. as is normal seasonality for pork, we expect the first quarter to be the strongest. in international/other, we expect margins of 2% to 3% as capacity expansions and strong global demand support volume growth and improved profitability. consistent with our expectation for a meaningful increase in capex spending to pursue a healthy pipeline of projects with strong return profiles, we anticipate capex spending of approximately $2 billion during fiscal 2022.
we now expect lower net interest expense due to lower anticipated average debt balances during the fiscal year. our expectations for productivity savings and tax rate changes remain unchanged. our net leverage is expected to remain well below two times net debt-to-adjusted ebitda, providing optionality for inorganic investment and additional return of cash to shareholders over the course of the year. in summary, we've had a strong start to the fiscal year.
we have a great team, growing demand for our products, strong portfolio diversity, and the differentiated asset footprint needed to win in the marketplace. we set out ambitious calls at our investor day, and we expect to achieve them. i'll now turn the call back over to megan for q&a instructions. megan?

yeah. good morning and thank you very much for taking the questions. the first one i wanted to kind of understand a little bit your commentary around the chicken segment and obviously, the -- on one side, improvements you have within your operations, but then at the same time, there seems to be a few headwinds arising on the industry side. so help us frame a little bit into the final quarter, but also maybe bridging into next year, how you think about the chicken segment? and what's your competitive advantage on the pricing side and how you think your investments into labor, better hedge ability, as well as better pricing, is going to basically bring you to that 5% to 7% range, which you're almost there already on a year-to-date basis, but how should we think about next year? thank you.
donnie king -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, ben, for that question. the turnaround that we've talked about for the last year now continues. and i'm pleased with the progress that we've made and said that in the script. we still have work to do, grain, and the volatility around grain, supply, demand, so forth, still exists out there.
but the demand for chicken is extremely strong. demand for ready-to-eat chicken, for example, is very strong. and we're at capacity as it relates to that. we are investing and have a new asset coming online early next year, and that will obviously be a help.
but the business did grow. and there's a lot of noise in this particular quarter around the hanceville fire in q4 of '21 that we'll work through. but the thing i want you to hear is that our harvest rates continue to improve, and there will be over -- there'll be $40 million or so in q4, and it will continue to grow from there. but i want to stop and pause at that point, and i'm going to pass it to david bray, and david, if you'd like to add some more color.
david bray -- group president, poultry
yeah. good morning, ben. just a little bit of additional color to that. and i think it's important to note that we're doing what we said we would do in chicken.
and we are progressing, but we are far from finished. and we know where our opportunities exist. and a large part of that will be uncovered as we can see that our volume grow through the q4 time frame. the ability for us to process more head through our facilities will help us from a cost standpoint, which will benefit us as we continue to progress through fy '24 -- '23.
and as donnie stated, we are seeing share gains. our harvest is up and we will continue to grow share through the q4 time frame and into fy '23 as well.
ben theurer -- barclays -- analyst
ok. perfect. thank you very much for that. and then just as only -- just a very technical question maybe for stewart.
so as we are on a year-to-date basis, still down on the volume on a consolidated basis, is the flat guidance really a function of because of 4q prepared foods, you get the easier comp because the divestiture happened last year during 4q and that's where the volume impact was? is that the right way how we should think about it?
stewart glendinning -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
well, i would just say, ben, i mean, there's probably a few more moving parts than that. of course, you're looking at all parts of the business to get to flat. but of course, you're right. i mean, the divestiture is one of those things.
ben theurer -- barclays -- analyst
ok. perfect. thank you. i'll pass it on.
donnie king -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.

our next question comes from alexia howard from bernstein. please go ahead with your question. ms. howard, your line is open.
please proceed with your question. is it possible your phone is on mute?
alexia howard -- alliancebernstein -- analyst
good morning, everyone.
donnie king -- president and chief executive officer
good morning.
alexia howard -- alliancebernstein -- analyst
can you hear me ok?
donnie king -- president and chief executive officer
yes.
alexia howard -- alliancebernstein -- analyst
all right. so first question is around the prepared foods elasticity. i'm wondering if you can talk about which categories were particularly affected this time and whether you expect those kind of trends to continue? i'm wondering where the competitive pricing dynamics are causing some pressure there. let's start there.
donnie king -- president and chief executive officer
ok. i'll start, and then i will flip it over to noelle to add some details. but i would start with that we are seeing some movements in the marketplace between foodservice to retail. in-home dining continues to increase in this environment, which we would suspected.
we're also seeing some movement from quick service chain account type business to more in -- on-premise dining as covid wanes and the people are more adventurous that they get out. and so we're seeing some improvement in that as well. but i would tell you, overall, we are starting to see some elasticity, but i would tell you they're below what historical elasticity you would expect. noelle, anything you'd like to add to that?
noelle o'mara -- group president, prepared foods
sure. thanks for the question, alexia. as i look at our prepared performance holistically, top line remains strong behind disciplined revenue management actions and profit is above prior years. pricing and productivity are partially offset by the cost of good increases.
as referenced, our prepared volumes on an organic basis are down about 5.5% year to date. and it's really three key focus areas. the first is supply. we continue to not be able to fill all of the orders that we have across our portfolio.
and as capacity continues to come online and as we improve our supply capabilities, it will allow us to not only improve availability but also merchandising that's been suppressed. and so you'll see as those improvements continue to take shape in q4, us investing back in merchandising. the second area is really around pricing. and as donnie referenced -- well, elasticity are better than historical lows, they still are impacting the business.
and given the macroeconomic environment, we're ensuring that we provide a breadth of value offerings across our portfolio, and you'll see us launching items focused on opium price points as well as larger sizes that can provide consumers value. and then the third area is really foodservice recovery. and we're focused on not only getting back volume that we lost during the pandemic but also driving portfolio offerings in many solutions that align to the operator and consumer needs. so what i feel good about is we have categories that continue to outpace total food and beverage.
we have a portfolio of leading brands and a focus on continuing to innovate and meet our consumer and customer needs in an obviously a very dynamic environment. and despite the continued market challenges, i'm expecting volume growth in the coming quarter is driven by the improved supply of the commercial investments in merchandising and innovation and continued food service recovery.
alexia howard -- alliancebernstein -- analyst
great. thank you very much for the comprehensive response. a quick follow-up. sticking with that part of the business.
private label dynamics, it seems as though need is being particularly affected by private label. i know you make private label presumably, it may be lower margin for you. just wondering what you're seeing in that area as that much occurs? thank you.
noelle o'mara -- group president, prepared foods
sure. as we look at private label performance, we don't see any acceleration as we look at the past couple of periods. where we do see share pressure in our portfolio, we also see the availability of merchandising lagging versus prior year. so that's why going back to our focus is on supply, our focus is on driving that volume so we can get back to the availability levels as well as the merchandising performance in the quarters ahead.
alexia howard -- alliancebernstein -- analyst
great. thank you very much. i'll pass it on.
donnie king -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.

our next question comes from ken goldman from j.p. morgan. please go ahead with your question.
ken goldman -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
hi. thank you. i had two on beef and cattle. first is do you have any additional color on when you expect maybe the turn in the cycle, right, from the point of, we're still in the liquidation phase to maybe that ending and heading toward a little bit more of a shortage than what's ideal for you? any more insights into how we should think about modeling that from a timing perspective?
donnie king -- president and chief executive officer
we -- thanks. good morning, ken. we still are maintaining our guidance for the segment to 11% to 13% for the full year. i think our number was 10.2%.
the cost increases we're seeing on cattle are certainly impacting the spread. and we've been talking now for a number of periods about the fact that there were going to be fewer cattle. i think we're current now from the cattle that we're involved in the backlog of covid. we're current on that.
the prices of those animals have continued to increase. and so there's drought and all those kind of conversations. but let me flip it over to shane, and i'll let him give you some color around beef.
shane miller -- group president, fresh meat
yes, ken. good morning. thanks for the question. yes.
so to donnie's point earlier, we, as an industry, have moved through the backlog of the covid impact and the harvest disruptions from covid. we are still experiencing drought, and i'd say the drought impact is still impacting over 40% of the regions where we grow cattle out in this country. so the drought is real, and it's still having an impact today. i think getting precise and specific on the timing of when it's going to flip is awfully difficult to do because we're dealing with mother nature right now.
but i would say, if you look at beef demand in general, we continue to see real robust demand, not just in the united states, but globally. so we feel real good from a demand perspective. the quality of beef that we're still bringing to the marketplace is historically strong. grading continues to maintain a high level.
so from a demand perspective and a quality perspective, we feel real good about this. but as to getting precise on the timing of when that's going to flip, i think that's awfully difficult to do.
ken goldman -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
well, if you don't know, i don't think anyone knows. thank you for that. but i have a quick follow-up. on the -- in the prepared remarks, you did provide a little bit more color on the ranges that you expect for the chicken segment margin and the prepared foods margin.
it still is a little bit of a wide range in beef. maybe you purposely left it that way because there's so much uncertainty. but maybe directionally, you could send us sort of how to think about that margin for the year, now that you're -- the year is getting closer to done in that particular segment would be helpful, if you can.
donnie king -- president and chief executive officer
yes. i'll just reiterate what i said before, ken, is, for the full year, 11% to 13%, we'll see this move to, let's call it, 6% to 8% as we're in q4, the latter part of q4. and then over time, let's talk '23, we've been saying for a couple of quarters now that we see that being a 5% to 7% which is lower than where we've been over the last couple of years, but versus the historical level, what we would be seeing there is very much in line with what we've built into our modeling and what we would anticipate.
ken goldman -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
great. thanks so much.
donnie king -- president and chief executive officer
you bet. thanks, ken.

our next question comes from adam samuelson from goldman sachs. please go ahead with your question.
adam samuelson -- goldman sachs -- analyst
hi. yeah. thank you. good morning, everyone.
donnie king -- president and chief executive officer
good morning.
adam samuelson -- goldman sachs -- analyst
i guess my first question, and maybe going back to prepared foods. and stewart, i think i heard you say at the low end of the 8% to 10% range for the full fiscal year, which i guess for the fourth quarter would get you something below 8%. and i guess, i'm trying to just make sure i understand some of the key moving pieces around the margins there. i would have thought you were in a better place on the price/cost side by now given some of the pricing actions in the marketplace.
and i guess the corollary to that is when thinking about the foodservice parts of this business, many of which -- or the legacy tyson came from the advancepierre acquisition. can you talk about kind of how those have been performing at this juncture? it would seem like the retail brands on nielsen remain quite healthy and those have, i would think, good better margins than the segment average. and so i'm just trying to get a sense of how the foodservice pieces are performing margin-wise and if there's something that may be more and more significant needs to happen to that part of the business.
stewart glendinning -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
well, i'll just pick up the margin point quickly, and then noelle can expand on some of the other pieces. but just look from a margin perspective, as i said, we are going to come in at the low end of the range. that gives you a little bit of flex. certainly, that means that we would just mathematically would be in the high 7s or low 8 for q4.
noelle o'mara -- group president, prepared foods
just to build on stewart's comment. so when you look at industry forecasts, we do show a slowdown in '22. however, the industry is still expected to rebound by 2025. and this unevenness of recoveries due to 2 things, the macroeconomic landscape as well as mix shifting between channels.
so we see that, as donnie referenced, with improved consumer mobility and comfort eating out, we see an increase in on-premise dining and a slowdown in some of the quick service restaurants that had originally led through the recovery. we've specifically seen some slowdown in our tortillas and pepperoni business that index against our commercial chain accounts. and we gave up some of the volume through the pandemic because of the spike in the demand. and so we're not only focused on getting back volume, but also, as i referenced, innovating and partnering with customers to ensure that we're leading through the overall recovery.
adam samuelson -- goldman sachs -- analyst
ok. all right. and then maybe another question for stewart. if i look at the balance sheet trends in the quarter, net debt to ebitda, you bought back a little bit of stock in the fiscal third quarter.
but i guess, just looking forward into the next -- over the next 12 to 24 months, i mean i'm just -- the balance sheet is kind of comfortable with your leverage target. you're already investing quite aggressively on the organic capex side. and so i guess i'm just trying to make sense of kind of the comfort level you have with the balance sheet kind of where it is versus what it would take to a significant releveraging event, but maybe a bigger step-up in share repurchase that there isn't continued excess cash building on the balance sheet from here. so any added color that you could provide just in priority of share repurchase moving forward?
stewart glendinning -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
sure, of course. well, look, first, i mean, we're very pleased with the strength of our balance sheet. when you look at our leverage levels, we haven't seen leverage levels like these since 2011, that sort of time frame. so we're pleased with having come through covid and put ourselves in a place where we've got a rock-solid balance sheet.
with respect to the capital allocation, our capital allocation approach, we've got a very good balanced approach. and that is strengthening our balance sheet, which we've done investing in our business, which you pointed out. we have ramped up our spend on capex, and that is good spend because it's coming in at strong returns. and it's helping to grow our business.
and then, of course, your question really about why don't we go to the share buyback, i mean, last year, this time, we spent about $50 million on buybacks. this year, we've got almost $700 million. and part of that is catching up on the dilution that we had from last year. so we'll see how that goes, but we're very pleased with where we are from a balance sheet standpoint.
adam samuelson -- goldman sachs -- analyst
ok. i appreciate that. i'll pass it on. thank you.
donnie king -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, adam.

our next question comes from ben bienvenu from stephens. please go ahead with your question.
ben bienvenu -- stephens, inc. -- analyst
hey. thanks. good morning.
donnie king -- president and chief executive officer
good morning, ben.
ben bienvenu -- stephens, inc. -- analyst
i want to revisit the chicken segment. and i want to ask when we think about kind of your new more dynamic pricing that you have in that business relative to variable costs, how should we think about the factors that create variability in the chicken margin, be that external or internal factors? and how insulated is that margin now relative to cyclicality in the industry?
donnie king -- president and chief executive officer
let me say a couple of things, and then i'll flip it to david to talk about a few things. we feel very good about -- i feel better about our chicken business than i have in a long time. and we're making progress every day. as i mentioned earlier, we're not where we want to be at this point.
but i would -- if you look at across channels, foodservice, retail, we gained share with branded value-added chicken and foodservice, i think it was 2.6 points or maybe a little more than that in foodservice. we lost a little share because of capacity in retail, the branded portfolio, and we're gaining that back rather quickly. but as we think about chicken and all these pieces and parts coming together, we're through the whole live animal livability hatch kind of conversation. we now have the supply chain on the ground that's going to continue to grow our supply so that we can service the customers in the way that we'd like.
we got more fully cooked capacity coming online, which helps, which is already sold. so we like that. and so we'll continue to optimize and improve the mix, which helps. and we will brand -- it will be a branded portfolio play as well.
but there's still volatility in grain out there. but we like what we're seeing. we like our opportunity going forward. and we think we have the foundation of this business in a good place today, and we look for things to improve over q4 and into next year.
david?
david bray -- group president, poultry
yes. i think one other thing to mention to that, ben, and it's despite what we're seeing from an inflationary standpoint and despite what we're seeing from an overall grain volatility standpoint, we're continuing to progress as planned. and a large part of that was changing the way that we worked with our great customers across the country and pricing more closer to what's going on within the market as well as inflation. and we're pricing quarterly now versus what we would have done previously from a 52-week standpoint.
so it's given us a lot more flexibility in what we do. but again, there's a lot of other things that we are doing that will put us in a position to win. and again, the volume unlock that we will see coming into this quarter will go a long way to help us build a much more sustainable model.
stewart glendinning -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
ben, this is stewart. i just want to add one thing there. don't overlook in david's model the leverage that you'll get from the increased volume. so you see them going up to 40 million birds this quarter.
every time he adds to those birds, they're not coming at any increase in fixed costs. that's already been paid for. and that's going to be helped as p&l.
ben bienvenu -- stephens, inc. -- analyst
yeah. ok. great. my second question is around beef.
and i appreciate the commentary around margins into next year as we navigate through the cycle. i'd be curious when thinking about that margin commentary for next year, would you characterize those margins as mid-cycle trough cycle margins kind of as we think about the up versus down in that business line, recognizing it's hard to see exactly where we are in the cycle, that would be helpful to us, i think.
donnie king -- president and chief executive officer
shane?
shane miller -- group president, fresh meat
yes. so, ben, this is shane. i think the way i would characterize it is as we're -- this year, we're in the 11% to 13% range for fiscal year '22. and as we transition to less numbers and back to the prior conversation around trying to pinpoint exactly when this has flipped, it was like trying to predict the weather right now.
so it's awfully difficult to do that. i would say it'd be more of the midterm. we believe over time -- to donnie's earlier point, over time, we're going to be trading somewhere in the 5% to 7% returns in our beef business. and we think about it in a couple of ways to, as you think about how we're decommoditizing this business is the quality aspect that i mentioned earlier.
we're partnered with some of the best cattle feeders in the world. and when you look at this global demand, it's going to continue. and we're not able to service all of that today because of some of the disruptions at the ports that we're dealing with. and having the ability to value up these components through our case-ready business through prepared foods and then also through our international business unit is an additional pro that this company has.
so we feel like we're going to be scaling into that here as we go through the next 12 to 18 months.
ben bienvenu -- stephens, inc. -- analyst
ok. very good. thanks and best of luck with the remainder of the year.
donnie king -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.

our next question comes from peter galbo from bank of america. please go ahead with your question.
peter galbo -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
hey, guys. good morning. just two really quick ones for me. shane and donnie, maybe just to stick on the beef topic, and i know we've covered a lot of ground there.
but one of the questions we've gotten, just given the level of liquidation you've seen this year, realizing the 5% to 7% kind of medium-term margin target, like what's the possibility though that next year comes in somewhat below that just because you're dealing with such a high level of liquidation this year that's relatively unprecedented?
shane miller -- group president, fresh meat
yes. so thanks for the question. similar to the comments i just made, it's -- we are still seeing quite a bit of cattle liquidation. to add a little more color to that, you haven't seen a hype of retention yet really start to build back.
so if you think of the time line to building back the cap crop and so forth. it's going to be a two- to three-year cycle. and then in respect to the 5% to 7% comment, we feel like we're in a good spot. i mean, unfortunately, we can't control mother nature in the drought conditions we're dealing with here.
but there's still further liquidation, i think that's going to occur and trying to pinpoint exactly when that finishes up and we start to see more half retention is awfully challenging. the most recent cattle on feed numbers would show the third highest amount here as of july 1. so we have plenty of cattle in edr here today that are going to take us through the balance of this quarter, obviously, and then into our fiscal -- excuse me, q1 of fiscal '23. but in respect to overall, the 5% to 7% range, i still feel good about where we're at.
peter galbo -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
ok. no, that's helpful. thank you, shane. and then maybe just a technical one for stewart and noelle, on prepared's margins.
again, kind of exiting this year at the kind of high sevns, low eights that stewart mentioned. just what's it going to take to build that back to a double digit? i know you had just come out of 2q at 11%, but now it seems like those margins have taken a step back, and based on some of your commentary, it doesn't feel like there's a lot more pricing that can go through. so like what do we need to see, i guess, to restore those margins back to a double-digit run rate? thanks very much.
noelle o'mara -- group president, prepared foods
sure. i can take that. so our building blocks remain the same. just taking a step back, we play in attractive categories.
we have leading share positions in those categories. top-line growth will come from the actions that we're taking to increase capacity into investments in innovation and continued equity building. we'll continue to have disciplined revenue management and cost transformation to drive our bottom line. so while i expect a continued dynamic marketplace, i believe we have the right building blocks in place and our path to deliver the sustainable double-digit margins.
stewart glendinning -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. maybe just to build on that, i think as noelle focuses on recovering some of that foodservice volume, and i guess busy with the merchandising that she was talking about, again, you'll start then to see that she has the potential to gain volume and to start gaining back some of that fixed cost deleverage it.
donnie king -- president and chief executive officer

our next question comes from robert moskow from credit suisse. please go ahead with your question.
robert moskow -- credit suisse -- analyst
hi. good morning. a few additional questions on chicken. you -- i think you are guiding to the low end of your margin range for chicken as well.
does that reflect a weaker outlook for 4q? or is 4q pretty much how you thought it would be? and then also, you mentioned you're trying to get to top quartile among your peers. your peers are -- from what i can see, like delivering really strong margins. so where are you now versus that top quartile? are you in top 50%? or are you below it?
shane miller -- group president, fresh meat
so a couple of things there. so first and foremost, within q4, i would say we are on with our expectations. what we've done through the course of fy '22 is make a lot of changes within our business related to mix. and the industry from that standpoint has had strong favorability because it's been tied to a big bird debone breast meat market.
as you know, tyson does not operate in that, and we're continuing to shift toward what is more of a value-added standpoint. as we think about benchmarking versus our competition, we are making progress. and the biggest piece of that, robert, is us getting our volume back in our facilities. and we've spent a lot of time talking about being 37 million head and growing that to 40 million head during the q4 time frame will put us in a much stronger position as we work to close out this year.
robert moskow -- credit suisse -- analyst
ok. and a follow-up. the usda for next year is forecasting even less than 1% volume growth for chicken. do you think that's like the right amount of volume for the market given the demand framework? from what you're reporting, pricing is up a lot, but demand has been pretty stable.
do you think that that's in line with how the overall industry will perform?
shane miller -- group president, fresh meat
so i would tell you -- so from a chicken standpoint and especially as we enter into the q4 time frame, what we're seeing from a demand standpoint in both foodservice and retail continues to be strong. and our customer orders continue to outpace our ability to fill them. and again, with additional volume coming through, we will be in a much better position to service our customers, but we anticipate strong demand in both retail and foodservice to continue.
robert moskow -- credit suisse -- analyst
so does that mean that 1% supply growth is not enough to meet the market?
shane miller -- group president, fresh meat
well, we will grow in excess of that next year. so we will be driving a lot of share within the industry next year. as we continue to increase our head. i think there is an opportunity for chicken to be very strong from a demand standpoint as we go into '23.
robert moskow -- credit suisse -- analyst
got it. thank you.

and our next question comes from ken zaslow from bank of montreal. please go ahead with your question.
ken zaslow -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
hey, guys. morning.
donnie king -- president and chief executive officer
morning.
ken zaslow -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
ok. i just want to follow up on just rob's question real quick. what do you think chicken production will be in 2022? or what do you think beef production will be in -- i'm sorry, in 2023, i'm sorry. where do you think chicken production will be in 2023? where do you think beef production will be in 2023? just trying to get a flavor for that.
donnie king -- president and chief executive officer
based on what was quoted in the prior call, usda is reporting a 1%, maybe a flat, i think that's probably realistic. i think our demand is going to be stronger than that as we go into '23. and from a beef perspective, with the herd liquidation, there's going to be fewer -- there's going to be fewer cattle in the harvest. and you're going to have more and more packers chasing those heads, particularly the -- those which have better genetics that grade better that provide additional revenue and margin opportunity.
and so that's going to become very tight. and as we move into '23 and even into '24, beef is going to see some -- you're going to see some higher cutouts and higher-priced cattle in the marketplace.
ken zaslow -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
ok. in the prepared remarks, it was said kind of about -- there was a supply chain issues in prepared foods. as -- you talked about the margin is still at that. i don't know if i maybe i missed it a little bit, but is there options for you guys to improve your supply chain? what are you doing there? and does that have a meaningful impact in 2023, 2024? and i'm not talking about pricing or anything like that, but -- and maybe i misheard in the prepared remarks.
so i just thought there was some opportunity in supply chain. can you talk about that?
donnie king -- president and chief executive officer
let me say a couple of things about that, ken, and then i will flip it to noelle. what we're talking about there is a big portion of that, for example, is in the first half, particularly in the first quarter. you may remember that we had a resurgence in covid at that point. and so we got a little bit behind and as we started the year or in our second quarter.
but we've been out of capacity on a few key categories that we're seeing now come online. we got more capacity coming online next year for prepared foods. the demand is -- while it's been impacted a little bit in some key categories around the pricing, it's still, let's say, less elastic than maybe you would -- or even our models would have indicated, but we're still -- we're seeing some elasticity. but we expect the volume to grow.
we expect to put forth a great deal of effort in our supply chain. those things that we can control, the productivity program, for example, is a huge -- huge for us in the way of automation and technology. we've been investing now for over a year, and we're starting to see some of those things bear fruit. and not only for this quarter, but as we move forward.
and so those investments are paying off. we're -- some of the things that we've done around autonomous planning and trying to eliminate or improve forecast accuracy and eliminate distress and those type of things, we're much better today than we were a quarter or two quarters ago, but there's still things to do. and -- but supply chain is improving. we're running at rate.
in many cases or in most cases, we are staffed completely, but we just -- we're looking for opportunities to continue to get better. noelle, anything you want to add to that?
noelle o'mara -- group president, prepared foods
i think you covered it well, donnie. to your point, we have made significant traction from a labor perspective as we think about automation within our facilities, digitization, the complexity reduction and flexibility that we've created in our network. and so all of those improvements are leading to a better supply picture as we've continued to progress through this year and as we are expected to progress through q4 next year.

donnie king -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, brandon, and thank you to everyone for joining us for the call. earlier today, we reported solid third quarter and year-to-date results. we continue to navigate through a complex and dynamic operating environment, and i'm grateful for the hard work and dedication of our team members. our results would not have been possible without them.
at our investor day last year, we shared three priorities with you: winning with team members, winning with customers and consumers, and winning with execution. and i'm pleased to say that we're making progress. for team members, our continuing investments are reducing turnover and improving staffing levels. for customers, our service levels are improving.
our execution, we're getting stronger, driving substantial savings and improving business results. i'm confident we're on the right track and recognize that there is more work to do. let me cover some highlights from the quarter. our multi-protein portfolio enabled our business results.
in the third quarter versus last year, we delivered substantially improved earnings in our chicken segment as well as higher earnings in prepared foods, which partially offset a decline in beef and pork earnings and we continue to accelerate our productivity actions to improve efficiency across all segments. with our iconic retail brands, tyson, jimmy dean, hillshire farm, and ball park. tyson's core business lines outpaced total food and beverage, up 13% in the last 13 weeks compared to pre-pandemic levels. we continue to be the market share leader in the majority of the retail core categories in which we compete.
while gaining share in both bacon and breakfast sausage in six of the nine core business lines, we grew share versus our second quarter. i was also pleased to see continued growth in our e-commerce channel, where approximately one in five u.s. households bought a tyson product during the past quarter with e-commerce sales growing 15% versus last year. we're seeing some recovery in the foodservice channel with continued gains in quarterly sales.
in broadline distribution, we have seen specific strength in branded value-added chicken, breakfast sausage, and bacon. in this challenging economic environment, where our cost of goods has continued to increase, consumer demand for protein remains relatively steady. our diverse portfolio allows us to meet customer and consumer needs across a broad range of products and price points even as consumers shift between proteins and products. our balance sheet grew stronger, providing optionality to invest in growth across our portfolio and return cash to shareholders.
we have a disciplined approach to deploying capital with a focus on total shareholder return. our year-to-date results clearly demonstrate that our diverse portfolio supports. our growth objectives are growing faster than the overall market, improving operating margins, and driving strong returns for our shareholders. now for highlights from our financial performance.
sales improved 8% for the third quarter and 16% year to date compared to the prior period. our sales gains were largely driven by higher average sales price in chicken and prepared foods. average sales price increased in these segments in response to persistent increase in the cost of goods. prices were lower in beef, in line with expectations, and pork segment versus the same quarter last year.
we delivered solid operating income of nearly $1 billion because of our diversified portfolio. year to date, we are up 15% over prior year. as expected, year over year third quarter earnings were lower as beef margins declined relative to a year ago, but still performed well in comparison to historical results. overall, earnings per share came in at $1.94 for the third quarter and $7.10 year to date.
we remain confident our actions will improve our long-term volume performance. however, our total volume was down both for the quarter and year to date. we are focused on overcoming the supply chain challenges, running our plants full, and reducing our costs. chicken volume is up year to date driven by demand and operational improvements, but down for the quarter.
lower quarterly volumes were driven by the fiscal year '21 fire at our rendering plant in hanceville, alabama as well as lower outside purchases of meat, chicks, and eggs. this was partially offset by increased levels of internal harvest versus the same quarter last year, and we expect internal growth to continue as we ramp up our bird supply. for the full year, we expect chicken to deliver 1% to 2% volume growth. in prepared foods, volumes are down 5.5% year to date due to supply chain challenges, uneven food service recovery, and the impact of increased pricing.
note also that the divestiture of our pet treats business last year drives 1.2% of the total decline. although retail volume is down, we maintained our market leadership positions. while the foodservice channel continues to recover, volume growth remains strong in the broadline distribution led by breakfast sausage and bacon. in beef, volumes are down year to date but were up 1.3% versus the same quarter last year, and we continued to increase quarter over quarter due to higher head throughput and carcass weight.
in pork, volumes were down year to date by 2.1% because of limited hog supply and lower export demand. we expect tightness in live hog inventories and declining export demand to continue to impact volumes in the fourth quarter. in the international/other segment, volumes are up 11.7% year to date and 21.9% versus the same quarter last year. investments in capacity, innovation, and brands are supporting our market share growth.
volume growth was driven by our strengthening qsr and retail performance. overall, -- our international business is growing both organically and inorganically. during q4, we signed a joint venture agreement with tanmiah food company in saudi arabia. this partnership will enable us to better serve our large global customers as well as expand our reach to new customers in the middle east.
we're investing in new plants and expanding existing capacity across our global network. eight plants are being constructed, with two expected to begin operation this fiscal year and six more by the end of fiscal year '23. this additional capacity will enable our team to address capacity constraints accelerate our value-added growth and better serve growing consumer demand for protein. we continue to make significant investments to attract and retain team members, including child care, citizenship support, transportation, free technical and college education, on-site health clinics, maternity and paternity leave, and other health benefits.
our nearside health centers in rural communities are seeing increased usage. these clinics provide team members, spouses, and dependents, comprehensive healthcare services at little to no cost. investment in team members are making an impact as higher pay and enhanced benefit offerings have led to lower turnover and absenteeism in our plants, which positions tyson for future growth. we are committed to creating a differentiated work experience for our team members.
these investments we're making in our people are part of our broader effort to evolve our business from an esg standpoint. over the past several years, we have made many investments to these ends. today, we are focused on three core pillars of our esg framework, the formula to feed the future. those three pillars are reimagined people and community impact, drive product responsibility from farm to table and working toward achieving net zero.
earlier this quarter, we released our sustainability report for 2021, which highlights our ambition and commitments to become the world's most sustainable and transparent protein company. in addition to the investments in people i mentioned a few moments ago, we also highlighted in our report our efforts around animal welfare, sustainable packaging, minimizing waste, water stewardship, and working within our operations and supply chain to reduce emissions. we're setting aggressive esg goals and working to meet them. as we run our business better, we are making process improvements, digitalizing the supply chain, increasing automation and aggressively managing sg&a across our operations.
our productivity program continues to deliver at the upper range of our initial projections and we'll realize more than $1 billion in recurring productivity savings by the end of fiscal year 2024. we're continuing to accelerate digitalization across tyson through supply chain planning and executional processes to better serve our customer. automation remains a top priority for our business, and i'm very pleased with the aggressive rollout of automation technologies. and given the macroeconomic environment, we are taking action to cut costs, reduce spend and reassess every role across the business to ensure that the work we do is value added for our customers and consumers.
finally, as we look for new and innovative ideas that can have the greatest impact on tyson's productivity and sustainability objectives, we held the first-ever tyson demo day. more than 100 companies were considered as presenters for the demo day, 20 were selected to make their pitch and ultimately, six companies were chosen for partnership. we are committed to strengthening our position as a global protein leader, and driving value creation for our shareholders. at our investor day, we outlined five imperatives for strengthening our position as a global protein leader.
i've spoken about transforming our team member experience, increasing capacity, investing in digital and automation, and the strength of our balance sheet. chicken remains a key focus for our long-term success, and we are executing against our road map to restore top quartile performance for this segment. this quarter, we surpassed a 6% adjusted operating margin. we expect to reach 40 million head per week by the end of this fiscal year, and to continue to grow after that, enabling us to maximize our fixed cost leverage and grow our value-added business.
we are optimizing our plant network by adding fully cooked capacity, converting plants for value-added production, implementing plant flexibility, and optimizing our portfolio mix. we have come a long way and have more work to do, but i'm pleased with the progress that we are making in chicken. as we look to address projected demand growth over the next decade, we're using our financial strength to invest in our business. we will have invested nearly $1.9 billion in fiscal year '22 focused primarily on new capacity and automation objectives.
year to date, we returned to shareholders approximately $1.2 billion in dividends and share repurchases as we continue to prioritize shareholder return. i will now turn the call over to stewart to walk us through more detail on our financial results for the third quarter.
stewart glendinning -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thank you, donnie. let me turn first to a summary of our total company financial performance. we're pleased to report solid results in the third quarter and year to date. sales were up for both the third quarter and year to date, benefiting from our pricing initiatives to offset the increase in cost of goods.
volumes were down both for the third quarter and year to date due to supply constraints and a challenging macroeconomic environment impacting consumer demand. looking at our sales results by channel. retail drove $173 million of top-line improvement in the third quarter relative to the same quarter last year. in the third quarter, the ongoing recovery in the foodservice channel drove an increase of $165 million.
sales to international markets, including both domestically and internationally produced products, were $339 million greater than the prior-year period as we leveraged our global scale to grow our business. donnie covered our earnings and eps results. slide 11 bridges operating income for the third quarter, which was $374 million lower than fiscal 2021. volumes were down 1.9% in the quarter.
our pricing actions, which partially offset the higher input costs, led to higher sales during the quarter. we saw continued increases in cost of goods across the business, in some instances, up to 15%. notable examples were labor, feed ingredients, live animals, and freight costs. sg&a was $20 million unfavorable to the same period last year due to increased investment in advertising and promotional spend and technology-related costs, partially offset by lower commission costs incurred by selling direct to customers rather than via brokers.
as donnie said, we are assessing all of our sg&a expenses across the business to identify non-value-added spend. savings from our productivity program initiatives continue to have a positive impact on margins. moving to the beef segment. sales were approximately $5 billion for the third quarter, flat versus the same period last year, but up 15% year to date at nearly $15 billion.
sales in the quarter remained strong, supported by higher volume but offset by lower average sales price driven by softer consumer demand for premium cuts of beef. global consumer demand for beef products remain strong, and we expect volume to continue to improve in the fourth quarter as improved labor participation supports higher plant productivity. on expenses, we incurred greater costs during the third quarter versus the comparable prior-year period as live cattle costs increased approximately $480 million in the quarter. we had sufficient livestock available in the quarter driven by higher herd liquidation due to drought conditions.
we delivered segment operating income of $506 million in the quarter, down 55% versus the prior-year comparable period. our operating margin of 10.2% was lower than the same quarter last year but remains a strong performance. we expect to see beef margins return closer to an expected long-term 5% to 7% average. looking next to the pork segment.
sales were approximately $1.6 billion for the quarter, down 6% versus the same period last year, but up 4% year to date at $4.8 billion. global demand is being impacted domestically by high retail prices and internationally by the strong dollar, making u.s. pork relatively expensive as compared to alternative sources globally. for the quarter, the average sales price decreased 3.9%.
segment operating income was $25 million and $248 million for the quarter and year to date, respectively. while down 63% versus the comparable prior-year quarter, operating income is down less than 1% year to date. overall operating margins for the segment declined to 1.5% for the quarter. the operating income deterioration was driven by compressed pork margins with rising hog costs and a constrained cutout.
moving now to prepared foods. sales were approximately $2.4 billion for the quarter, up 5% relative to the same period last year and up 9% year to date at $7.2 billion. sales increased despite a volume decline driven by higher average sales prices. note, part of the volume decline in the quarter was driven by the sale of our pet treats business.
our brand strength and category relevance has enabled continued strong performance across multiple categories. operating margin for the segment was 7.6% or $186 million for the quarter, up versus last year. year to date, operating margin is 8.9% and flat, compared to the prior year at $635 million. cost of goods continues to increase, pressuring our cost of production.
to offset higher costs, we've executed productivity initiatives, revenue management and optimize our spend. to support our growth aspirations, we continue to invest in marketing and trade to increase the market share of our brands. moving into the chicken segment's results. sales were $4.4 billion for the quarter, up 26%.
year to date, sales are up 25% at $12.3 billion. average sales price increased in the quarter compared to the same period last year. our shift in pricing mechanisms to more variable structures has reduced risk by allowing us to be more agile in response to increasing cost of goods. chicken delivered adjusted operating income of $269 million in the third quarter representing an operating margin of 6.2%.
quarterly operating income increased over the same quarter last year due to higher average sales price and efficiency improvements, partially offset by increased cost of goods. for the third quarter, we experienced $145 million in higher feed and costs versus prior year, and we recognized $23 million in net derivative losses, compared to $56 million of net derivative gains in the prior year. turning to slide 16. our healthy cash flows and improved balance sheet have continued to support our disciplined capital allocation approach.
we remain focused on building financial strength, investing in our team members and business, and returning cash to shareholders. we produced $1.9 billion of operating cash flow so far during fiscal year '22, and that's after funding a $1.9 billion increase in our working capital. our leverage ratio at 1.2 times net debt to adjusted ebitda demonstrates our powerful balance sheet and our continued capital allocation optionality. investing in our business for both organic and inorganic growth and operational efficiency will continue to be an important priority and will help tyson increase production capacity, market capabilities, and profitability.
this will support return on capital generation above the market for our shareholders. finally, we remain committed to returning cash to shareholders through both dividends and share buybacks. year to date, we've returned $491 million in dividends and repurchased $693 million of shares, including $170 million of shares during the third quarter. let's now discuss the financial outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year.
based on the strong results year to date, we're maintaining our total company sales guidance at a range of $52 billion to $54 billion. we now expect total volume growth to be flat on a year-over-year basis. looking at aoi margin target ranges for our segments. in chicken, our operational turnaround is on track, and we expect full year margins to be between 5% and 7%, but at the lower end.
based on the current trends in retail and foodservice, we expect the full year margin in prepared foods to be at the lower end of the 8% to 10% range. in beef, we expect margins to move toward our expected 5% to 7% range as the live capital to cutout price spread continues to decline. however, we still expect to deliver a full year aoi margin of 11% to 13%. in pork, due to margin compression from hog costs and global demand headwinds, we're reducing our full year aoi margin outlook to be in the range of 3% to 5%.
in international/other, we anticipate slightly lower results from our foreign operations in fiscal '22 due to supply chain disruptions and other impacts related to covid-19. our expectations for capex and net interest expense are lowered to $1.9 billion and $350 million, respectively. our tax rate expectation is lowered from approximately 23% to approximately 22.5%. our net leverage is expected to remain well below two times net debt to adjusted ebitda, providing optionality for inorganic investment and additional return of cash to shareholders for the remainder of the year.
i'll now turn the call back over to brandon for q&a instructions. brandon?
brandon tucker -- senior manager

[operator instructions] our first question comes from adam samuelson with goldman sachs. please go ahead.
adam samuelson -- goldman sachs -- analyst
yes. thank you. good morning, everyone.
donnie king -- president and chief executive officer
good morning, adam.
john r. tyson -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
good morning.
adam samuelson -- goldman sachs -- analyst
so, i guess my first question is thinking about the outlook for fiscal 2023 in beef, and you're kind of staying at or below the low end of the normalized range. clearly, there's been some herd liquidation that's been happening in the u.s. industry. cattle prices have risen.
i guess i'm trying to understand if we're already at or below the low end of that normalized range, the cattle herd was going to keep -- is going to keep shrinking. can you help us think about how we would ever get -- how we would get back to that normalized range in the next few years with the smaller herd? talk about kind of what you're doing from productivity, from a mixed, case-ready capacity that would be a balance to margins and what would seem like a more challenging kind of multiyear outlook?
john r. tyson -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
hey adam. this is john, and thanks for the question. i think, look, first, i'd reiterate what we see as the long-term guidance for the beef business. and, you know, we -- that's a full outlook for the year, long term.
we're not, at this point, going to give quarterly guidance. and what i think i'd say is, you know, we're, at tyson, not necessarily immune to the cattle cycle, but there are a couple of things i'd point out, you know, that maybe make this cycle a little bit different. you know, number one, we see the quality, generally speaking, around the industry is stronger and better that has kind of supported demand for beef cattle. i think, secondly, the global demand is pretty strong.
that's a little bit tempered by fx that we're seeing in our business. but generally speaking, i think that makes this cycle that we're heading into a slightly different. i'll let shane maybe comment on some of the investments we're making around the business and give a little more detail as it relates to the outlook on beef.
shane miller -- group president, fresh meat
thanks for the question, adam. you know, john touched on a couple of things that -- i think to think about that's a bit different this cycle versus, you know, previous cycles is, one, you know, john touched on the cattle quality. that's extremely different this go-round than the last time we went through this cycle. the second component is, globally, beef has remained and still has been a strong demand product that's going into different channels throughout asia.
and also, we're seeing interest from different parts of the globe that historically have not been big buyers of u.s. beef. and then, finally, if you think about the -- even though we do have a strong quality that's coming out of the meat products, but you have items such as our specialty products, fats and oils are off all items. items like that that typically haven't been large contributors that this go-round are significant contributors.
so, if you think of it in direction in relationship to the last cycle, i think we have an opportunity here to scale in here and do much better than the last go-round. so, i think all those things coupled together give us confidence and hope that we're going to continue to be able to drive this type of return.
adam samuelson -- goldman sachs -- analyst
ok. that's helpful. and if i could just maybe switch gears to the chicken business. and if you think about the exit margins coming out of fiscal fourth quarter and 7.3%, can you just help us think about the trajectory of chicken from here? i think there was some mark-to-market derivative gains in the quarter.
but how do we think about the volume scaling kind of mix contribution? and help us think about kind of what would get you to the 8% versus the 6% at the upper and lower bounds of your guidance range.
donnie king -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, adam. this is donnie. thanks for the question. the chicken turnaround continues.
we've made a lot of progress. david and his team have got our chicken business in a better place than it's been in some time. but we haven't arrived yet. there's still things to do.
and we get better sequentially each quarter and would expect that to continue. i would point out that we're guiding to a 6% to 8% for '23, and we feel very good about that. and we feel good about investing in our tyson brand and continuing to use that. but let me just flip it over to david.
and this is a guy who's been doing all the work and -- he and his team, and let him add some additional color for you.
david bray -- group president, poultry
perfect, donnie. thank you very much. and you said it very well. we have made progress in 2022, but we've got a considerable amount of work to do as we get into 2023.
but it's also important to understand that our goals have not changed within this segment. and we are aligned on not only making sure that we service our customers, but we run our facilities and capacity. and that's incredibly important to us as we move into 2023. as a team, we're focused on making sure that our customers are serviced, that we fill our plants, and that we're taking care of our team members.
and in total, we've got a very strong plan for 2023. and john mentioned the guidance between 6% to 8%, and we feel very good about the plan we have in place to deliver those numbers.
adam samuelson -- goldman sachs -- analyst
great. i'll pass it on. thanks.
donnie king -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, adam.

our next question comes from ben bienvenu with stephens. please go ahead.
ben bienvenu -- stephens, inc. -- analyst
hey. thanks. good morning, everybody.
donnie king -- president and chief executive officer
good morning.
ben bienvenu -- stephens, inc. -- analyst
so, i want to ask about the prepared foods business, and you talked about the cadence of improvements that we should expect as we move through the year. could you talk about the critical path to achieve that cadence of improvement through the year? and if we think about the pricing that you've taken today, is that sufficient to cover the costs to get to that 8% to 10% range? or is there additional pricing that you might need to take?
donnie king -- president and chief executive officer
let me just say that -- and i'll pass it over to stewart to add some commentary. we guided to 8% to 10% in 2023. and behind productivity, capacity utilization, and mix improvements, we anticipate improved volume sales and aoi for '23. our food service recovery is a little slower pace than expected, but we feel very good about this segment and the performance.
and i'm personally very proud that we have stewart leading this business. and, stewart, why don't you add some comments?
stewart glendinning -- group president, prepared foods
yeah. thanks. good morning, ben. i'd, you know, start by saying that it's great to run this business because when you look at the construct of the prepared foods business, on the retail side out of the nine categories, we've got the no.
1 position in eight. and on the food service side, we're in, i think, about 19 categories or so there. and in the majority of those, we've got the no. 1 position.
so, we're really starting from a position of strength just from a portfolio standpoint. you look at the way this year has gone, we took pricing earlier in the year. and so, as we went through the year, of course, we had continued inflation. so, looking to the back part of this -- of '23, as we go through '23, we're going to be recovering from the 5.8% to get up to the eight.
and that's really going to have a couple of big drivers. the first one and the most important is volume. if you look back in the volume history, we shared last quarter that we'd lost some food service volume. we're working on getting that back.
our fill rates, we still have an opportunity in fill rates. and so, there's volume that's actually sitting in our order queue that we can go and get. and we're working on that and seeing improvement week over week. as the pricing, we'll see how the year goes.
in this fourth quarter, we saw a strong volume performance. some of that came on the back of increased promotions. but i'd note that our promotions were in line with our competition. so, back half of the year, probably the last point to make is we've got pretty strong plans for cost reduction this year, and that will also contribute to getting us to the 8% to 10%.
ben bienvenu -- stephens, inc. -- analyst
ok. great. and if i could circle back to the chicken business, i believe your goal that you laid out at the investor day in 2021 was to be at an 84% hatch rate as of kind of around right now. is that where you are? are you on track? you mentioned commentary in your slides that you're on track with your hatch improvement goals.
are we kind of now at a new cruising level and shouldn't expect further improvement from here? or could that continue to improve, would you want it to?
david bray -- group president, poultry
we are well on track. we are very pleased with the work that our live team has done in getting this put back in a position where we're no longer having daily conversations about what our hatch rates are. so, we are on track and feel good.
ben bienvenu -- stephens, inc. -- analyst
ok. thank you. best of luck.

our next question comes from alexia howard with alliancebernstein. please go ahead.
alexia howard -- alliancebernstein -- analyst
good morning, everyone.
donnie king -- president and chief executive officer
good morning.
john r. tyson -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
good morning.
alexia howard -- alliancebernstein -- analyst
great. can i ask about the productivity savings program? you obviously overdelivered in fiscal '22 relative to where you were expecting to get to. can you talk about what it was that went better than expected? and i guess linked to that, a second question, if the automation part is going faster than expected, how quickly is total employee count coming down? and how much more is there to go on that front? thank you.
donnie king -- president and chief executive officer
sure. thanks for the question. so, the productivity program, as we laid it out, it was a three-year program, and we're well ahead of that in 2022. and we talked about this in terms of really three buckets.
automation is obviously one of those, digital is another, and then operational and functional excellence. and all of those are working together really, really well. we think we'll meet our commitment by the end of this fiscal year '23. but, you know, it seems like every rock we turn over, we find something new, and we capture that, and we'll continue to do that.
the automation piece specifically is progressing faster than what we had planned. and, of course, we're happy about that. but -- you know, remember, the automation piece was to eliminate some laborious difficult, high turnover type of positions. and in the program, as i think it was in the script that i mentioned, in chicken, the debone automation project, but we also, in this programmatic approach to automation, where we have focused in our pack-out area.
and we've also launched our digital enablement group as we take technology throughout tyson. and we're progressing on all of those, and we'll update you each and every quarter on how we're doing in that area.
alexia howard -- alliancebernstein -- analyst
great. and anything on the headcount side of things?
donnie king -- president and chief executive officer
i have nothing to report on that now. we obviously are eliminating positions and are eliminating difficult jobs, and we are reassigning people to open position throughout the company.
alexia howard -- alliancebernstein -- analyst
great. thank you very much. i'll pass it on.
donnie king -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.

our next question comes from robert moskow with credit suisse. please go ahead.
robert moskow -- credit suisse -- analyst
hi. thank you. look, those of us who have followed tyson for a long time are used to the company putting people with a lot of brand management expertise in charge of prepared foods because it's a heavily branded food portfolio, and putting people into the cfo role who have 20-plus years of experience in the finance track. and this latest reshuffling did the opposite.
can you speak to how the organization is responding culturally to these decisions, especially in light of the fact that you're also closing down two of your headquarters, consolidating into springdale? donnie, what are you doing to mitigate execution risk during this, you know, kind of high turmoil period?
donnie king -- president and chief executive officer
thank you. in short, we have a plan. let's start with the office consolidation that you referenced. you know, this is something that we've talked about.
we've looked at for a number of years now. and we made the decision to do that in an effort to be a better version of ourselves. we're still working through trying to finalize which team members are moving and which ones are not. we certainly realize it's a difficult decision for those team members, and we're committed to providing the resources.
and the way we've characterized that here at tyson is we're trying to help those team members, and it's about 1,100 of them, to be able to find the yes in terms of being able to move here and with their families. and i would just characterize it as integration a few years later. and there's opportunity, obviously, that we see in terms of being better, being more agile, and delivering better results, being more productive, all those type attributes. and in order to get that, we had to do our project concept.
now, in terms of the people, i would remind you, at tyson, we have a -- our succession planning process is very robust. and we're working that program. it's a living document, and we did, to your point, make some decisions. i would start with i am very pleased with the decisions that we've made around john randal, around stewart, and amy tu.
these are very talented individuals. and all of them have experience in other areas that -- and then they brought that to tyson. so, we're comfortable with the team that we've got. the team feels good with the leaders that they have.
and i already see great progress in the work that they're doing. and -- but we're -- i'm perfectly comfortable with the people we put in place.
robert moskow -- credit suisse -- analyst
i appreciate that, donnie. maybe a follow-up. when do you expect to be able to give more clarity to those 1,100 people? in my experience, you know, people who want to know stuff like that sooner than later. how quickly can you move?
donnie king -- president and chief executive officer
sure. so, i think the thing that you need to know about that is we've been working and meeting almost on a daily basis. we put together a team to execute the plan that we have in place. we've invited every team member to join us here in northwest arkansas.
and that's open. we've asked them to commit to us, you know, what their intentions are. and in fact, today -- i don't know the numbers yet, but today was the day at which we needed to know that. and we really approached this in a couple of different ways.
one is we want you to be here. we want you to remain a part of tyson foods. and quite frankly, i've been out recruiting people to, as other leaders have, to come to northwest arkansas. and we've had a lot of success.
there will be some people who, at this point in their life, can't move. and so, we will try to create an opportunity where they can stay with the company long enough so that their replacement could be hired and trained so that we have no business interruption or interruption of business continuity.
robert moskow -- credit suisse -- analyst
makes sense. thank you.
donnie king -- president and chief executive officer

our next question comes from ben theurer with barclays. please go ahead.
antonio hernandez -- barclays -- analyst
hi. good morning. this is antonio hernandez on behalf of ben theurer. my question is regarding your capex plans for the next year.
you provided some color on that. but could you provide a little bit more breakdown on the different items that you're spending and what should we expect more in the medium to long term? thanks.
john r. tyson -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
hey, there. you're kind of muffled on our end. i think your question was about capex and just wondering if we could expand upon that. is that right?
antonio hernandez -- barclays -- analyst
exactly. yes.
john r. tyson -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
sure thing. well, i think what we've talked to you about already this morning is our plans for a heavier investment in our business compared to historical years. and i think, you know, in a small part, that's driven a little bit about the inflationary environment that we're in. but really, i think the point we want, you know, you to take away is that we see a lot of opportunity in our business in terms of productivity improvements, things like automation and a little bit of capacity expansion.
so, as it relates to priorities, i would tell you that in our value-added segments, we're trying to grow capacity. and in some of our, you know, chicken, prepared foods, and fresh meats businesses, we see opportunities for network optimization. so, i don't think it's any departure from what you would expect us to be investing in, a decent balance of growth and productivity investments. i would emphasize, you know, back to the question that someone asked earlier, automation is a huge part of our agenda.
and what we like about those investments is we see sustained productivity as we reapportion team members to different parts of our operations. and so, we feel really confident in some of the more programmatic investments we're making around our automation agenda.
antonio hernandez -- barclays -- analyst
ok. perfect. thank you.
operator
my next question comes from ken goldman with jpmorgan. please go ahead.
ken goldman -- jpmorgan chase and company -- analyst
hi. thank you. you know, i wanted to ask about your guidance for the sales range of $55 billion to $57 billion. i do appreciate that there are six new plants coming on and that you'll have some, you know, additional pricing and some mix improvements.
i guess one of the questions we're getting from investors this morning is, you know, is it reasonable to expect the high end of that range, just given some of the potential trade-down coming as consumers potentially, you know, face some more challenges and more importantly, where we're seeing chicken prices today? so, i guess i'm curious, you know, if you can expand a little bit perhaps on how much production the six new plants are expected to cumulatively add? i think that would help people really kind of maybe bridge the gap there to that higher end, perhaps?
donnie king -- president and chief executive officer
let me start off, ken, and say this. i mean, we feel very confident in the -- what we've laid out in terms of outlook. could we move to the higher side? perhaps. but we're guiding to have a really, really good year.
you know, we factored in things like inflation. we factored in growing share in both dollar and volume. we've included all those things in terms of the drought and the conditions that we're seeing in the beef segment, the strength of the dollar from an export position. so, in short, i would tell you that we've considered all those things in coming up with this plan.
and we rolled it up as a team, and we all signed off on it. but i'll pass it to john and see if he wants to --
john r. tyson -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah, donnie, i think that was a fair summary. i mean, you know, there's a balance in that projection between the volume growth and what we see from a sales growth from a pricing standpoint. and i think that we feel confident in the mix between those two things to achieve the range that we gave. you also asked a question about what's the capacity coming online with the new build.
and i think without going into details of each of those operations, a little bit of that is dependent on the timing of when things come online in '23. but i think overall, what we want you to take away is that we feel confident in the range at this standpoint, you know, as a roll-up of multiple factors that go into the numbers.
ken goldman -- jpmorgan chase and company -- analyst
ok. thank you. and then a quick follow-up. you obviously have done really well with getting your productivity at an accelerated pace.
i don't think -- and forgive me if i missed this, you did talk about productivity after '23. previously, you had kind of guided into '24. is it fair to assume that there will be still significant productivity savings after '23 now that you've pulled those forward a little bit? and if so, when might we get a little bit of color on the dollar percentage amount there?
donnie king -- president and chief executive officer
so, great question. you know, first thing i would say to you is we had a good '22, and we feel very good about delivering a year early in '23. our nature is that we are -- have a continuous improvement mindset. so, we will identify and continue to identify opportunities to become more productive, become more efficient to run lines at rate better to automate, do all those type of things that will continue to bring money to the bottom line.
we feel good about that, and i think you could expect that we would have another program or continuation of this program. i don't know what that is at this moment. john, anything?
john r. tyson -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
no, nothing to add, donnie. thanks.
operator
our next question comes from peter galbo with bank of america. please go ahead.
peter galbo -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
hey, guys. good morning. thanks for taking the question.
donnie king -- president and chief executive officer
good morning, peter.
peter galbo -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
john, i just wanted to maybe clarify a couple of points you made on the volume growth assumptions between some of the segments. i think what you're calling for in chicken is maybe like a 5% growth in '23, just given the weekly slaughter levels. just wanted to check that. and then on beef, i wanted to make sure i heard you correctly, you know, even with usda kind of calling for down mid single digit on volumes, you were thinking you could be relatively stable.
i don't know if that meant flat for the year or how you were thinking about that.
john r. tyson -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
sure. i think, look, we've kind of tried to give some overall indications on volume as it relates to the various segments. and there's a lot of factors that go into the sales and aoi numbers we're looking at, part of which is volume. i think in our poultry business, we do feel comfortable about the sequential growth directionally speaking, that we're talking about as we head into fy '23.
and i think on the beef business, you know, even amid the total environment and usda calling out the harvest, i think what i'd point to is some of the investments we make in terms of our business model around our relationships with suppliers, investments in kind of the value-added parts of our business, and, you know, continuing to grow in specific channels. i think we see it as critical, you know, to preserving the outlook for '23. shane, maybe you have a little bit to add on the beef segment.
shane miller -- group president, fresh meat
yeah. peter, i think one of the things to keep in mind, too, when you look at beef is you're lapping, you know, a period a year ago with still a covid-induced reduction in volumes. and we've seen our operations get back to -- we're getting five days of animals harvested, processed in five days and six days really turned into a flex day. so, on top of that, from the supply component, you're right.
i mean, we are in the middle of the drought still. and we're seeing drought-induced movement into the feed yards continues to show lower weights at placement, which, in a sense, means that cattle are being pulled forward and so forth. so, as you look forward here into the next several months, i mean we're still going to have plenty of animals to work through.
peter galbo -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
got it. no. thanks. that's very helpful.
and, donnie, i guess just to follow up on ken's last question around chicken. you know, just given that you have transitioned more of your contracts to a more variable pricing structure, what we've seen in the spot markets in terms of pricing, can you just kind of remind us where you stand today in terms of how commodity markets or commodity chicken markets might impact pricing relative to history where maybe it wasn't as impactful to your business?
donnie king -- president and chief executive officer
let me -- i'll mention a few things, and then i'll let david add some additional color. yes, we feel very good about that. i would remind you that in our portfolio, the percentage of our portfolio that is value-added is significant. and a significant portion of that is branded.
and so, we have a lot more discretion with that. some of the pricing variability is essentially more associated with some of the segments like fresh chicken or things like that. but we feel very good. and, you know, if you go back and look at us through history, you will find when the market goes up really high in breast meat -- and i think a quarter or so ago, breast meat was trading at around $2.60 and you can buy that for about $0.90 today.
you know what, we never got the high of that based on our model, and we never get the lows either. so, we trade within a range here, and we have -- on purpose and have more -- or better, more predictable results. david?
david bray -- group president, poultry
donnie, i think that was perfect, especially when you talked about our exposure and the amount of big bird breast meat that we actually have a part of. but the other piece to that is we have great customers at tyson foods. and what we've done within our variable pricing is provided us the opportunity to have more consistent conversations with them about the things that make their prices go up and the things that make their prices go down. and we'll continue to have those conversations despite soft times and seasonality.
so, a lot of progress has been made against that. and again, we've done a lot of work to shift into more of a value-added mix.

our next question comes from ken zaslow with bmo. please go ahead.
ken zaslow -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
hey. good morning, guys.
donnie king -- president and chief executive officer
good morning, ken.
john r. tyson -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
good morning.
ken zaslow -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
hey, john, stewart, can you kind of tell us, as you enter the new role, what is your key actions you expect to do within the next, call it, six to 12 months, and how you think that role for you will evolve? and what contribution you will actually have to the changes that need to be done?
john r. tyson -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
hey, ken. this is john. maybe let me answer that question first. and i think the first thing i'd point out, just as it relates to kind of the overall leadership team here, as you know, i've been on the executive team for going on a few years now and involved in the senior leadership level for more than that.
so, i don't think from a capital allocation standpoint or a strategy standpoint, you should expect too many significant changes or departures from how things have been handled in the past. i guess that's the first point i'd make. you know, stewart and i are sitting here next to each other. you know, stylistically, you might see a few differences between the two of us.
but i think, you know, overall, i think the direction of the company stays the same. i think, you know, check back with me in a quarter or two to see if there's any, you know, new ideas. but i think overall, i'll just provide the perspective that i think, you know, these leadership moves are kind of both for continuity rather than radical change of any kind.
stewart glendinning -- group president, prepared foods
yeah. ken, maybe first just with the background point. i spent 13 years before this in the beer business, 10 of those as an executive officer, four of those as the cfo running the branded businesses. so, i'm coming to this business with a good knowledge of brands, and i'm excited to run what is a powerful part of our portfolio.
when i look at the business, i see huge opportunity mainly because the platform is so strong. you know, starting off, if you look at the volume performance of prepared foods over the last number of years, while share has been good, volume could be stronger. and so, as i started to this job, i see real opportunity for volume improvement, particularly in the food service business. and i'm pressing hard against that.
that means filling the orders we already have and it means selling out the capacity that exists in our network. and both of those have a big opportunity in our company. i also, by the way, look at our cost structures and believe that we've got the ability to run our business in a leaner way and still achieve the growth goals that we want to see in the company. and then, i'd probably finish up by saying that i further believe that on the innovation side, we have lots of runway and lots of opportunity to press hard in the market.
so, i come into role with both confidence and believing that we have a strong pathway ahead.
donnie king -- president and chief executive officer
if i might, ken, just a couple of things. stewart touched in fairly great detail, you know, his prior experience, and he does have great experience coming into tyson. but john randal, you know, he's had experience outside of tyson. he's had escalating levels of responsibility and banking and venture capitalism prior to joining tyson.
but you may not know that within tyson, for the last four years, he's led the m&a strategy, ventures, and other areas of the company. so -- but don't forget about the fact that, you know, he's been involved in this business essentially his whole life. so, a lot of experience there. let me mention amy tu, which you didn't ask about very specifically.
but amy came to us with a great deal of global leadership outside of tyson with boeing and walmart. she has strong experience in m&a, strategy, and commercial, as well as the legal background. and she's a very talented person. and, you know, i'm very happy with what i'm seeing out of all three of these today, and i think they will make us a better tyson as we move forward.
ken zaslow -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
great. i was not minimizing the experience. i just wanted to see the actions, particularly in prepared foods because i sense that, you know, you're in the 8% margin and you're kind of wanting to go to that 8% to 10%. but it sounds like there's a little bit of a touch on operational efficiencies.
my second question would be, as i think about the longer term, and i know there was an allusion to how you can actually get back to the midpoint of the range. what are the concrete actions that you can do? or is it really dependent on the market in terms of just making sure that china remains a key exporter? because that's the single biggest thing that's changed over the last couple of years. so, is it the new environment that you think will get you back there? or do you think that there is internal actions that can be taken to put you back into that margin structure? and with that, i thank you guys.
donnie king -- president and chief executive officer
let me -- ken, thank you. let me just say a couple of things. we think we have a bit of a different business model than we had, let's say, in 2015, when we went through the drought last time. it's already been talked about today in terms of our relationship with these producers that provide us with this better quality grading animals that we have.
i think it's also important to remind you about the global demand is better than previous cycles. and people outside the united states are looking for high-quality, grain-fed u.s. beef. and so, we're able to meet that.
but we've also invested heavily to be able to take boxed beef up the value chain with our investment most recently in eagle mountain, utah, and also in columbia, south carolina. so, we continue to take beef and pork up the value chain. and so, we feel better. we feel -- you know, the drought is real.
we see that. we're not kidding ourselves about that. but we intend to manage through it and perform better than we did the last time through. shane?
shane miller -- group president, fresh meat
yeah. thanks for the question. donnie, i think you hit on all the key points. the only thing i would mention is, you know, no matter what the market conditions are or the cattle supply, we feel good about all these investments to differentiate our beef business model.
and on top of that, if you think about the investments that we've made and we are making into our supply chain on beef and cattle sustainability, these are key important topics that our customers. and, ultimately, the consumer are asking about. and we feel really good about what we're doing there, telling the story back up into the feed yard, but even further back into the ranch and to maintain and preserve resources and have focused on sustainability for the future.
ken zaslow -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
thanks very much. appreciate it. thank you, guys.

good morning, and welcome to the tyson foods fourth quarter 2022 earnings conference call. [operator instructions] please note this event is being recorded. i would now like to turn the conference over to brandon tucker, senior manager, investor relations. please go ahead.
brandon tucker -- senior manager, investor relations
hello, and welcome to the fourth quarter fiscal 2022 earnings conference call for tyson foods. prepared remarks today will be provided by donnie king, president and chief executive officer; and john r. tyson, evp and chief financial officer. additionally, shane miller, group president, fresh meats; stewart glendinning, group president, prepared foods; david bray, group president, poultry; and amy tu, group president, international, and cao, will join the live q&a session.

donnie king -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, brandon. and thank you to everyone for joining us for the call. earlier today, we announced our fourth quarter and total fiscal year 2022 results, which showed record annual financial performance, including revenue, adjusted operating income, and earnings per share. i'm grateful for the hard work and dedication of our team members.
our results would not have been possible without them. in this challenging macroeconomic environment with historically high inflation, consumer demand for protein remains relatively steady. we remain well-positioned to serve this demand. we leveraged our diverse protein portfolio across multiple channels and brands to meet customer and consumer needs across a broad range of products and price points, serving an estimated one-fifth of u.s.
protein consumption. and as proven by our double-digit sales growth, our portfolio of value-added and branded products positions us uniquely to win. in addition to growing sales, we are also aggressively' mitigating inflationary cost and sg&a expenses through disciplined revenue management and enterprisewide productivity actions, including investments in automation to improve operational excellence and efficiency. as we progress our efforts to be the most sought after place to work, we continue to listen to our team members needs and invest in areas, like child care, to provide a better quality of life for our team members.
we're beginning to see results from these investments through improved staffing levels and reduced turnover. before i discuss our financial performance, let me provide a bit of strategic context. as you are well aware, we have a strong and disciplined strategic growth plan. in this past year, we continue to methodically execute against this plan as we strengthened our position as a global protein leader.
our growth strategy is built on five key pillars: transforming our team member experience, growing with our customers to service demand, investing in digital and automation to drive operational excellence, restoring competitiveness in our chicken segment, and leveraging our financial strength to invest in the business and return cash to shareholders. i'm pleased to report that we have executed on each of these imperatives and delivered what we said we would entering the fiscal year. our commitment to strengthening our position as a global protein leader and driving value creation for our shareholders is the most important goal for our team. having the right leadership team in place is also imperative as a global protein leader.
to accomplish this, we recently announced changes in our executive leadership team, which we believe will drive improved results across our organization. overall, we feel good about our performance. we saw a lot of really good things. we delivered record sales, revenue, and earnings.
the chicken turnaround progressed as promised. beef performed better than expected. and prepared foods is seeing positive volume momentum exiting the year. with that strategic context, let's turn to our financial performance.
compared to our initial fiscal year guidance, we exceeded our total company sales and beef margin guidance. and we met guidance on chicken and prepared foods margins. we managed our balance sheet and sit today at a leverage ratio comfortably below our guidance. sales improved 7% for the fourth quarter and 13% year over year.
we delivered record sales revenue as a company and across each of our four largest operating segments. we delivered record annual adjusted operating income of $4.4 billion, up 3% over the prior year. as expected, our fourth quarter earnings were lower compared to the prior year. but this was almost entirely due to record strength in beef a year ago, our operating income performance translated to adjusted earnings per share of $1.63 for the fourth quarter and a record $8.73 for the full year, up 5% from last year.
turning to our results on volume. we're continuing to optimize our existing footprint, add new capacity, adjust our product mix by plan, and match our portfolio more closely with customer and consumer needs. we saw the benefits of our efforts in the fourth quarter as total company volume increased 2.1%. we are building positive momentum and remain confident that our strategy will enable us to grow volumes across all segments long term.
chicken volumes increased 1.1% in the quarter compared to the prior year, driven by increased domestic production. in prepared foods, volumes were relatively flat in the quarter compared to the prior year. we are gaining momentum, delivering sequential quarterly improvement, driven primarily by the strength of our retail brands. the categories in which we play continue to be highly consumer-relevant, with the vast majority remaining elevated relative to pre-pandemic.
in a few slides, we'll discuss our strong share performance. compared to prior year, beef volumes were up 5.1% for the quarter, driven by higher head throughput and carcass weight, improving from a full year volume deficit of 1.5% in the third quarter. we finished a year relatively flat. port volumes were down 1.1% for the quarter compared to prior year due to limited hog supply and reduced export demand.
in international, volumes continue to grow, up 7.3% compared to the prior-year quarter, driven by our investments in capacity, innovation, and brands that support market share growth. as we look ahead, one thing that excites me is the momentum i see in our branded retail business. it is evident that we are delivering the brands and the products that consumers want. with our iconic retail brands, tyson, jimmy dean, hillshire farm, and ball park, tyson core business lines outpaced total food and beverage and our peers in growth, up 18% in volume sales in the last 13 weeks compared to pre-pandemic levels per nielsen data.
according to nielsen data, tyson core business lines grew volume share by 2.6 points this quarter compared to pre-pandemic levels, while also growing share relative to a year ago. we continue to be the market share leader in the majority of the retail core categories in which we compete, while also gaining share in seven of these nine core categories. we experienced the greatest share gains in frozen protein breakfast, smoked sausage, and corn dog category. our brand strength relative to our peers is undeniable, as tyson, jimmy dean, hillshire farm, and ball park all hold favorite brand status with consumers in the categories in which we compete.
many of our retail businesses continue to outperform total food and beverage and remain highly relevant to consumers, and, therefore, elevated in consumption. consumers will continue to spend on relevant categories and brands they know and trust. this data shows the recovery we're seeing versus a year ago and the momentum we are gaining as we move into fiscal 2023. we have made steady progress improving fill rates and on-shelf availability as we focus on serving our current customers and attracting new customers to grow our distribution and volume.
additionally, we took various degrees of pricing in our key categories earlier this fiscal year to offset inflationary cost pressures. recently, we have seen competitors followed by increasing their prices, nearing tyson's price gap relative to our competitors. this is supporting improved volume performance across our portfolio of prepared foods products as we are continuing to see price elasticities remain below historical levels. we're investing strategically in merchandising and advertising to support the long-term health of our brands as their strength enables continued growth in both, dollar and volume retail share.
these factors, along with our strong business fundamentals, resulted in sequential quarterly share growth in many of our key retail category. and we expect our retail share growth to continue. while the food service industry has yet to recover to pre-pandemic traffic levels, the tyson focus 6 group is outpacing both total broadline and respective categories and volume sales, up 18.9% and 0.9 share points in the last 52 weeks compared to last year according to npd supplytrack data. the tyson focus 6 group composed of value-added chicken, breakfast sausage, dinner sausage, pepperoni pizza toppings, bacon, and philly steak is also up 1.7 volume share points in the last 52 weeks compared to pre-pandemic levels.
we believe strongly in our food service portfolio and are confident there is immediate and long-term growth ahead of this business as we align with key growing customers and execute our strategy across all categories to build momentum for the future. our team members are essential to providing the products to our customers and consumers' demand. staffing levels and the impact on operational throughput were a challenge in our business. we continue to make significant investments in our team members' experience, prioritizing these three key areas of health, safety, and well-being of our team members, total rewards and team member growth, and our one tyson culture with digitalization as a key enabler.
we're now seeing business results from investing in becoming the most sought after place to work. examples of these investments are free education, child care solutions, citizenship support, transportation, maternity and paternity leave, and expanded mental health and well-being benefits. in august, we received national recognition for our innovative ride-sharing program benefiting team members across the nation. the program provides an option for team members who may have difficulty assessing reliable transportation to get to work and is improving their quality of life.
investments in enhanced benefits, digitalized processes and tools, and career growth opportunities for our team members are paying off. in october, we announced our one tyson corporate office consolidation to world headquarters in springdale, arkansas. the move will enable excellence and execution by bringing our corporate business unit roles together on one campus, driving a culture that optimizes collaboration, innovation, accelerates speed, and facilitates career growth for our team members. the feedback we've received from our customers for this change has been well received.
these investments we're making in our people are part of our broader effort to evolve our business from an environmental, social, and governance perspective. today, we are focused on three core pillars of our esg framework, the formula to feed the future. those three pillars are reimagining people and community impact, driving product responsibility from farm to table, and working toward achieving net-zero. in july, we released our sustainability report for 2021, which highlights our ambition to become the world's most sustainable and transparent protein company.
in addition to the investments in people mentioned, we also highlighted in our report our efforts around animal welfare, sustainable packaging, minimizing waste, water stewardship, and working within our operations and supply chain to reduce emissions. significant progress was achieved in the past fiscal year in improving our scores and metrics within esg rating agencies. we are particularly proud of a more than 30% increase in our dow jones sustainability index score year over year, and we're taking more steps to continue to improve our standing with esg stakeholders. in the past fiscal year, our productivity program outperformed on our commitments, delivering over $700 million in savings impact across all components of our business.
this performance indicates how tyson has remained focused on optimizing our business processes, digitalizing our supply chain and increasing automation, and aggressively managing sg&a across our operations. we expect the productivity program will continue to outperform our original expectations of more than $1 billion in recurring savings by the end of fiscal year 2024. the program is now on track to deliver this commitment by the end of fiscal year 2023, a year earlier than expected. as mentioned before, these recurring savings support the partial offset of inflationary pressures, while at the same time improving our competitiveness in the marketplace.
automation remains a top priority, and i'm very pleased with the aggressive rollout of automation technologies across all segments in fiscal year 2022, including continuing to scale debone automation in our poultry operations and pack-out automation across all businesses. i will now turn the call over to john to walk us through more detail on our financial results for the fourth quarter.

thank you, donnie. let me turn first to a summary of our total company financial performance. we're pleased to report resilient fourth quarter and record annual performance in the fiscal year. sales were up for both the fourth quarter and fiscal year, benefiting from our pricing initiatives to offset the increase in cost of goods.
volumes were up for the fourth quarter and relatively flat for the full year as we overcame supply constraints in an elevated inflationary environment pressuring consumer demand. looking at our sales results by channel for the fiscal year, retail drove 1.4 billion of top-line improvement, while the ongoing recovery in the food service channel drove an increase of 2 billion. fiscal year sales in international markets, including both domestically and internationally produced products, were 1.3 billion greater than the prior year as we leverage our global scale to grow our business. donnie covered our operating income and earnings per share results, so i won't repeat.
slide 16 bridges operating income for the fiscal year, which was 126 million greater than the fiscal 2021. we significantly improved earnings in our chicken segment and generated higher earnings in prepared foods, which more than offset the expected decline in beef earnings. our pricing actions, which offset the higher input costs, led to higher sales during the year. we saw notable year-over-year increases of 20% to 25% across the business in cost of goods, including labor, feed ingredients, live animals, and freight costs.
investment in growth is our priority. to facilitate this growth, an additional 80 million in sg&a expenses compared to last fiscal year was invested in team members, marketing, advertising, and promotional spend to support our brand and digitalization initiatives, among other things. while sg&a expenses increased, sg&a as a percentage of total sales was down to 4.2% from 4.5% in the prior fiscal year, reflecting our continued focus on assessing all expenses across the business to identify non value-added spend and continuing to build leverage across the scale of our business. as mentioned by donnie, we significantly accelerated our productivity actions to improve efficiency across all segments during the past year, which has had a meaningful positive impact on our margin profile.
our year-to-date results clearly demonstrate that our diverse portfolio supports our growth objectives of growing faster than the overall market, improving operating margins and driving strong returns for our shareholders. now, moving to the beef segment, sales were approximately $4.9 billion for the fourth quarter, down 3% versus the same period last year but up 10% for the fiscal year at nearly $20 billion. sales in the quarter remained strong, supported by higher volume but offset by lower average sales price. global consumer demand for beef products remains strong.
we expect volumes to remain stable next year amid tightening supply of cattle, offset by improved labor participation, supporting higher plant productivity. on expenses, we incurred greater costs during the fiscal year compared to the prior year as live cattle costs increased approximately 2 billion. but we have sufficient livestock available to finish the year, and we continue to have ample supply to support our operations. we delivered segment operating income of 2.5 billion for the year.
and our fiscal year operating margin of 12.5% was a very strong performance by historical standards. we still expect future beef margins to be in a normalized range of 5% to 7% over the long term. looking next to the pork segment, sales were approximately 1.6 billion for the quarter and 6.4 billion for the fiscal year, down 3% and up 2%, respectively, versus the prior year. global demand remains challenged by high domestic retail prices and the strong u.s.
dollar, making u.s. pork relatively expensive as compared to alternative sources globally. for the year, the average sales price increased 4.1%, offsetting the decrease in volume of 1.9%. we expect these headwinds to impact pork volumes next year to a lesser extent than the past year.
segment operating income and margins were 198 million and 3.1%, respectively, for the fiscal year. the operating income deterioration was driven by herd health issues negatively impacting hog costs and a constrained cut out compressing pork margins in the elevated inflationary environment, increasing operating costs overall. while the q4 result was negative operating income, we do expect to flip back to positive returns in q1. moving now to prepared foods, sales were approximately 2.5 billion for the quarter, up 12% relative to the same period last year.
for the fiscal year, sales increased 9.4%, driven by the higher average sales price increase of 13.5%, partially offset by the volume decline of 4.1%, in which 0.9% of the decline was due to the sale of our pet treats business. volume performance improved in the fourth quarter as our investments in brands and merchandising drove an increase in portfolio market share. our fourth quarter result, which was roughly flat versus last year, was our strongest performance this year and better than the competition, which underscores the strength of our brands. we expect volume to grow sequentially next year, driven by food service recovery, improved supply, and continued investment in our brands.
operating margin for the segment was 5.8% or 147 million for the quarter, up 4.1% compared to last year. for the fiscal year, our operating margin was 8.1%, up 0.5% compared to the prior year at 782 million. now, on to the chicken segment's results. sales were 4.6 billion for the quarter, up 19%.
and for the full year, sales were up 24% at 17 billion. volumes improved both for the quarter and fiscal year as we gained momentum in the improvement of our live operations. we expect this operational improvement to continue driving sequential quarterly volume growth into next fiscal year. average sales price increased by approximately 18% for both the quarter and the fiscal year compared to last year.
our shift in pricing mechanisms to more variable structures, allowing us to be more agile in response to market condition, was a key decision by our management team. chicken delivered operating income of 337 million or 7.3% for the fourth quarter and 926 million or 5.5% margin for the total fiscal year. respectively, this represents margin improvement of 10.2% and 5.3% over the prior-year comparable periods. this quarter, we surpassed our goal of processing 40 million head per week by the end of the fiscal year.
we intend to continue to grow next year to 42 million head per week, enabling us to maximize our fixed cost leverage and grow market share along with our value-added business. with live operations on a positive trajectory, we will continue optimizing our plant network and portfolio mix to maximize the profitability of our chicken segment. i am pleased with the tremendous progress we have made against our road map to restoring competitiveness in this business. however, there's still work to do to attain industry-leading performance, and i look forward to more great things to come from the team on this one.
now, turning to slide 20, our healthy cash flows and improved balance sheet have continued to support our disciplined capital allocation approach with a focus on total shareholder return. we remain focused on building financial strength, investing in our team members and business, and returning cash to shareholders. we produced 2.7 billion of operating cash flows in fiscal year '22. this is after funding a 2.1 billion increase in working capital, which included an investment of $1 billion in inventory to better service our customers, as well as the impact of cost inflation.
additionally, we had other planned working capital outflows associated with taxes paid on the divestiture of our pet treats business, payment of a portion of deferred payroll taxes from the cares act, and the settlement of certain legal accruals. our leverage ratio finished the year at 1.3 times net debt-to-adjusted ebitda, demonstrating our powerful balance sheet and our continued capital allocation optionality. investing in our business for both organic and inorganic growth and operational efficiency will continue to be an important priority as we utilize a disciplined capital allocation and balance sheet management approach to invest in desirable projects, brands, categories, and geographies. we also maintain a disciplined m&a approach, investing in opportunities that fit well with our existing portfolio or our growth objectives, such as the recent acquisition in saudi arabia, providing access to the growing halal market.
while m&a will always be a consideration for growth, we're focused first on investing in growth in our existing footprint. this will facilitate tyson increasing production capacity, market capabilities, and profitability, providing return on capital generation above the market and at a minimum of 12% return on invested capital for our shareholders as our long-term target. to address projected demand growth over the next decade, we invested $1.9 billion in our business in the past fiscal year, focused primarily on new capacity and automation objectives. finally, we remain committed to returning cash to shareholders through both dividends and share buybacks.
for the fiscal year, we returned nearly 1.4 billion in cash to shareholders through $653 million in dividends and $702 million of share repurchases as we continue to prioritize shareholder return. let's now discuss the fiscal 2023 financial outlook. we anticipate total company sales between 55 billion and 57 billion, and also expect volume growth compared to the prior fiscal year. both total company sales and volume growth in fiscal '23 will largely be driven by our chicken, prepared foods, and international businesses, as we work to run our plants full, optimizing our existing footprint and utilizing new capacity expansions.
to grow volumes in our chicken, prepared foods, and international businesses, construction is in progress of six new plants, all to be in operation by the end of fiscal 2023. we're building a value-added chicken plant in danville, virginia, and we're growing our bacon business with a new location in bowling green, kentucky. and we're also expanding our footprint and increasing volumes outside the u.s. with three plants going live in china and one in malaysia during 2023.
these investments in the recently announced joint venture partnerships are fueling future growth, both organically and inorganically, in our international business. we remain focused on growing internationally and on those fastest-growing protein consumption markets in the world. now, as we touched on earlier, our productivity program is expected to deliver an additional 300 million to 400 million of savings during fiscal 2023 as we build upon the foundation laid across the enterprise this year with focus on operational and functional excellence, digital solutions, and programmatic automation initiatives. to continue to capitalize upon the organic growth opportunities ahead for our business, we expect to increase capex spending to approximately $2.5 billion during fiscal 2023 to pursue a healthy pipeline of projects with strong return profile.
we currently expect our adjusted tax rate to be around 23%, and we anticipate net interest expense of approximately $320 million. liquidity is expected to significantly exceed our minimum target and net leverage is expected to remain below two times net debt-to-adjusted ebitda. we expect strong and meaningfully better operating cash flows in fiscal 2023 as we do not expect to invest as much in working capital as experienced in the past fiscal year. now, finally, let's look at how each of our segments will contribute to our total company performance.
as mentioned earlier, we continue to expect future beef segment margins to be in a normalized range of 5% to 7% for the long term. however, based on current market dynamics, we expect fiscal 2023 to be at or below the low end of that range. in pork, we expect return on sales between 2% and 4%. due to normal seasonality for our pork segment, we expect the front half of the year to outperform the back half of the year.
we continue to invest behind our expanded case-ready capacity, increasing volume through organic growth with new and existing customers, underpinned by product innovation for both our beef and pork segments. prepared foods is expected to deliver margins during fiscal 2023 between 8% and 10%, driven by volume growth, productivity, and disciplined revenue management. we expect volume, sales revenue, and operating income to all increase through the fiscal year, with stronger quarters in the second half of the year compared to the first half of the year. in chicken, our operational turnaround progress as forecasted, and we are now increasing our focus on optimizing our mix to maximize profitability of our value-added portfolio.
we expect to deliver full year margins of 6% to 8%, driven primarily by progressively growing volume and sales revenue, while at the same time realizing additional operational improvements. and in international, we anticipate improved profitability from our operations in fiscal 2023, driven by volume growth from capacity expansions ramping up. our segments individually and in aggregate have clear and compelling roles within tyson's portfolio strategy. we make products that provide options for consumers across proteins and up and down the value chain, delivering performance that supports the company's long-term earnings objectives and desirable returns for shareholders.
to sum it up, fiscal 2022 was a record year in revenue, operating income, and eps. and as a result, we are in a strong financial position as we enter fiscal 2023 to support continued investment in our existing footprint, new capacity expansion, more automation, and support for our brands as we continue to grow our business. now, before i turn the call over for your questions, i want to take a moment to address an important issue. i'm sure you've seen the news about the recent incident involving me.
i'm embarrassed, and i want to let you know that i take full responsibility for my actions. i also want to apologize to our investors as i have to our employees. this was an incident inconsistent with our company values, as well as my personal values. i just wanted you guys to hear this directly from me and to know that i'm committed to making sure this never happens again.
and with that, i'll turn the call back over to donnie. donnie?
donnie king -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, john. i would like to take a moment to make one final point. like john, the company takes this matter seriously. tyson foods has a strong, robust corporate governance process.
our independent board of directors are overseeing a thorough review of this matter, and i'm confident in this independent process. with this said, and before i turn the call back over to brandon for your questions, i'd like to remind you that 2022 was a record year for sales for operating income, as well as eps. and we look forward to a strong 2023.
brandon tucker -- senior manager, investor relations

[operator instructions] today's first question comes from alexia howard with bernstein. please go ahead.
alexia howard -- alliancebernstein -- analyst
good morning, everyone.
donnie king -- president and chief executive officer
good morning.
john r. tyson -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
good morning.
alexia howard -- alliancebernstein -- analyst
ok. i guess we need to focus in on the chicken segment here. and i know in your prepared remarks, you made some comments about why things came up short this quarter. can you talk about what was the negative, the big negative surprises? chicken prices, it sounds like there was some operational and executional issues.
and also, as we look forward, can you talk about how quickly you expect some of those issues to resolve? and what gives you confidence that they might improve over the remainder of the year? and then i have a follow-up.
donnie king -- president and chief executive officer
ok. alexa, thank you, and thank you for your question. i'll start out with some broad comments, and i will get a little more tactical as it relates to chicken, and then await your next question. but i would just simply tell you that q1 was a very challenging quarter for us as the confluence of several external factors across all businesses.
we saw market swings across all businesses, and they were unpredictable and sizable. but we have opportunities to perform better, and you would never hear me say anything other than that. this is the first time i've seen all markets work against us all at the same time. it's the first time i remember market impacts being greater than those controllables that we have and the opportunity for improvement of them.
as we think about moving forward, efficiency in our operations, in our company will be a focal point for us. there are some places where we need to make decisions faster and, in some cases, better decisions. in some cases, we will need to adjust our business model. and in other cases, the accuracy of our projections has to be better than what we've demonstrated here in q1.
i'd remind you and everyone else that we're not bigger than the market. and then, q1 and over time, markets will do their job, and we simply have to do ours. q2 will be seasonally softer than q1, and the back half will be better than the first half. while the back half will be better than the first half, we feel good about our business outlook.
for example, we knew the beef herd was nearing the bottom of the cycle. we knew pork had heard health issues and that there would be incremental packing capacity coming online. and it did. we did not expect the incremental beef, pork, and chicken in the marketplace domestically in q1, especially in light of the fact that the cost of animal and the cutout or the pricing was declining.
our prepared foods performed as expected, delivering on operating income. we grew share in both dollars and pounds in the quarter. and i would just -- and to remind everyone else before i get into chicken and the details that we have a strong diversified portfolio. and we have confidence in our multi-protein strategy that it will deliver growth and shareholder value.
now, let me let me go a little deeper as it relates to chicken, and we, perhaps, can go even deeper later. in chicken, we have a differentiated model. we have the no. 1 brand in chicken.
we've talked often about the fact that our model doesn't get the highs or lows of the commodity markets. this does not mean we're not impacted. for example, we talked a lot about variable pricing models. we have those, but i would remind you that those pricing models have lags as well.
as we started this year in chicken in particular, we had a good plan. we still like our chicken business, but there were a lot of moving parts in q1. so, what happened in q1? our volume was up 3%, and our harvest pounds were up 15%. this is due to a mix shift from small bird bone-in to more of a boneless product.
and it was part of our strategy. our supply plan is dictated by our demand plan. this is a core tenet of our business. we plan for a strong november to december.
if you'll remember -- for fresh chicken, if you remember, we shorted fresh chicken the last three years in a significant way, and we had a plan in place this holiday season to not have that happen again. november and december were softer than we expected or planned for in retail fresh chicken. this created excess in our retail fresh chicken. because the sales didn't materialize in retail fresh, this triggered a resale or movement of product.
the resale price was much lower than modeled for the original sale. so, to help you a little bit, i would say, just to dimensionalize this, about two-thirds of our miss was market-driven, and about a third of the miss was related to labor, yield, and spend. some of which was associated with the movement of product because of the miss on fresh chicken. the movement of product from one location to another impacted labor, yield, and created incremental freight cost.
we also had some knock-on effects on building inventory as a result of this inventory above our plant. and as a reminder, avian influenza impacted our pricing and volume on both paws and chicken leg quarters in the quarter. there was more chicken, beef, and pork in the market than anticipated. so, you know, it sounds like, you know, a lot of excuses there.
i get that. so, what? now what? what are we doing? i tell you that we still have a great chicken business. we still have a good plan. we are cleaning up and have been cleaning up some issues from q1 that i've talked about earlier.
so, as we think about from this day -- or since q1, we have to control the controllables. i would remind you that we are fully staffed, and we continue to invest in a better workplace experience through automation, etc. we're growing our business servicing our customers and becoming the most sought after place to work, and we will compete with the very best in the chicken space. so, let me pause and let's get a follow-up question, and we'll go from there.
alexia howard -- alliancebernstein -- analyst
thank you for that. just moving quickly to the beef segment. you've given us a range of 2% to 4% on the operating margin side now. prior to that, it was more open-ended, just below your long-term guidance.
what has become clearer? what is more certain now about the outlook for this year? and what gives you the confidence that it will come in within that range and not below it? thank you, and i'll pass it on.
donnie king -- president and chief executive officer
all right. thank you. i will i'll start out on this, and then i will flip it to brady for a few comments. you know, we're moving closer to the bottom or to the trough of the beef cycle.
we, obviously, were surprised of the amount of beef harvested in our q1. there was a lot more beef on the market than what we had expected, particularly, in light of increased pricing -- or excuse me, increased cost of cattle and, at same time, a decline in cutout. so, that was a bit of a surprise to us. that's a miss for us.
but we are moving closer. we know that there are more heifers being harvested. we know there are more cattle being harvested. we know that what those signs are that we are looking for in terms of when the herd would rebuild.
and, you know, it's going to require rain or precipitation. it's going to require the rancher to see more forage and hay availability. those are some of the things you need to look for. but as we've gotten a quarter closer, to answer your question, alexia, we see a little more clearly than now.
we know that the trough is coming, but we wanted to -- the number you see is a conservative number for us and making every effort to make sure that we guide you to where we see q2 and the balance of the year going. and so, brady, let me see if you want to add anything to that. welcome, brady stewart.
brady stewart -- group president, fresh meats
thank you, donnie. and certainly, your points relative to cattle availability and the look into the future is spot-on. the drought, lack of affordable hay and forage, and higher overall supply chain costs are still driving cattle liquidation in parts of the u.s. as we move out of this cycle of the cattle liquidation and start to see some heifer placements into the future, we'll certainly have better visibility to the trough that you mentioned as well, donnie.
why i'm optimistic about the future is the team has worked diligently and effectively to strategically align ourselves with suppliers to ensure we have the supply required relative to higher grading cattle. we feel good about global demand exists, specifically on higher grading beef products. from a macro standpoint, we're seeing some appreciation in job credit values, specifically on specialty products, including fats and oils. and while it is hard to pinpoint the exact bottom based on the current drought and feedstock conditions, we are seeing some moderation and some signs of optimism relative to the drought conditions that will keep an eye on moving into the future.
operator
thank you. and, ladies and gentlemen, our next question today comes from ken goldman at jpmorgan. please go ahead.
ken goldman -- jpmorgan chase and company -- analyst
hi. thank you. i wanted to ask a couple of questions. first, you know, donnie, you made a change at the top in the chicken segment.
can you outline a little bit, you know, which changes are most important as we think about the next few years that you'd like to see and maybe why the change was made now?
donnie king -- president and chief executive officer
sure i'd be happy to. you know, david bray was leaving our poultry business. and, you know, i talked about in q1 that we had some issues as it related to markets and the amount of protein on the market. the change that we made is a result of some of the controllables that i think we made some good decisions.
i'd like to have seen those decisions faster, you know, and, perhaps, some better-quality decisions. and there were things in q1 as it relates to chicken that we could have done better. and i made the change. i went out immediately and recruited wes morris, who -- wes has run many parts of our chicken businesses, he's led our prepared foods business, and he's also led our case-ready beef and pork business.
and i had the opportunity to pick up a great talent with many, many years of experience and knowhow in this business, and we made the change. in terms of the overall organization, you know, shane miller leaving our pork -- or excuse me, our beef and pork business, our fresh meats business, you know, the relocation got changed. shane is still actively engaged in the company. he and brady are working through a transition.
and so, you know, when shane decided he could not move for reasons -- by the way, shane is still trying to figure out how he can get here and be a part of it. there's some personal things that he's got to deal with. but we were fortunate to pick up brady stewart, who was the coo of another company, and he's well versed in our -- in the pork business and the package meats business and could do a number of roles for us going forward. we're very fortunate to be able to pick up both wes and brady in our organization, and we look for great things from them.
but we got a lot of upside and runway in the organization because of them. you know, recently, we announced amy tu leading our international business, along with a few other functions. but, you know, we're excited about amy and what she's doing and her passion for the international market and her passion for growing tyson in international markets. and i feel really good about where we are from an international perspective.
i feel really good about where we are from the chicken perspective and the leadership there. i feel really good about where we are from a beef and pork perspective. if you click down one level as it relates to beef, that team is largely intact moving here. and some have, in fact, already moved here.
so, stewart, you saw the numbers in prepared foods. stewart has done a really nice job of challenging the business and upgrading pork raw material into this branded portfolio that we have. and then, finally today, actually today, melanie boulden is joining us. and so, why melanie, and why a chief growth officer? it was all in an effort to try to get a center of excellence here in springdale, arkansas, around branding, marketing, communication, and innovation.
and melanie has got great experience in consumer packaged goods and, most recently, chief marketing officer in a food and beverage company. so, i'll pause and take a breath right there, ken, and wait for a follow-up.
ken goldman -- jpmorgan chase and company -- analyst
no, no, that's helpful. thank you for that. i guess as my quick follow-up, it's obviously not the most -- the largest segment you have. but since you mentioned international, it's never made money.
and i'm just curious -- i'm not trying to be critical of it because, obviously, it's a -- but in the long run, it's going to be a business that should be very profitable for you and others. but what's the strategy, don? you've taken a much stronger tack toward, i think, profitability and margins and just efficiency than, perhaps, your predecessors have. between you and amy, what is the frac that we should expect that margin to be going on ahead?
donnie king -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, ken. and we do appreciate the interest in our international business. i would tell you that we've invested a great deal in the plant. and, you know, with covid over the last year, particularly in the food service channel, we've had some headwinds with that.
those have lessened. and we're in a sweet spot there in terms of our alignment with global customers, many of which are in the food service channel. but we also have launched a branded portfolio across thailand, malaysia, and china. and we feel good about that.
and they're doing -- the brands are doing really, really well and provide, not only innovation outside the u.s., we also take that innovation, and we add that and we bring some of those things back to the u.s. but we feel good about it. it's been an investment. it's been a long time coming.
but i think you will see here in '23, our international business deliver some really nice results in the way of operating income. amy, anything you would like to add to that?
amy tu -- chief accounting officer and group president, international
ken, thank you for the question and pointing out the profitability or nonprofitability over the last few years. i think don is absolutely right. this is our growth strategy. we've talked about in the past where global population growth will happen.
it will happen outside the united states. and so, we're taking our existing footprint right now and putting in place the kind of execution fundamentals that we need to have. and then, we're also discussing, with our other segments, the opportunities that lie before us, given the raw materials that we have here in the united states. but donnie just put forward exactly what we have outside the united states, which are strong brands.
we're launching smart factories. we are able to do things more quickly outside the united states, which will give us ultimately a benefit for the entire company. so, more to come. but we are very excited about what we see right now.
john r. tyson -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
hey, ken, also -- this is john. and i think it's just worth pointing out. you know, the business has been profitable over the last few years. and on an ebitda basis, you know, we look at something in the high single digits for that.
so, i think there's financial performance to support the continued investment there. but at the right --
ken goldman -- jpmorgan chase and company -- analyst
got it. so, there's more to that. ok. perfect.
thank you, john.
operator
and our next question today comes from ben bienvenu with stephens. please go ahead.
donnie king -- president and chief executive officer
hi, ben.
ben bienvenu -- stephens, inc. -- analyst
hey, good morning.
donnie king -- president and chief executive officer
good morning.
ben bienvenu -- stephens, inc. -- analyst
so, i want to ask a follow-up on chicken. donnie, i think you characterized the underperformance in the first quarter as two-thirds of the market, one-third tyson-specific. as you look forward, understanding that your view is -- and i think we would agree that a recovery is underway in kind of commodity chicken fundamentals, what is the critical path from an internal standpoint to improve that business from here? i think, you know, last year, the focus was hatchability. that was a big opportunity around growing capacity utilization.
what are the focus points as we move through fiscal '23?
donnie king -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, ben. i will make a few remarks, and i'll pass it to wes for a little more detail. you know, as i said in my opening comments and also in the first question, we still feel really good about our chicken business. we think we have a good plan.
yes, we got hit in the mouth in q1 because of all the protein on the market in q1. and our tray pack or fresh chicken business didn't materialize as we had expected. and so, you know, we created our own issue with that because of what happened in the market. but i would tell you, we still have tremendous opportunity and upside as we execute this business.
and it's nothing exciting, but it's the fundamentals of labor and yield and spend and, you know, just maintaining growth in this business to fill up our capacity and service the needs that we have. and i would remind you that -- you and everyone else that we place chickens based on what our demand plan looks like. it's in service of our demand plan. so, you know, as we go back and look at what happened in q1 and think about the future in q1, you know, strategically, the only thing that went awry was the fact that the demand didn't materialize in the place at retail in which we thought it would.
and so that triggered a number of other inefficient moves and activities. but again, we think, with q1, you've seen the numbers. q2 is seasonally softer. but as we start getting toward the, you know, to that q3 time period, you know, we feel good about it.
and we don't have something that's broken here that -- like a hatch issue and a genetics issue. the time horizon for fixing this is much shorter than in many of those things. wes, anything you want to add to that?
wes morris -- group president, poultry
yeah. good morning, ben, and thanks for the opportunity. first, let me say how excited i am to be a part of tyson foods. this is a great chicken company.
it's got great people, great brands, great customers. and i want to echo what donnie said around we did a lot of foundational work and executed it very well. you know, we said we would improve our capacity utilization. we would staff our plants, and they're at a record staffing level.
we've added automation and got some opportunities as we start up that. that negatively impacted our yield in q1. and then, we said we'd rebuild inventory post-covid to better service our customers, and our order fill rate indicates that we did that well. and so, from a live perspective, we performed very well.
the volatility of our hatch numbers are behind us, and we did exactly what we said we were going to do on the live production side. and so, that allows us to focus more of our energy on standing up that automation to its expected results and to make sure we're still meeting the needs of the consumer. but the one thing that's obvious we can do better is understanding the consumer shifts in our business and making sure we got the right amount of birds in the right place at the right time.
ben bienvenu -- stephens, inc. -- analyst
ok. very good. thank you. my second question is on the prepared foods business.
a very strong start to the year. the guidance is unchanged. i know it's early in the year, but implied in the guidance being unchanged is a moderation in the operating margin. so, what is it that we would need to see for that to happen? how much of that is it's early in the year, and you want to get a little bit more of the fiscal year under your belt to adjust that guidance versus an explicit view that things soften from here?
donnie king -- president and chief executive officer
so, let me make a comment, and then i'll flip it over to stewart. you know, in terms of prepared, you know, we did deliver what we said we would in q1. we feel good about that on a go-forward basis with these iconic billion-dollar plus brands that we have. we feel good about that.
stewart said in the last quarter that retail was really, really good. and we had some work to do as it relates to the food service side. and of course, you know, we're still not back to pre-covid levels in the food service channel. and so, there's some upside for that opportunities when that happens, but we need more demand there.
i would tell you, even in all of that, we continue to grow our share in the food service, prepared, and poultry business. but, stewart, why don't you add some color to this?
stewart glendinning -- group president, prepared foods
yeah, thanks for that, donnie. you know, look, food service, as i said last quarter is operating from a very, very strong platform. and investors should expect to see that, you know, over the medium term that that business continues to grow and the profitability improves. in the short run, we've got a job to do on food service, and i believe we're making progress there.
as i look at the pipeline that's developing. very strong performance on retail, but acknowledge that in the first quarter, some of that is seasonal, as you look at some of the sausage breakfast, sausage products that we have. and we're taking some of that benefit. i feel good about the guidance we've given for the year.
there may be a little bit of variability in some of the quarters, but i'm really standing on the fact that this is a solid platform that we can continue to see -- go from strength to strength.
operator
thank you. and our next question today comes from adam samuelson with goldman sachs. please go ahead.
donnie king -- president and chief executive officer
hi, adam.
adam samuelson -- goldman sachs -- analyst
hi. thank you. hi. good morning.
so, i guess coming back to the chicken a little bit more deeply. i guess i'm trying to kind of square kind of the point on market kind of demand dynamics where a bit responsible for pretty unfavorable mix. and, donnie, you talked about your sales volumes in chicken up, like, 2.7%, but harvest up, 15. so, clearly -- and you talked about too much meat in the market.
as i think about your own harvest levels up 15, that would represent a pretty disproportionate amount of the increase in poultry production in the industry in the fourth quarter. and so, i guess i'm just trying to get a sense of when you say market was the source of weakness, is it just pricing? is it mix? or is it just, look, we saw the big bird kind of down, the commodity market pricing was bad? or is it just demand in your highest value channel or higher value channel and retail trade pack, and you had to put that sell that meat into the big bird market at a discount as a lower value?
donnie king -- president and chief executive officer
let me make a few comments, and then i'll let wes add some color to this. you know, the miss for us was clearly in our fresh chicken or tray pack chicken at retail. that was where we stumbled. the demand for our branded retail products was very good, demand for our food service chicken products were all very good.
but the thing that exacerbated this was the amount of overall protein in the marketplace in q1, beef, pork and chicken. while our harvest pounds were up 15%, remember that we are converting all those pounds into a boneless form, right? that's different. that's a mix shift and a strategy change as we get out of some of the more small-bird, whole-body, eight-piece type product. we talked about that last quarter.
we moved into a boneless mix in that area. and we got more to come as it relates to that. but, wes, why don't you cover some of the detail?
wes morris -- group president, poultry
yeah. adam, thanks for the question. you know, like i said before, we executed our plan very well and did exactly what we said we were going to do. but we did have a strategic mix change at less bones.
and then, one of the drivers was the impact of our sales of paws, you know, 2% to 2.5% of a lot of the chicken, depending on what size; rebuilding our safety stock inventory; and then the seasonal increase in inventory to supply wings to the marketplace. but, adam, the way i asked you to think about it is, at a macro level, we did a very good job, and we absolutely had the right number of chickens. we simply had them in the wrong place based on the post-covid changes. and so, we had more than we needed in our fresh chicken business and came up short in some other areas.
adam samuelson -- goldman sachs -- analyst
ok. and then i guess and this goes to both the performance in the quarter and the change in outlook for the balance of the year. just you guys reported in mid-november, nearly halfway through the quarter at that point. just help me understand kind of where the information disconnect was between live production operations and financial planning, that there was this bit of a disconnect in the period.
and in terms of the magnitude of the guided margin change for the rest of the year, is that just continued on favorable mix? is that cost? is that contracting and pricing? i'm just trying to understand the moving pieces on the magnitude of that margin change relative to three months ago.
donnie king -- president and chief executive officer
sure, adam. so, i said earlier that as a way of a reminder that we start with a demand plan and that over the past three years we have not been able to service the demand in fresh chicken at retail. we were trying to correct that at this point. and every demand signal we had said that the demand was going to materialize, and we placed chickens accordingly.
remember, we placed those chickens for that november time frame back in august. and so, you know, we were going -- i understand your point about we're in mid -- you know, we're in november, and we're having the last earnings call. a lot of things from that day forward, you know, the demand didn't show up in fresh chicken. a lot of the other things worked exactly, exactly the way we planned for them.
but that trigger -- think about fresh chicken. you typically put that product in a tray and then -- before you have the order. and when the order doesn't show up, then you have to take it out of the tray or sell it in the tray at a discounted or in a distressed fashion. we had a lot of that in our q1.
and, you know, we've cleaned up that. we're still trying to get ourselves going back again. q2 is going to be seasonally softer, variable pricing models and the lag associated with that. i mean, we'll get caught up with that.
the back half of the year, we feel good about where we're going to be relative to that. and so, wes, that's i think the first question. what about the second one?
wes morris -- group president, poultry
yeah. you know, optimistic about the path forward. you know, the usda projecting q2 numbers around 2%, which is a lot less chicken availability than the 77 increase we saw in q1. then when you couple that with 4% to 5% less cattle, you should have an overall protein per capita that is much smaller than what we saw in q1.
we're already seeing some changes in the marketplace since the end of the quarter. we've seen boneless go up in the quarter. wings are up around $0.14, $0.15. and so, optimistic going forward that the chicken values will correct.
we've talked about variable pricing on a lot of these different calls. and the good news is it's much, much faster than the historical one-year fixed price agreement. but unfortunately, it still has a short-term lag. as these markets correct, it'll take a minute to hit the sell sheet.
john r. tyson -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
hey, adam, this is john, too. and i think there are just a couple of other things that we've said that are worth reemphasizing. you know, one is -- and i think you asked a good question about what was going on, and you talked to us last time in november. i think in addition to all the poultry dynamics that donnie was describing here, i think there's still, you know, a difference of outlook as it relates to beef availability, which, i think, you know, was maybe a little bit of a surprise.
and then, i think as it relates to the outlook for the year, if you just look at kind of what the public data says, i think it's something like 25% to 30% more chicken meat in the freezer. and so, you know, our plans account for working through that, but it does take some time to work through that. and, you know, there are timing differentials between how the market recovers and where our pricing recovers. so, all of that influences just the shape of the year for us.
and i think we've also said this, but just to make sure, you know, the listeners on the call get it today, q2 will be softer for us than q1. and we expect to see a recovery in what is our q3 and q4, the second part of our fiscal year.
operator
thank you then. and a question today comes from robert moskow with credit suisse. please go ahead.
robert moskow -- credit suisse -- analyst
hi. thanks for the question. i guess the follow-up is it sounds like there's no change to your production plan for chicken. i think you had a plan of 42 million head per week.
is that still the same? and i don't know, like, do you still have to harvest 15% more chicken now in order to satisfy the demand that you have three months from now? are you still at a 15% increase in production?
donnie king -- president and chief executive officer
so let me make sure i separate for you -- a great question, by the way. one is head and one is weight. the 15% is weight. the head is different.
we have talked in terms of, in physical '23, by the end of fiscal '23, we would be at about 42 million head a week. and that's still the plan. i would also tell you that the plan is -- i mean the demand is there to support 42 million chickens a week. and if that changes, we'll change.
but that's what we see right now as we look at the demand picture. the other thing that i think to that, and i'll just say it, as we talked about the beef cycle and the pork cycle and herd health and so forth, i think it's -- if you look at what happened in q1, i think every chicken company in america read the headlines around there's going to be less beef, less pork. and the natural belief is that chicken will fill that gap. the problem with all that is there wasn't a gap in beef and pork in q1.
and so, i think you're seeing even now, based on the numbers, wes quoted earlier, you're seeing the adjustments in the marketplace relative to that. but we will always balance our supply with what our demand needs are. and i just -- this is the fundamental tenet of how we operate this business and have operated for many years.
robert moskow -- credit suisse -- analyst
ok. i guess the follow-up is i've gotten questions from investors asking whether this is an indication of much weaker demand from consumers. would you describe it that way? or is it really oversupply that's been the issue and then, in the back half of your fiscal year, you think that that's what's going to correct? it's not really demand needs to get better. it's that the supply needs to normalize.
donnie king -- president and chief executive officer
i think you are spot-on relative to that. and i think you're already seeing adjustments in terms of the supply plan. i would tell you, and i don't want to mislead you or anyone else on this, there's some -- there's unusual erratic, however you choose to describe it, behavior as it relates between channel swapping and even parts of the store and how -- what's going on there. swapping between proteins, all the normal things that you would know from all your years of covering this protein sector, they're all in play.
but i think this is -- i think in q1, this was a supply issue, first and foremost. secondly, there was some shifting in what part of the store and what products were purchased.
operator
thank you. and our next question today comes from ben theurer with barclays. please go ahead.
ben theurer -- barclays -- analyst
yeah. good morning, and thanks for taking my question. just wanted to dig a little bit into -- if you could explain in more detail what happened on the derivatives, in both cases, chicken and pork, and if there was something else outstanding that might go wrong going forward, and how you're planning on trying to not run into this. because i think you said, on pork, without the derivatives, it would have been positive, but then, obviously, because of it were negative.
so, just to understand a little bit of that dynamic. that would be my first question.
john r. tyson -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
hey, ben, this is john. i think maybe just a couple of comments, you know, headlining on kind of how we're using, you know, hedging and derivatives as it relates to risk management kind of overarching strategy. generally speaking, what you would expect from us is, you know, the kind of coverage in the near term and coordinated with what our, you know, sales picture looks like with customers. and we really use it as a margin management tool or any type of speculative tool.
and so, i think that just emphasizing that last point, you know, we would not project any -- you know, there's no outsized bets sitting out there in terms of what the markets are going to be doing. we kind of keep things in close and use it more from a margin management standpoint.
ben theurer -- barclays -- analyst
ok. and then, just from, like, general, within prepared foods, i mean, obviously, you had a very, um, hit a very good quarter. both pricing still nicely up, but, at the same time, volume was actually up. can you help us understand how much of that volume was just recovery in some of the food service things, as you're saying, you still need to catch up here on the volume to get to pre-pandemic levels? and are you seeing any sort of elasticities or any headwinds and some consumers becoming a little more sensible to the price increases? just to understand the volume impact within that as it was still positive?
stewart glendinning -- group president, prepared foods
yeah, sure. stewart here, i'll just pick that up. so, first of all, look, like i said earlier, we have a very, very powerful platform here, both on the retail side and on the food service side. the increase in volume was not driven by food service.
food service, for me, is still a place where there's a lot of work to be done. a good platform, but opportunity to fill some plants, to sell harder against volume that we lost during covid. this was driven by the strength of retail. and what was really impressive in the quarter was the ability of our brands to gain price, to offset some inflation, and also to gain ground with consumers.
but, you know, we're working closely with our customers. we're providing the right level of support for our brands. and i think this the performance in this quarter just demonstrates the real strength of our retail platform. at the same time, there's ground that we can cover in innovation.
i'm pleased the melanie's on board. she's going to be a big help. there's ground we can cover from a productivity standpoint, just in running our operations better. and certainly, we'll start to fill up that food service volume.
operator
thank you. and our next question today comes from michael lavery with piper sandler. please go ahead.
donnie king -- president and chief executive officer
good morning.
michael lavery -- piper sandler -- analyst
thank you. good morning. i just wanted to follow up on the consumer demand piece and just understand, you know, you said you've seen channel shifts and protein shifts and things that sound pretty typical. but in just a few weeks, the elevated snap party is going to be over.
and just curious how you think about for that cohort, which, you know, is a certain demographic, but how do you think about that impact in your planning for the rest of the year?
donnie king -- president and chief executive officer
sure. i will start and then offer it up to anyone else that may have something to add. but, you know, i think it's -- if you look at the information that we see, it says the consumer is working through savings. you know, in the middle of the pandemic, you know, they were able to bank a lot of savings.
and over the last little bit, they've been working through that savings. and i think many consumers are now out of that savings -- those savings and are at least nearing the last of it. and so, you know, i would expect the consumer to be to be under more pressure as we move forward in this year. but i would also remind you that as a company, if you look at our brands and we cover the spectrum across proteins, we have a product for every consumer across various proteins and price points.
so, we feel very good about the fact that we can intersect with that consumer wherever they are, and that -- you know, that's, i think, a good position to be in or the best position you can be in. and so, we'll see how it turns out. but we don't know any more about that than you do today.
john r. tyson -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah, i would add two things to what donnie is saying. number one, if you think about the kind of prepared and retail branded side of our business, we've been paying attention to what the consumer is doing and feeling over the last few quarters, and we continue to today. i think the good news is even in these times where the outlook for the economy is evolving, we've had pretty steady growth and pretty strong performance in that part of our business, which tells us that, well, yeah, there may be a lot of behavioral changes going on in the economy. we see consumers come into the brand in the categories that we're in repeatedly.
so, i think we feel good about that. on the second point i want to make is, you know, from a -- how to say it, you know, the supply and demand balancing on the kind of fresh and frozen more commodity protein side of our business has more influence on how we're performing than does the macro situation because people are going to continue to eat protein. they may cut back on other things, but food is not one of them.
michael lavery -- piper sandler -- analyst
that's helpful. and just a follow-up on the beef spreads. you've called out the drivers of the pressure near term, but any sense of how long before it can rebound? and i know you don't want to get into fiscal '24, really, but maybe any just directional guardrails of how to think about it? is this going to be more of the same for a while? is there something you can point to that's a catalyst one way or the other? just, you know, a little bit maybe longer look, if there's anything you can add there.
donnie king -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. i mean, i wish i could be here before you today and tell you i knew when that was going to happen. but there's kind of some prerequisites before we're going to see that, you know, heifer retention, which is going to be driven by, you know, better precipitation, getting past the drought, and for ranchers to see -- you know, to have hay that's more portable and forage land to be able to feed those animals, i don't think you're going to see heifer retention in a meaningful way until those things occur. and, you know, i've listened to every expert that's been through all these cycles through all these years, and i've been through a couple of them myself.
it's -- you know, i get a number somewhere between the spring of '23 and, you know, the spring of '24. and that's how variable the -- you know, it could be. what i can tell you is the harvest of heifers and the harvest of cows continues. and in a lot of cases, people are paying up for those animals to sell them at a -- for a lesser cutout.
so, that's what i can tell you about it. brady, anything you would add to that?
brady stewart -- group president, fresh meats
no, donnie. i think you covered it very well. we have a different situation today than we have in the past as well relative to some of the interest rates pressures that certainly will have an impact as these ranchers decide to retain heifers as well. so, that, coupled with some of the weather and impacts that we see, certainly create the uncertainty that you outlined.
operator
thank you. and our next question today comes from eric larson with seaport research partners. please go ahead.
eric larson -- seaport research partners -- analyst
yeah. thanks for taking my question. it's on the beef cycle again. and it is -- i guess it's not surprising that we continue to see cow and heifer slaughter.
but i guess the question that i have and it's related to this, we're at 50-year kind of low, you know, on these various cattle sectors. and it seems like the recovery for this will -- it will certainly take quite a bit longer than maybe i would have expected. is that -- and now, when you've got new capacity coming on stream from some more competitors, what does the increase in capacity with, you know, lower and a more sustainable lower supplies mean for, you know, the mid- to longer-term margin for your business.
donnie king -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, i will make a few comments and brady can step in on this. i mean, i think you've described it very well in terms of what the levers are here. everything you've said, i think i agree with what you said and how you characterized. and you've also described this, you know, this future state of where there will be more packing capacity with fewer animals.
and so, if you build the capacity, these are -- you know, for these large plants, you spend $1 billion to build a beef plant. so, if you spend $1 billion to get a beef plant, you're going to process animals. and so, that could, in all likelihood, drive up the price of the cattle that are available at that point. but the -- you're going to get some pushback with the consumer if you try to cover that or try to get cutout to cover that.
so, i see all of the same pressures and dynamics that you just outlined. and it's going to take bit to rebuild the herd. and once we get to whatever that bottom is, i mean, we're looking at two-plus years to be able to see some better times. brady?
brady stewart -- group president, fresh meats
thanks for that, donnie. i think there's a couple of other factors that we need to consider as we come out of this cycle. and one of them is certainly relative to export demand. and we've seen an increase in terms of demand from our export partners relative to higher grading cattle.
i think that is an anomaly relative to cycles that we have certainly seen in the past, and it's something that we will be watching as well. now, we've seen the strength that i mentioned earlier relative to some of the drop values and byproducts as well. so, certainly, combining not only the supply factors that you touched on from a live cattle perspective, but also the demand factors that are going to come into play from both our export customers and our domestic customers is certainly a focal point for us.
eric larson -- seaport research partners -- analyst
thank you, guys.
donnie king -- president and chief executive officer
ok. well --
operator
ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. i'd like to turn it back to management for any final remarks.
john r. tyson -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
sure, this is john again. and just a couple of things to wrap up on we want to make sure we got to cover with you before i hand it to donnie to close it off. i think the first thing, if we think about the top-line guidance that we've given, you know, our outlook there is probably in the bottom half of that range just to kind of crystallize where we are today. and then, i think the second thing is we don't really get to touch on capital allocation today, although i know it's a point of interest for many, many folks.
and our capital expenditure outlook for the year is, you know, firm at or around the $2.5 billion number. but i think what we would guide to, as we look forward, that's probably the high watermark. and, you know, for us, our priorities are kind of preserving financial strength and flexibility, investing for returns in our business, and then, after that, being disciplined on m&a, dividends, and share repo. so, just want to make sure people understood kind of what the outlook was like there.
and, yeah, i think with that, donnie, i'll hand it back to you just to close it out.
donnie king -- president and chief executive officer
all right. thanks, john. we're building a world-class business organization positioned to take advantage of the opportunities in front of us. we remain confident that our strategy will deliver long-term growth and shareholder value.
thank you for your interest in tyson foods, and we look forward to speaking with you soon. goodbye.

donnie king -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, sean, and thank you to everyone on the call for joining. earlier today, we announced our first quarter 2023 results. we delivered solid top-line results with year-over-year revenue and volume growth and continued strength in our share position, providing momentum for the remainder of the fiscal year. compared to record performance in the prior year, first quarter earnings declined, driven by weaker results in chicken, pork, and beef, which more than offset strong performance in prepared foods.
it's important for you to know that we are uniquely positioned to win in an attractive global protein market. we have market-leading brands across diverse portfolio that resonate with consumers as proven by our year-over-year sales and volume growth. we serve an estimated one-fifth of u.s. protein consumption, and we're well positioned to meet consumer demand, which remains steady despite a challenging macroeconomic environment with ongoing elevated levels of inflation.
as we navigate a complex and dynamic operating environment, i'm grateful for our team members whose hard work and dedication make our business operations possible. five key pillars of our strategy are: transforming our team member experience, growing with our customers to service demand, investing in digital and automation to drive operational excellence, restoring competitiveness in our chicken segment, and leveraging our financial strength to invest in the business and return cash to shareholders. in service of these long-term strategic imperatives, i'd like to emphasize that we continue to deliver on our commitments of growing volume by filling up our footprint, solving labor problems, investing in automation, and building inventory to meet customer demand with improved fill rates, all while maintaining a focus on liquidity and financial health. we are confident these investments will pay dividends over the long run, and we remain committed to methodically executing our growth strategy, driving long-term value creation for our shareholders.
now, let me take a moment to discuss our results and shed some light on some of the challenges and outlook. we went into q1 with a good plan, but our overall results were impacted by a confluence of factors, including consumer and customer demand dynamics and the curve of the beef cycle, among other things. allow me to touch on each segment. as we have previously mentioned to you, we've been expecting beef to come under pressure for some time.
with higher cattle prices, we expected overall harvest to slow down. but that hasn't happened yet. as such, we continue to draw on the herd, which continues to decline. this is putting pressure on spread margin in the business.
we tightened our outlook range for the year. for pork, when you account for mark-to-market derivatives in the number, we flip back to breakeven, as expected. but given continued supply and demand dynamics, we lowered our outlook for the year by 200 basis points. for chicken, when compared to expectations from last quarter, a few different things didn't go as planned.
most notably, demand didn't appear in the parts of the market where we had expected. as a result, we had to move things around and we experienced higher cost, a lower price environment, and knock-on effects from a network standpoint. and last, it's worth emphasizing our prepared food segment, which delivered a great result for the quarter. we said we were going to grow dollar share and volume share with the strongest portfolio of brands in the categories where we compete, and we've done just that.
we're feeling good about the outlook for the balance of the year. and our international business continues to build momentum in terms of volume and sales growth. with the end of covid lockdowns, particularly in china, we expect good year-over-year comps. we'll dive deeper into this during the discussion of segment results and the q&a portion of the call.
now, let's turn to our growth numbers. sales improved 2.5% year over year. and as we delivered record first quarter revenue for total company and individually in chicken, prepared foods, and international, and other, we are focused on driving growth in these segments which will enhance our margin profile over time. we continue to see benefits of our efforts to optimize our existing footprint, add new capacity, adjust our product mix by plan, and match our portfolio more closely with customer and consumer needs.
prepared foods revenues increased 8.8% for the quarter, driven by both volume growth and pricing actions implemented in the prior year. positive momentum continues to build in prepared foods as it delivers sequential quarterly improvement in revenue since the fiscal fourth quarter of 2021, driven primarily by the strength of our retail brands. beef revenue was down 5.6% compared to prior year. lower average sales price, driven by the decreased value of beef cutout, more than offset the increased volume from higher headcount throughput.
compared to prior year, report revenue was down 6% for the quarter. this was driven by decreased volume due to balancing supply with customer demand, partly offset by increase in average sales price. chicken revenue increased 9.6% compared to prior year, driven by volume growth from increased domestic production and pricing initiatives in an elevated inflationary cost environment. in international, revenue growth remained strong, up 11.3% compared to prior-year quarter.
this was driven by our investment in capacity, innovation, and brand to support market share growth. in the next few slides, we'll detail our success winning in retail marketplace with our advantaged brands and advantaged categories. the retail categories in which we participate are highly consumer-relevant, with the vast majority remaining elevated relative to pre-pandemic and demonstrating growth over the prior year. with our iconic retail brands, tyson, jimmy dean, hillshire farm and ball park, tyson core business lines outpaced total food and beverage and our peers in volume growth up 9% relative to year ago per nielsen.
tyson core business lines also grew pound share by 2 points this quarter relative to a year ago per nielsen, continuing to be market share leader in most of the retail core categories in which we compete. we delivered both dollar and pound share growth in both the aggregate and across dayparts compared to a year ago, most notably in the morning meal occasion. our brands continue to perform well as we see elasticities below historical levels. additionally, tyson, jimmy dean, hillshire farm, and ball park all hold favorite-brand status with consumers in the categories in which we compete, highlighting our brand strength relative to our peers.
consumer spend on relevant categories and brands they know and trust. the trajectory of our tyson core business lines volume share growth shows the recovery we have seen since april and the momentum we now have. we have improved fuel rates and own ship availability. price gaps relative to competitors have narrowed while we continue to invest in merchandising and advertising to support our brands.
these factors, along with other strong business fundamentals, resulted in sequential quarterly share growth in tyson core business lines, commanding a five-year record-high market share of nearly 28%. it is evident we are delivering the brands and products that consumers desire. while the food service industry has yet to recover to pre-pandemic traffic levels the tyson focus 6 group is outperforming pre-pandemic volume sales, up 2.7 and 1.7 share points in the latest 52 weeks, according to npd supplytrack data. the tyson focus 6 group is also outpacing both total broadline and its respective category, up 11.7% in volume sales and 0.6 share points in the latest 52 weeks compared to last year per npd.
we believe strongly in our food service portfolio and are confident in the path to continue to grow this business as we align with key growing customers to build momentum for the future. our team members are essential to providing the products our customers and consumers demand. we're seeing business results from making significant investments to become the most sought after place to work by investing in our team members' experience. recent highlights include expanding access to benefits with day one eligibility, enhanced parental leave policies, expanding mental health benefits, and citizenship support at no cost to our u.s.
team members. in november, as recognition for our tyson immigration program's commitment to improving the lives of immigrant team members, we received the prestigious keeper of the american dream award from the national immigration forum. we also just completed what we've been calling project next frontier. we're setting the foundation for our hr-shared service model, focused on process and system efficacy and better overall hr service delivery for our team members, setting us up for savings in the future.
i am pleased to report we're also progressing as expected with our north american headquarters consolidation focused on building our one tyson culture. in addition to realizing savings, we are collaborating, innovating, and working with greater speed and agility to serve our customers. i would also like to thank our team members for their dedication that led to tyson foods' no. 1 ranking on fortune magazine's list of the world's most admired companies in food production category for the seventh consecutive year.
following the strong outperformance of expectation in fiscal 2022, the productivity program is on track to meet expectations this fiscal year and to deliver the $1 billion of recurring savings commitments a year earlier than originally promised. we expect this program to translate from a one-time initiative to sustained year-on-year productivity improvements, supporting our bottom line on a continued basis. examples of initiatives in our productivity program include leveraging data analytics to improve inventory visibility, mitigating distress pounds, a direct plant shipment program which continues to bring on new customers and categories, removing miles from the roads, and driving efficiency in our distribution network. this is an example of how our scale drives competitive advantage.
investing heavily in automation, we recently rolled out automated sandwich hand-wrap and burrito assembly capabilities, as well as an automated line to serve snacking production. we have also continued to scale our chicken debone automation across multiple facilities, and we are piloting a robotic tray pack machine that is showing promising results, expanding our smart factory program to digitize our plants to new sites, as well as exploring opportunities to digitize our processes. our progress displays how tyson remains focused on optimizing our business processes, digitalizing the supply chain increasing automation and aggressively managing sg&a across our operations. before i turn the call over to john to walk us through more detail on our financial results for the quarter, some final comments.
our segments, individually and in aggregate, have clear and compelling roles within tyson's portfolio strategy to deliver sustainable, high-quality growth at good value. we have a powerful and diverse portfolio across proteins and channels around the world. we have products for consumers across proteins and price points, delivering performance that supports the company's long-term earnings objectives and desirable return for shareholders. we are modernizing our operations with our productivity program and are building a team positioned to take advantage of the opportunities in front of us.
again, we entered q1 with a good plan to execute our strategy. that led to solid top-line growth and strong performance in prepared foods. market dynamics and some operational inefficiencies impacted our profitability. we see opportunities to become more agile and efficient, which will further improve our operational execution.
we remain committed to executing our growth strategy and are confident we will grow volume, revenue, and operating income in the back half of fiscal year 2023 and have a long runway of growth ahead of us. with that, i will turn the call over to john.
john r. tyson -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thanks, donnie. first, let's review a summary of our total company financial performance. then, we can dive deeper into the details for the individual segments. as donnie stated, sales were up year over year for the first quarter, benefiting from both volume growth and disciplined revenue management to offset elevated inflationary increases in our cost of goods.
looking at our sales results by channel, retail drove 324 million of top-line improvement, led by chicken and prepared foods. our industrial and other channel sales increased by 108 million, led by beef and chicken. and this was offset by slight decreases in sales to the food service and international channels. as expected, given the record shrink of beef a year ago, we delivered lower adjusted operating income than the prior year, 453 million.
this translated to an adjusted earnings per share of $0.85. now, turning to the adjusted operating income bridge. we significantly grew prepared foods earnings in the quarter, but underperformance in chicken, pork, and beef led to $979 million lower operating income compared to the prior year. while pricing actions led to an improvement of 222 million, higher input costs per pound increased cost of goods sold by 1.3 billion.
about two-thirds of this increase was driven by inflationary impacts on raw material and supply chain costs. the remainder was primarily due to a shift to producing more value-added mix, higher labor costs, and unfavorable derivative impacts. excluding the impact of restructuring, sg&a expenses as a percentage of sales were down to 3.7% from 4.3% in the prior fiscal year as we continue to eliminate nonvalue-added spend across our business, while investing to support the future growth of our brands. our productivity program continues to play a critical role in the long-term improvement of our margin profile.
now, to the individual segment results. starting with the beef segment, sales in the quarter remain strong at more than 4.7 billion but were down 5.6% compared to record-high sales in the prior year. volume gains of 2.9% were supported by improved staffing for higher throughput, while the average sales price was down 8.5% due to softer domestic demand for beef. live cattle costs increased approximately 530 million in the quarter as cattle supplies continue to tighten.
net-net, segment operating income for beef was 129 million for an operating margin of 2.7%, off the previous year's historical record first quarter margin of 19%. we saw higher cattle prices as beef herd numbers continue to decline. we will continue to monitor the beef cutout value and balance our supply with customer demand during a period of margin compression, while pushing volume growth in case-ready and premium branded products. although the near-term operating environment remains challenging, we have reasons to believe in our long-term outlook for beef.
this outlook is supported by our investment in strategic supplier relationships that provide higher quality beef, a growing global demand specifically in asia, and the strengthening drop credit, as well as opportunities to shift our beef products up the value pyramid. now, let's look at the pork segment. sales were approximately 1.5 billion for the quarter, down 6% for the record-high in the prior year. average sales price gains of 1.4%, mostly driven by higher-value specialty products, were offset by volume decreases of 7.4%.
international demand for u.s. pork products continues to be impacted by the strong u.s. dollar, while domestic demand is being affected by high retail prices despite the cutout realigning to historical norms. however, we are optimistic that when these factors normalize, demand will improve.
we expect to see continued industry supply challenges in the fiscal year as the producer navigates herd health issues and higher input costs. on expenses, we incurred greater cost as lean hog costs increased approximately 55 million over the prior year. we also experienced an unfavorable year-over-year derivative impact of 35 million. segment operating income is lower than expected, a loss of 19 million for the quarter, down from a profit of 160 million in the prior year.
as we move forward, port margins should be supported over time with the normalization in the strength of the u.s. dollar aiding future export demand, a strengthening drop credit, and additional opportunities to shift pork products up the value pyramid, especially in our case-ready business. now, let's move on to the chicken segments results. sales were a record first quarter high at $4.3 billion, up 9.6% from the prior year.
the sales increase was attributable to a 2.5% uptick in volume and 7.1% gain in pricing compared to the prior-year quarter. volume gains are due to a combination of strategic choices: to maximize our capacity utilization and pursue an optimal mix strategy with products and customers. our pricing results, while improved, were lower than expected. we pegged this to a combination of factors that influence chicken prices, mostly related to total protein availability, notably chicken and beef.
we anticipate these factors easing in the back half of 2023 as beef availability lessens and total poultry harvest normalizes, providing support for improvement in our chicken prices. this fall in commodity chicken prices, driven by heightened protein supply in the market and seasonal demand weakness, does not change our strategy. based on current usda industry poultry placement data, we're optimistic on a forward-looking supply condition in the intermediate term. we intend to grow our domestic production to 42 million head per week during this fiscal year, which should enable us to improve our fixed cost leverage, grow volume, and gain market share.
we'll continue optimizing our plant network and portfolio mix to maximize the profitability of our chicken segment, particularly by growing our portfolio of value-added products which remain in high demand. operating income in the quarter was negatively impacted by 225 million of higher feed ingredient costs and unfavorable year-over-year derivative impact of approximately 40 million. net-net, our chicken segment delivered operating income of $77 million in the first quarter. we see significant room for improvement in the long-term operating margin of our chicken segment, as there is still work to do to attain industry leading performance.
and we are optimistic it can be achieved due to the following: our diversified value added portfolio with lower margin volatility; our brand strength with the highest consumer awareness and brand loyalty, according to nielsen data; our growth strategy, taking advantage of existing capacity; optimization of our portfolio by shifting from commodity to value-added products; and last, a further implementation of our productivity program as we ramp up more automation. last, i want to turn to our prepared foods business. in this segment, we had a solid quarter with growth in both revenue and volume. this was driven by strong brands, increased support for our customers, and pricing aimed at recovering in the continued inflation.
revenue was approximately 2.5 billion for a record first quarter, up 8.8% compared to the prior year. volume gains of 1.2% were driven by strength in retail, notably jimmy dean, and improved customer fulfillment despite decreased volumes in food service. this quarter was our third sequential quarter of volume growth, and we saw significant pricing power of our portfolio with a year-over-year increase of 7.6%. driven by top-line growth and productivity savings, we delivered segment operating income of 266 million for the quarter.
the operating margin of 10.5% was up from 8% in the prior year. we're very pleased with the performance of this quarter in prepared foods as this segment is critical to drive profitable growth for tyson by valuing our beef, pork, and chicken commodity meat products. we continue to be optimistic for the outlook of this segment due to the following. our diversified portfolio meets consumers across meal-eating occasions and snacking occasions in all sales channels.
we are outperforming our competition in retail with room to grow further market household penetration. our comprehensive food service portfolio has opportunity to grow by regaining lost customers and broadening our customer base. we've got additional operational efficiencies to unlock by increasing plant utilization, in addition to the implementation of our various productivity initiatives. and finally, we have an opportunity to innovate, expand, and acquire into new spaces through new offerings, the growth of our existing products, and attractive, disciplined approach to m&a.
now, turning to talk about our financial position. building financial strength, investing in our business, and returning cash to shareholders remain the priorities of our capital allocation strategy. we produced operating cash flows of 762 million for the quarter, and our leverage ratio finished the quarter at 1.6 times net debt to adjusted ebitda, demonstrating our commitment to a sound balance sheet. focused primarily on new capacity and automation objectives, we invested nearly 600 million into our business in the first quarter to capitalize on projected demand growth over the next decade.
investment in the business, both organically and inorganically, is expected to generate returns at or above our 12% return on invested capital target over time. our capital allocation priorities are first to invest in growth and productivity in our existing footprint. then, we will employ a disciplined m&a approach by investing in opportunities that fit well with our existing portfolio. next, we remain focused on returning cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.
notably, we will continue to support and grow the dividend for our shareholders as evidenced by its continuous payments since 1977, an annual increases each fiscal year since 2013. our approach to share buybacks will continue to be managing for dilution and entering the market opportunistically when assessing for multiple factors. we returned nearly 500 million in cash to shareholders in the quarter through $169 million in dividends and $313 million of share repurchases. at tyson, we utilize a disciplined capital allocation approach to invest in our business for both organic and inorganic growth, and we return cash to shareholders while maintaining a robust balance sheet.
now, let's turn to the fiscal 2023 financial outlook. we are maintaining our total company sales guidance of $55 billion to $57 billion, which implies a 3% to 7% sales growth for the year. supported by the factors detailed earlier, we expect future beef segment margins to be in a normalized range of 5% to 7% in the long term. however, based on current market dynamics, we now expect to perform between 2% and 4% this fiscal year.
given the result in pork in the first quarter, we are lowering margin guidance for the year to be between zero and 2%. counter to normal seasonality for our pork segment, we expect the back half of the year to outperform the first half of the year. for our poultry business, we now expect full year margins to be between 2% and 4% but gaining momentum through the year and exiting the fourth quarter at a margin above this range. prepared foods had a strong first quarter and performance.
as this is historically normal seasonality for the segment, we're maintaining our expected full year margin performance to be between 8% and 10%. in international, we continue to see volume and sales growth year over year. and we anticipate improved profitability in fiscal 2023, driven by volume and revenue growth from new facilities ramping up. we remain committed to growing our business internationally, representing the fastest growing protein consumption markets in the world.
our expectation for capex for the remainder of the year is unchanged at approximately $2.5 billion. our expectations for productivity savings remain unchanged at $300 million to $400 million. our net interest expense and tax rate are now expected to be around $330 million and 24%, respectively. we remain committed to our investment grade rating and managing our net leverage ratio to be at or below two times net debt to adjusted ebitda over the long term, providing optionality for inorganic investment and additional return of cash to shareholders.
in summary, we had a slower start than expected but are optimistic on the outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year and long term. we have a great team, growing demand for our products, strong portfolio diversity, and a differentiated asset footprint needed to win in the marketplace. overall, we see some persistent market factors, some operational challenges, and some expected seasonality influencing our second quarter results. and therefore, we're expecting total company volume, revenue, and operating income to be meaningfully stronger in the second half of the year compared to the first half of the year.
we remain in a strong financial position to support continued investment in our existing footprint, productivity, and the support of our brands as we continue to grow our business and provide desirable returns for our shareholders. so, with all that, i'll turn the call back over to sean for q&a instructions.
sean cornett -- vice president, investor relations
thanks, john. we will now move on to your questions. please recall our cautions on forward-looking statements and non-gaap measures apply to both our prepared remarks and the following q&a. operator, please provide the q&a instructions.

[operator instructions] today's first question comes from alexia howard with bernstein. please go ahead.
alexia howard -- alliancebernstein -- analyst
good morning, everyone.
donnie king -- president and chief executive officer
good morning.
john r. tyson -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
good morning.
alexia howard -- alliancebernstein -- analyst
ok. i guess we need to focus in on the chicken segment here. and i know in your prepared remarks, you made some comments about why things came up short this quarter. can you talk about what was the negative, the big negative surprises? chicken prices, it sounds like there was some operational and executional issues.
and also, as we look forward, can you talk about how quickly you expect some of those issues to resolve? and what gives you confidence that they might improve over the remainder of the year? and then i have a follow-up.
donnie king -- president and chief executive officer
ok. alexa, thank you, and thank you for your question. i'll start out with some broad comments, and i will get a little more tactical as it relates to chicken, and then await your next question. but i would just simply tell you that q1 was a very challenging quarter for us as the confluence of several external factors across all businesses.
we saw market swings across all businesses, and they were unpredictable and sizable. but we have opportunities to perform better, and you would never hear me say anything other than that. this is the first time i've seen all markets work against us all at the same time. it's the first time i remember market impacts being greater than those controllables that we have and the opportunity for improvement of them.
as we think about moving forward, efficiency in our operations, in our company will be a focal point for us. there are some places where we need to make decisions faster and, in some cases, better decisions. in some cases, we will need to adjust our business model. and in other cases, the accuracy of our projections has to be better than what we've demonstrated here in q1.
i'd remind you and everyone else that we're not bigger than the market. and then, q1 and over time, markets will do their job, and we simply have to do ours. q2 will be seasonally softer than q1, and the back half will be better than the first half. while the back half will be better than the first half, we feel good about our business outlook.
for example, we knew the beef herd was nearing the bottom of the cycle. we knew pork had heard health issues and that there would be incremental packing capacity coming online. and it did. we did not expect the incremental beef, pork, and chicken in the marketplace domestically in q1, especially in light of the fact that the cost of animal and the cutout or the pricing was declining.
our prepared foods performed as expected, delivering on operating income. we grew share in both dollars and pounds in the quarter. and i would just -- and to remind everyone else before i get into chicken and the details that we have a strong diversified portfolio. and we have confidence in our multi-protein strategy that it will deliver growth and shareholder value.
now, let me let me go a little deeper as it relates to chicken, and we, perhaps, can go even deeper later. in chicken, we have a differentiated model. we have the no. 1 brand in chicken.
we've talked often about the fact that our model doesn't get the highs or lows of the commodity markets. this does not mean we're not impacted. for example, we talked a lot about variable pricing models. we have those, but i would remind you that those pricing models have lags as well.
as we started this year in chicken in particular, we had a good plan. we still like our chicken business, but there were a lot of moving parts in q1. so, what happened in q1? our volume was up 3%, and our harvest pounds were up 15%. this is due to a mix shift from small bird bone-in to more of a boneless product.
and it was part of our strategy. our supply plan is dictated by our demand plan. this is a core tenet of our business. we plan for a strong november to december.
if you'll remember -- for fresh chicken, if you remember, we shorted fresh chicken the last three years in a significant way, and we had a plan in place this holiday season to not have that happen again. november and december were softer than we expected or planned for in retail fresh chicken. this created excess in our retail fresh chicken. because the sales didn't materialize in retail fresh, this triggered a resale or movement of product.
the resale price was much lower than modeled for the original sale. so, to help you a little bit, i would say, just to dimensionalize this, about two-thirds of our miss was market-driven, and about a third of the miss was related to labor, yield, and spend. some of which was associated with the movement of product because of the miss on fresh chicken. the movement of product from one location to another impacted labor, yield, and created incremental freight cost.
we also had some knock-on effects on building inventory as a result of this inventory above our plant. and as a reminder, avian influenza impacted our pricing and volume on both paws and chicken leg quarters in the quarter. there was more chicken, beef, and pork in the market than anticipated. so, you know, it sounds like, you know, a lot of excuses there.
i get that. so, what? now what? what are we doing? i tell you that we still have a great chicken business. we still have a good plan. we are cleaning up and have been cleaning up some issues from q1 that i've talked about earlier.
so, as we think about from this day -- or since q1, we have to control the controllables. i would remind you that we are fully staffed, and we continue to invest in a better workplace experience through automation, etc. we're growing our business servicing our customers and becoming the most sought after place to work, and we will compete with the very best in the chicken space. so, let me pause and let's get a follow-up question, and we'll go from there.
alexia howard -- alliancebernstein -- analyst
thank you for that. just moving quickly to the beef segment. you've given us a range of 2% to 4% on the operating margin side now. prior to that, it was more open-ended, just below your long-term guidance.
what has become clearer? what is more certain now about the outlook for this year? and what gives you the confidence that it will come in within that range and not below it? thank you, and i'll pass it on.
donnie king -- president and chief executive officer
all right. thank you. i will i'll start out on this, and then i will flip it to brady for a few comments. you know, we're moving closer to the bottom or to the trough of the beef cycle.
we, obviously, were surprised of the amount of beef harvested in our q1. there was a lot more beef on the market than what we had expected, particularly, in light of increased pricing -- or excuse me, increased cost of cattle and, at same time, a decline in cutout. so, that was a bit of a surprise to us. that's a miss for us.
but we are moving closer. we know that there are more heifers being harvested. we know there are more cattle being harvested. we know that what those signs are that we are looking for in terms of when the herd would rebuild.
and, you know, it's going to require rain or precipitation. it's going to require the rancher to see more forage and hay availability. those are some of the things you need to look for. but as we've gotten a quarter closer, to answer your question, alexia, we see a little more clearly than now.
we know that the trough is coming, but we wanted to -- the number you see is a conservative number for us and making every effort to make sure that we guide you to where we see q2 and the balance of the year going. and so, brady, let me see if you want to add anything to that. welcome, brady stewart.
brady stewart -- group president, fresh meats
thank you, donnie. and certainly, your points relative to cattle availability and the look into the future is spot-on. the drought, lack of affordable hay and forage, and higher overall supply chain costs are still driving cattle liquidation in parts of the u.s. as we move out of this cycle of the cattle liquidation and start to see some heifer placements into the future, we'll certainly have better visibility to the trough that you mentioned as well, donnie.
why i'm optimistic about the future is the team has worked diligently and effectively to strategically align ourselves with suppliers to ensure we have the supply required relative to higher grading cattle. we feel good about global demand exists, specifically on higher grading beef products. from a macro standpoint, we're seeing some appreciation in job credit values, specifically on specialty products, including fats and oils. and while it is hard to pinpoint the exact bottom based on the current drought and feedstock conditions, we are seeing some moderation and some signs of optimism relative to the drought conditions that will keep an eye on moving into the future.
operator
thank you. and, ladies and gentlemen, our next question today comes from ken goldman at jpmorgan. please go ahead.
ken goldman -- jpmorgan chase and company -- analyst
hi. thank you. i wanted to ask a couple of questions. first, you know, donnie, you made a change at the top in the chicken segment.
can you outline a little bit, you know, which changes are most important as we think about the next few years that you'd like to see and maybe why the change was made now?
donnie king -- president and chief executive officer
sure i'd be happy to. you know, david bray was leaving our poultry business. and, you know, i talked about in q1 that we had some issues as it related to markets and the amount of protein on the market. the change that we made is a result of some of the controllables that i think we made some good decisions.
i'd like to have seen those decisions faster, you know, and, perhaps, some better-quality decisions. and there were things in q1 as it relates to chicken that we could have done better. and i made the change. i went out immediately and recruited wes morris, who -- wes has run many parts of our chicken businesses, he's led our prepared foods business, and he's also led our case-ready beef and pork business.
and i had the opportunity to pick up a great talent with many, many years of experience and knowhow in this business, and we made the change. in terms of the overall organization, you know, shane miller leaving our pork -- or excuse me, our beef and pork business, our fresh meats business, you know, the relocation got changed. shane is still actively engaged in the company. he and brady are working through a transition.
and so, you know, when shane decided he could not move for reasons -- by the way, shane is still trying to figure out how he can get here and be a part of it. there's some personal things that he's got to deal with. but we were fortunate to pick up brady stewart, who was the coo of another company, and he's well versed in our -- in the pork business and the package meats business and could do a number of roles for us going forward. we're very fortunate to be able to pick up both wes and brady in our organization, and we look for great things from them.
but we got a lot of upside and runway in the organization because of them. you know, recently, we announced amy tu leading our international business, along with a few other functions. but, you know, we're excited about amy and what she's doing and her passion for the international market and her passion for growing tyson in international markets. and i feel really good about where we are from an international perspective.
i feel really good about where we are from the chicken perspective and the leadership there. i feel really good about where we are from a beef and pork perspective. if you click down one level as it relates to beef, that team is largely intact moving here. and some have, in fact, already moved here.
so, stewart, you saw the numbers in prepared foods. stewart has done a really nice job of challenging the business and upgrading pork raw material into this branded portfolio that we have. and then, finally today, actually today, melanie boulden is joining us. and so, why melanie, and why a chief growth officer? it was all in an effort to try to get a center of excellence here in springdale, arkansas, around branding, marketing, communication, and innovation.
and melanie has got great experience in consumer packaged goods and, most recently, chief marketing officer in a food and beverage company. so, i'll pause and take a breath right there, ken, and wait for a follow-up.
ken goldman -- jpmorgan chase and company -- analyst
no, no, that's helpful. thank you for that. i guess as my quick follow-up, it's obviously not the most -- the largest segment you have. but since you mentioned international, it's never made money.
and i'm just curious -- i'm not trying to be critical of it because, obviously, it's a -- but in the long run, it's going to be a business that should be very profitable for you and others. but what's the strategy, don? you've taken a much stronger tack toward, i think, profitability and margins and just efficiency than, perhaps, your predecessors have. between you and amy, what is the frac that we should expect that margin to be going on ahead?
donnie king -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, ken. and we do appreciate the interest in our international business. i would tell you that we've invested a great deal in the plant. and, you know, with covid over the last year, particularly in the food service channel, we've had some headwinds with that.
those have lessened. and we're in a sweet spot there in terms of our alignment with global customers, many of which are in the food service channel. but we also have launched a branded portfolio across thailand, malaysia, and china. and we feel good about that.
and they're doing -- the brands are doing really, really well and provide, not only innovation outside the u.s., we also take that innovation, and we add that and we bring some of those things back to the u.s. but we feel good about it. it's been an investment. it's been a long time coming.
but i think you will see here in '23, our international business deliver some really nice results in the way of operating income. amy, anything you would like to add to that?
amy tu -- chief accounting officer and group president, international
ken, thank you for the question and pointing out the profitability or nonprofitability over the last few years. i think don is absolutely right. this is our growth strategy. we've talked about in the past where global population growth will happen.
it will happen outside the united states. and so, we're taking our existing footprint right now and putting in place the kind of execution fundamentals that we need to have. and then, we're also discussing, with our other segments, the opportunities that lie before us, given the raw materials that we have here in the united states. but donnie just put forward exactly what we have outside the united states, which are strong brands.
we're launching smart factories. we are able to do things more quickly outside the united states, which will give us ultimately a benefit for the entire company. so, more to come. but we are very excited about what we see right now.
john r. tyson -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
hey, ken, also -- this is john. and i think it's just worth pointing out. you know, the business has been profitable over the last few years. and on an ebitda basis, you know, we look at something in the high single digits for that.
so, i think there's financial performance to support the continued investment there. but at the right --
ken goldman -- jpmorgan chase and company -- analyst
got it. so, there's more to that. ok. perfect.
thank you, john.
operator
and our next question today comes from ben bienvenu with stephens. please go ahead.
donnie king -- president and chief executive officer
hi, ben.
ben bienvenu -- stephens, inc. -- analyst
hey, good morning.
donnie king -- president and chief executive officer
good morning.
ben bienvenu -- stephens, inc. -- analyst
so, i want to ask a follow-up on chicken. donnie, i think you characterized the underperformance in the first quarter as two-thirds of the market, one-third tyson-specific. as you look forward, understanding that your view is -- and i think we would agree that a recovery is underway in kind of commodity chicken fundamentals, what is the critical path from an internal standpoint to improve that business from here? i think, you know, last year, the focus was hatchability. that was a big opportunity around growing capacity utilization.
what are the focus points as we move through fiscal '23?
donnie king -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, ben. i will make a few remarks, and i'll pass it to wes for a little more detail. you know, as i said in my opening comments and also in the first question, we still feel really good about our chicken business. we think we have a good plan.
yes, we got hit in the mouth in q1 because of all the protein on the market in q1. and our tray pack or fresh chicken business didn't materialize as we had expected. and so, you know, we created our own issue with that because of what happened in the market. but i would tell you, we still have tremendous opportunity and upside as we execute this business.
and it's nothing exciting, but it's the fundamentals of labor and yield and spend and, you know, just maintaining growth in this business to fill up our capacity and service the needs that we have. and i would remind you that -- you and everyone else that we place chickens based on what our demand plan looks like. it's in service of our demand plan. so, you know, as we go back and look at what happened in q1 and think about the future in q1, you know, strategically, the only thing that went awry was the fact that the demand didn't materialize in the place at retail in which we thought it would.
and so that triggered a number of other inefficient moves and activities. but again, we think, with q1, you've seen the numbers. q2 is seasonally softer. but as we start getting toward the, you know, to that q3 time period, you know, we feel good about it.
and we don't have something that's broken here that -- like a hatch issue and a genetics issue. the time horizon for fixing this is much shorter than in many of those things. wes, anything you want to add to that?
wes morris -- group president, poultry
yeah. good morning, ben, and thanks for the opportunity. first, let me say how excited i am to be a part of tyson foods. this is a great chicken company.
it's got great people, great brands, great customers. and i want to echo what donnie said around we did a lot of foundational work and executed it very well. you know, we said we would improve our capacity utilization. we would staff our plants, and they're at a record staffing level.
we've added automation and got some opportunities as we start up that. that negatively impacted our yield in q1. and then, we said we'd rebuild inventory post-covid to better service our customers, and our order fill rate indicates that we did that well. and so, from a live perspective, we performed very well.
the volatility of our hatch numbers are behind us, and we did exactly what we said we were going to do on the live production side. and so, that allows us to focus more of our energy on standing up that automation to its expected results and to make sure we're still meeting the needs of the consumer. but the one thing that's obvious we can do better is understanding the consumer shifts in our business and making sure we got the right amount of birds in the right place at the right time.
ben bienvenu -- stephens, inc. -- analyst
ok. very good. thank you. my second question is on the prepared foods business.
a very strong start to the year. the guidance is unchanged. i know it's early in the year, but implied in the guidance being unchanged is a moderation in the operating margin. so, what is it that we would need to see for that to happen? how much of that is it's early in the year, and you want to get a little bit more of the fiscal year under your belt to adjust that guidance versus an explicit view that things soften from here?
donnie king -- president and chief executive officer
so, let me make a comment, and then i'll flip it over to stewart. you know, in terms of prepared, you know, we did deliver what we said we would in q1. we feel good about that on a go-forward basis with these iconic billion-dollar plus brands that we have. we feel good about that.
stewart said in the last quarter that retail was really, really good. and we had some work to do as it relates to the food service side. and of course, you know, we're still not back to pre-covid levels in the food service channel. and so, there's some upside for that opportunities when that happens, but we need more demand there.
i would tell you, even in all of that, we continue to grow our share in the food service, prepared, and poultry business. but, stewart, why don't you add some color to this?
stewart glendinning -- group president, prepared foods
yeah, thanks for that, donnie. you know, look, food service, as i said last quarter is operating from a very, very strong platform. and investors should expect to see that, you know, over the medium term that that business continues to grow and the profitability improves. in the short run, we've got a job to do on food service, and i believe we're making progress there.
as i look at the pipeline that's developing. very strong performance on retail, but acknowledge that in the first quarter, some of that is seasonal, as you look at some of the sausage breakfast, sausage products that we have. and we're taking some of that benefit. i feel good about the guidance we've given for the year.
there may be a little bit of variability in some of the quarters, but i'm really standing on the fact that this is a solid platform that we can continue to see -- go from strength to strength.
operator
thank you. and our next question today comes from adam samuelson with goldman sachs. please go ahead.
donnie king -- president and chief executive officer
hi, adam.
adam samuelson -- goldman sachs -- analyst
hi. thank you. hi. good morning.
so, i guess coming back to the chicken a little bit more deeply. i guess i'm trying to kind of square kind of the point on market kind of demand dynamics where a bit responsible for pretty unfavorable mix. and, donnie, you talked about your sales volumes in chicken up, like, 2.7%, but harvest up, 15. so, clearly -- and you talked about too much meat in the market.
as i think about your own harvest levels up 15, that would represent a pretty disproportionate amount of the increase in poultry production in the industry in the fourth quarter. and so, i guess i'm just trying to get a sense of when you say market was the source of weakness, is it just pricing? is it mix? or is it just, look, we saw the big bird kind of down, the commodity market pricing was bad? or is it just demand in your highest value channel or higher value channel and retail trade pack, and you had to put that sell that meat into the big bird market at a discount as a lower value?
donnie king -- president and chief executive officer
let me make a few comments, and then i'll let wes add some color to this. you know, the miss for us was clearly in our fresh chicken or tray pack chicken at retail. that was where we stumbled. the demand for our branded retail products was very good, demand for our food service chicken products were all very good.
but the thing that exacerbated this was the amount of overall protein in the marketplace in q1, beef, pork and chicken. while our harvest pounds were up 15%, remember that we are converting all those pounds into a boneless form, right? that's different. that's a mix shift and a strategy change as we get out of some of the more small-bird, whole-body, eight-piece type product. we talked about that last quarter.
we moved into a boneless mix in that area. and we got more to come as it relates to that. but, wes, why don't you cover some of the detail?
wes morris -- group president, poultry
yeah. adam, thanks for the question. you know, like i said before, we executed our plan very well and did exactly what we said we were going to do. but we did have a strategic mix change at less bones.
and then, one of the drivers was the impact of our sales of paws, you know, 2% to 2.5% of a lot of the chicken, depending on what size; rebuilding our safety stock inventory; and then the seasonal increase in inventory to supply wings to the marketplace. but, adam, the way i asked you to think about it is, at a macro level, we did a very good job, and we absolutely had the right number of chickens. we simply had them in the wrong place based on the post-covid changes. and so, we had more than we needed in our fresh chicken business and came up short in some other areas.
adam samuelson -- goldman sachs -- analyst
ok. and then i guess and this goes to both the performance in the quarter and the change in outlook for the balance of the year. just you guys reported in mid-november, nearly halfway through the quarter at that point. just help me understand kind of where the information disconnect was between live production operations and financial planning, that there was this bit of a disconnect in the period.
and in terms of the magnitude of the guided margin change for the rest of the year, is that just continued on favorable mix? is that cost? is that contracting and pricing? i'm just trying to understand the moving pieces on the magnitude of that margin change relative to three months ago.
donnie king -- president and chief executive officer
sure, adam. so, i said earlier that as a way of a reminder that we start with a demand plan and that over the past three years we have not been able to service the demand in fresh chicken at retail. we were trying to correct that at this point. and every demand signal we had said that the demand was going to materialize, and we placed chickens accordingly.
remember, we placed those chickens for that november time frame back in august. and so, you know, we were going -- i understand your point about we're in mid -- you know, we're in november, and we're having the last earnings call. a lot of things from that day forward, you know, the demand didn't show up in fresh chicken. a lot of the other things worked exactly, exactly the way we planned for them.
but that trigger -- think about fresh chicken. you typically put that product in a tray and then -- before you have the order. and when the order doesn't show up, then you have to take it out of the tray or sell it in the tray at a discounted or in a distressed fashion. we had a lot of that in our q1.
and, you know, we've cleaned up that. we're still trying to get ourselves going back again. q2 is going to be seasonally softer, variable pricing models and the lag associated with that. i mean, we'll get caught up with that.
the back half of the year, we feel good about where we're going to be relative to that. and so, wes, that's i think the first question. what about the second one?
wes morris -- group president, poultry
yeah. you know, optimistic about the path forward. you know, the usda projecting q2 numbers around 2%, which is a lot less chicken availability than the 77 increase we saw in q1. then when you couple that with 4% to 5% less cattle, you should have an overall protein per capita that is much smaller than what we saw in q1.
we're already seeing some changes in the marketplace since the end of the quarter. we've seen boneless go up in the quarter. wings are up around $0.14, $0.15. and so, optimistic going forward that the chicken values will correct.
we've talked about variable pricing on a lot of these different calls. and the good news is it's much, much faster than the historical one-year fixed price agreement. but unfortunately, it still has a short-term lag. as these markets correct, it'll take a minute to hit the sell sheet.
john r. tyson -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
hey, adam, this is john, too. and i think there are just a couple of other things that we've said that are worth reemphasizing. you know, one is -- and i think you asked a good question about what was going on, and you talked to us last time in november. i think in addition to all the poultry dynamics that donnie was describing here, i think there's still, you know, a difference of outlook as it relates to beef availability, which, i think, you know, was maybe a little bit of a surprise.
and then, i think as it relates to the outlook for the year, if you just look at kind of what the public data says, i think it's something like 25% to 30% more chicken meat in the freezer. and so, you know, our plans account for working through that, but it does take some time to work through that. and, you know, there are timing differentials between how the market recovers and where our pricing recovers. so, all of that influences just the shape of the year for us.
and i think we've also said this, but just to make sure, you know, the listeners on the call get it today, q2 will be softer for us than q1. and we expect to see a recovery in what is our q3 and q4, the second part of our fiscal year.
operator
thank you then. and a question today comes from robert moskow with credit suisse. please go ahead.
robert moskow -- credit suisse -- analyst
hi. thanks for the question. i guess the follow-up is it sounds like there's no change to your production plan for chicken. i think you had a plan of 42 million head per week.
is that still the same? and i don't know, like, do you still have to harvest 15% more chicken now in order to satisfy the demand that you have three months from now? are you still at a 15% increase in production?
donnie king -- president and chief executive officer
so let me make sure i separate for you -- a great question, by the way. one is head and one is weight. the 15% is weight. the head is different.
we have talked in terms of, in physical '23, by the end of fiscal '23, we would be at about 42 million head a week. and that's still the plan. i would also tell you that the plan is -- i mean the demand is there to support 42 million chickens a week. and if that changes, we'll change.
but that's what we see right now as we look at the demand picture. the other thing that i think to that, and i'll just say it, as we talked about the beef cycle and the pork cycle and herd health and so forth, i think it's -- if you look at what happened in q1, i think every chicken company in america read the headlines around there's going to be less beef, less pork. and the natural belief is that chicken will fill that gap. the problem with all that is there wasn't a gap in beef and pork in q1.
and so, i think you're seeing even now, based on the numbers, wes quoted earlier, you're seeing the adjustments in the marketplace relative to that. but we will always balance our supply with what our demand needs are. and i just -- this is the fundamental tenet of how we operate this business and have operated for many years.
robert moskow -- credit suisse -- analyst
ok. i guess the follow-up is i've gotten questions from investors asking whether this is an indication of much weaker demand from consumers. would you describe it that way? or is it really oversupply that's been the issue and then, in the back half of your fiscal year, you think that that's what's going to correct? it's not really demand needs to get better. it's that the supply needs to normalize.
donnie king -- president and chief executive officer
i think you are spot-on relative to that. and i think you're already seeing adjustments in terms of the supply plan. i would tell you, and i don't want to mislead you or anyone else on this, there's some -- there's unusual erratic, however you choose to describe it, behavior as it relates between channel swapping and even parts of the store and how -- what's going on there. swapping between proteins, all the normal things that you would know from all your years of covering this protein sector, they're all in play.
but i think this is -- i think in q1, this was a supply issue, first and foremost. secondly, there was some shifting in what part of the store and what products were purchased.
operator
thank you. and our next question today comes from ben theurer with barclays. please go ahead.
ben theurer -- barclays -- analyst
yeah. good morning, and thanks for taking my question. just wanted to dig a little bit into -- if you could explain in more detail what happened on the derivatives, in both cases, chicken and pork, and if there was something else outstanding that might go wrong going forward, and how you're planning on trying to not run into this. because i think you said, on pork, without the derivatives, it would have been positive, but then, obviously, because of it were negative.
so, just to understand a little bit of that dynamic. that would be my first question.
john r. tyson -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
hey, ben, this is john. i think maybe just a couple of comments, you know, headlining on kind of how we're using, you know, hedging and derivatives as it relates to risk management kind of overarching strategy. generally speaking, what you would expect from us is, you know, the kind of coverage in the near term and coordinated with what our, you know, sales picture looks like with customers. and we really use it as a margin management tool or any type of speculative tool.
and so, i think that just emphasizing that last point, you know, we would not project any -- you know, there's no outsized bets sitting out there in terms of what the markets are going to be doing. we kind of keep things in close and use it more from a margin management standpoint.
ben theurer -- barclays -- analyst
ok. and then, just from, like, general, within prepared foods, i mean, obviously, you had a very, um, hit a very good quarter. both pricing still nicely up, but, at the same time, volume was actually up. can you help us understand how much of that volume was just recovery in some of the food service things, as you're saying, you still need to catch up here on the volume to get to pre-pandemic levels? and are you seeing any sort of elasticities or any headwinds and some consumers becoming a little more sensible to the price increases? just to understand the volume impact within that as it was still positive?
stewart glendinning -- group president, prepared foods
yeah, sure. stewart here, i'll just pick that up. so, first of all, look, like i said earlier, we have a very, very powerful platform here, both on the retail side and on the food service side. the increase in volume was not driven by food service.
food service, for me, is still a place where there's a lot of work to be done. a good platform, but opportunity to fill some plants, to sell harder against volume that we lost during covid. this was driven by the strength of retail. and what was really impressive in the quarter was the ability of our brands to gain price, to offset some inflation, and also to gain ground with consumers.
but, you know, we're working closely with our customers. we're providing the right level of support for our brands. and i think this the performance in this quarter just demonstrates the real strength of our retail platform. at the same time, there's ground that we can cover in innovation.
i'm pleased the melanie's on board. she's going to be a big help. there's ground we can cover from a productivity standpoint, just in running our operations better. and certainly, we'll start to fill up that food service volume.
operator
thank you. and our next question today comes from michael lavery with piper sandler. please go ahead.
donnie king -- president and chief executive officer
good morning.
michael lavery -- piper sandler -- analyst
thank you. good morning. i just wanted to follow up on the consumer demand piece and just understand, you know, you said you've seen channel shifts and protein shifts and things that sound pretty typical. but in just a few weeks, the elevated snap party is going to be over.
and just curious how you think about for that cohort, which, you know, is a certain demographic, but how do you think about that impact in your planning for the rest of the year?
donnie king -- president and chief executive officer
sure. i will start and then offer it up to anyone else that may have something to add. but, you know, i think it's -- if you look at the information that we see, it says the consumer is working through savings. you know, in the middle of the pandemic, you know, they were able to bank a lot of savings.
and over the last little bit, they've been working through that savings. and i think many consumers are now out of that savings -- those savings and are at least nearing the last of it. and so, you know, i would expect the consumer to be to be under more pressure as we move forward in this year. but i would also remind you that as a company, if you look at our brands and we cover the spectrum across proteins, we have a product for every consumer across various proteins and price points.
so, we feel very good about the fact that we can intersect with that consumer wherever they are, and that -- you know, that's, i think, a good position to be in or the best position you can be in. and so, we'll see how it turns out. but we don't know any more about that than you do today.
john r. tyson -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah, i would add two things to what donnie is saying. number one, if you think about the kind of prepared and retail branded side of our business, we've been paying attention to what the consumer is doing and feeling over the last few quarters, and we continue to today. i think the good news is even in these times where the outlook for the economy is evolving, we've had pretty steady growth and pretty strong performance in that part of our business, which tells us that, well, yeah, there may be a lot of behavioral changes going on in the economy. we see consumers come into the brand in the categories that we're in repeatedly.
so, i think we feel good about that. on the second point i want to make is, you know, from a -- how to say it, you know, the supply and demand balancing on the kind of fresh and frozen more commodity protein side of our business has more influence on how we're performing than does the macro situation because people are going to continue to eat protein. they may cut back on other things, but food is not one of them.
michael lavery -- piper sandler -- analyst
that's helpful. and just a follow-up on the beef spreads. you've called out the drivers of the pressure near term, but any sense of how long before it can rebound? and i know you don't want to get into fiscal '24, really, but maybe any just directional guardrails of how to think about it? is this going to be more of the same for a while? is there something you can point to that's a catalyst one way or the other? just, you know, a little bit maybe longer look, if there's anything you can add there.
donnie king -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. i mean, i wish i could be here before you today and tell you i knew when that was going to happen. but there's kind of some prerequisites before we're going to see that, you know, heifer retention, which is going to be driven by, you know, better precipitation, getting past the drought, and for ranchers to see -- you know, to have hay that's more portable and forage land to be able to feed those animals, i don't think you're going to see heifer retention in a meaningful way until those things occur. and, you know, i've listened to every expert that's been through all these cycles through all these years, and i've been through a couple of them myself.
it's -- you know, i get a number somewhere between the spring of '23 and, you know, the spring of '24. and that's how variable the -- you know, it could be. what i can tell you is the harvest of heifers and the harvest of cows continues. and in a lot of cases, people are paying up for those animals to sell them at a -- for a lesser cutout.
so, that's what i can tell you about it. brady, anything you would add to that?
brady stewart -- group president, fresh meats
no, donnie. i think you covered it very well. we have a different situation today than we have in the past as well relative to some of the interest rates pressures that certainly will have an impact as these ranchers decide to retain heifers as well. so, that, coupled with some of the weather and impacts that we see, certainly create the uncertainty that you outlined.
operator
thank you. and our next question today comes from eric larson with seaport research partners. please go ahead.
eric larson -- seaport research partners -- analyst
yeah. thanks for taking my question. it's on the beef cycle again. and it is -- i guess it's not surprising that we continue to see cow and heifer slaughter.
but i guess the question that i have and it's related to this, we're at 50-year kind of low, you know, on these various cattle sectors. and it seems like the recovery for this will -- it will certainly take quite a bit longer than maybe i would have expected. is that -- and now, when you've got new capacity coming on stream from some more competitors, what does the increase in capacity with, you know, lower and a more sustainable lower supplies mean for, you know, the mid- to longer-term margin for your business.
donnie king -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, i will make a few comments and brady can step in on this. i mean, i think you've described it very well in terms of what the levers are here. everything you've said, i think i agree with what you said and how you characterized. and you've also described this, you know, this future state of where there will be more packing capacity with fewer animals.
and so, if you build the capacity, these are -- you know, for these large plants, you spend $1 billion to build a beef plant. so, if you spend $1 billion to get a beef plant, you're going to process animals. and so, that could, in all likelihood, drive up the price of the cattle that are available at that point. but the -- you're going to get some pushback with the consumer if you try to cover that or try to get cutout to cover that.
so, i see all of the same pressures and dynamics that you just outlined. and it's going to take bit to rebuild the herd. and once we get to whatever that bottom is, i mean, we're looking at two-plus years to be able to see some better times. brady?
brady stewart -- group president, fresh meats
thanks for that, donnie. i think there's a couple of other factors that we need to consider as we come out of this cycle. and one of them is certainly relative to export demand. and we've seen an increase in terms of demand from our export partners relative to higher grading cattle.
i think that is an anomaly relative to cycles that we have certainly seen in the past, and it's something that we will be watching as well. now, we've seen the strength that i mentioned earlier relative to some of the drop values and byproducts as well. so, certainly, combining not only the supply factors that you touched on from a live cattle perspective, but also the demand factors that are going to come into play from both our export customers and our domestic customers is certainly a focal point for us.
eric larson -- seaport research partners -- analyst
thank you, guys.
donnie king -- president and chief executive officer
ok. well --
operator
ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. i'd like to turn it back to management for any final remarks.
john r. tyson -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
sure, this is john again. and just a couple of things to wrap up on we want to make sure we got to cover with you before i hand it to donnie to close it off. i think the first thing, if we think about the top-line guidance that we've given, you know, our outlook there is probably in the bottom half of that range just to kind of crystallize where we are today. and then, i think the second thing is we don't really get to touch on capital allocation today, although i know it's a point of interest for many, many folks.
and our capital expenditure outlook for the year is, you know, firm at or around the $2.5 billion number. but i think what we would guide to, as we look forward, that's probably the high watermark. and, you know, for us, our priorities are kind of preserving financial strength and flexibility, investing for returns in our business, and then, after that, being disciplined on m&a, dividends, and share repo. so, just want to make sure people understood kind of what the outlook was like there.
and, yeah, i think with that, donnie, i'll hand it back to you just to close it out.
donnie king -- president and chief executive officer
all right. thanks, john. we're building a world-class business organization positioned to take advantage of the opportunities in front of us. we remain confident that our strategy will deliver long-term growth and shareholder value.
thank you for your interest in tyson foods, and we look forward to speaking with you soon. goodbye.

operator
good morning, and welcome to the tyson foods first quarter 2023 earnings conference call. [operator instructions] i would now like to turn the conference over to sean cornett, vice president, investor relations. please go ahead, sir.
sean cornett -- vice president, investor relations
good morning, and welcome to tyson foods' fiscal first quarter 2023 earnings conference call. prepared remarks today will be provided by donnie king, president and chief executive officer; and john r. tyson, executive vice president and chief financial officer. additionally, brady stewart, group president, fresh meats; stewart glendinning, group president, prepared foods; wes morris, group president, poultry; and amy tu, president, international, and chief administrative officer, will join the live q&a session.
we prepared presentation slides to supplement our comments, which are available on the investor relations section of the tyson website and through the link on our webcast. during today's call, we will make forward-looking statements regarding our expectations for the future. these forward-looking statements made during this call are provided pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995. forward-looking statements include comments reflecting our expectations, assumptions, or beliefs about future events or performance that do not relate solely to historical period.

for reconciliations of these non-gaap measures to their corresponding gaap measures. please refer to our earnings press release. now, i'll turn the call over to don. 
donnie king -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, sean, and thank you to everyone on the call for joining. earlier today, we announced our first quarter 2023 results. we delivered solid top-line results with year-over-year revenue and volume growth and continued strength in our share position, providing momentum for the remainder of the fiscal year. compared to record performance in the prior year, first quarter earnings declined, driven by weaker results in chicken, pork, and beef, which more than offset strong performance in prepared foods.
it's important for you to know that we are uniquely positioned to win in an attractive global protein market. we have market-leading brands across diverse portfolio that resonate with consumers as proven by our year-over-year sales and volume growth. we serve an estimated one-fifth of u.s. protein consumption, and we're well positioned to meet consumer demand, which remains steady despite a challenging macroeconomic environment with ongoing elevated levels of inflation.
as we navigate a complex and dynamic operating environment, i'm grateful for our team members whose hard work and dedication make our business operations possible. five key pillars of our strategy are: transforming our team member experience, growing with our customers to service demand, investing in digital and automation to drive operational excellence, restoring competitiveness in our chicken segment, and leveraging our financial strength to invest in the business and return cash to shareholders. in service of these long-term strategic imperatives, i'd like to emphasize that we continue to deliver on our commitments of growing volume by filling up our footprint, solving labor problems, investing in automation, and building inventory to meet customer demand with improved fill rates, all while maintaining a focus on liquidity and financial health. we are confident these investments will pay dividends over the long run, and we remain committed to methodically executing our growth strategy, driving long-term value creation for our shareholders.
now, let me take a moment to discuss our results and shed some light on some of the challenges and outlook. we went into q1 with a good plan, but our overall results were impacted by a confluence of factors, including consumer and customer demand dynamics and the curve of the beef cycle, among other things. allow me to touch on each segment. as we have previously mentioned to you, we've been expecting beef to come under pressure for some time.
with higher cattle prices, we expected overall harvest to slow down. but that hasn't happened yet. as such, we continue to draw on the herd, which continues to decline. this is putting pressure on spread margin in the business.
we tightened our outlook range for the year. for pork, when you account for mark-to-market derivatives in the number, we flip back to breakeven, as expected. but given continued supply and demand dynamics, we lowered our outlook for the year by 200 basis points. for chicken, when compared to expectations from last quarter, a few different things didn't go as planned.
most notably, demand didn't appear in the parts of the market where we had expected. as a result, we had to move things around and we experienced higher cost, a lower price environment, and knock-on effects from a network standpoint. and last, it's worth emphasizing our prepared food segment, which delivered a great result for the quarter. we said we were going to grow dollar share and volume share with the strongest portfolio of brands in the categories where we compete, and we've done just that.
we're feeling good about the outlook for the balance of the year. and our international business continues to build momentum in terms of volume and sales growth. with the end of covid lockdowns, particularly in china, we expect good year-over-year comps. we'll dive deeper into this during the discussion of segment results and the q&a portion of the call.
now, let's turn to our growth numbers. sales improved 2.5% year over year. and as we delivered record first quarter revenue for total company and individually in chicken, prepared foods, and international, and other, we are focused on driving growth in these segments which will enhance our margin profile over time. we continue to see benefits of our efforts to optimize our existing footprint, add new capacity, adjust our product mix by plan, and match our portfolio more closely with customer and consumer needs.
prepared foods revenues increased 8.8% for the quarter, driven by both volume growth and pricing actions implemented in the prior year. positive momentum continues to build in prepared foods as it delivers sequential quarterly improvement in revenue since the fiscal fourth quarter of 2021, driven primarily by the strength of our retail brands. beef revenue was down 5.6% compared to prior year. lower average sales price, driven by the decreased value of beef cutout, more than offset the increased volume from higher headcount throughput.
compared to prior year, report revenue was down 6% for the quarter. this was driven by decreased volume due to balancing supply with customer demand, partly offset by increase in average sales price. chicken revenue increased 9.6% compared to prior year, driven by volume growth from increased domestic production and pricing initiatives in an elevated inflationary cost environment. in international, revenue growth remained strong, up 11.3% compared to prior-year quarter.
this was driven by our investment in capacity, innovation, and brand to support market share growth. in the next few slides, we'll detail our success winning in retail marketplace with our advantaged brands and advantaged categories. the retail categories in which we participate are highly consumer-relevant, with the vast majority remaining elevated relative to pre-pandemic and demonstrating growth over the prior year. with our iconic retail brands, tyson, jimmy dean, hillshire farm and ball park, tyson core business lines outpaced total food and beverage and our peers in volume growth up 9% relative to year ago per nielsen.
tyson core business lines also grew pound share by 2 points this quarter relative to a year ago per nielsen, continuing to be market share leader in most of the retail core categories in which we compete. we delivered both dollar and pound share growth in both the aggregate and across dayparts compared to a year ago, most notably in the morning meal occasion. our brands continue to perform well as we see elasticities below historical levels. additionally, tyson, jimmy dean, hillshire farm, and ball park all hold favorite-brand status with consumers in the categories in which we compete, highlighting our brand strength relative to our peers.
consumer spend on relevant categories and brands they know and trust. the trajectory of our tyson core business lines volume share growth shows the recovery we have seen since april and the momentum we now have. we have improved fuel rates and own ship availability. price gaps relative to competitors have narrowed while we continue to invest in merchandising and advertising to support our brands.
these factors, along with other strong business fundamentals, resulted in sequential quarterly share growth in tyson core business lines, commanding a five-year record-high market share of nearly 28%. it is evident we are delivering the brands and products that consumers desire. while the food service industry has yet to recover to pre-pandemic traffic levels the tyson focus 6 group is outperforming pre-pandemic volume sales, up 2.7 and 1.7 share points in the latest 52 weeks, according to npd supplytrack data. the tyson focus 6 group is also outpacing both total broadline and its respective category, up 11.7% in volume sales and 0.6 share points in the latest 52 weeks compared to last year per npd.
we believe strongly in our food service portfolio and are confident in the path to continue to grow this business as we align with key growing customers to build momentum for the future. our team members are essential to providing the products our customers and consumers demand. we're seeing business results from making significant investments to become the most sought after place to work by investing in our team members' experience. recent highlights include expanding access to benefits with day one eligibility, enhanced parental leave policies, expanding mental health benefits, and citizenship support at no cost to our u.s.
team members. in november, as recognition for our tyson immigration program's commitment to improving the lives of immigrant team members, we received the prestigious keeper of the american dream award from the national immigration forum. we also just completed what we've been calling project next frontier. we're setting the foundation for our hr-shared service model, focused on process and system efficacy and better overall hr service delivery for our team members, setting us up for savings in the future.
i am pleased to report we're also progressing as expected with our north american headquarters consolidation focused on building our one tyson culture. in addition to realizing savings, we are collaborating, innovating, and working with greater speed and agility to serve our customers. i would also like to thank our team members for their dedication that led to tyson foods' no. 1 ranking on fortune magazine's list of the world's most admired companies in food production category for the seventh consecutive year.
following the strong outperformance of expectation in fiscal 2022, the productivity program is on track to meet expectations this fiscal year and to deliver the $1 billion of recurring savings commitments a year earlier than originally promised. we expect this program to translate from a one-time initiative to sustained year-on-year productivity improvements, supporting our bottom line on a continued basis. examples of initiatives in our productivity program include leveraging data analytics to improve inventory visibility, mitigating distress pounds, a direct plant shipment program which continues to bring on new customers and categories, removing miles from the roads, and driving efficiency in our distribution network. this is an example of how our scale drives competitive advantage.
investing heavily in automation, we recently rolled out automated sandwich hand-wrap and burrito assembly capabilities, as well as an automated line to serve snacking production. we have also continued to scale our chicken debone automation across multiple facilities, and we are piloting a robotic tray pack machine that is showing promising results, expanding our smart factory program to digitize our plants to new sites, as well as exploring opportunities to digitize our processes. our progress displays how tyson remains focused on optimizing our business processes, digitalizing the supply chain increasing automation and aggressively managing sg&a across our operations. before i turn the call over to john to walk us through more detail on our financial results for the quarter, some final comments.
our segments, individually and in aggregate, have clear and compelling roles within tyson's portfolio strategy to deliver sustainable, high-quality growth at good value. we have a powerful and diverse portfolio across proteins and channels around the world. we have products for consumers across proteins and price points, delivering performance that supports the company's long-term earnings objectives and desirable return for shareholders. we are modernizing our operations with our productivity program and are building a team positioned to take advantage of the opportunities in front of us.
again, we entered q1 with a good plan to execute our strategy. that led to solid top-line growth and strong performance in prepared foods. market dynamics and some operational inefficiencies impacted our profitability. we see opportunities to become more agile and efficient, which will further improve our operational execution.
we remain committed to executing our growth strategy and are confident we will grow volume, revenue, and operating income in the back half of fiscal year 2023 and have a long runway of growth ahead of us. with that, i will turn the call over to john.
john r. tyson -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thanks, donnie. first, let's review a summary of our total company financial performance. then, we can dive deeper into the details for the individual segments. as donnie stated, sales were up year over year for the first quarter, benefiting from both volume growth and disciplined revenue management to offset elevated inflationary increases in our cost of goods.
looking at our sales results by channel, retail drove 324 million of top-line improvement, led by chicken and prepared foods. our industrial and other channel sales increased by 108 million, led by beef and chicken. and this was offset by slight decreases in sales to the food service and international channels. as expected, given the record shrink of beef a year ago, we delivered lower adjusted operating income than the prior year, 453 million.
this translated to an adjusted earnings per share of $0.85. now, turning to the adjusted operating income bridge. we significantly grew prepared foods earnings in the quarter, but underperformance in chicken, pork, and beef led to $979 million lower operating income compared to the prior year. while pricing actions led to an improvement of 222 million, higher input costs per pound increased cost of goods sold by 1.3 billion.
about two-thirds of this increase was driven by inflationary impacts on raw material and supply chain costs. the remainder was primarily due to a shift to producing more value-added mix, higher labor costs, and unfavorable derivative impacts. excluding the impact of restructuring, sg&a expenses as a percentage of sales were down to 3.7% from 4.3% in the prior fiscal year as we continue to eliminate nonvalue-added spend across our business, while investing to support the future growth of our brands. our productivity program continues to play a critical role in the long-term improvement of our margin profile.
now, to the individual segment results. starting with the beef segment, sales in the quarter remain strong at more than 4.7 billion but were down 5.6% compared to record-high sales in the prior year. volume gains of 2.9% were supported by improved staffing for higher throughput, while the average sales price was down 8.5% due to softer domestic demand for beef. live cattle costs increased approximately 530 million in the quarter as cattle supplies continue to tighten.
net-net, segment operating income for beef was 129 million for an operating margin of 2.7%, off the previous year's historical record first quarter margin of 19%. we saw higher cattle prices as beef herd numbers continue to decline. we will continue to monitor the beef cutout value and balance our supply with customer demand during a period of margin compression, while pushing volume growth in case-ready and premium branded products. although the near-term operating environment remains challenging, we have reasons to believe in our long-term outlook for beef.
this outlook is supported by our investment in strategic supplier relationships that provide higher quality beef, a growing global demand specifically in asia, and the strengthening drop credit, as well as opportunities to shift our beef products up the value pyramid. now, let's look at the pork segment. sales were approximately 1.5 billion for the quarter, down 6% for the record-high in the prior year. average sales price gains of 1.4%, mostly driven by higher-value specialty products, were offset by volume decreases of 7.4%.
international demand for u.s. pork products continues to be impacted by the strong u.s. dollar, while domestic demand is being affected by high retail prices despite the cutout realigning to historical norms. however, we are optimistic that when these factors normalize, demand will improve.
we expect to see continued industry supply challenges in the fiscal year as the producer navigates herd health issues and higher input costs. on expenses, we incurred greater cost as lean hog costs increased approximately 55 million over the prior year. we also experienced an unfavorable year-over-year derivative impact of 35 million. segment operating income is lower than expected, a loss of 19 million for the quarter, down from a profit of 160 million in the prior year.
as we move forward, port margins should be supported over time with the normalization in the strength of the u.s. dollar aiding future export demand, a strengthening drop credit, and additional opportunities to shift pork products up the value pyramid, especially in our case-ready business. now, let's move on to the chicken segments results. sales were a record first quarter high at $4.3 billion, up 9.6% from the prior year.
the sales increase was attributable to a 2.5% uptick in volume and 7.1% gain in pricing compared to the prior-year quarter. volume gains are due to a combination of strategic choices: to maximize our capacity utilization and pursue an optimal mix strategy with products and customers. our pricing results, while improved, were lower than expected. we pegged this to a combination of factors that influence chicken prices, mostly related to total protein availability, notably chicken and beef.
we anticipate these factors easing in the back half of 2023 as beef availability lessens and total poultry harvest normalizes, providing support for improvement in our chicken prices. this fall in commodity chicken prices, driven by heightened protein supply in the market and seasonal demand weakness, does not change our strategy. based on current usda industry poultry placement data, we're optimistic on a forward-looking supply condition in the intermediate term. we intend to grow our domestic production to 42 million head per week during this fiscal year, which should enable us to improve our fixed cost leverage, grow volume, and gain market share.
we'll continue optimizing our plant network and portfolio mix to maximize the profitability of our chicken segment, particularly by growing our portfolio of value-added products which remain in high demand. operating income in the quarter was negatively impacted by 225 million of higher feed ingredient costs and unfavorable year-over-year derivative impact of approximately 40 million. net-net, our chicken segment delivered operating income of $77 million in the first quarter. we see significant room for improvement in the long-term operating margin of our chicken segment, as there is still work to do to attain industry leading performance.
and we are optimistic it can be achieved due to the following: our diversified value added portfolio with lower margin volatility; our brand strength with the highest consumer awareness and brand loyalty, according to nielsen data; our growth strategy, taking advantage of existing capacity; optimization of our portfolio by shifting from commodity to value-added products; and last, a further implementation of our productivity program as we ramp up more automation. last, i want to turn to our prepared foods business. in this segment, we had a solid quarter with growth in both revenue and volume. this was driven by strong brands, increased support for our customers, and pricing aimed at recovering in the continued inflation.
revenue was approximately 2.5 billion for a record first quarter, up 8.8% compared to the prior year. volume gains of 1.2% were driven by strength in retail, notably jimmy dean, and improved customer fulfillment despite decreased volumes in food service. this quarter was our third sequential quarter of volume growth, and we saw significant pricing power of our portfolio with a year-over-year increase of 7.6%. driven by top-line growth and productivity savings, we delivered segment operating income of 266 million for the quarter.
the operating margin of 10.5% was up from 8% in the prior year. we're very pleased with the performance of this quarter in prepared foods as this segment is critical to drive profitable growth for tyson by valuing our beef, pork, and chicken commodity meat products. we continue to be optimistic for the outlook of this segment due to the following. our diversified portfolio meets consumers across meal-eating occasions and snacking occasions in all sales channels.
we are outperforming our competition in retail with room to grow further market household penetration. our comprehensive food service portfolio has opportunity to grow by regaining lost customers and broadening our customer base. we've got additional operational efficiencies to unlock by increasing plant utilization, in addition to the implementation of our various productivity initiatives. and finally, we have an opportunity to innovate, expand, and acquire into new spaces through new offerings, the growth of our existing products, and attractive, disciplined approach to m&a.
now, turning to talk about our financial position. building financial strength, investing in our business, and returning cash to shareholders remain the priorities of our capital allocation strategy. we produced operating cash flows of 762 million for the quarter, and our leverage ratio finished the quarter at 1.6 times net debt to adjusted ebitda, demonstrating our commitment to a sound balance sheet. focused primarily on new capacity and automation objectives, we invested nearly 600 million into our business in the first quarter to capitalize on projected demand growth over the next decade.
investment in the business, both organically and inorganically, is expected to generate returns at or above our 12% return on invested capital target over time. our capital allocation priorities are first to invest in growth and productivity in our existing footprint. then, we will employ a disciplined m&a approach by investing in opportunities that fit well with our existing portfolio. next, we remain focused on returning cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.
notably, we will continue to support and grow the dividend for our shareholders as evidenced by its continuous payments since 1977, an annual increases each fiscal year since 2013. our approach to share buybacks will continue to be managing for dilution and entering the market opportunistically when assessing for multiple factors. we returned nearly 500 million in cash to shareholders in the quarter through $169 million in dividends and $313 million of share repurchases. at tyson, we utilize a disciplined capital allocation approach to invest in our business for both organic and inorganic growth, and we return cash to shareholders while maintaining a robust balance sheet.
now, let's turn to the fiscal 2023 financial outlook. we are maintaining our total company sales guidance of $55 billion to $57 billion, which implies a 3% to 7% sales growth for the year. supported by the factors detailed earlier, we expect future beef segment margins to be in a normalized range of 5% to 7% in the long term. however, based on current market dynamics, we now expect to perform between 2% and 4% this fiscal year.
given the result in pork in the first quarter, we are lowering margin guidance for the year to be between zero and 2%. counter to normal seasonality for our pork segment, we expect the back half of the year to outperform the first half of the year. for our poultry business, we now expect full year margins to be between 2% and 4% but gaining momentum through the year and exiting the fourth quarter at a margin above this range. prepared foods had a strong first quarter and performance.
as this is historically normal seasonality for the segment, we're maintaining our expected full year margin performance to be between 8% and 10%. in international, we continue to see volume and sales growth year over year. and we anticipate improved profitability in fiscal 2023, driven by volume and revenue growth from new facilities ramping up. we remain committed to growing our business internationally, representing the fastest growing protein consumption markets in the world.
our expectation for capex for the remainder of the year is unchanged at approximately $2.5 billion. our expectations for productivity savings remain unchanged at $300 million to $400 million. our net interest expense and tax rate are now expected to be around $330 million and 24%, respectively. we remain committed to our investment grade rating and managing our net leverage ratio to be at or below two times net debt to adjusted ebitda over the long term, providing optionality for inorganic investment and additional return of cash to shareholders.
in summary, we had a slower start than expected but are optimistic on the outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year and long term. we have a great team, growing demand for our products, strong portfolio diversity, and a differentiated asset footprint needed to win in the marketplace. overall, we see some persistent market factors, some operational challenges, and some expected seasonality influencing our second quarter results. and therefore, we're expecting total company volume, revenue, and operating income to be meaningfully stronger in the second half of the year compared to the first half of the year.
we remain in a strong financial position to support continued investment in our existing footprint, productivity, and the support of our brands as we continue to grow our business and provide desirable returns for our shareholders. so, with all that, i'll turn the call back over to sean for q&a instructions.
