thank you.[operator instructions]. your first question comes from the line of bob koort with goldman sachs.
tom glinski -- goldman sachs -- analyst
good morning. this is tom glinski on for bob. so the first question is, your guiding flat volumes in 2021 for lithium. even though the battery chemicals market should be growing nicely next year.
i guess this suggests that you're going to be losing market share. first, are you ok with that? and then second, if other producers capture that incremental volume in 2021 and get through the challenging qualification process with the customers, do you expect to regain that market share in 2022 and beyond. or is there a risk your competitors maintain that? thank you.
kent masters -- chief executive officer
tom, i guess a function of our projects and when they're coming on and the capacity is coming on, and who has that capacity to capture growth. so there's not a lot we can do about that at this point. we're on our plan to bring that capacity on, but they'll likely demand will pick up before we have that capacity. so we will lose a little share, but we expect the battle moved back to us as we get that capacity on as the market continues to grow out into the future.
tom glinski -- goldman sachs -- analyst
great. that makes sense. and then i guess higher level looking at 2021. considering the moving pieces between price down and lithium volume flat but capturing some incremental cost savings.
do you think you can grow segment ebitda next year, or ebitda is going to be flat to down? thank you.
kent masters -- chief executive officer
well, frankly it's going to depend on how the market develops over the year with us without having volume. we'll have some cost savings to offset inflation. and those pieces that we'll be close -- will be around flat unless we get a material change in pricing.
tom glinski -- goldman sachs -- analyst
got it. that makes sense. thank you.

your next question comes the line of david [inaudible]with deutsche bank.
david huang -- deutsche bank -- analyst
hi, this is david huang here for david. i guess first just on pricing. give us some industry pricing has bought in and even some carbon pricing started to recover. i guess if you can just fill elaborate a little bit more on your pricing weakness on carbonate in '21.
and do you expect that to the bottom during the year? or would that be like a 2022 story?
kent masters -- chief executive officer
yes, i'll make a comment and then let eric give you a little bit more detail or his perspective. so that's the magic question. it looks like when you look at the indices out there that it's at least bottomed if not starting to tick up a little. but we probably need to see that a bit more to have more confidence.
but we're anticipating that turns up during '21. and the question is when during 21. so, eric, you want to add something.
eric norris -- president, lithium
yes, i can add specifically relative to carbonate. this is -- we look at where the growth is. it's coming in the coming year we look at what's happened this year. it's more of a hydroxide growth story.
carbonate is therefore not enjoying as much of that. there is some growth in china. china is where we see more of these low prices, and it's the more oversupplied market. so it is that the magic question as ken referred to.
we have some reported indices seeing it picking up. others see it flat. it's even from the price supporting groups that report price around the world and in china specifically, it's murky and well below marginal cash crosses. the price of carbonate has gone well below where we thought it would have gone six months ago.
it is trending up in one report. we'll have to see. our view would be that given the dynamic that supply dynamics i talked about and the growth is more driven on the hydroxide side that you a clear movement about marginal cash costs for the spot prices of carbonate is more likely at the 2022 event. not that they couldn't happen in '21, but it looks more favorable in 2022.
hydroxide, however, will be differently believed.
david huang -- deutsche bank -- analyst
thanks. and then on the panel. it looks like the recovery at the bill is a little bit slower than the expected surge. since you're batting i mean, sales could be up slightly in '21.
i guess what kind of improvement are we talking about. and then just given that -- if we look says the current pace of recovery in catalyst as you say we expect that we can't achieve that same level if it dies in 2022 of 19 levels.
kent masters -- chief executive officer
so, i'll comment and raphael can also comment. but i think a lot of it depends on the man and the view of what driving comes back. when travel comes back, and it's really about fuel demand and refinery utilization for us. so, we don't see us getting back to 19 levels for '20 until the end of ' 22.
probably very late '22 to be back to that both from a fuel demand utilization and from our perspective as well.
raphael crawford -- president, catalysts
this is raphael. i think that's right, kent. and when we look at the outlook, there are a few things that play in. one is the impact of a pandemic.
and when do fuel volumes recover to 2019 levels and that's a volume component. and the other is refining margins. so, there's a lot of pressure on refineries right now. just the total value of refined products from a margin perspective has gone down.
and when that recovers that's going to be dependent on volume. but also on utilization industry capacity. so we wouldn't see that returning transcend until sometime in 2022 timeframe.
david huang -- deutsche bank -- analyst
thank you.

your next question comes from the line of mike harrison with seaport global securities.
mike harrison -- seaport global securities llc -- analyst
hi, good morning. coming back to this idea that lithium volumes are sold out for next year. if there is some additional demand take up, or if some of this oversupply or inventory gets worked down could that put you in a position to drive higher pricing? and can you maybe also comment on whether you have any flexibility to move more volume or to maybe accelerate some of your production if you do see demand picking up.
kent masters -- chief executive officer
yes. so, if the market gets tight and the supply is not there i mean prices should move up when we expect to see that around hydroxide. less about, less with carbonate and it's difficult. i mean, we had delayed our projects a bit when the pandemic kicked off, we just didn't know what things were going to look like.
and as soon as we got some visibility, we tried to pull those back as much as possible. and we haven't lost much time on that, and we haven't really lost our capital estimates are still the same range as well. so it's really not possible for us to pull it more forward than our current plans. we wouldn't be able to accelerate now to impact when those projects are coming on stream.
so from our perspective, i don't think we're going to have extra capacity to what we are anticipating. we may be a little early with the projects, early on are planned, but it's not going to be dramatic.
mike harrison -- seaport global securities llc -- analyst
all right. and i think everybody is kind of focused on what's happening here in the u.s. from a political standpoint. but can you maybe talk about to a and whether some of the political news there could impact your relationship with the government or your rights in the atacama.
kent masters -- chief executive officer
right. so while i mean what's happening there. so they're going to -- they're going to redo their constitution that's coming. that's a pretty long process that they have in place to do that, and so far that's all been without too much turmoil.
so we don't -- we have to wait and see what that constitution looks like. we don't really expect it to impact our rights in the atacama but i mean, i guess that's something we'll have to wait and see. i don't think it would be -- i mean it's not until it is interesting to start changing how they work with the international community. so he's got a great reputation following the rule of law, and having a strong economy in south america is an example.
so i don't think they want to change that. but it's something we'll have to watch very closely as that plays out.
mike harrison -- seaport global securities llc -- analyst
all right. thanks very much.

your next question comes from the line of vincent andrews with morgan stanley.
vincent andrews -- morgan stanley -- analyst
thank you. and good morning, everyone. i'm just wondering, you talk about 60% of your assets you're going after with the new two new projects come on. what about the other 40%.
can you talk about a medium-term perspective? what's it going to take for you to go after those assets. how much money it would require in capex spending. and at what point would you start talking about how you'd go after that, and how you'll finance it.
kent masters -- chief executive officer
vincent, i'm not sure i'm clear on the question. so go to after the other 40% of the asset?
vincent andrews -- morgan stanley -- analyst
yes. i guess my question is, when are we, when should we anticipate the other 40% coming online. and how much we have to spend to do it.from a resource standpoint.
kent masters -- chief executive officer
from a resource standpoint.
vincent andrews -- morgan stanley -- analyst
correct.
kent masters -- chief executive officer
ok. so we have access to those resources. so it's just about building conversion capacity. so we've started that process at la negra and kemerton is part of that.
so, we're building that out. we'll sell those plants out, and then we'll layer in additional capacity to go after. and that's our strategy. and our plan longer term, we have not necessarily laid out a capex program publicly over time, but that's the plan.
if we build capacity and then we sell it out and then we reinvest.
vincent andrews -- morgan stanley -- analyst
i'm sorry. and it is a follow up then to the earlier question about market share. how do you think about the medium-term in terms of not per se having a suggested timeline for that other 40% of production versus how fast you think the market's going to grow. do you think you'll be able to bring that 40% on in conjunction with market growth, or is it possible that the lag?
scott tozier -- chief financial officer
well, we'd be layering in that capacity. so we're trying to do is trying to get it just right. we add capacity as the market grows and bring that on as it's required. and it's a matter of how well we execute, and how well we forecast the market.
but we think we can. that's what we're trying to do.
vincent andrews -- morgan stanley -- analyst
all right. thank you, very much. appreciate it.
operator
the next question comes the line of john roberts with ubs.
john roberts -- ubs -- analyst
thank you. nice progress on the cost savings efforts. the debt backstop indicates some uncertainty here in the divestment process refined chemicals and catalysts additives. are we expecting one buyer for both, or two? and do you think both will be announced before year-end?
scott tozier -- chief financial officer
hey john, this is scott. so we were expecting that we'd have two different buyers for those two different businesses. discussions continue favorably on both of those. a little bit too early to call exactly when we'd be able to announce and announce a deal on either one of them.
but obviously, we're pushing hard to do that. the backstop is also related to economic uncertainty. and so we just got to -- i think we've just got to get through the winter period and that increasing covid cases and whatever the government reactions to those are to fully understand where we end up in 2021. and that's -- it's really just a safety valve for us in case things go the wrong direction.
and the banks have been very supportive of us and our story. so really appreciate their contributions.
john roberts -- ubs -- analyst
and then you mentioned in the third quarter the benefit of timing in talison shipments to tianqi. was that a catch up from q2? it doesn't sound like it's a pull forward from the fourth quarter given the strong fourth-quarter guidance.
scott tozier -- chief financial officer
yes. you've got a right, john. it was really a catch up from the q2 shutdown that they had. and just from an accounting perspective, when tianqi takes more product, we end up getting that equity income immediately.
so it helps, helps our bottom line.
john roberts -- ubs -- analyst
thank you.

your next question comes from arun viswanathan with rbc capital.
arun viswanathan -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
great. thanks for taking my questions. good morning. congrats on the results.
just nice to see the contradictions playing out. i just wanted to ask about the contracting side of lithium. i think you had offered concessions to some of your customers this year in 2020. did you find the need to extend those concessions into 2021? could you just maybe comment on the contracting environment out there.
thanks.
kent masters -- chief executive officer
so we're in the process of having those discussions with our customers. so i mean, you're right. we've made concessions late '19 for the 2020 period. they were one-year concessions market price is lower than it was at the time we made those concessions today.
and so we're having discussions about what that those contracts will look like for 2021. at the moment, it's too early to give any too much guidance on exactly what that looks like. so we're having those discussions today.
arun viswanathan -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
ok. i appreciate that. and then i guess on that note, i imagine that you may be extending or rolling over maybe three-year contracts that you signed up in '16 or '17. is that going on? when do you expect to do that? and i guess, would you expect to revert to the prior price umbrella on those contracts or is their potential for those negotiations to result in pricing closer to market levels at this point.
kent masters -- chief executive officer
eric, do you want to talk a little bit about the contract strategy.
eric norris -- president, lithium
sure. so to answer that first part of that question arun, we don't have any contracts, any major battery-grade contracts, or turnover next year. it's not the following year in 2022 that we have one that does turnover. that being said, it might be worthwhile to discuss what we're trying to do, right.
and with our contracts so just as a recollection of what we shared in the past, we're moving from what previously was a singular fixed-price contract for all customers to a more segmented approach. and really putting that into, i would put it simply into three buckets. one is, there'll be a group of customers that as we talk in the future with them, and we've actually had some new customers come in. so we have some brand new lte one we've signed during the quarter.
that is prospectively for the conference in volumes when they come online. so that first category is people that really want very little volatility in their price and our will. and as a result, we are looking at or negotiating a fixed price with them that's well above current prices and favorable investment economics for us. there's a second category that may want to have a little bit more volatility but not quite so much.
they don't want to. they don't want to have a nosebleed price when the market recovers. and we're insisting on a floor that we have -- we can earn favorable reinvestment economics over that pricing cycle with that second category. and then the third will be price buyers.
now our aim and the way this is shaping up is that we expect about once we have moved from this old contract structure to the new. and this price concession we gave this year that bridging between the two contract structures is to have about 20% in that price bucket, and about 80% in the first two buckets. and if that 80% that drive our capacity expansion. what they commit to us to in these long term contracts is the basis for our adding capacity over time.
and any access is what we would then sell into the price market. so we don't build for that price market, and we don't commit very long to that price market. that's the strategy where we are today. quite encouraging.
we're starting to see with as the second six months of the year as come about, and you're looking now at a 2021 and has a very strong, we believe demand curve associated with it. we're starting to see that already in europe. we're already 15% up year to date with that -- with those positive signals coming through the channel. we're seeing more and more customers coming to us, and wanting to talk with us about long term contracts that have favorable reinvestment economics to us, or transitioning their existing legacy contracts to that new structure i just described in a way that allows favorable reinvestment economics for us.
and that is absolutely paramount. because i think a lot of the rest of the industry that's still buying on price is not appreciating the fact that at current prices no one's going to expand. and there isn't going to be sufficient lithium for them. and so having more and more customers, including automotive oems become aware of the need for reinvestment economics on behalf of the lithium in the supply industry is starting to turn the tide.
2020 want to be -- because of the pandemic, it's going to be a bit of a transitional year. we're still working through that. that's why there's some uncertainty and of course, we talked about the weakness already in carbonate. but maybe that's helpful additional context to your question, arun.
arun viswanathan -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
very helpful. thanks a lot.
operator
your next question comes from laurence alexander with jefferies.
laurence alexander -- jefferies -- analyst
hi. could you give a sense of your current thinking around inventory management? how much of an inventory build you need to do next year to prepare for the growth curve you expect from 2022 to 2023.
kent masters -- chief executive officer
i'm assuming you're talking about lithium. we've been to that for all the inventory questions come from the one to qualify that. so next year, i mean the inventory is probably in the channel. we don't think have really changed much from what we said in the last quarter as ordered them, and we're saying if demand is picked up and it feels better but we don't have data to say that inventories any less than it was last quarter.
so that still has to be worked off. but given the demand profile, we see in 2021 and our limited capacity, we don't expect to build inventories there. we would expect actually and we will work those down, and then we work off of what we would consider standard inventory in the channel. so we don't see it building at least from our perspective through 2021.
w see us working inventories off.
laurence alexander -- jefferies -- analyst
and then can you add then for bromine given the trends in the end market. what negative factors do you see keeping the bromine improvement next year at fairly modest?
kent masters -- chief executive officer
netha, you want to make a few comments on that.
netha johnson -- president bromine specialties
sure. large enough i think that the biggest impact for us is the overall macroeconomy. we tend to be driven by global gdp, so that's really the limiting factor for us is how fast are things going to come back. and this is going to come back in a stable consistent way if you're going to be lumpy.
and right now it's just a little bit unclear how that recovery is going to take place across the globe in 2021.
laurence alexander -- jefferies -- analyst
thank you.

your next question comes the line of joel jackson with bmo capital.
unknown speaker
hi, this is robin on for joel. can you provide some more order of magnitude around the guidance of catalyst ebitda you expect next year? is it reasonable to be about halfway between 2020 and 2022? was it more likely to be above or below that level? maybe you can just walk us through some of the key building blocks to get there.
scott tozier -- chief financial officer
hey robin. this is scott. let me make a quick comment and maybe raphael can give some additional color. it's really going to depend on refinery utilization rates, as well as transportation fuel demand.
and given what we're seeing and projections right now, it's likely in the bottom half of that range that you just gave versus the top math. but maybe raphael you can add some more color as to what you're seeing.
raphael crawford -- president, catalysts
robin, i think that scott characterized it correctly. but over the next six months, i think we'll have a much clearer picture as to what that recovery will look like. as we see demand recovery, we see margins progress at refineries will have a better sense of that. but i want to give you a sense robin that while it's going to be a challenging 2021 better than 2020, the business is still very focused on the right that to return to growth in the future with a focus on chemicals.
with a focus on refineries east of suez where demand continues to grow. so while we have a challenge, we also have good strategies to establish us for long-term recovery and growth.
unknown speaker
that's helpful. thank you. just as a follow-up, i apologize, did i hear correctly really in the call that it was mentioned that lithium ebitda will be closer to flat for next year. i assume the cost savings in the lithium portion of the cost savings are offsetting that.
that slightly lower pricing. is that right?
scott tozier -- chief financial officer
robin this is scott. i think you have about right. it's really a little bit early to call exactly what the numbers going to be. but lithium ebitda should be flat to maybe down a bit.
just given the dynamics that we're seeing.
ok. thank you.
operator
your next question comes from the line of pj juvekar with citigroup.
pj juvekar -- citi -- analyst
yes. hi. good morning. so it looks like you have some limited capacity growth and you might lose some share next year.
why couldn't you build inventories in full q here to sell so as to not lose share? and then secondly, you -- some of your capacity is still idle like the wodgina mine. and what does it take for you to start that backup?
scott tozier -- chief financial officer
ken would you like that.
kent masters -- chief executive officer
yes, i'll start. so first question about inventory. so i mean there's a limit on inventories on hydroxide. and we know there are a little more than normal in the channel, and we actually shut down some facilities to manage that a little bit because there's life on hydroxide.
so you want to be careful about how you manage those inventories. so we'll work through those inventories next year. so we'll be able to probably we'll sell more than we'll be able to make. so we are doing that to some degree, but we're limited by the life of hydroxide and that's where that extra demand comes from.
the other question on wodgina. our limitation is on conversion capacity. right. so wodgina does not produce but that's because we can't we don't have the capacity to convert that.
so kemerton brings us and gets us going in that direction. and then we would just -- we have to manage between  wodgina and talison and about how that how --what resource we use there. so, but we're limited more on conversion capacity. so we'd be needing to add additional conversion capacity to take full advantage of our resources.
scott tozier -- chief financial officer
just to add on kent. this year pj, we are selling all the hydroxide that we can make. so we are sold out this year. in fact and that's -- where we've made the concessions we talked about on price and the leverage for that is we're getting the volumes this year that we've planned.
that's the reason for the upward guidance for the fourth quarter. so we're getting what we intended. and in fact, we'll be up year over year on volumes overall. and we expect the industry to be down.
so this will be in that regard to a solid year for lithium. as you go into next year can hit its conversion capacity. in fact our ratio of mining capacity conversion capacity, mining potential is actually the version that's about four to one. so it's about more conversion assets.
and we're being -- as we talked about in terms of managing our cash flow and managing our profitability, very disciplined about how we bring that conversion capacity to market. next year, we'll be a flat year, but we'll have significant capacity we bring on in 2022 and be in a position as we ramp those plants to recover any lost ground we have with our customers. as i earlier said, we've also started to draw up new contracts with customers for that volume in that year.
pj juvekar -- citi -- analyst
thank you for that color. it's interesting you're seeing conversion capacity is the bottleneck. again maybe related to that. can you talk about what's happening to conversion capacity in china? i know they at some point back in 15,16 they were constrained that they are overbuilt.
where do we stand on conversion capacity utilization in china? can you just give us some update there? and also, could you take some of your volumes into the chinese third party conversion. thanks.
kent masters -- chief executive officer
eric, you want to comment.
eric norris -- president, lithium
yes. sure. so in china, as you know, these chinese converters. now, i assume you're talking a lot about our integrated competitors such as the tianqi and you're talking about other non-integrated producers.
those that do not own a resource, they're dependent upon economics, right in their net buyer of they have to buy their rock. many of those mines have been curtailed. altero being the latest victim of low market prices they've been able to operate. so supply for iraq has dried up.
and they've been sustaining themselves through available inventory. that's one factor. another factor is, they themselves at current carbonate prices are breakeven at best and most are operating at a loss, as we see the price in china. spot prices in china below marginal cash costs.
so it's a pretty challenging economic picture for those producers. in a market recovery, we expect that capacity to come back. and china's going to remain a very healthy market for lithium into the future. so i think there's going to be a place for those producers.
in terms of ore going in. as you know, we're looking in terms of growing our capacity. we've talked about buying versus building capacity. we still are evaluating that approach and that remains a viable expansion off route for us.
it's the way we got the capacity we have today, the basis for how we got our current chinese conversion capacity. we are less inclined, particularly for hydroxide which is the growth part of a market where there's a lot of process know-how quality differentiators to teach a toll producer how to do that. that's proprietary know-how that we would be concerned we'd lose if we were to toll. so our bias would be to acquire.
pj juvekar -- citi -- analyst
great. thank you.
operator
your next question comes the line of mike sison with wells fargo.
mike sison -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
hey, good morning. nice quarter. if i recall you've got a 40 million in carbonate coming on. and i guess in '22 and 50 hydroxide, and 22.
how much of that is already contracted out. and how long do you think -- how long do you think you'll take to sell those out.
kent masters -- chief executive officer
so your numbers are right. although they're not going to -- it's not going to turn on day one at that capacity. right. so there's a ramp in our manufacturing processes to get us up to those full capacity.
so they won't come on all of it. it will just turn a switch. unfortunately, it doesn't work like that. eric, you want to talk about the ramp of sales versus production.
eric norris -- president, lithium
yes. so where i mentioned earlier mike that we are in particular on the hydroxide side which the type of market we are entertaining. well, first of all, we already had long-term contracts. then i see long term contracts that had earmarks if you will against that capacity when it came on.
and now we are having additional countries we signed one recently as i said during the quarter to increase that utilization of that plant, and we're in negotiation with still others. so i don't think i'm -- we're liberty has to share the details of exactly how much. but i would say, a significant portion of the talison capacity is well assured from a sales standpoint. on the carbonated side, a little different.
most of the carbonate market is increasing in china. as you know, the china market is a much shorter-term contracting market. we have been very diligent to maintain relationships with our existing capacity out of never wanted to build relationships and ongoing volume relationships, or sales to a number of leading chinese producers with whom we are talking about growing our business. we are talking with him about committed volumes.
the nature of contracting though is different from those. so it's gonna be a little different with carbonate in terms of we'll be closer to bringing that to market before we have firm prices with -- for that volume. though remember that whereas along the cost curve, so it still very attractive business notwithstanding the fact that we have some of the same long-duration contracts that we see on the [inaudible] side.
mike sison -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
right. great. thanks. and then a quick one on catalyst.
any thoughts on pricing for fcc heading into '21.
kent masters -- chief executive officer
raphael, you want to comment.
raphael crawford -- president, catalysts
sure. mike, this is raphael. i think pricing in fcc has been challenged in 2020 for non-contract volumes. so our nonspecialty, noncontract volumes have been under the most pressure in response to decisions by refineries to look for perhaps less special, fewer specialty catalysts in order to help their near-term economic pain.
going into 2021, i think that the trend would continue. i mean i think we'll continue to see pressure on non-contracted volumes, but where we create a differential value namely in areas like high propylene yield. i think we'll continue to hold onto the price and remain strong in that area.
mike sison -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
great. thank you.

your next question comes the line of chris kapsch with loop capital markets.
chris kapsch -- loop capital markets -- analyst
good morning. thanks for taking my question. so a follow up on eric on how comprehensive comments about the shifting approach to the contracts. and really, i guess against the context of some of the anecdotal commentary about hydroxide versus carbonate.
it seems like the oversupply is still a little more acute in carbonate versus hydroxide. so -- and then you obviously, have this tension about some customers wanting near-term pricing release, and others may be more focused on concerns about longer-term supply. i'm wondering if those conversations reflect this bifurcation hydroxide versus carbonate. and if you could take another a little bit further is it, as this plays out is it more likely in the context of those buckets that you described.
eric, the more likely that the hydroxide guys are going to fall in this bucket where they won't fix prices, security, and supply, and the carbonic customers are more likely to be willing to play some of the volatility.
eric norris -- president, lithium
sure. any advance comments, kent, before i dive in.
kent masters -- chief executive officer
no. go ahead.
eric norris -- president, lithium
ok. so i think the reflection of what everything i've described and you asked chris is both there is a difference between carbonate and hydroxide. more the carbonate market going forward will be in china. and to date, i don't see the same approach to secure us a supply in terms of contracting with us or with anybody for that.
but volume rather i see that the market tends to be content to go for a short duration on the bet the resource will continue to come online. conversion price can come online, and there'll be sufficient capacity. and there's also a bifurcation based on who's buying, right. more of the purchasing decision is moving closer to the point of use.
so it's moving to the battery producers, and the automotive producers and they gave the investments, they are making in the length of supply chain whether it be carbonate or hydroxide tend to want longer as the surety that they're going to have it because of the size the investments they're making. not everybody is doing that, but increasingly more are and more becoming i think appropriately aware of the need to do that. so it's also who we're contracting with. and in these long-term contracts, it plays a factor in that.
chris kapsch -- loop capital markets -- analyst
ok. thanks for that. and then just as a follow-up. could you think as the last caller you characterize the inventories that you saw in the supply chain? any update on that.
and also, just any changes to the timeline on the idling of your convert, your hydroxide conversion facility in north america. thanks.
eric norris -- president, lithium
yes. so we have -- so first of all i'll just reiterate what kent said. look at it is imperfect the science of assessing how much inventories in the channel. we can survey our customers and we do.
and that gives us a basis for understanding that. we obviously, don't know what our competition holds. and they -- and some of how quite a bit if we look at it things net the overall monthly inventory in the channel. so about the same as it was three months ago.
five months, five-month of access roughly speaking. though i think that shifted. there's probably more carbonate than hydroxide now. so carbonate has built up a bit, and hydroxide is drawn down a bit.
again, we are probably wrong about that, but directionally correct. it doesn't feel that different because a little bit better because i think that the pull on hydroxide but not too different. i'm sorry. then you had the second part of your question, chris.
chris kapsch -- loop capital markets -- analyst
is this the timeline of the idling of your hydroxide?
eric norris -- president, lithium
yes, we have. we are in the process of restarting the king's mountain hydroxide facility now. employees are returning. that's sooner than we thought and that's based upon the improvement we're seeing for demand next year.
and some of the earlier questions around can you please try to get more volume next year. so we're ramping that plant up. it's a small plant, so it has a very small impact on the overall volume growth. but we're starting that up.
and so we're peak which is the feedstock plant that feeds that hydroxide plant with the carbonate feedstock. we'll restart on schedule beginning of the year 2021.

your next question comes the line of colin rusch with oppenheimer.
colin rusch -- oppenheimer and company -- analyst
thanks so much, guys. can you give us a sense of how mature the conversations are on the financing side? it sounds like things are going pretty well, and there are some pretty meaningful opportunities to reduce your cost capital going forward. but just curious how far down the road you are with on.
kent masters -- chief executive officer
yes. we're well advanced in those discussions, so feel comfortable about where we're headed.
colin rusch -- oppenheimer and company -- analyst
excellent. and then i think the lithium market's been pretty well labor. but i'm just curious if you're seeing any consolidation in terms of battery oems given we're seeing capacity additions. it looks like there's going to be a handful of folks that really stride out here.
and if there's any consolidation below that with some of the cathode producers as you look out over the next three to five years.
kent masters -- chief executive officer
eric?
eric norris -- president, lithium
yes. sure. so on the battery oem. i don't be interested to see what you see calling because we don't see that.
in fact, i've seen the opposite. you've seen new players come into the market. not very recently, but companies like norfolk come into the market for europe. and many other multinationals who have played around this space in the past.
i think looking to come in to support the growth of the european markets. so i see more players coming into the market on the batteries had not less. and some of that's being supported and driven by the automotive volume. i think want more off.
they want some negotiating leverage right. they want more options or they want more localized options for in the case of europe. on the cathode side, it is constantly changing. right.
this is the part of the market that has, i said is not necessarily directly involved in the personal decision as much anymore being told what to make either by the automotive oem or the battery maker, so they're losing some of their power in the decision channel. and so i do expect some change consolidation. i can't point to any obvious ones now, but there is disruption. there are people gaining share and losing share.
and so i think we'll continue to see evolution in that part of the channel. and also some backward integration. you have some battery makers now building their own in-house cathode capabilities. that's super helpful.
colin rusch -- oppenheimer and company -- analyst
that's super helpful. yes, i'd love to have that conversation offline. thanks, guys.

at this time, we have no further questions. i will now turn the conference back over to ms. mandy.

ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. and welcome to the q3 2020 albemarle corporation earnings conference call.[operator instructions]. i would now like to hand the conference over to your presenter today ms.meredith bandy, vice president of investor relations. thank you.
please, go ahead ma'am.
meredith bandy
all right. thanks, marcus. and welcome to albemarle's third-quarter 2020 earnings conference call. our earnings were released after the close in the market yesterday and you will find our press release, presentation, and non-gaap reconciliations posted to our website under the investor section at www.albemarle.com.
joining me on the call today are kent masters, chief executive officer; and scott tozier, chief financial officer. raphael crawford, president, catalysts; netha johnson, president bromine specialties; and eric norris, president, lithium, are also available for q&a. as a reminder, some of the statements made during this conference call including our outlooks, expected company performance, expected impacts of the covid-19 pandemic, and proposed expansion projects may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws. please note the cautionary language about forward-looking statements in our press release and that same language applies to this call.
please also note that some of our comments today may refer to financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with u.s. gaap. a reconciliation of these measures to gaap can be found in our earnings release and the appendix of our presentation, both of which are posted on our website. now, i will turn it over to kent. 
kent masters -- chief executive officer
thank you, meredith. and good morning everyone. on the call today, i will cover a high-level overview of results and strategy, and highlight additional actions we're taking to improve the sustainability of and to grow our business. scott will then review third-quarter financials, provide updates on our balance sheet and cost savings initiatives, and review our outlook.
at albemarle, our first priority is the safety and well-being of our employees, customers, and communities. thanks to the courage and dedication of our employees, we've been able to safely operate our facilities throughout the pandemic to meet customer needs. our cross-functional global response team continues to meet regularly to address -- to assess pandemic related risk and adapt protocols as necessary. protocols, including restricting travel, shift adjustments, increased hygiene, and social distancing remains in place at all locations.
our recent focus has shifted from managing the immediate crisis to building in flexibility to adjust for regional differences and changing conditions. today, looking at our nonessential workers around the globe, most of north america remains on work-from-home status. asia and australia have returned to work sites. most of europe returned to work sites over the summer, but have now gone back to work from home given rising covid-19 cases and rates.
and finally, in chile in covid-19 rates and falling cases have allowed us to trial a soft reopening approach at a worksite at reduced capacity. as we all know, the situation is challenging and continues to evolve. i'm grateful to our team for their continued vigilance and commitment to working safely and productively. turning to recent results.
yesterday, we released third-quarter financials, including net income of $98 million, or $0.92 per share, and adjusted ebitda of $216 million down 15% from the prior year. our adjusted ebitda results surpassed the high end of our q3 outlook by 14%, thanks to better than expected performance in lithium and bromine and the exceptional cost-saving results across our businesses. we currently expect full-year 2020 adjusted ebitda of between $780 million and $810 million. lower year-over-year based on reduced global economic activity, due to the global pandemic and reduced lithium pricing as expected going into the year.
scott will go into more detail on our outlook for the rest of this year and talk directionally about next year. in late 2019, we launched an initiative to achieve sustainable cost savings of over $100 million per year by the end of 2021, with about half of that or $50 million to be achieved in 2020. earlier this year with the onset of the pandemic-related economic slowdown, we accelerated those initiatives giving us a line of sight to $50 million to $70 million savings in 2020. implementation has been even more successful than we expected, and we are on track to deliver about $80 million in savings this year and to reach a run rate of more than $120 million by the end of 2021.
we plan to turn this two-year project into an ongoing culture of operating discipline and continuous improvement with additional cost and efficiency targets. our strategic approach to sustainability is another facet of this operational discipline and a key area of focus for albemarle. since we spoke last quarter, we have published our enhanced sustainability report which expands on the four key quadrants of our sustainability framework and sets the baseline for our environmental performance and increased disclosures. now, we are working to establish sustainability goals and targets and continue to make progress in each quadrant.
this week, we also published our global labor policy in alignment with international labor organization conventions, and our human rights and global community relations and indigenous peoples' policies. both consistent with the un guiding principles. these policies will be available on the sustainability section of our website. i'm proud to say that albemarle generates more than 50% of our revenues from products that help reduce greenhouse gas emissions or promote greater resource efficiency.
as our lithium business grows, an even larger proportion of our business will contribute to global sustainability. in summary, we are concentrating our efforts where they matter most so we can continue to create sustainable value for our customers, investors, and stakeholders. our growth projects at la negra and kemerton are key to increasing our battery-grade lithium conversion capacity in line with long-term customer demand. la negra iii and iv is an expansion of our lithium carbonate capacity in chile.
the project is expected to reach mechanical completion in mid-2021, followed by a six-month commissioning and qualification process. la negra iii and iv allows us to add carbonate capacity at the very low end of the cost curve. kemerton, our new lithium hydroxide conversion plant in western australia is on track to reach mechanical completion by late '21 with a six-month commissioning and qualification process to follow. kemerton is quote growing our hydroxide capacity in line with expected strong long-term market demand.
and with that update, i'll turn it over to scott for more detail on our recent results.
scott tozier -- chief financial officer
thank you, kent. good morning, everyone. albemarle generated third-quarter net sales of $747 million, a decrease of about 15% compared to the prior year, and in line with our previous outlook. this reduction was driven primarily by reduced prices in lithium, as expected coming into the year, and reduced volumes and catalysts in bromine related to pandemic related economic weakness.
gaap net income was $98 million or $0.92 per diluted share, and non-gaap adjustments this quarter were primarily related to restructuring for cost savings and discrete tax items with adjusted earnings of $1.09 per diluted share. lower net income was primarily driven by lower net sales, partially offset, by cost and efficiency improvements. corporate and sg&a costs were lower versus the prior year, due to these cost savings initiatives. as kent stated, adjusted ebitda was $216 million, a decrease of 15% from the prior year.
the success of our short-term and sustainable savings initiatives, as well as the timing of equity income from talison jv, helped us improve margins and beat the midpoint of our q3 ebitda outlook by about 20%. turning to slide 8. for a look at the ebitda bridge by business segment. adjusted ebitda was down $38million over the prior year, reflecting lower net sales and lower equity income, partially offset by cost savings initiatives and efficiency improvements.
lithium's adjusted ebitda declined by $31 million versus the prior year, excluding currency. pricing was down about 17%, partially offset by cost savings. lower pricing reflects previously agreed battery-grade contract price concessions for 2020, as well as lower market pricing and technical grade products. lithium ebitda margin benefited from cost savings and the timing of talison jv shipments to our partner tianqi.
bromine's adjusted ebitda was down about $10 million, excluding currency. the decline was primarily, due to lower volumes, as a result of the pandemic-related economic downturn, partially offset by ongoing cost savings. likewise, catalyst adjusted ebitda declined by $30 million, excluding currency, primarily due to lower volumes, offset by cost savings and efficiency improvements. fluid catalytic cracking or fcc volume improved sequentially but remain down compared to the prior year, due to lower transportation fuel consumption.
as a result of travel restrictions. hydro processing catalyst or hpc volumes were also down compared to the prior year, due to normal lumpiness of shipments, and softness related to lower oil prices and reduced fuel demand. our corporate and other category adjusted ebitda increased by $15 million, excluding currency, primarily, due to improved fine chemistry services results. we ended the quarter with liquidity of about $1.5 billion, including just over $700 million cash, $610 million remaining under our revolver, and $220 million on other available credit lines.
total debt was $3.5 billion representing a net debt to adjusted ebitda of approximately 3.2 times. our commercial paper supported by our revolver which is not due until 2024. and so that leaves about $670 million of short-term debt to be restructured or repaid over the next year. we expect to repay the 2021 debt maturities out of cash on hand, assuming continued economic recovery, and cash inflows from divestitures.
however, we are also working with our banks on a delayed draw term loan to backstop those 2021 maturities. if the economic recovery or divestitures are delayed, we'd be able to refinance the short-term debt using this new delayed draw term loan. as kent highlighted earlier, our 2020 sustainable cost savings initiative is on track to achieve cost reductions of about $80 million this year. that's 60% above our initial estimates.
we expect to reach run-rate savings of more than $120 million by the end of 2021, up 20% from the previous outlook. we continue to expect short terms cash management actions such as travel restrictions, limited use of external services, and consultants and working capital management to save the company about $25 million to $40 million of cash per quarter this year. next year, we expect some headwinds as some of these temporary cash savings reverse. finally, we're nearing our expected range of 2020 capital spending to $850 million to $900 million based on the timing of spend.
our two major capital projects were negative three and four, and kemerton remains on track for completion in mid-2021, and late 2021 respectively. they will begin generating sales revenue in 2022, following a roughly six-month qualification period for each plant. turning to our outlook. this quarter is a transition from quarterly to annual outlook.
in the next quarter, we expect to return to our normal practice of giving annual outlooks. as we approach the end of the year, we currently expect to deliver full-year 2020 net sales of around $3.1 billion at the midpoint of our range. adjusted ebitda of between $780 million and $810 million, and adjusted diluted earnings per share of between $3.80 and $4.15. lithium's q4 adjusted ebitda is expected to increase by 10% to 20%, compared to q3 2020 as battery grade customers continue to meet the planned volume commitments.
bromine q4 ebitda is expected to be similar to q3. stabilization in electronics and building and construction continued to help offset weakness in other energy markets, particularly deepwater drilling and automotive. finally, catalysts q4 ebitda is expected to be down between 20% and 30% sequentially, primarily due to hpc volumes and mix. fcc demand is expected to continue to recover with increased travel and depletion of global gasoline inventories.
but q4 is expected to be particularly weak for hpc catalysts in part because of normal lumpiness, but also as refiners continue to defer hpc spending into 2021 and 2022. as we look beyond this year, visibility remains challenging. however, we are seeing signs of improvement or at least stabilization in our businesses. ev sales remain a key driver for the growth of our lithium business.
global ev sales were up 90% in the month of september, compared to the previous year. september represented a new monthly record of ev registrations led by european ev sales. the rest of the world continues to rebound from the pandemic related slowdown earlier this year with year to date global ev sales up 15%. the fourth quarter is also typically a seasonally strong quarter for auto sales.
and similarly, the ihs market expects global ev production to increase by 20% to 30 % in full-year 2020, and by nearly 70% in 2021. our bromine business supplies a diverse set of end markets and is generally driven by broader consumer sentiment and global gdp. consumer sentiment continues to improve in most regions albeit, still below pre-pandemic levels. analysts now expect global and u.s.
gdp to be down about 4% in 2020 before rebounding next year. finally, in catalyst. after the sharp drop off in march, u.s. miles driven has rebounded but remains well below normal levels.
similarly, refinery capacity utilization has improved from earlier this year but remains well below typical levels. refinery utilization rates in the mid 70% range are a challenge for an industry designed to run efficiently at utilization rates of 85% or higher. given recent shifts in demand in refining economics, we don't expect to see pre-pandemic levels until 2022 at the earliest. forecast and leading indicators like these helped gauges the outlook for these markets.
however, a variety of factors including supply chain lags, contract structure, inventory changes, and regulatory impacts can cause results to differ from the underlying market conditions. now, let's turn to slide 13 for our current view of 2021. in lithium, we expect full-year 2021 volumes to be relatively flat as our plants are effectively sold out, given current volume constraints. we expect to see volume growth in 2022 as la negra iii and iv, and kemerton comes online.
full-year 2021 lithium prices are expected to be down slightly, due primarily to lower average realized pricing for carbonate and technical grade products. discussions with long-term battery-grade customers are under way. it's too early to say what changes will be made to those contracts for 2021. lower average market pricing and higher inventories may pressure pricing.
at the same time, many of our customers remain concerned about the security of long-term high-quality supply. which speaks to the strong demand growth seen for electric vehicles. in bromine, we expect full-year 2021 results to improve slightly, assuming continued economic recovery and ongoing cost savings. our bromine business was probably the least impacted of our businesses during 2020, and that's part of the reason we expect a fairly modest improvement in 2021.
and in catalysts, we expect 2021 results to continue to improve from the very low levels seen in 2020. but to remain well below 2019 levels. near-term catalyst results are challenging as reduced refinery capacity utilization and lower oil pricing continues to pressure our customers' margins. in the longer term, this business is well-positioned in growth regions like the middle east and asia and poised to benefit as refinery shift production to chemicals.
kent masters -- chief executive officer
thanks, scott. economic conditions are improving, but uncertainty remains. particularly of additional covid-19 impacts lengthen the time to a full economic recovery. we have the playbook established and know-how to manage through subsequent ways of covid-19 as necessary.
at the same time, we are confident in the long-term growth prospects of our core businesses and continue to focus on controlling what we can control. that means, first and foremost focusing on the health and well-being of our employees, customers, and communities. it also means building operational discipline and sustainability into all aspects of our business, including manufacturing, supply chain, capital project execution, and customer experience. we remain confident in our strategy and we will modify the execution of that strategy to further position albemarle for success.
meredith bandy

operator
thank you. [operator instructions] our first question comes from david begleiter with deutsche bank. your line is now open.
david begleiter -- deutsche bank -- analyst
thank you. good morning. kent, on recycling in lithium, when do you expect it to become a bigger part of the market, and what will be albemarle's role in lithium recycling going forward?
kent masters -- chief executive officer
yeah. so let me -- i'll start with that, maybe eric can give a little bit more detail. so i mean we -- we've got activities around lithium, but we -- we expect that to be a number of years out before it becomes a major -- a major business. so basically, there has to be enough lithium in the market to -- for -- for it to run its lifecycle in a vehicle and then come back for a recycling.
so -- and i -- i think our role in that -- i mean we've had to look at those business options. but when -- when you see lithium being recycled, there's a component of that that looks a lot like our conversion facilities. so we would anticipate that we would play in that. but it's a number of years out before that comes to fruition.
so eric, anything you want to add there?
eric norris -- president of lithium
sure, kent. david, i'd add that we have a number of efforts already with existing customers, both in -- in the u.s. and in europe, who are very focused on investing in recycling capabilities. in some cases, in europe, it's part of the e.u.
battery directive. those targets within e.u., for example, are still being set and being discussed. the industry is offering its views on technology as are we and when it will be ready. and as kent pointed out, we're doing some novel process development and linking it into how we might run our con -- our conversion plants or ad -- adapt those plants and those designs for that capability.
so it is early days, but our model is really well-positioned with its customer base and it's spread across the various cathode technologies, and with our global footprint to -- to really take advantage of that trend as it develops in the next decade.
david begleiter -- deutsche bank -- analyst
thank you. and -- and just on your wave 3 projects you list on slide 8, when should -- should we see -- expect the formal announcement on which project will be mo -- moving forward and how do you rank order of these projects right now in your mind as likelihood of moving forward first?
kent masters -- chief executive officer
yeah, i think the order that we listed them, that's kind of our -- our order, so we expect to see a china facility would be the first thing that we would move on. we're -- we're working on that, investigating it, doing planning around it now. but it -- it's still at a -- it's a point where it could be an acquisition and then an acquisition using -- has some element of work to it before it really becomes an albemarle facility or a greenfield plant. but we're -- we're working on that now and we'd probably come to a fid on that late '21, depending on whether it's an acquisition or a greenfield.
david begleiter -- deutsche bank -- analyst
thank you very much.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from ben kallo with baird. your line is now open.
ben kallo -- robert w. baird -- analyst
thanks for taking my question. maybe i'm just taking a step back. could you talk a bit about just visibility in your lithium sales as we move into next year? like we see all these announcements from big auto ems and -- and -- and then smaller start-ups. and can you talk about how your salespeople attack those companies and then your lead time to that? and then maybe meet -- weaving in next year going from i think the streets are like $850 million this year to over $1 billion of ebitda next year.
not to ask for guidance for '22, but just can you give us some puts and takes for growth in -- in '22 with -- with both volume and then how you think about pricing as well? thank you.
eric norris -- president of lithium
good morning, ben. this is eric norris. first, in terms of the visibility, we see -- see near term, which i think was your first question. we have two approaches we take, right? one is exactly what kent described in the call, which is a macro to micro approach of modeling demand, and that has led us with some of the announcements you've referenced to increase our demand outlook on a macro basis.
that -- a big part of that is what happens on the ground with our salespeople. our strategy has been and will continue to be to use contracts to secure long-term volumes. that requires a discussion with the customer to commit anywhere from three to five years and a discussion that follows that into the details of what they are looking at from -- from a -- from a specific chemistry, location, and quantity point of view. so i'd characterize our visibility as -- as quite reasonable and good in that regard, giving us the certainty we need to expand and positioning us well in the market to grow with -- with the additional resources we have.
maybe you could repeat your second question?
ben kallo -- robert w. baird -- analyst
my second -- my second question was just the -- the street is modeling about 20% growth, and it's mostly coming from lithium from '21 to '22. can you talk about the -- the puts and takes that we should think about without giving -- without having to give guidance, but the -- the volume you're bringing on and how we should think about that versus pricing that maybe rebalance as you move to new contracts?
scott tozier -- chief financial officer
yeah. ben, this is scott. i'll take -- i'll take that question. so as you look into 2022, the volumetric growth coming from lithium with the start-up of la negra iii and iv and kemerton i and ii is clearly the highlight for -- for that year.
however, we do see continued recovery in refining catalysts as transportation fuels and refinery utilization continues to improve, and po -- potentially some additional growth in bromine as some of those early growth projects come to -- come to fruition and we're able to place that into the market. so i think we're well-positioned going into 2022 to see very meaningful and high return growth in -- in that year.
ben kallo -- robert w. baird -- analyst
great. thank you, guys.
operator
thank you. our next question comes now chris kapsch with the loop capital markets. your line is now open.
chris kapsch -- loop capital markets -- analyst
yeah. good morning. thanks for taking my questions. so on the upward revisions here, 2025 lithium demand forecasts, you pointed to -- obviously, to ev penetration and the mix of evs, larger batteries of the drivers.
i'm just wondering if you could provide color on -- on the outlook from a hydroxide versus carbonate standpoint? i'm just curious if the -- the upward revision is tied mostly to higher energy density evs, and therefore, more skewed toward hydroxide?
eric norris -- president of lithium
good morning, chris. so relative to the demand question, the mix, it is weighted toward hydroxide. if you look at the market today, we see it being sort of a 30-70 split, by the -- 30% hydroxide. that would bring that value.
and if you look out to 2025, and there's going to be some error bars on this, of course, but it's -- it's about 60-40, 60% hydroxide. so the -- the large part of the growth is in hydroxide high nickel chemistries. it's not to say there isn't growth in carbonate for a more conventional technologies like lsp. but to enable the -- the -- the growth targets of the western oems, in particular, in the range they're looking for in energy density, it's going to be hydroxide, and that's true even in 2021.
the rate of growth we see for demand in '21 is hi -- incrementally higher for hydroxide than is for carbonate. and as you know, our models are well-positioned no matter which way it goes because we -- we have capacity coming on and we're doubling our capacity in both product lines. as we roll forward and look at wave 3, the predominance of that is going to go toward hydroxide for the reasons i just referenced.
chris kapsch -- loop capital markets -- analyst
got it. that's -- that's helpful. and the follow-up is regarding your comments about your contracts, which sort of are seemingly kind of on sort of a perpetual renegotiation right now. but -- but what -- you mentioned the ability to lift prices higher.
i'm curious if there's also a floor in the renegotiated contract and if that applies to both ev supply chain customers and -- and -- and industrial-grade customers also? and then just any color on just the -- the tone of the co -- the conversations given that the world kind of has changed over the last three to six months if the -- if -- if it feels like the -- the leverage has shifted back from -- from them to the suppliers given maybe concerns about security of supply? thanks.
kent masters -- chief executive officer
yes. i'll -- i'll start with that, then maybe eric gives some color. i'm not sure. but i think for the industrial customers, i mean the long-term contracts are mostly in the ev market.
so when we talk about our long-term co -- contracts, that's about the ev market -- ev market. less so on the industrial side. and i don't think the leverage really has shifted, but it has changed the tone of the discussions. and it's a -- we -- we still sit with our long-term prices above the spot market even with the moves that we've seen.
but there's less pressure on those contracts. there's not that there's no pressure on those contracts, but there's i would say less pressure. if that trend continues, it will kind of move in the same direction. eric, you want to top that off?
eric norris -- president of lithium
the only thing i would add, kent and chris, is that these contracts, you've characterized them, kent, as if or, chris, as if they have been perpetually negotiated and that they may be one size fits all. that's the change. we -- we didn't make an adjustment, a concession as the market pricing collapsed a year ago, and now we're moving into restructuring these contracts based on customer needs. and -- and there are going to be some that are going to look like spot and that's going to be, as -- as kent pointed out, some of those contracts in the tg area and perhaps in the china market.
there's others that are going to be like the old variety. but the -- the vast majority is going to be variable-based pricing that reflects some market index, a global index, not necessarily just china. and that's positioning us well as we go into an improving market from a price standpoint to benefit from a growth standpoint.
chris kapsch -- loop capital markets -- analyst
very helpful, thanks.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from laurence alexander with jefferies. your line is now open.
laurence alexander -- jefferies -- analyst
good morning. so i guess two questions. first, on the recycling comments earlier. is the message that you'll engage in significant recycling when the returns are double your whack? or is it that you're engaging in a significant amount of r&d to try and position yourselves for when that market develops? i mean like are you subsidizing the market to some -- the development to some extent? and secondly, can you speak to the trends in conversion costs as specs change at the automotive oems? are the costs rising or falling over the next few years?
kent masters -- chief executive officer
yes. on -- on recycling, i -- i think -- i would say it's really we're invest -- we're investing in r&d process, but we're actually -- we're talking to customers about what the business model might look like. but it's really an early phase of that and it's -- we're investing at this point and trying to figure out what the business model would look like and what our role would be in that. but we're also investing in r&d that kind of get us there.
so i don't think we're -- we're not sitting and waiting until we get the returns that we expect. and the -- kind of the biggest driver for that is there's not going to be no lithium that's coming through the lifecycle to feed recycling processes for another -- another -- a number of years. and -- and i'm sorry, the second question?
laurence alexander -- jefferies -- analyst
just with respect to some auto oems or as the battery specs are evolving, is the conversion costs rising or falling? is it becoming tougher to meet those specs?
kent masters -- chief executive officer
yes, i mean the -- the specs are evolving and -- but i -- i don't know that processing costs are really going up. so we're driving hard on productivity trying to have those costs down. there are, in some cases, some steps that we've modified in order to meet some of the specs around crystallization. i don't think it's driving the cost up at this point, but it -- in it -- but it's probably offsetting some of our productivity gains.
but -- and it's -- as it gets more sophisticated, but we get better at making it. a lot of that's about process control. we are looking at one step in the process that we have to add in which -- which would add a little bit of cost, but i think we would have -- at -- at a minimum, we'd offset that with our productivity.

thank you. our next question comes from mike harrison with seaport global securities. your line is now open.
mike harrison -- seaport global securities -- analyst
hi, good morning. what may i ask about the lithium business, you're pricing and mix, you said was down 20%. typically, i think about pricing is flowing through pretty directly to the bottom line, and so that 20% decline would have been something like $80 million of an ebitda headwind. yet, your ebitda was only down $18 million.
so -- so how did you make up that -- that fairly significant difference? it doesn't look like volume would've been big enough to make that up on its own.
scott tozier -- chief financial officer
yeah. this is scott. i would -- i would point to -- there is volume growth in the -- in the quarter on a year-over-year basis. but also, we're seeing the -- the results of our productivity actions from a cost perspective.
and so that's been a big focus that we started in 2019 as we're -- as we're trying to maximize the productivity and not only have the -- the world class resources that give us low costs, but also have low-cost operations. and -- and we're seeing the benefits of that very clearly in the fourth quarter. and we'll -- we'll see benefit of -- of that in the -- in 2021 as well, both on the cost basis, but also we're seeing some volumetric growth just from the yield enhancements and improvements that the engineers are able to get out of our plants. so all --all -- all pointing in the right direction for us.
kent masters -- chief executive officer
and i would -- i would add to that. i mean those productivity improvements. i mean they flow through. it's much more difficult to get them on flat volumes.
as we get volume growth, those really start to show up. but there'll be new facilities which will then kind of re -- redo the playbook on productivity again. but i think as volume grows, those really show up more.
mike harrison -- seaport global securities -- analyst
understood. ok. and -- and then over on the catalysts side, you -- you mentioned the -- the change in customer order patterns affecting maybe the cadence of the year. but i -- i wanted to dig in a little bit on this customer that deselected you guys because of your support for electric vehicles.
do you see that is -- is kind of a one-off happening with a specific customer or are -- are there other customers where you see this coming into play going forward?
kent masters -- chief executive officer
yeah. so, difficult to predict the future but we -- we kind of see it as kind of one customer took exception and we're going to work pretty hard to gain their confidence and get that customer back. but they've kind of taken a different view at the moment.
mike harrison -- seaport global securities -- analyst
all right. thanks very much.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from arun viswanathan with rbc capital markets. your line is now open.
arun viswanathan -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
great. thanks for taking my question. just curious on the pricing outlook. you know, you commented that maybe, you know, your -- your overall pricing would be down a little bit year on year in -- in '21 versus '20 and we have seen some initial improvement in pricing, i guess, in certain markets.
so, maybe you can just give us your thoughts on how, you know, price in both carbon and hydroxide evolves through the year as you see it and -- and -- and maybe if there's any regional differences between china and north america, that'll be helpful. thanks.
kent masters -- chief executive officer
so, i'll make a comment and eric can add some color. but, i mean, i think -- i think we see the same numbers that you're seeing around spot prices. so, they have moved china spot prices. so, we sell little-to-no volume in china on a spot basis.
so, it's not directly applicable but it is indicative of the market but we've not really seen prices change outside of china. so, the contract prices, we haven't really seen. but as i said earlier, it -- it lessens the pressure on our discussions with customers. so, it's not as much downward pressure as we -- we'd seen, say, second quarter -- third quarter of last year because those spot prices have turned up, but we'll just have to see how it plays out during the year.
at the moment, the spot prices are still below our contract prices. so, it's not like a sea change. if it continues to move, it -- that could give us some upside. but at the moment, that -- those prices are still below our contract prices.
eric norris -- president of lithium
and so, i'd add to that, arun, that -- that the prices in china that you're seeing are largely carbonate and have largely inflected in the past two months. it's a bit early -- it's an encouraging sign but a bit early to extrapolate that to the world. and as kent pointed out, our business is biased to more world or ex-china prices than in-china prices. and most of our outlook is around carbonate and tg products, not around necessarily battery-grade hydroxide which is relatively flat in this outlook.
so, it's -- it's an encouraging sign and the way we've got our contract structured should it continue, broaden, and deepen over time that trend then -- then we're in an extremely good position to benefit -- benefit from that going forward and we'll just continue to watch it. i would say it's a matter of -- from where we are today, it's not a matter of if prices inflect -- inflect upwards broadly, it's -- it's just a matter of when. and 2021 as a transition year. i think as we go forward in the future, it's just going to get pretty tight.
arun viswanathan -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
great. thanks for that detail. and maybe you could also offer your thoughts on maybe a little bit longer term, you know, you noted that it is going to get pretty tight. would you expect, you know, pricing to kind of head back toward prior peaks that we saw in '17 and '18.
and also, maybe you can just comment on -- on that as it relates to spodumene as well. thanks.
kent masters -- chief executive officer
yeah. so, i would say, i mean, we're predicting the future, right? and this industry has really only been through one down cycle, so we're coming off that. we don't anticipate that prices move back to the peaks that they were before but we don't know that. so, i think i'll leave it -- i'll leave it at that.
eric norris -- president of lithium
yeah. on spodumene, we are -- because of what's happened in china, what -- what's really the reason we believe prices have spiked in china is a fundamental shortage now of -- of available carbonate inventory and -- and available spodumene supply and inventory. so, what that -- that's meant is now prices have started to inflect upward for chemical-grade spodumene which should that trend continue, will -- will provide more supply into that market to meet -- to meet that need. what that all means from a future standpoint, as kent said, the -- the calculus too hard to say given the -- the maturity of this -- this market and we'll continue to watch.
arun viswanathan -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
thanks.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from vincent andrews with morgan stanley. your line is now open.
vincent andrews -- morgan stanley -- analyst
thank you. thank you for taking my question. i just wanted to bridge the -- the wave 3 on slide 8 with sort of the plans from when you -- when you did the -- the marbl jv. just looking back at that slide, you were going to build two stages of 50,000 tonnes of lce at wodgina and it was going to be $1.6 billion split between the two parties.
doesn't seem like you're still planning to do that at wodgina. so, what's -- what's changed and -- and why in that $1.6 billion number as it relates to 250,000-tonne plants? is that still a good approximation of what it would cost in australia? presumably, it's less than china. just if you could just help us bridge that, that'll be very helpful.
kent masters -- chief executive officer
yeah. so, i mean, i guess, our plans around the marbl jv have evolved, but -- so, the initial conversion is -- is the kemerton i / ii. and as -- and as we see it today, the second conversion facility and the second 50,000 would be in china. so, that would be probably that first project that we were talking about in the wave 3 projects.
vincent andrews -- morgan stanley -- analyst
ok. but presumably, that's going to come in less than the australian capex cost that you'd envisioned. is that correct?
kent masters -- chief executive officer
yeah, absolutely. so, if it -- it'd be -- it'll be quite a bit less than western australia plant.
vincent andrews -- morgan stanley -- analyst
ok. and if i could also ask what is the plan in terms of the -- the washington facility i believe is in care and maintenance mode right now. do you intend to leave it like that or do you anticipate bringing it back online at some point this year?
kent masters -- chief executive officer
well, i don't know about this year. so, we just have to -- to see how we evolve as the kemerton project comes on, and then we accelerate growth and modernize our plans for being a resource. it's a very good quality resource, so it's there. i don't know off the top and i don't want to commit to when we bring that resource on but it would be as we start into these phase 3 projects when we would need that -- need that resource.
vincent andrews -- morgan stanley -- analyst
thank you very much. i really appreciate it.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from kevin mccarthy with vertical research partners. your line is now open.
cory murphy -- vertical research partners -- analyst
hi. good morning. this is cory on for kevin. as it relates to the bromine business, at your 2019 investor day, you've talked about expecting the resource discovery and expansion of off-shore drilling.
obviously, things have changed. so, how was your view of the market changed? and can you talk a little bit more about your u.s.-based bromine expansion?
kent masters -- chief executive officer
yeah, i think in terms of our view of the off-shore oil market, i think it's -- it's muted slightly. things have changed a little bit but we do see oil prices recovering which we know with the lag time of six to nine months is going to be good for our business going forward. in terms of the u.s. expansion, it fits right along to the corporate strategy of accelerating a lower-capital intensity, higher-return growth projects.
you know, magnolia, for example, it's great jurisdiction for us, we've been there for decades, and we know those assets well. that really lends itself to investments to have a quicker return and a higher return and those are the ones we'll leverage as we grow this business going forward.
cory murphy -- vertical research partners -- analyst
thank you. and -- and if i may follow up sort of pivoting here on divestitures. it -- it sounds like you're close on performance catalysts. do -- do you have any expectations regarding aggregate proceeds and timing? and with lithium recovering in equity raise recently, would you consider separating the balance of your catalysts business at some point?
kent masters -- chief executive officer
yeah. so, i mean, fcs and pcs, we're on the same track that we were at. it's gone slower, covid slowed us down, but we're -- we're -- i'd say we're back on track but they're not done yet. and as we said in the prepared remarks that we'll kind of let you know when we get closer or -- or -- on those deals to get signed.
on catalyst, i mean, we still think that we're kind of the best owners for that business. we've been in that business for some time, we add value, we've taken a hit over covid-19, and the -- the miles driven being down, and the refinery utilizations, and all of those -- all of those issues. but we still think we like the strategy of kind of becoming, you know, more and crude to chemicals, moving toward asia as we move and we still like the products we have and the innovation we have in that business. we think we're the best owners of that business for today, so we don't have immediate plans around divestiture of catalyst.
they're core part of our businesses, the three businesses we have in the portfolio are all core for us.
cory murphy -- vertical research partners -- analyst
understood. thank you very much for the color.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from jeff zekauskas with j.p. morgan. your line is now open.
jeff zekauskas -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
thanks very much. you're bringing on 50,000 tonnes to kemerton, 30,000 of which is yours and you're bringing on 40,000 tonnes at la negra. and you -- you said that demand's going to be really strong for electric vehicles over a three-year period, much stronger than people thought before. so, as a base case, how many tonnes do -- do you expect to sell out of those two units in 2022? and i know it takes time to ramp up.
so, of the, you know, the 40,000 and the 30,000 that's yours, as a base case, how much will you sell in 2022?
kent masters -- chief executive officer
so, eric, if you want to look at the detail on that i would -- i would think as we bring those plants on and ramp them up, we'd expect to be selling kind of half of each in the first year. and that's fair, yeah. if you look at, we have an example, jeff. obviously, we've -- we've had in growth mode, we've done this one other time before as part of wave 1 wodgina ii and that plant came up a little north of -- of 50% but it was a brownfield facility with much of the existing infrastructure in place from the acquisition we'd made prior to that.
so, kemerton is -- is greenfield considering that 50% feels -- feels reasonable and the same with la negra as well for 2022.
jeff zekauskas -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
great. and -- and for my follow-up, is there any volume or ebitda benefit from either of these two projects in 2021? and i guess the rock for kemerton has to come from talison greenbushes because the other -- the wodgina mine is on -- is sleeping. is that correct, or -- or is that not correct? and what's the effect on '21?
kent masters -- chief executive officer
yes. so, i -- i don't -- and i don't think you're going to see much in '21. i mean, we've -- we've got increased cost because we're commissioning and bringing those on. and if we -- if we were to -- if we could accelerate and get a little bit of sales, it'd be offset by those costs but i wouldn't be planning on benefit in '21.
and initial -- and -- and -- and initially as most likely, we'll feed that -- the kemerton from the initial phases with talison product.
jeff zekauskas -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
ok, great. thank you so much.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from pj juvekar with citigroup. your line is now open.
pj juvekar -- citi -- analyst
yes, hi, good morning. you know, currently in china, the carbonate prices are higher than hydroxide prices because of, you know, come back over the lsp batteries. do you think that's a trend or it's an anomaly that may not last? and then secondly just on pricing, you had given sort of 15% concessions on certain contracts in 2020. and the expectation that the time was in 2021, those contracts would go back to regional pricing.
did that happen on those contracts?
eric norris -- president of lithium
so, on the first question, pj, good morning. it's -- it's eric here. the carbon delta on carbonate and the inversion of carbonate being higher than historically -- historically hydroxide is a buck or two lower. we think that's a -- that's a dislocation of a rapidly responding china market which is largely carbonate and not -- not a longtime trend.
it's important to understand that a lot of the hydroxide market is supplied by low-cost brine producers of which albemarle is one, converting to hydroxide which is what we do with kings mountain. and without that supply, there's not enough market, there's not enough volume for -- for the marketplace. so, the point is that the -- the economics say that there has to be that -- that incentive for those producers to go to hydroxide. so, we -- we expect that to -- to revert and we -- we are obviously very well positioned in -- in -- in both product lines to participate.
pj, your -- your second question was -- was what again, please?
pj juvekar -- citi -- analyst
so, your contract that will reset in 2020 lower, and they were expected to go back to their original price in 2021. did that -- did that happen?
eric norris -- president of lithium
well, what -- recall what we -- we had -- what we've done. our strategy has been to migrate these contracts to benefit from the -- a recovering market price. what we have -- we have converted several of them over and struck new ones based upon a market reference price, all -- either in all or a part, it depends on the customer. and we are -- we'll do the remainder this year going forward.
so, so that's our strategy. our strategy is to take advantage of the inflection of price not to go back to our fixed price in the past necessarily, although there are some customers who -- who are asking for that, right? so, it's not a one-size-fits-all answer, but the aim is to benefit from a recovering market in prices in terms of how we structure those contracts.
pj juvekar -- citi -- analyst
so, eric, if i heard you right, you're saying that your contracts are going to be more sort of dependent on price or maybe more variable pricing as opposed to like a fixed annual price?
eric norris -- president of lithium
that is correct. that is correct. it will vary. look, i -- i -- i can give you examples of some customers who want a fixed price.
they want the stability. that's -- that today is a price is well above -- we're not going agree to that unless it's well above market. and -- but that's -- that's one segment of a customer base. another segment and a big chunk want some variability to say that they're able to move with the market price relative to other -- their competitors or other sources supply they buy.
and as a result, those contracts will have that kind of a -- a market-based component to them either collared or in part for their volume or for a large part of their volume. the degree to which we give that flexibility also dictates how much of a commitment we make to them as well. the more spot-based the customer wants to be, the less likely we're going to commit to them long term and use that as part of our justification for expansion. so, there are some caveats there in our value proposition but that's how we're approaching things.
and all of this is going to allow us we believe to really improve our overall mix on a price-and-profitability basis as the market price recovers.
pj juvekar -- citi -- analyst
great. thank you for that.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from robert koort with goldman sachs. your line is now open.
robert koort -- goldman sachs -- analyst
thank you very much. let me explore a little bit more on the marbl integration with how you plan your lithium expansion. so, a couple of questions there. what will be the transfer price from talison to the kemerton marbl jvs? and why pursue the chinese expansion in concert with marbl if you can get 100% of it and now you have the financial wherewithal with the, you know, accommodating equity markets to fund that kind of expansion.
why share that? why not keep it all for your shareholders?
kent masters -- chief executive officer
yeah. so, well, i -- i would say the short answer on that is that was in our original agreement that we would do two of the 50,000 tonnes and then the next one we expect to do would be the one in china. and that -- that's part -- that's part of the jv. so, we -- i mean, and, you know, the -- the jv was done cause one, to get the resource for the wodgina mine, we have that.
and also, their expertise in mining to help us on that side because we're more of chemical processing expertise on our side and -- and they bring the expertise on the -- on the mining side. so, that's kind of the logic behind overall and that's -- that -- that's part of the -- the original deal that we did with them. so, we're -- we're committed to doing another project -- another conversion project with them.
robert koort -- goldman sachs -- analyst
ok. and -- and maybe if i could get an answer on the transfer price from talison and also your new la negra project is going to use thermal evaporator. can you talk about what that does to the cost structure out of the la negra iii and iv versus the capacity that's already there i and ii from a cost-curve standpoint? thanks.
kent masters -- chief executive officer
yeah. so, on the -- the transfer price, i mean, it's a kind of established market price that we were following australian tax rules around that. and so, it's a -- it's a market -- i would say it's a market price -- arm's-length market transaction around that. and then the thermal evaporator, i mean, there -- it was -- it was a return project that's driven by financials, but probably just as much around sustainability.
so, it allows us to operate without water or -- or much less water than we were using before. and that, you know, that's an area where water is tight and then the cost of that. i think the returns were -- were good. i don't recall exactly what they were.
i don't know that they were extraordinary, but the benefit was also around from a sustainability perspective as well.
robert koort -- goldman sachs -- analyst
great. thanks a bunch.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from mike sison with wells fargo. your line is now open.
mike sison -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
hey guys, good morning. just one quick question on -- on your 2025 forecast. do you and sort of pundits believe the industry can sort of support that by then? and then how much capacity do you hope to have on -- online by 2025 to support that growth?
kent masters -- chief executive officer
so, i mean, i think the, i mean, i -- i can't speak for the industry. so, part of -- as we see acceleration in ev adoption, that's kind of what has moved us in this current pivot toward accelerating our growth plans. and the goal was that we kind of maintain our share in there. eric, maybe you want to talk about the capacity in 2025.
i don't have that number in my head.
eric norris -- president of lithium
well, i think a -- a rule of thumb way to think about our capacity growth and the plans that we've put forth for wave 3 and for wave 4 to -- to sustain our leadership and grow with the market is, you know, it's going to be hydroxide way to the growth. we already commented on that earlier in an earlier question and it's -- it's going to require as you get on the middle part of the decade us bringing at least 50,000 tonnes to market a year of hydroxide. and that is -- that is what that plan if you look at the details, would enable into the middle of decade and beyond. so, approximately speaking, you're talking about 150,000 tonnes of growth a year in the market price or in that neighborhood, mike, and are bringing on 50,000.
that's -- that's the kind of pace we're looking at.
mike sison -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
great. thank you.
operator
thank you. this concludes our question-and-answer session. i would now like to turn the call back over to kent masters for closing remarks.
kent masters -- chief executive officer
ok. thank you, joelle. in closing, albemarle is well-positioned to capitalize on long-term growth trends for all three of our core businesses. we have built the capabilities to accelerate low-capital intensity, higher-return growth.
at the same time, we will continue to control what we can control. that means first and foremost, focusing on the health and well-being of our employees, customers, and communities. it also means building operational discipline and sustainability into all aspects of our business including manufacturing, supply chain, capital project execution, and customer experience. we -- we remain confident in our strategy and we will modify execution to position albemarle for success.
thank you.

ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. and welcome to the albemarle corporation q4 2020 earnings conference call. at this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. after the speaker presentation.
there will be a question and answer session. [operator instructions] i would now return the conference to your speaker today, meredith bandy, vp of investor relations and sustainability. please, go ahead ma'am.
meredith bandy -- vice president of investor relations and sustainability
hi. thank you, jewel. and welcome to albemarle's fourth-quarter 2020 earnings conference call. our earnings were released after the close in the market yesterday and you will find the materials posted to our website under the investor section at albemarle.com.
joining me on the call today are kent masters, chief executive officer; and scott tozier, chief financial officer. raphael crawford, president of catalysts; netha johnson, president of bromine; and eric norris, president of lithium, are also available for q&a. as a reminder, some of the statements made during this conference call including our outlook, expected company performance, expected impacts of the covid-19 pandemic, and proposed expansion projects may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws. please note the cautionary language about forward-looking statements contained in our press release and that same language applies to this call.
please also note that some of our comments today may refer to financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with gaap. a reconciliation to these measures to gaap can be found in our earnings release and the appendix of our earnings presentation, both of which are posted to the website. now, i will turn the call over to kent. 
kent masters -- chief executive officer
thanks, meredith. and thank you all for joining us today. on today's call, i will highlight recent accomplishments and discuss our strategy to capitalize on the very attractive long-term growth trends we see for our businesses. scott will give more detail on our result outlook and capital allocation.
i'm pleased to say that albemarle reported solid fourth-quarter results including net sales of $879 million and adjusted ebitda of $221 million. both of which were at -- at or above the high end of our previous outlook. i'm also encouraged by the rebound we began to see in the second half of the year, particularly for bromine and lithium. we expect to generate full-year 2021 net sales of between $3.2 billion and $3.3 billion and adjusted ebitda of between $810 million and $860 million, both up from 2020 results.
as i'm sure you were aware, earlier this month, we completed a $1.5 billion capital raise. the proceeds of this offering provide the financial flexibility to execute our long-term strategy including the acceleration of high-return growth projects. now we turn to slide 5. we have a clear strategy to drive sustainable value for our shareholders.
albemarle has four primary strategic objectives. first, we will grow profitably. we have identified and planned a portfolio of low capital intensity high-return projects. these projects lever our diverse world-class resources in both lithium and bromine.
over the past five years, we have built the internal team and capabilities to execute these projects on time and on budget. in addition, we have the long-term commercial relationships with customers that are required for these projects. we are working to ensure that we are aligning with their strategic requirements while achieving adequate returns for our shareholders. of course, the majority of our growth will be in lithium but at the same time, we will be investing in our bromine projects.
this will include highly efficient brownfield projects with attractive returns and short paybacks. i'm sure netha would be happy to give you more detail when we get to q&a. second, we will maximize productivity. over the past year, we have optimized earnings and cash flow generation across our business including our very successful, sustainable cost-savings program.
operational discipline is essential for generating cash flow and supporting growth and we will not take our eyes off the ball even as we move into an accelerated growth phase. third, we will invest in discipline. focusing our capital investments on our highest return opportunities just as we have in the past, we will actively assess our portfolio for opportunities to unlock shareholder value. we will also continue to maintain our investment-grade credit rating and support our dividend.
fourth and finally, we will advance sustainability across our businesses which is a core value, which is a core value for albemarle. our aim is to increase sustainability throughout the value chain from the resource to the end-use of our products. most recognizably, we develop lithium products that enable the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions through the adoption of battery electric vehicles. our catalyst business contributes to sustainability by helping refiners produce cleaner transportation fuels.
and our bromine products contribute to consumer safety at preventing fires in electronic equipment. with continued regulatory changes, advancements in technology, and investments in infrastructure like charging stations, the current environment is ideal for a step-change in ev adoption. we are seeing this play out in the acceleration of global ev sales led by rebounding demand in china and new demand in europe. global ev sales increased 45% during 2020 and are expected to increase by over 70% in 2021.
on the right-hand side of the slide, you see demand projections for lithium over the next 5 to 10 years. based on our internal estimates, we believe demand will reach more than 1.1 million tons by 2025, up from around 300,000 tons today. this is slightly higher than third-party projections from industry analysts like benchmark minerals, roskill, and the cru -- cru group. but as you can see, the consensus is that the industry expects to see significant growth in the coming years.
as the industry leader in lithium, albemarle is able to take these external estimates, internal forecasts, and discussions with our strategic customers and suppliers to generate a detailed demand forecast. on slide 7, you see other metrics we use to gauge the future of the lithium market. while albemarle's demand for -- demand outlook for lithium is above third-party estimates, our outlook is below some of the more ambitious targets from automotive oems. for example, tesla's vision of three terawatt hours of battery production by 2030 would translate to roughly 2.3 million tons of lithium.
that means, that tesla's demand alone would exceed estimates for the entire market. additional regulatory impacts, for example, if the u.s. decides to adopt more european-like ev incentives would be incremental to our estimates. total lithium demand is expected to grow by about 30% per year from 2020 to 2025, led by lithium consumption and electric vehicles which are expected to grow by 47% per year.
two other trends support lithium demand: increased adoption of battery electric vehicles, and larger battery size. battery electric vehicles and larger battery size improve the com -- consumer experience with longer driving ranges and innovation in batteries is also driving shorter charging times. it's important to note that this outlook does not assume a major shift in battery technologies over the next five years. advanced battery technologies like solid state batteries could potentially increase lithium intensity later this decade.
since 2015, we've nearly tripled our nameplate conversion capacity to 85,000 tons per year. later this year, we expect to complete two major projects which we refer to as wave ii. wave ii consists of our la negra iii and iv project and kemerton i and ii projects which will more than double our current capacity to 175,000 tons per year. over the last five years, we engaged with our customers with long term volume commitments to execute this portfolio of projects.
now, with this new acceleration in demand, customers are asking us to repeat the model. our next two waves of expansion could once again more than double our nameplate capacity. with lower capital intensity, we expect these projects to generate very attractive returns. the identified and planned wave iii projects would add 150,000 tons of annual capacity over the next three to five years.
this third wave includes a conversion plant in china, which would be part of our marbl -- marbl joint venture; a smaller expansion at our silver peak asset in nevada; another plant in china on a new mega site; and kemerton iii and iv brownfield project in australia. we also have identified opportunities for a fourth wave of projects. these could include further expansions in australia, china, and southeast asia and the potential to restart the mine and expand our conversion facility at kings mountain in north carolina. wave iv also includes options to support customers looking to localize supply.
for example, by converting carbonate to hydroxide near the battery manufacturer. and before we continue, let me update you our wave ii projects. so la negra iii and iv enable us to add lithium carbonate capacity at the very low end of the cost curve. the project remains on track for mechanical completion in mid-2021.
kemerton i and ii, our new lithium hydroxide conversion plant in western australia, is on track to reach mechanical completion late in 2021. kemerton is core to our hydroxide capacity in line with expected strong long-term market demand. both of these projects will add significant commercial lithium sales beginning in 2022 following commissioning and customer qualification processes. as we move from wave ii to wave iii projects and beyond, we expect an estimated 40% reduction in capital intensity to support compelling economic returns.
we can achieve these capital efficiencies and returns for three key reasons. first, we were able to leverage our experience and project execution by building standardized plants with economies of scale. for example, we expect new hydroxide plant would be a standard two trains or 50,000 tons per year similar to what we are building at kemerton today. second, in many cases, we're moving from greenfield to brownfield economics.
just as today we're moving from la negra i and ii to la negra iii and iv. likewise, we'll move from kemerton i and ii to kemerton iii and iv and so on. as with kemerton, the focus will be on building what we call mega sites -- standardize, large-scale plants able to support multiple trains for lithium conversion. finally, we'll be buying or building additional facilities in low-cost jurisdictions as we did when we successively acquired and then expanded our guangzhou facility in china in 2016.
before i turn it over to scott to review recent results, i'd like to acknowledge all the hard work by albemarle team to continue to operate during the global pandemic as well as their ability to achieve significant progress on our long term strategy. a year ago, when my predecessor laid out our 2020 strategic objectives, i don't think any of us could've imagined how the year would play out. despite all the challenges, our team has delivered. we set ourselves up to grow profitably keeping our major lithium capital projects on track for 2021 completion.
we maximize productivity achieving $80 million of sustainable cost savings in 2020, 60% above our initial targets. we demonstrated financial discipline, completing our 26 consecutive years of dividend increases and maintaining our investment-grade credit rating throughout the pandemic related downturn. and finally, we improved the sustainability of our businesses by establishing baseline environmental data and improving our reporting and transparency. now -- i'll now turn the call over to scott for a detailed review of the 2020 financial results.
scott tozier -- chief financial officer
thanks, kent, and good morning, everyone. albemarle generated fourth-quarter net sales of over $879 million, a decrease of about 11% compared to the prior year. but at the high end of our previous outlook, this reduction was primarily due to reduce prices in lithium, as expected coming into the year, and reduced volumes and catalysts offset by improvements in bromine. gaap net income was $85 million.
adjusted eps of $1.17 excludes a pension mark-to-market loss due to lowered discount rates. as kent stated, adjusted ebitda was $221 million, above the high end of our previous outlook. turning to slide 13 for a look at adjusted ebitda by business segment. lithium ebitda declined by $17 million versus the prior year.
pricing was down about 20% in the quarter due to contract pricing adjustments agreed in late 2019 as well as product mix. volumes were higher than expected due to a combination of improving demand and customers fulfilling their full year contract commitments. cost savings to help offset the impact of lower prices. bromine's ebitda was up about $7 million.
the increase was due to higher volumes and higher pricing. bromine is overall a good news story. the business has essentially rebounded to pre-pandemic levels. in q4, they benefited from higher demand, customer restocking, and some short-term supply demand imbalances for both raw materials and finished goods.
catalyst's ebitda declined by $53 million primarily due to lower volumes. this business continues to be the most challenged of the three due to ongoing travel restrictions as well as reduced refinery capacity utilization and margins. fluid catalytic cracking or fcc volume improved sequentially but remain down compared to the prior year quarter. hydroprocessing catalyst or hpc volumes were also down with a tough comparable relative to an unusually strong q4 2019.
our corporate and other category ebitda decreased by $8 million due to a mix of slight -- slightly lower fine chemistry services results and slightly higher corporate costs. the fcs business is contract-driven and can vary quarter to quarter. full-year results were very strong compared to history. compare the -- comparing the full year to fourth quarter, you can see it and get a sense of the rebound we started to see in the second half of 2020, particularly for lithium and bromine.
we are pivoting capital allocation to prioritize high-return growth projects to out -- to align with strategic customer demand and maintain our leadership positions. we remain committed to preserving the financial flexibility necessary to fund growth and to maintain our investment-grade credit rating. we'll also continue to support our dividend although dividend growth may be lower than the historical average while we build out the next wave of growth projects that will enable higher return opportunities. finally, we will pursue a disciplined and thoughtful approach to investments including m&a and joint ventures.
as we said in the past, the most likely m&a you'd see us do would be both on acquisitions of lithium conversion assets in cases where buying allows us to grow more quickly and generate better returns than building. we are finalizing the sale of our fine chemistry services and performance catalyst solutions businesses and expect to update you in the coming months. let's turn to slide 15 for a look at our balance sheet. the primary use of proceeds from our equity offering is to accelerate profitable growth.
the 90% or about 90% of the proceeds are for lithium growth with most of the remainder for enhancements to our bromine business. the returns on these projects are highly attractive and we expect to generate returns at least two times are weighted average cost of capital at mid-cycle pricing. these are large, long-dated projects with a bulk of incremental spending in 2022 through 2025. in the meantime, instead of holding the proceeds as cash, we plan to delever which will reduce interest expense and cash drag on the balance sheet.
this will enable us to use cash and debt capacity to fund investments as they are approved. our long-term target net leverage ratio remains 2 to 2.5 times adjusted ebitda. pro forma for the offering, we are below that range but expect to increase our leverage as needed to accelerate growth and deliver returns to shareholders. overall, we expect 2021 results to improve year over year.
for the total company, we expect net sales to be higher year over year as our businesses continue to recover from the event -- events of 2020. adjusted ebitda of between $810 million and $860 million also suggests potential upside compared to 2020 due to higher net sales and ongoing cost savings. we expect capex to be slightly higher year over year as we begin to execute our accelerated growth projects. however, as i mentioned earlier the bulk of that spending for these projects will be in 2022 to 2025.
net cash from operations is expected to be lower due to higher cash taxes and higher inventories as we start up the two new lithium plants. expectations for adjusted diluted eps of $3.25 to $3.65 is lower than last year due to higher taxes and depreciation as well as the increased share count. due to the recent severe winter weather, we have temporarily shut down four of our u.s. plants.
our bay port, pasadena, magnolia, and baton rouge plants have been down since monday. once it is safe to do so we will restart these facilities. and this situation is still evolving. at this point, we expect some impact to q1 results, and potentially, q2.
it's possible the weather will have more of an impact than what is currently included in this outlook, and we'll update you if there are any material changes. let's turn to slide 17. lithium results are expected to be relatively flat compared to 2020. we expect slightly higher volumes with the restart of north american production late -- late last year, as well as modest efficiency improvements.
as usual, we expect volumes to be back-half weighted for lithium. at this point, we still anticipate slightly lower pricing, depending on full-year average realized pricing for carbonate and technical-grade products. our new contract structures provide increased flexibility to increase price in response to improving market prices. lithium costs will be slightly higher year over year related to the start-up costs associated with la negra and kemerton, partially offset by continued cost and efficiency improvements.
and as kent discussed, the long-term growth story for lithium is intact. in catalysts, we expect 2021 results to be flat year over year, including higher pcs earnings. we -- we expect a decline in north american refining catalysts volume. this is primarily a result of one customer who recently indicated that they would deselect albemarle's catalysts due to our public support for electric vehicles.
longer term, we are continuing to position the catalysts business to grow in emerging markets and capitalize on our strengths as a global specialty chemicals producer in the crude-to-chemicals market and the renew -- renewable fuels market. raphael can give more color on the challenges and opportunities we see for our catalysts business during q&a. in bromine, we expect full-year 2021 results to improve modestly with continued economic recovery and a return to sold-out plants. our ongoing savings initiatives should offset the impact of inflation.
looking ahead, we see steady demand increases for our flagship fire safety products, driven by new technology trends like 5g and electric vehicles. i'll turn it back to kent to review our strategic objectives for 2021.
kent masters -- chief executive officer
thanks, scott. albemarle finished strong in 2020 and we are excited about the opportunities ahead of us in 2021. we will continue to execute our long-term strategy. the successful completion of our wave 2 projects and investment decisions on new expansion projects in lithium and bromine.
we are also working with customers to reach commercial agreements for a majority of new capacity prior to investing. we will continue to maximize productivity with operational discipline across our businesses, including cost reduction, lean principles, continuous improvement, and project execution excellence. we expect to achieve $75 million of productivity improvements in 2021. we will be disciplined stewards of capital, investing in high return growth, maintaining our investment-grade credit rating, and supporting our dividend.
finally, we will continue to implement and improve sustainability across our company, including setting near-term goals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions at our existing operations and exploring science-based target options for all three of our businesses. and with that, we'd like to open up the call for questions. so joel, over to you.

operator
thank you. [operator instructions] and our first question coming from the line of david deckelbaum with cowen. your line is open.
david deckelbaum -- cowen and company -- analyst
good morning, guys. thanks for the time this morning. i wanted to follow up on your questions around potentially looking at acquiring a chinese hydroxide conversion facility. can you just expand upon that a bit and just help us understand what sort of metrics are you using to weigh acquisition right now? we've seen a lot of your peers looking to expand conversion capacity in the western hemisphere.
how should we think about the scale of this? and what sort of things you'd be looking for before making an acquisition like that?
jerry masters -- chairman, president, and chief executive officer
yes. so we've -- and i'll make a few comments, and then eric can give you some detail if i don't get there. but we've -- and we've looked at china very much, we're very familiar with the operators there, and we've been kind of looking at these opportunities for some time. we've made acquisitions in the past so we feel pretty comfortable with this, with the assets that are on the ground and what we would need to do to move them to our standards.
so we did that at xinyu. we bought an asset and we've expanded, and we consider that to be very successful. so we like the model. we're comfortable.
we've got people on the ground in china. so we're able to do good due diligence. we have -- we'd be able to staff a new facility with -- partially from people from our existing plants. so we feel very comfortable with the strategy.
and then, i think it seemed like part of your question was about people looking at different geographies. and we're looking at different geographies as well, but we still see growth in asia as being a big part of the growth coming forward. and ultimately, we'll be moving in other locations around the world. but we still see growth in asia, which is why we're looking at this as a strategy.
david deckelbaum -- cowen and company -- analyst
i appreciate that. and then, just perhaps on my follow-up, you talked about just pricing this quarter, obviously driven by increased volumes of a greater mix of carbonate and industrial grade. as we think about growth coming online from wave 2, when do you think we should think -- as we think about pricing with contracts rolling, at what point do we see battery grade making up a greater component of the overall mix? is that really like a late 2023 dynamic just given sort of delays around qualification? or how should we think about that as you guys increase capacity into the market?
jerry masters -- chairman, president, and chief executive officer
yes. i think that means a big piece is already battery-grade material and both carbonate and hydroxide. but i'll let eric get into the details, maybe around timing as they layer in.
eric norris -- president, lithium
yes. so the volume -- just to build on what kent said, 60% of our business today is energy storage. and that's split between carbonate and hydroxide relatively evenly as we sit here today. with the expansions coming on, we have -- it will still be split because we have a large expansion in kemerton in hydroxide and, similarly, one in la negra on carbonate.
so that's where our growth is. as we bring that capacity on, that's where the volume will go. so that 60% of sales will grow larger on a volume basis. now, in terms of pricing, that's an evolution that we're going through now in our contracts.
we've had, as you may know, concessions we made to fixed-price contracts we've done in the past. and while that's given us security of supply to run our plants and strong margins at the bottom of the cycle, we're now evolving those pricing mechanisms to give us more exposure to the market as it recovers. and that will benefit this volume as well. we bring on volume under new terms that will allow us to benefit from a rising market.
jerry masters -- chairman, president, and chief executive officer
does that answer your question?
david deckelbaum -- cowen and company -- analyst
yes, for the most part. thank you, guys.
operator
our next question coming from the line of joel jackson with bmo capital markets. your line is open.
robin fiedler -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
hi. this is robin on for joel. thanks for taking my question. you talked about being limited on lithium inventories to meet your own demand.
how much offline conversion in spodumene capacity do you see reramping in the industry this year to meet total industry demand? and how quickly do you see industry inventories rebuilding? or maybe you can talk about overall tightness and what that could mean for pricing.
eric norris -- president, lithium
so robin, it's eric here again. i think the short answer to your question is while mines are restarting, there are still some that went into the bankruptcy phase in australia that still haven't come back. they are -- it takes some time, particularly in western australia right now given the labor crisis and the rising iron ore prices, to mobilize both equipment and labor personnel to restart a plant. so what we foresee going forward, given the strong demand that's starting to develop -- or has been under development in china and is now ramping around the world, that it's going to remain short in china.
that spodumene is going to be a constraint. that is why you're seeing carbonate prices rise so quickly in china, where there is a high demand, in particular for carbonate for some of the recovering industries in china post-pandemic, but also because of the growth of lfp chemistry, specifically in china. and inventories are a bare minimum in the chinese market and have come back to normal levels worldwide, which is why we were in a position during the first quarter to otherwise thought, like as in prior quarters, would not be a strong quarter, where it was quite the opposite. we had to pull volumes forward into that to drive the growth that you saw.
we're limited in what we can do, but we'll benefit greatly when we bring on that new capacity and be well positioned into 2022.
robin fiedler -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
that's really helpful. and just a quick follow-up. so i assume the rationale to reinstate tolling is to meet that market tightness. so is that strategy temporary then? maybe you can discuss the amount of volume from tolling and what the margin impact from that is, because i think the previous long-term target for lithium margins was closer to 40%.
obviously, things are trending sub-35 right now. maybe you can just elaborate on those points.
jerry masters -- chairman, president, and chief executive officer
tolling has always been a bridging strategy for us, and it's only ever done in carbonate because we feel that there's adequate carbonate capacity out there that can meet the standards for that product, and hydroxide is something we view as different and more proprietary. the bridging strategy, in this case, is to get us revamped in relationships with chinese customers that we've supplied in the past such that when we bring on la negra 3 and next year, we have a ready customer base to take that on. so i would think of it as ad hoc or bridging. it's not a sustained strategy.
it is something -- we're not -- i can't get into the details of volumes per se. but it is to, as you point out, not as lucrative, not as high a margin of business for us because we're paying somebody to convert for us. so it moves us to the right on the cost curve, whereas we're normally on the left side, you're moving more toward the right, so that impacts margins. but it does provide incremental ebitda, and it does set us up for a successful ramp next year.
robin fiedler -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
thank you very much.
operator
and our next question coming from the line of david begleiter with deutsche bank. your line is open.
david begleiter -- deutsche bank -- analyst
first, in lithium, what was the benefit of the acceleration of customer orders into q1 on ebitda?
jerry masters -- chairman, president, and chief executive officer
thank you. good morning. david, i'm going to have to -- let me just take a quick look. but i think it's meaningful in terms of the volume.
so it's probably in the 30s -- $30 million range, something like that.
scott tozier -- chief financial officer
another way of think about it, david, is that you may have had -- i don't know your model, but you may have had -- to get to guidance, you may have had a much stronger second half than first half. and because of the robust demand, whatever we make, we're selling. there's not very little going to inventory. so the quarters are going to be a lot more even or similar this year than they were last year for the lithium business.
david begleiter -- deutsche bank -- analyst
got it. got it. and eric, just on la negra and kemerton following the commissioning qualification processes, how should we think about volume ramp-up for these two new assets?
eric norris -- president, lithium
yes. so we've kind of -- we've said those will ramp up over a period of time. so from, we first turn it on, nothing, to getting us to expect to get to a full ramp of say, 18 months, and some of that depends on demand and customers. but -- so over that first year per line, you -- probably 40 or 50% of capacity in the first 12 months.
that's probably the best way to think about it. and some of that will depend on demand, but we think we expect demand to be there.
david begleiter -- deutsche bank -- analyst
perfect. thank you.
operator
and our next question is coming from the line of jeff zekauskas with j.p. morgan. your line is open.
jeff zekauskas -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
thank you very much. when you bring on your new capacity in 2022, '23 in lithium, how might you compare the pricing structures that will be negotiated versus the current pricing structures that you have today? that is, how has the market changed? and how has albemarle changed in the way that you charge your customers or contemplate charging your customers?
jerry masters -- chairman, president, and chief executive officer
right. so we've been talking about kind of the shift in our commercial strategy in lithium for some time. we kind of delayed -- intentionally delayed the conversion from kind of a strict long-term fixed-price contract to one that is more indicative of the market, that moves more with the market. and we'd have different types of customers we'd contract slightly different ways.
we delayed the conversion of that a little bit because the market was so far down. we didn't think it was the right time to negotiate at the bottom of the market, so we held off on that. so that strategy hasn't changed and the new volume doesn't change that. so i think we're moving into that dynamic as we go through the next 12 months or that the contracts we'll be negotiating will be on that new basis.
so portfolio of customers with -- kind of customers who really want security of supply will be more of a fixed price, but it will still move with the markets and then contract with other people that look more like market prices. not spot prices contracted, but prices that move with the market. and that's what we've been talking about for the, i would say, almost the last year. and we did delay the implementation intentionally because we felt like we didn't want to negotiate at the bottom of the market.
jeff zekauskas -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
ok great. thank you so much.
operator
and our next question coming from the line of colin rusch with oppenheimer. your line is open.
joe beninati -- oppenheimer & company -- analyst
hey, guys. it's joe on for colin. can you speak a little bit to how challenging hiring is at this point as you get ready to bring capacity on early next year?
scott tozier -- chief financial officer
challenging hiring next year.
jerry masters -- chairman, president, and chief executive officer
ok. all right. sorry, i missed that. so yes, hiring.
so yes, so i mean there were two locations. so chile and kemerton, so western australia, and a different dynamic because we've got a significant operation in chile already. so i don't -- it's not such a challenge in that location. a bigger issue in chile at the moment is covid.
but we're able to bring people on there, and we've been bringing them on, training them with the existing staff. and australia is a little different because it's a true greenfield facility. but we've been hiring. we've been -- we're happy with the plan.
we've been doing well. in the labor market, it's a different -- a little different dynamic in the construction market than it is in the chemical operating market. so we've been able to hire according to our plans and ramp up staff that would operate the facility according to our plan. so that hasn't impacted us.
what's been more of a challenge is in the construction labor market and getting the staff that we need to complete construction. and we were actually trying to accelerate it, but we're not able to do that. we're just kind of treading water with our original plan.
joe beninati -- oppenheimer & company -- analyst
ok. that's helpful. and then, switching gears a little bit. beyond pricing, can you speak to any other elements of your long-term contracts that you're working to improve, given what seems like a better negotiating position?
jerry masters -- chairman, president, and chief executive officer
well, i would -- i mean i guess it's several elements, but it's really about the guaranteed supply, the profile of that supply. pricing is a big part of that and liabilities. eric, you have --
eric norris -- president, lithium
i would say that the big -- the evolution of the dialogue, where we feel we have a lot of value to offer now is location of supply, as well as the localization. and we've referenced in our expansion strategies down the road how we can play to that. and it's -- for many of our customers, that's a down the road consideration because the vast majority of the business today is still asia-based. and then, the other is sustainability.
sustainability has been key. as oems become more involved and have thought through their value proposition, which is based on lower co2 and other sustainable factors, they want suppliers who are differentiated in that regard. and what we are doing, what kent described in the call, has real value. we talk in these calls very much about what it means to shareholders of being part of the s&p 500 esg index.
for me, it's about driving a value proposition with our customers and getting paid for it. so that's become a big part of our proposition as well.
joe beninati -- oppenheimer & company -- analyst
super helpful. thank you very much.
operator
our next question coming from the line of vincent andrews with morgan stanley.
unknown speaker
hi. this is angel on for vincent. just curious on your wave 3, what are the key gating factors that you kind of see for both capacity and lithium and bromine before you actually announce fid?
jerry masters -- chairman, president, and chief executive officer
i'm sorry, you said the key?
unknown speaker
the key gating factors or what are the primary, i guess, checkpoints sort of things that you want to see before you actually make the fid decision?
jerry masters -- chairman, president, and chief executive officer
yes. so i mean we're looking -- right. so we're -- i mean we're looking at projects, identifying them, designing in the plans for that. so i guess it's anything you would expect to see in a normal investment program.
so we're getting -- making sure that we've got designs, the process chemistry that we like. we've lined up -- we have the resources. that's not an issue. but a lot of it's about location, about permitting, workforce.
i mean of all the things that you would see that we would line up. but we're relatively advanced at looking at that. and then, obviously, when you get to that decision point, the returns are a big deal.
unknown speaker
got it. and then, switching, i guess, to bromine a little bit. you talked about the favorable mix, customer, i guess, not repeating going forward. one, i guess, could you give us a little bit more color on that and why it won't repeat? and then as we think about kind of the second half or kind of 2q and beyond, should we expect higher pricing in bromine to kind of offset both the shorter supply because of lost production because of the area and also the raw materials headwind that you mentioned?
scott tozier -- chief financial officer
yes. this is scott. i would start, and maybe netha can add some additional color. but in the first quarter, the bromine market overall was relatively short.
so it gave us some nice opportunities in the spot market to take advantage of that and get some upside. we're not expecting that kind of condition to continue through the rest of the year. but maybe, netha, you have more specifics?
netha johnson -- president, bromine specialties
yes. just as scott described, we had a chance to go sell some volume out of inventory to our noncontracted customers that increased demand based on market recovery. that's a unique opportunity and at very good pricing. we don't expect that to continue through the second half of the year.
but just like the other industrial businesses, as you look forward, to the second part of your question, freight and raw materials are going up. and they'll do the same for us and that will impact our business in q2 and beyond for the rest of the year.
unknown speaker
that's all i had. thank you.
operator
your next question coming from the line of matthew deyoe with bank of america. your line is open.
matthew deyoe -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
hi. thanks, can we talk a little bit about the puts and takes on lithium ebitda as we move sequentially through the year? i kind of understand the transition from 1q to 2q, but it seems like you're guiding for price to improve sequentially as we move through the year, but also costs are up. so perhaps like how much cost do you expect to incur with these new plant start-ups? and when would that roll off?
scott tozier -- chief financial officer
yes. this is scott. so in the second half, we just have something in the range of 10 to $15 million of incremental costs from those plants. it all depends on the timing of when those come in.
but that's the kind of range that we're looking at ultimately. so as you look at the puts and takes, obviously, there's a limit in terms of our ability to supply additional volume. we're getting some out of tolling. of course, that comes at a lower margin ultimately for us.
so that's a bit of a drag from a margin perspective as well.
matthew deyoe -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
ok. and then, on catalysts, you made a comment that you don't expect to get back to pre-covid levels before late 2022, 2023. so can you just walk through your assumptions there? is that just all miles driven? or is there something else that's happening?
jerry masters -- chairman, president, and chief executive officer
ultimately, it's coming from our customers and what our customers are telling them. but maybe, raphael, you can provide some additional color as to the specific parts of the market that are slower than others.
raphael crawford -- president, catalysts
sure, scott. so i think there's a few different pieces that come into play. i mean one of them is miles driven is a big driver of recovery in refining utilization. i think we're already starting to see an improvement in refining utilization, and you'll see that throughout the year and into next year.
that's going to have -- will have a big effect on fcc usage at the refineries. and our business, about 60% of our business is fcc, so we'll see that recovery. on the cft or hpc business, that business is timed with turnarounds at refineries. a lot of that's been pushed out until 2022, and that's when we'll start to see an uptick in that business.
the portfolio we have in our business is very much geared toward high performance. when refiners are running near capacity, that's really when the value of our business -- of our products kicks in because we help them maximize on yield, maximize on the throughput through their assets. so as it recovers, we'll start to see that leverage effect in the return of our business.
matthew deyoe -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
ok. and so, just right now, you're seeing mix just mixing down across some of the catalyst because people don't need their utilization through the refineries?
raphael crawford -- president, catalysts
yes. i think that's a fair statement. we have a -- we see a mix impact and a volume impact, but we expect both of those to reverse as the world recovers.
operator
and our next question, coming from the line of arun viswanathan with rbc capital markets. your line is open.
arun viswanathan -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
great. thanks for taking my question. good morning. i'm just curious what you're seeing, i guess, in china? there's been obviously some robust recovery in lithium markets in there, as well as in europe.
do you expect that to kind of continue into next year? is there an environment or scenario where you see prices kind of getting back to, say, the 12 to $14,000 per ton range? maybe you can just comment on what your outlook for pricing is for hydroxide.
jerry masters -- chairman, president, and chief executive officer
yes. it's hard to comment too much on price. i mean, those are the -- that's the magic question. but the market is clearly moving in that direction.
and you're seeing the demand growth. so the demand growth we expect to continue. i mean what we're seeing is kind of -- it's extraordinary, but it may not be 135%, but it's going to be 70, 80% for the year around ev levels, and lithium is going to follow that. so demand growth is going to be there.
and pricing has moved very quickly in china because that's mostly a spot market, so it would move quicker. that hasn't translated into the contract market fully yet. so it has started to, we think, and we see that moving in that direction over time. it's hard to predict what's going to happen out into the future, but we see prices moving up.
and that what's happening in the spot market will translate into the contract prices. and that will be a positive for albemarle.
arun viswanathan -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
and just as a quick follow-up then. a couple of years ago, you were discussing contracts with term lengths of maybe seven, 10 years at times. have you seen your customers kind of come back to you now with requests to kind of elongate their contracts? or -- yes, maybe you can just comment on the customer environment from a contracting perspective.
jerry masters -- chairman, president, and chief executive officer
let me start, eric can add some detail to that. so -- but i would say, i mean, our philosophy hasn't really changed. we've adjusted a bit on the kind of the nature. i would say we've evolved in our contracting structure, but it's really still the same philosophy.
and i think our customers are kind of coming around to that way of thinking a bit. and i think it's changing because some of it's with oems now. several years ago, we were talking to cathode makers, then battery makers and now it's oems and still talking across that -- all three of those areas, but the oems are getting more involved, and they have a longer-term view. so i don't know about 10-year contracts, but three-year, five-year, maybe seven on the longest term.
but those are the kind of -- that's the nature of the contracts that we're discussing. i don't know anyone's pushing us further than that.
operator
and our next question, coming from the line of aleksey yefremov with keybanc. your line is open.
paul staudinger -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
this is paul on for aleksey. could you update us on any lithium recycling initiatives currently so far?
eric norris -- president, lithium
so yes, paul, eric here. recycling is a key part of -- key platform for us going forward from a growth standpoint, both because our customers who as kent just indicated, are increasingly oems, value that as part of their partnership with us, and because a good amount of the know-how we have from processing lithium is going to be replicable in the streams that will come from a recycled process. we've got investments we've made in start-ups we're looking at, making through some relationships we have. we've got technology initiatives under way, with some business development activities under way to partner.
we have one joint development agreement, which we're currently doing with a customer. all these are all confidential at this stage, so i can't divulge names. but it's a pretty comprehensive effort and a critical one for our growth going forward. we aim to -- we view this as a future resource that we would like to play prominently in.
your line is open.
operator
and our next question coming from the line of john roberts from ubs.
matt skowronski -- ubs -- analyst
good morning. this is matt skowronski on for john. going off of jeff's question earlier, you mentioned that you're restructuring some of your lithium contracts. and i believe on the last call, you mentioned the majority of these contracts will eventually have some sort of variable-based pricing tied to an index.
when do you expect the majority of your contracts be based on this variable price mechanism? and how frequently does a typical contract allow for price adjustments?
eric norris -- president, lithium
right. so it's eric here. you're right. our legacy contracts had, as kent described in the past, a fixed price mechanism.
and during the crisis of the past year plus, we've -- we gave some relief on that. that relief clause expires during the course of this year. some in the middle of this year, all by the end of the year. so that's -- for our legacy contracts, that's the time frame we'll be looking to move to the new structure that we'd earlier described and that will give us that upside to rise -- have price rise with the market more freely than it would have under the fixed-price constructs.
and it's the basis for any new contracts we've struck. we've struck several new contracts, both with battery and automotive oem producers in the past three to six months. and they are in that same construct. now, it's important to note, it's not one structure.
we have some customers who actually value more consistency. and obviously, that's a higher price point from a fixed price standpoint, so we can get our returns over the cycle. and there are certain commitments we'll make to go along with them on volume. on the other hand, those who are more fixated on price, we'll have a component of our mix there.
we will be a little more -- just exercise more discretion about how long we go on some of those contracts. and so, there's going to be a mix there, there's going to be mix that we see. but the underlying message is exposure to a rising market.
matt skowronski -- ubs -- analyst
that's helpful. thank you.
operator
and our next question coming from the line of ben kallo with baird. your line is open.
ben kallo -- robert w. baird -- analyst
hey, guys. thanks for taking my question. just on bromine, i know it's not the top of du jour, but the chip shortage that we see, everyone sees out there, can you talk about how your visibility is on that? or what you could gain if there's semiconductor new builds and how -- if that benefits you? and then just on the lithium side, scott, i back when the worry was around not enough batteries being produced, and from our ev coverage, i think that's a worry too, but what do you guys see on that side as far as new capacity being built? and how you guys are modeling that yourselves and the visibility on that?
scott tozier -- chief financial officer
so yes, so on -- let me start with the second part first with the battery. i mean we're focused on making sure we get the lithium that goes with the market. and we model that from the vehicle backwards to the battery, and then to the cathodes, and it's -- there's a lot of plans and capacity being added. i don't know that we -- we're not going to put an opinion out there about capacity for batteries.
we're very focused on making sure that we've got the -- our part of the lithium market and we're building out -- somewhat all of our growth plans are about. those investments and executing on those investments so we've got lithium to provide that market. so i don't think we should comment about the capacity in the battery market, but we see a lot of projects and a lot of capability in executing those projects. on the -- maybe netha could talk a little bit about the chip shortage and how that impacts bromine from a -- i guess, that would be across all the electronics space.
netha johnson -- president, bromine specialties
yes. ben, we see the electronics market is really strong. but as scott mentioned, we're not seeing the chip shortage impact us. a strong semiconductor chip electronics market is definitely good for us.
but with us being sold out, we have very limited additional capacity to leverage that in the rest of the year. so we do have contracted volumes in those markets. those volumes are being ordered as we expect. and so, we don't really see that as an issue right now.
now, things could always change. but from where we sit in the supply chain, we're not seeing an impact right now with the chip shortage.
jerry masters -- chairman, president, and chief executive officer
and i think it's a little bit -- ben, part of your question was just about an advantage we might see coming forward. i think that's really just going to be about demand of those electronics. so what -- they build -- they need more chips, those underlying applications where we play, whether it's in automotive or just call it, the internet of things, proliferation of chips. and that's an advantage for us, so they -- but they have to be able to keep up with it for it to be an advantage for us.
ben kallo -- robert w. baird -- analyst
and if i can sneak one more in. just, what about just the overall flexibility of the three businesses? i know you guys have done a lot and -- but just overall, 80% of the questions are about lithium here. and so, how do you think about the portfolio altogether?
jerry masters -- chairman, president, and chief executive officer
yes. so look, we've got three core businesses and it's a portfolio. so catalysts is struggling a little bit. their market is not as strong because the miles driven and the issues we saw from covid there.
bromine held up very well during the pandemic. and then, really, evs and then part of that, the lithium market was accelerated through covid because of, really, the european response to the covid was really about clean energy and electric vehicles. so i think the portfolio effect is working for us. i mean we'd love for all three businesses to be striking on all cylinders.
but that's part of the portfolio. we think they're key businesses. they all fit into the sustainability angle that we're pushing. there's a sustainability piece for all three of those businesses, and that's kind of what ties them all together, and we like that portfolio.
and it's working because we -- when business is down, the other two are doing quite well, and that will probably cycle.
ben kallo -- robert w. baird -- analyst
all right. thank you.
operator
and our next question coming from the line of chris kapsch with loop capital. your line is open.
chris kapsch -- loop capital markets -- analyst
yeah. hi, good morning. so my question relates to lithium business in the industry and focused on your visibility more specifically. so the industry at this point is still pretty china-centric.
and in the materials space, china has been notoriously sort of double ordered or build excess inventories during periods of rising commodity prices. and on the flip side, as this industry has witnessed, the pain can be pretty acute when prices are coming in with destocking and the supply chain exacerbating the downward pricing pressures. granted this lithium chemicals for the battery application are not as commodity-oriented as, say, copper or iron ore or something, but i'm just wondering if you could comment on the ability right now for the industry to build back inventories or safety stocks or buffer stocks? and maybe also speaking to your visibility, how is this changing along with the procurement strategies, which are migrating maybe away from cathode producers simply to cathode plus battery and in some cases, oes. so just if you could speak to visibility on that, what the dynamic is currently and how you see that evolving.
jerry masters -- chairman, president, and chief executive officer
ok. so i mean, i guess, a bit about china. i'm not sure we have a ton more visibility, but there's not -- i mean we're fighting to keep up with demand. i think the industry is doing the same.
so i don't think they're building -- anybody's building inventory in this supply chain. everyone -- and that probably goes from batteries to cathodes to materials as well. i mean from my perspective, we're not building inventories, we actually sold down inventories to take advantage or to satisfy demand in the first quarter. and i don't know, eric, if you have any more visibility around that?
eric norris -- president, lithium
no. i mean the industry is tight. i can -- up and down, not just in china, around the world, and it's a consequence, in some regards, of just how bad it got last year from a value standpoint. a lot of capacity went out of the market, a lot of projects slowed down.
so it's going to take a while to catch up and yet demand is accelerating. so it's -- we don't see a let up in the situation, which is one reason why we won't give a specific number. we see price rising going forward for the foreseeable future. china is still very important to the industry.
if there's a delay anywhere in building out capacity downstream for batteries, it's outside of china. so asia continues to be an important point going forward, which certainly in the near term, suits where we're bringing on capacity. so we're very optimistic about being able to place that capacity we're bringing on next year.
jerry masters -- chairman, president, and chief executive officer
and i would just say one thing that's a little different than some of the other industries that, kind of mining industries, iron ore, ferrous materials, i mean, we are integrated into the resource and into the conversion as well. so we -- and that's not all china. that's -- the resources are really not in china. a lot of the conversion capacity and the customer demand today is in china.
but it's -- and we spent a lot of effort making sure we have a diverse resource base from a resource standpoint and also from a conversion specific. so we're not too heavy in china. it's why you see us building in western australia, and we're doing conversion capacity in chile as well. so we focus on that diversification from a resource standpoint and from a conversion basis as well.
and in some cases, it's more expensive for us to do that, but we think it's important.
chris kapsch -- loop capital markets -- analyst
thanks for the insights. appreciate it.

and i'm not showing any further questions at this time. i would now like to turn the call back over to mr. kent masters for closing remarks.

ok. thank you, olivia. and again, thank you all for joining us today. all the efforts and opportunities we discussed today require execution, and we have the capabilities, the resources and most importantly, the people to execute on our strategy.
we expect to achieve accelerated growth with lower capital intensity, which should enable us to achieve higher returns. we will continue to work on our sustainability throughout the value chain, not only within albemarle's operations but by continuing to support our customers. thank you, and we look forward to speaking to you on our next call.

ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the first-quarter 2021 albemarle corporation earnings conference call. [operator instructions] please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [operator instructions] i would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker host, meredith bandy, vice president of investor relations and sustainability. please go ahead.
meredith bandy -- vice president of investor relations and sustainability
all right. thank you, olivia, and welcome to albemarle's first-quarter earnings conference call. our earnings were released after the close of the market yesterday, and you'll find our press release, presentation and non-gaap reconciliations posted to our website under the investors section at albemarle.com. joining me on the call today are kent masters, chief executive officer; scott tozier, chief financial officer.
raphael crawford, president, catalysts; netha johnson, president, bromine specialties; and eric norris, president, lithium, are also available for q&a. as a reminder, some of the statements made during this call, including our outlook, guidance, expected company performance and proposed divestitures and expansion projects may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws. please note the cautionary language about forward-looking statements contained in our press release and presentation. that same language applies to this call.
please also note that some of our comments today refer to financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with gaap. a reconciliation of these measures to gaap financial measures can be found in our earnings release and the appendix of our presentation, both of which are posted to our website. and with that, i'll turn the call over to kent. 
jerry masters -- chairman, president, and chief executive officer
ok. thanks, meredith. good morning, and thanks to you all for joining us today. on today's call, i will highlight our recent accomplishments and discuss our strategy as it relates to accelerating growth and creating a more sustainable business.
scott will give us more detail on our results, outlook and capital allocation. this was another strong quarter for albemarle with solid financial results. we generated net income of $96 million and adjusted ebitda of $230 million, up 17% from last year. we benefited in part from several lithium customers that accelerated orders under long-term agreements, as well as favorable volume and customer mix in our bromine business.
we continue to see strong market demand for lithium, especially from evs. first-quarter ev sales were up 135% versus last year, led by china. european and north american sales were also up significantly. all that said, remember that we are sold out in bromine and lithium.
therefore, we are maintaining our previously reported company guidance for the full year. scott will provide additional detail on this in just a few minutes. we are advancing our growth plans with the progress being made at our wave 2 lithium projects. these two projects, la negra 3 and and kemerton 1 and 2 are expected to add volume beginning next year.
as you are probably aware, during the first quarter, we successfully completed a $1.5 billion equity offering and then subsequently reduced our debt. this enabled us to achieve two strategic goals. first, we are now well positioned to execute on our high-return wave 3 growth projects for lithium and bromine. and second, we have maintained our investment-grade credit rating, which was recently upgraded to a bbb rating by s&p global.
i'm also proud to say that we have signed the u.n. global compact, joining the efforts of corporations and stakeholders worldwide to advance sustainability. on slide 5, i want to update you on those two projects at la negra and kemerton, our two ongoing projects to increase lithium production from our world-class resources. these conversion facilities are in the final stages of construction and when complete, are expected to double our nameplate capacity to 175,000 metric tons per year.
this added capacity will provide much needed volumes to support our customers' growth ambitions and will enhance our ability to drive further earnings expansion. construction is on track for completion later this year. we are watching the western australia labor situation closely, but currently, we do not expect any impact to our schedule. once complete, we move into final commissioning and customer qualification, which typically takes about six months.
we expect to begin producing commercial volume from both projects in 2022. these two sites will complete our wave 2 lithium projects and enable our team to focus on the execution of wave 3, which represents a further 150,000 metric tons of conversion capacity. we expect to make investment decisions on the first projects from wave 3 as early as the middle of this year. this includes a greenfield site in china and potentially the acquisition of a chinese conversion plant.
i would like to mention that the chilean nuclear energy commission, or cchen, has confirmed that our resource and reserves report is in full compliance following the additional data we provided in january. we are committed to complying with our regulatory obligations around the world, and we are pleased to reach a satisfactory and collaborative resolution with cchen. finally, in bromine, we are accelerating our growth projects and expect to see the benefit of these projects beginning in 2022. i'll now turn the call over to scott to review the first-quarter results.
scott tozier -- chief financial officer
thanks, kent. i'll begin on slide 6, and i'm happy to report on a strong start to the year. for the first quarter, we generated net sales of $829 million, a 12% increase from last year. this was driven by increased volumes across our three core businesses, as well as a favorable customer mix within our bromine unit.
gaap net income was $96 million. adjusted eps of $1.10 excludes the cost of early debt repayment that we incurred when we delevered in march following our equity raise. our sales growth enabled us to generate adjusted ebitda of $230 million, up 17% from last year, giving us an early start to meeting our guidance for the full year. now turning to slide 7 for a look at adjusted ebitda by business.
adjusted ebitda in total was up $34 million over last year, thanks to stronger lithium and bromine results and a foreign exchange tailwind. lithium's adjusted ebitda increased $30 million versus the prior year as some customers accelerated orders for battery-grade carbonate and hydroxide into the first quarter. to meet this demand, we drew down lower cost inventories resulting in q1 margin expansion. average realized pricing was down 10% as expected due to lower carbonate and technical-grade pricing.
however, increased volumes more than offset the lower price. market demand remains very strong, but our plants are sold out, which limits our ability to increase volumes in 2021. bromine's adjusted ebitda grew by about $8 million compared to the first quarter of 2020, an increase of 9%. the strong quarter was due primarily to higher sales volumes across the product portfolio.
pricing was also higher, in large part related to a favorable customer mix. the u.s. gulf coast winter storm reduced production and increased cost by about $6 million in the quarter. and just like lithium, we drew down inventory in q1 and our bromine plants are sold out for the year, making it difficult to offset the production losses from the storm.
we expect to see the impact from lost production in the q2 and q3 timeframe. catalysts' adjusted ebitda declined $23 million, primarily due to the u.s. gulf coast winter storm, which impacted production in bayport and pasadena, texas. these sites incurred increased electric and natural gas costs, production downtime and repair expenses that totaled $26 million.
our q1 catalyst results from last year included $12 million of income that was later corrected as an out-of-period adjustment, which further complicates the year-over-year comparison for this quarter. without this and the storm impact, our catalysts ebitda would have been up 31%. our corporate and other category adjusted ebitda increased by $4 million, primarily due to lower corporate costs. slide 8 highlights the company's financial strength.
with the proceeds from our $1.5 billion equity offering in february, we repaid debt. by deleveraging in the short term, instead of holding the proceeds as cash, we were able to reduce interest expense and create the debt capacity that will allow us to accelerate our growth for the lithium and bromine businesses, funding investments as they are approved. you can see how we are executing on our commitment to grow our dividend and maintain our investment-grade credit rating. we increased our dividend for the 27th consecutive year, which speaks to our ongoing success and a track record of shareholder returns, which we are proud to maintain.
on slide 9, we provide a look at our guidance for the year. i would like to note that our company guidance for the year includes a full year of fine chemistry services results. in february, we entered into an agreement to sell the fcs business for proceeds of approximately $570 million. the transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2021.
we've also given a breakout of second half guidance for fcs for modeling purposes. as we've discussed, our lithium and bromine businesses outperformed expectations for the quarter, primarily driven by accelerated customer orders and a favorable customer mix. we do not expect to see the same upside over the next 3 quarters, mostly because our lithium and bromine businesses are effectively sold out and we don't have excess inventory to meet increased demand. timing of orders can shift from quarter-to-quarter but the outlook for full year volumes is mostly unchanged, except for modest increases in lithium.
we continue to monitor the chip shortage at automotive manufacturers for impacts to lithium and bromine. and so, far, we've not seen an impact. this may be due to our position in the supply chain. in may, ihs revised their forecast for 2021 ev production, down 3% from prior forecasts related to microchip shortages and supply chain issues.
ev production is still though expected to be up 70% year over year. we are maintaining our company guidance for the full year and continue to expect net sales to be in the 3.2 to $3.3 billion range, which is slightly higher than last year. the demand we saw during the first quarter and sold out volumes speak to the importance of investing in our lithium and bromine businesses to add to our future earnings potential. our 2021 guidance for adjusted ebitda remains between $810 million and $860 million.
we continue to expect capex to be around 850 to $950 million for the year as we complete our wave 2 lithium projects and begin focusing our efforts on wave 3. net cash from operations are also tracking on plan. as the year progresses, we expect higher inventories as we start to commission the two new lithium plants, and higher cash taxes. expectations for adjusted diluted eps of $3.25 to $3.65 are on track, reflecting higher taxes, depreciation and increased share count and lower interest expense.
while our total company guidance has not changed, the outlook for our lithium and catalyst businesses has, as shown on slide 10. our outlook for the lithium business has improved due to higher lithium volumes driven by plant productivity improvements, and we have added some tolling of lithium carbonate. we expect lithium prices to improve sequentially through the remainder of the year due to tightening market conditions. overall, average realized pricing for the year will be flat compared to last year.
we continue to expect higher costs in 2021 related to project start-ups, but this will be partially offset by efficiency improvements. in total, lithium ebitda is now expected to be up high single digits on a percentage basis. the outlook for our catalyst business is lower than we had originally planned, offsetting the upside we expect from lithium. on a year-over-year basis, total catalyst results are projected to be down about 30% to 40%.
this is primarily due to the impact of the u.s. gulf coast winter storm and delays in customer fcc units. our outlook for the bromine business has not changed. while we had a very strong first quarter, we do not expect the favorable customer mix to continue in future quarters and we will not be able to make up the lost production in the first quarter.
in addition, raw material costs are moving higher. we continue to expect results to be modestly higher than last year due to continued economic recovery and improvements in certain end markets, including electronics and building and construction, along with ongoing cost savings and improved pricing. finally, as to our quarterly progression for the full company, we expect q2 to have modest growth in ebitda and the second half to have a modest decline. we continue to expect that 2022 results will benefit from accelerated growth plans in bromine, recovery in catalyst and the initial lithium sales from la negra 3 and 4, kemerton 1 and 2.
and with that, i'll hand it back to kent.
jerry masters -- chairman, president, and chief executive officer
thanks, scott. as i mentioned earlier, in april, we signed the u.n. global compact, a voluntary leadership platform for the development, implementation and disclosure of responsible business practices. in addition to supporting the ungc principles, we are aligning our sustainability framework to the u.n.
sustainable development goals, the largest corporate sustainability initiative in the world. over the past year, we've increased esg disclosure, published updated sustainability policies and made public commitments to advance sustainability. sustainability is, by its nature, a long-term commitment. but i'm pleased to report that we are beginning to see the benefits of our efforts.
for example, albemarle was recently recognized and added to the s&p 500 esg index. you can expect more details on these and other sustainability-related initiatives in our 2020 annual sustainability report due to be issued in june. now, on slide 12, i'd like to reiterate our corporate strategy. we have started 2021 with a strong quarter and continue to make progress on our four strategic pillars.
we are completing our wave 2 projects and plan for those to deliver commercial volumes and generate sales in 2022. we are making plans to execute on our wave 3 lithium projects, as well as expand our bromine resources to align with growing customer demand. and we are laser-focused on operational discipline to drive maximum productivity across our businesses. we continue to expect around $75 million of productivity improvements this year, and we will continuously work to improve efficiencies within our operations.
with a revitalized balance sheet, we are well positioned to invest in high-return growth maintain our investment-grade credit rating and support our dividend. finally, sustainability remains a top priority and key component of our value proposition to our customers, and we are dedicated to exploring opportunities such as the u.n. sustainable development goals to help us implement these efforts. with that, i'd like to open the call for questions, and we'll hand over to olivia.

thank you so much. [operator instructions] your first question comes from the line of p.j. juvekar with citi.
p.j. juvekar -- citi -- analyst
great. good morning, kent and scott. congrats on finishing la negra three and four. now that's done, are you looking for new hydroxide convergent capacity either in china or elsewhere? and would you consider building a convergent plant in the u.s.?
kent masters -- chief executive officer
so good morning, p.j., and thanks for that. we are -- so we're -- we've completed construction. we're still commissioning. so still a little bit to go at la negra.
and then as you see in the plans that have the phase three, it's mostly about hydroxide capacity in the near term. so kemerton will be coming on in the next year. and then the next wave of investments at the moment are focused on china, and we're -- we do look for acquisition of conversion capacity, but it's a bit of a challenge just to find the assets that we want and that are for sale. so you kind of have a meeting of mines there.
but we're also in parallel, we're progressing our plans to do greenfield projects as well. and if we were able to find an acquisition, we continue to progress the greenwood plans that we have. so they would be -- they're not -- if we did an acquisition, that doesn't mean we stop our greenfield plans and projects, but we would just do them in parallel. and then the last part -- i'm sorry, a lot about the u.s.
so i mean, we will look at the u.s., but it's not in the next year or so, right? so it's -- there's time. and our view is most of the cathode capacity that's being built and will be producing for the next several years, it's going to be in china or at least asia. and so we have time before we have to see if we need capacity in north america or europe.
p.j. juvekar -- citi -- analyst
ok. and then next question is, i want to go back to comments that you had made, kent, i think on the last call, about sort of market segmentation of customers that some customers will have a long-term contract, some will have more market-related contracts, especially customers like those who negotiated prices down in 2019. i was just wondering if either you or eric could add some color on this sort of market segmentation of customers?
kent masters -- chief executive officer
sure. so yes, i don't know if we can add much more than we talked about previously, but we're -- in the past, we had kind of a long-term contract formula and it was -- we were trying to use that strategy for all of our customers. and what we've learned is that not all customers want to buy that way. so we're trying to segment on how they want to buy.
and actually, we think it's good for us as well. so we're -- we have longer-term contracts that look more like a fixed price. and ideally, we want those contracts to move with the market but slightly with the market, but it looks more like a long-term contract. the other extreme, we'll have contracts that look more like spot.
they're probably it's not -- probably not a one-year contract, it's probably more than that, but it moves with the market or closely with the market. still may be dampened a bit and then you'll have some in the middle. where that shakes out from a portfolio standpoint until we settle all that with our customers. i can't tell you, but for lack of anything else, it's probably a third, a third, a third is kind of how we see it now.
p.j. juvekar -- citi -- analyst
thank you.
operator
your next question comes from the line of john roberts with ubs.
john roberts -- ubs -- analyst
thank you. on the delay at kemerton 2, if you're having delays, is the entire industry having significant delay here? i mean, we've got the car companies accelerating their demand plans here as the supply actually going to undershoot what the industry needs?
kent masters -- chief executive officer
well, i can't speak to the other projects. but i mean, if you're building in western australia, the availability of labor, the tightness is extreme. and western australia is kind of famous for labor market that gets difficult if you're doing large projects just because of the resource industry draws all of the resources if their prices go up and their prices have gone up significantly for say is probably the biggest example, and they're drawing all the resources away. that's always been an issue in western australia, but today, we have covid.
so they locked down not only australia but about state by state. so we can't move -- not only can we not get resources from china or thailand or even the u.k., we can't get resources from the east part of australia. so we're kind of stuck with what's in western australia. so -- and i think that will affect anyone doing a big capital project in western australia or australia.
i'm not sure that it applies, say, in china, for example.
john roberts -- ubs -- analyst
ok. and then when announced it sodium-ion battery, all the lithium stocks popped, including albemarle, is sodium ion is something that we need to pay more attention to?
eric norris -- president
john, it's eric. sorry, as you may know, isn't a new chemistry. the catls innovation is on a matrix that may make it more effective. it is a chemistry that is lower energy density, heavier material.
so it's applicable probably for the low -- very low end of ev ranges and maybe grid storage. i think one of the attractiveness components of it is -- its sodium is abundant. right? so it may alleviate at that low end of the market -- given alternative if lithium supplies become tight as they have been in the past year or so.
john roberts -- ubs -- analyst

your next question comes from the line of bob koort with goldman sachs.
bob koort -- goldman sachs -- analyst
thank you very much. good morning. kent, i was wondering you mentioned that la negra completed takes six months to commission. is that a function of just the qualifying process? and can you inventory production while you're doing that and then have a nice buffer of inventory to start selling from as soon as the qualification is complete? or is it a function of making sure the process works properly?
kent masters -- chief executive officer
it's both. so we're commissioning and qualifying in parallel. so we can kind of -- we do early commissioning to get qualification samples, but the plant has not been operating at rates so that it takes us time to get it to operating at rates. so we -- kind of long pole in the tent, so to speak, is the qualification process, but we're commissioning during that same time, and we run them in parallel so that we -- to save time.
so it's -- i think the answer is both.
bob koort -- goldman sachs -- analyst
ok. and on we've seen some pretty spectacular spot prices out there, some north of $1,000. when do you turn that on? and -- do you imagine that would ever feed the kemerton plants? or will you feed kemerton through talison for the foreseeable future?
kent masters -- chief executive officer
yes. so yes, we'll see how that goes. i mean our plans are to feed kemerton from talend. and then as we either bring on other capacity or do an acquisition, we would use wodgina for that.
and our strategy about selling spodumene hasn't changed.

unknown speaker
thank you. good morning, guys. a quick one on so you've talked about the closing issue you have in there. like when do you expect that to correct itself?
kent masters -- chief executive officer
so i'll start and netha can add a little bit. so -- and i think there's a broader issue in the chlorine space, but i mean our suppliers had some equipment failures, and we expect that to last -- they're telling us a month, right? so they've got a short-term fix. we hope we'll get us back up to some higher rates and then the permanent fix is going to take kind of -- i think they told us two to three months.
netha johnson -- president, bromine specialties
as we look at the broader chlorine market, we think there'll be opportunities to get it back in balance by q4 that we're hopeful for that.
unknown speaker
ok. makes sense. another one. like in terms of m&a, like -- you've done the fcs deal.
so you monetize that. like when you look at the rest of the portfolio, is there anything else in there that you think might be better with somebody else? no? can you talk about the portfolio, what you see in there?
kent masters -- chief executive officer
yes. so we -- i mean, we were looking at our pcs business and we ran a process and we didn't get the pricing we wanted for it. so it's performing well, and we've pulled back -- that is no longer for sale, and we're running as part of the portfolio. we're running as part of our catalyst business.
so we'll hold on to that. and then for the broader part of the portfolio, the three primary businesses, bromine, lithium, and catalyst. we see those as core businesses. so that's kind of our fundamental portfolio and now pcs is part of catalyst.
unknown speaker
ok. thank you very much.

your next question comes from the line of joel jackson with bmo capital markets.
joel jackson -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
hi. good morning, everyone. my first question, i'll follow up on spot. i mean, you as we've seen pretty interesting surges in prices in the last bunch of weeks.
i know there's lags on contracts and stuff. but i think if we also -- it seems like conversion margin, the proxy conversion margins have been extremely strong. so are those -- as carbon hydroxyprices have been really strong. so do you see the spa gene price increases more of a lagging indicator? or do you think that they're setting off to be another run-up in spot prices sparked lithium derivative prices?
kent masters -- chief executive officer
look. i'll make a broad comment and let eric can try a little bit of detail. it's hard for us to project where the market is going. and we see prices both spodumene and carbonate and hydroxide prices being up.
the only place you really have visibility of spot prices is in china for the carbonated hydroxide. and so you see that. you see the same numbers that we do. those have not fully translated into the contract prices, but we do see contract prices moving up.
and spodumene, i mean, it has gone up, come back down a little bit. i don't know that we're in what you would call a super cycle or headed toward that. but i think -- i do think prices will be higher than they have been in the last couple of years.
eric norris -- president
hey, joel. what i would -- this is -- and i think your question reflects this. this is a china market phenomenon. the china market is very dependent for its growth on imported spodumene.
what -- so -- and there is a shortfall of available supply to meet demand given the rapid growth post pandemic, particularly in carbonate in china. so in that regard, maybe spodumene is a bit of a lead because it's the short supply. but i think what we expect to happen is more supply to come into china from other parts of the world. we've seen prices go up and stay up with demand.
it's hard to say what's going to happen with spodumene prices. from an albemarle perspective, the way we take advantage of that is we don't sell spodumene or that's right, we don't sell chemical-grade spodumene to say we sell a specialty spodumene for the glass market. but for us, it's tolling. so you've heard us talk about looking at tolling opportunities, and that's part of our improved guidance.
and for that, we're able to participate in that spot price market, which is, as i've said earlier, very favorable.
joel jackson -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
so my follow-up would be just looking out to 2022 for lce volume increases, i think you talked about maybe gaining about 30,000 tonnes lce volume for next year with the different expansion ramping on. kemerton 2 has delayed a few months maybe you've been pushing it a little more tolling now this year. is it about 30,000 tonnes still the right number for next year?
eric norris -- president
so, joel, i mean, i think it's -- you have to break it down. first of all, i don't think we've said 30,000 tonnes. we've talked about ramp rates on plants. so the kemerton plant with a start-up in the early part of next year, there is a three-month delay to the second unit.
we've talked about getting to full run-rate capacity by the end of the second year in that facility. similarly, in carbonate, you'd see a phenomenon that is somewhat like that. i would say our run rate for carbonate by the end of '22 will probably be at the 30,000 run-rate basis at the end of the year, that ramps. it's a little bit different, ramping brine versus spodumene because brian is obviously a harvested material versus a fixed input.
but that roughly should -- between those two should be able to calculate sort of our guidance. the change would be a slight delay at kemerton. and then a year-on-year growth that we can achieve in tolling. and that's going to be it's harder for us to predict now because it's a function of what's available in the market for us to toll with.
kent masters -- chief executive officer
yes. it's also a function of how fast we ramp up, right, so how well commissioning goes. and then there's -- when you'll commission, you'll be able to make products, but at lower rates, and that will ramp up over time, and it's how well we do in that ramp curve. and it's hard to speculate on that.
joel jackson -- bmo capital markets -- analyst

your next question comes from the line of arun viswanathan with rbc capital markets.
arun viswanathan -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
great. thanks for taking my question. i guess i just wanted to get your thoughts. we've had some differing views, i guess, maybe you could just provide your color on spodumene, carbonate, and hydrox.
spodumene, obviously, there was some oversupply in years past, but it seems like most of that is slowly working itself out. maybe you can just characterize supply and demand in each of those areas? thank you.
kent masters -- chief executive officer
ok. and again, i'll start. eric can fill in where i miss things. but i think in the past, the industry is growing.
right? so as the industry grows, you bring on capacity, it's a smaller percentage of the industry. so i don't think we're going to have those periods of oversupply, undersupply is tight, as they were in the past with the extremes showing up in pricing. so i think that applies across for hard rock as well as kind of the salt conversion capacity for the salt. so i think as the industry gets bigger, each addition is a smaller percentage of the total industry, it has less of an impact.
that said, where we are, i mean, spodumene is tight. and i think that the conversion capacity as the growth rates that we see, which you kind of see in as an indicator, ev sales is the forward-looking growth curve for lithium. those are pretty tight and you've got to make investments, and you've got to be good at executing those projects and commissioning them and then ramping them up to full capacity, which is we think we're good at that, but we're in the process of proving it.
eric norris -- president
and i would just add, arun, that today, as we sit here today, all three are extremely tight. if we had more carbonate that we could produce and sell, we could sell it readily, same with hydroxide. we don't have the disadvantage. we have the ability.
we have idle capacity on the spodumene side. so we are not feedstock limited. that's a strength we have going forward. what we're limited on is our ability to get conversion capacity in the ground quickly.
and that's part of our plan for next year. as to the long term, my guess would be that our view would be, i should say, that hydroxide will probably see the higher rate of growth going forward off a smaller base. carbonate has done well in the near term based upon the lfp trend for lower-end vehicles, particularly in china, and we see that starting to take root in some other regions as well for the low end. but the key to high ev penetration is higher energy density.
and the key to that is hydroxide and ultimately, potentially solid-state chemistries. so that's going to require a heavier burden on hydroxide. we see that being the tighter market on a long-term basis going forward.
arun viswanathan -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
great. and just wondering if there's any concern from elevated logistics costs for the next little while, also, maybe you can just address if there's any concerns on the container shortage issue?
kent masters -- chief executive officer
well, i think across all of our businesses, the supply chain is a challenge and a concern. so oceangoing freight probably the biggest, but well, chemicals supply in the u.s. is hitting us and particularly chlorine at the moment, but it's tight in a number of chemicals, but oceangoing freight is a big concern for us and something that we are working pretty hard to try to manage. we spent a lot of time trying to streamline that supply chain digitizes, so we have much better visibility on it.
so we're making progress on that, but it's still a concern.
arun viswanathan -- rbc capital markets -- analyst

vincent andrews -- morgan stanley -- analyst
thank you, and good morning. if i could just ask in bromine, it doesn't sound like in either your sort of electronic sales or your auto sales that you're seeing any real volume issues from the shortage of microchip. so is that just something that it's either being offset by other parts of the business or it's just not an issue either year to date or into the back half of the year?
kent masters -- chief executive officer
yes. vincent, from where we sit in the supply chain, we're not seeing that at all and from a demand side, our demand in those areas have been steady.
vincent andrews -- morgan stanley -- analyst
ok. great. and if i could just ask, you have the analyst day coming up and you're also concurrently working on the wave three projects and looking to move forward with us. i mean, should we be expecting a material update on those at the analyst day? or are those two events unique?
kent masters -- chief executive officer
so a material update. i'd say it depends on the definition. so we'll give you progress on where we are, but we're not -- but we're still in the planning phase. we're not moving dirt on any of the projects yet.

your next question comes from the line of david begleiter with deutsche bank.
david begleiter -- deutsche bankanalyst
thank you. good morning. eric, a couple of questions for you. just on lithium pricing in q3.
is your guidance for that pricing to be up year over year in q3?
eric norris -- president
yes. the second half, we were down 10% to recount a little history here to put it in perspective. we're down 10% across the board in the first quarter, 4% in the second quarter, and we're saying flat for the year. so it will be up year over year.
another way to think of that is our lowest price point over the past 24 months or including the rest of this year, so over 2020 and 2021, we expect to be the fourth quarter of last year. and ever since then, we sort of bottomed and we're seeing as spot prices move up for that small amount of our business is exposed to that, such as battery grade in china or tech grade. and as concessions to contracts given during the height of the pandemic roll off, we see those prices rising in -- into the second half of this year. and given the tightness in the market, we expect into next year as well.
david begleiter -- deutsche bankanalyst
very good. and also, there's been some progress on dle project near your operations in southern arkansas. can you discuss the viability of a dle project for you guys in southern arkansas going forward?
kent masters -- chief executive officer
well, yes, so i'll say that for us, we continue to look at magnolia brines, where we operate our bromine operation as being a spot where we could process lithium and dle's a potential technology for that. dle, just -- it's a bandied-about term, most often here in the u.s. with many of the projects, what they're talking about is absorption resins. and so it's a mechanical operation for extracting it's a mechanical operation as opposed to an evaporation effort such as we do in chile, that you would only apply you have to apply, meaning if you apply it to resource that are of lower quality or have higher impurities present, which is generally true with both oilfield brines, which is what we have in magnolia, or geothermal brines.
so it's more intensive. it actually also consumes a lot more water and energy given the -- so it has some drawbacks from it. we're studying what alternatives we could deploy to a resource like that, that could include absorption that optimize those factors of cost and sustainability. given where we are with our high-quality resources and then what we can do in the year to drive our growth in the next 5 years, we put that as a resource later in the decade that we would consider for that given those technical challenges and given its cost profile.
eric norris -- president
yes. and i would just add, so we've -- we didn't -- that wasn't included in our phase three but it's something that we look at. we're looking at the technology. we have access to the brines and we have the operation.
we're already kind of pumping the brines around. so we'd be in a good position to leverage it if we think that get the technology right, and we believe the cost position is right. but it's something that comes probably in phase four if we get that technology right.
david begleiter -- deutsche bankanalyst
very helpful. thank you.

your next question comes from the line of jeff zekauskas with j.p. morgan.
jeff zekauskas -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
thanks very much. in your talison operation in equity income in lithium, sometimes you earn $30 million and sometimes you earn $15 million or $16 million. what's the difference between the two? and we've had some 15s and 16s. are there any 30s to come?
scott tozier -- chief financial officer
jeff, it's scott. so the equity income in talison is affected by two things. one is the volume that's being shipped both to ourselves as well as to tianqi, our partner. and of course, that has been either flat or rising over time.
the bigger impact that you're seeing through the equity income is coming from the transfer price, which is affected by that -- by the spodumene market price that's out there. so when that price is high, you're going to see a higher equity income. when it's lower, you'll see a lower equity income. and generally, that's going to track on about a six-month lag to the market indicators that are out there.
so as we've talked about in some of the prior questions, because the spodumene price is higher or going higher right now, you should expect in the second half that, that equity income would also track to that.
kent masters -- chief executive officer
you should just keep in mind, though, that then our input cost for conversion goes up when that price goes up. so we don't really -- it doesn't matter so much to us because it's all -- it washes through. but it's the difference between equity income and what shows up in the lithium p&l.
jeff zekauskas -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
then for my follow-up, i think over the past several years, if you had to describe the contractual terms of your long-term lithium contracts. i think you would have said that they were above market. given the changes in the lithium market and its tightness or snugness, is it now the case that your long-term contracts are more comparable to current prices?
kent masters -- chief executive officer
it depends on what you call -- yes, i think it depends on what you're calling current prices. so if you're talking about spot prices in china, which is what everyone can see, that's probably correct. but i think if you were to think about contract prices over time -- contract prices outside of china that different suppliers have, it's probably in line or above those, i would say probably still above those.
jeff zekauskas -- j.p. morgan -- analyst

your next question comes from the line of ben kallo with baird.
ben kallo -- robert w. baird & co. -- analyst
hey. thanks. good morning, guys. thanks for taking my questions.
just maybe two on the -- and then one on bromine. lithium, you get this question a lot, but just on recycling, we saw redwood materials raised a large some of money. i want to understand how you see the players in the recycling as they either work with you or competitors you, is number one. number two, on the tesla call, and then -- and i think before that, moscowas talking about the lfp and the increase there.
and i just wanted to understand, i think you talked a little bit about this, but how you make investments into carbonate versus hydroxide with that background, looking like there's a large increase in demand for lfp? and then on bromine, just how comfortable you are around the timing of the expansion? i think it's really chemical expanded already earlier. so i just want to see how strong do you think that market is for bringing on new capacity?
eric norris -- president
ben, this is eric. on recycling, recycling is happening around the world. and so the companies you're referring to are largely here in the u.s. there's a set of companies similarly in europe.
-- a regional business model because of the collection and nature of different regulations around the world. as a global player, we're engaged with all of these companies. we view them in almost every case as a partner, not a competitor. and we bring process technology and know-how that -- what we deploy in some of our existing virginia operations that could be a partnership approach to helping to remove the lithium and/or take a byproduct that comes out of their operations, which is lithium rich.
so that's the way we work with them. you have to remember, a lot of these companies got set up, and this is -- and then europe is ahead on this, largely to go after the nickel and the cobalt not lithium. lithium is usually the byproduct of the recycling operation, that's where we fit in. and so as we look at trying to partner with our customers and drive their success from a sustainability standpoint, we view this as an important part of the value mix we bring is helping them recycle the lithium and recycle it back to them for their continued growth.
on the tesla side, we view what tesla has described as very -- generally very consistent with our market outlook. it's going to continue to shift, and i think, expand, meaning the size of the ev market, which by 2025 might be at one level, but by 2030, i think you're going to have a larger proportion of vehicles that are electrified. -- some news out about some intentions around that here in the u.s. today.
and for the lower end, lfp is the applicable technology. i mean it gives you a lower range. we still believe, though, that for the mid and the higher-range vehicles, you're going to need -- in order to get -- you need higher energy density to get the range. and you can drive good cost if you can get good technology and then get the cost per kilowatt hour down, you don't get the kilowatt hours up per unit weight.
so that's the mix we see. and it's very consistent with the way tesla is approaching the market as well. turn it over to netha for bromine.
netha johnson -- president, bromine specialties
hello, ben. if you talk about the timing of our bromine expansions, i think we feel really good about the markets that we participate in and their projections over the next few years. and we're really just executing the company's strategy-building capabilities to accelerate lower capital intensity, higher return growth. and for us, what we're doing it at is magnolia.
and that's a great place for us to do it because we have great jurisdiction. we've been there for over 50 years. we know the asset well and we can produce every product that we make out of that facility. so that leads us to have high confidence in those projects, and the timing of execution.
and we feel really good about the plan there and our ability to deliver what we want out of those expansion projects.

your next question comes from the line of matthew deyoe with bank of america.
matthew deyoe -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
thank you. so as you ramp talison to meet kemerton demand, what do you expect your partner to do? i know they have their own kind of hydroxide plans. those have been pushed a bit. do you expect talison output to increase by the 50,000 metric tons you're going to need? or will it be closer to 100,000 metric tons? and just how do you see that time line playing out, can you move as fast as you think you'll need if it's a joint discussion versus your singular desires, i guess?
kent masters -- chief executive officer
yes. well, it's definitely a joint discussion. it's a jv. and i think we'll optimize the supply the product at talison our portion or half of that with that's ours.
but we have jv product at wodgina. they have their own product and other parts of australia, and we'll swap product to kind of optimize economics. i think the way you would think about it as talison goes to feed our portion and some other product feeds their portion at kemerton. however, physically, it probably won't work that way.
we'll swap product to optimize the economics.
matthew deyoe -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
i guess i meant more what you expect tianqi to do versus in that portion, i apologize.
eric norris -- president
this is eric jumping in. we can't predict what tiangi is going to do. i mean they have some public statements out there around their kwinana facility, which is really very -- in terms of its potential over time, similar in size to kemerton, at least our first investment in kemerton. and the jv is owned by the two of us.
so it produces a budget to what we need. so you really need to talk about what's on the ground there cgp1 and cgp2. we feel with cgp2 being fully ramped, we'll meet the needs of what we have invested in and allow us to ramp at kemerton. and if they don't have the need on their side, they won't take their share, right, is how it comes down to it.
so that's how it works. we're always entitled to at least 50%. it could be of what's available. it could be more if they don't need to take more and vice versa on the other side.
matthew deyoe -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
ok. and if i could just follow up. so the new pricing approach you talked about, i understand it's still in the works. but theoretically, i guess, if you were to look over the last cycle, maybe peaks in 2018 and trough more in 2020.
can you provide some context as to like how much your realized price would have been higher in 2018 had you chosen this path versus how much lower you would have been in 2020? like how much higher are the peaks and how much lower were the trough? i would imagine some sort of analysis has been done to kind of get a sense for if this was a net winner or a loser over time?
kent masters -- chief executive officer
yes. so we've not done analysis that we can share about what our price would have been under the new model. but you're right, it would have been higher toward the peak and lower during -- so which is the point we're trying to move a little bit more with the market but not expose ourselves fully to the commodity price. but i don't have the numbers to share with you to exactly what it would be.
and the other part of that question, which we don't really know the answer to is how the portfolio, what does it look like? how much of that bot type pricing will we end up with versus that long-term contract pricing. because during the last peak and bottom pretty much were all on the long-term contracts.
eric norris -- president
i think it's also important that in the last peak and bob, there were no automotive producers involved at all in the cycle. there are now and there's a lot more demand now. and i'll reference mark kent made earlier that given the size and maturity of -- we've only gone through one cycle before, really, since the dawn of the ev, and now we're moving through the next part of the cycle. it's going a little different.
it probably won't have the same volatility it did before. we don't know. but i think the size of growth is such that -- and supply additions is such that it's going to change with time. so the pricing structure we're putting in place is going to continue to evolve.
we have contracts that fit the structure. so we know it works. we have customers paying fixed prices. we have customers who are only -- we're only going to give them a year commitment and they'll take -- they'll want to ride the wave.
and at that point, that wave is going up. so it's -- how it settles out over time, we'll have to continue to dimension for you, but we're at the early stages.

hey. good morning. nice quarter. just curious what your thoughts on the lithium demand whether percent or tons in '22 is expected to be for the industry?
kent masters -- chief executive officer
yes. it's a question, mike, that i may have to go back and look at our demand model because we do have a model we put out -- and it's still consistent with what we think today. and it was some months ago earlier this year, we did that. we're seeing a much bigger demand year in '21 overall this year than last because of the post-pandemic recovery.
the overall market growth is 25% plus. so we're going to be at least in that order of magnitude for 2022, i'd say, on a year-on-year basis.
mike sison -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
got it. and then i know there's some timing in terms of getting the volume on for wave two, but when do you think roughly you'll have all the capacity available to sell? is it '23, '24, '25? just curious on the -- when you'll be able to sell it all.

your next question comes from the line of chris kapsch with loop capital markets.
chris kapsch -- loop capital markets -- analyst
yes. good morning. just a slightly more nuanced follow-up on this discussion around the increased volumes implied in your guidance. and -- so i surmise, most of that is coming from more volumes from via green bushes and that spodumene being converted downstream via tollers.
first, is that an accurate characterization? and then with that in mind, eric, i'm pretty sure you've stated in the past that you don't rely on toll conversion for battery-grade chemicals, but only for technical grade lithium products. but in this case, it seems like the extra volumes are carbonate feeding into the lfp cathode market. so just wondering if that also is accurate? and if that's the case, should we be thinking of these carbonate grades via tollers as just -- or maybe just the lfp market being more of a technical grade market? and then finally, just -- it seems like this is part of the market you'll address once la negra is ramped next year. but will then -- you then say the current toll relationships that you're leaning into currently to opportunistically address these volumes?
eric norris -- president
there are a bunch of questions there, chris. let me go to the first one, which had to do with -- help me here, i'm just stuck on the lfp, but you had something before that. what was that? what was your first question, chris?
chris kapsch -- loop capital markets -- analyst
yes. so the tolling volumes, we've --
eric norris -- president
our volume, yes. yes. sorry. senior moment there, i guess.
if you look at our produced volumes, we're going to be fairly flat first half to second half. maybe slightly better in the second half because we have a little bit better production. we have some better production in chile in the fourth quarter seasonally, just by a tad. what the real difference in our volume first to second half and our volume growth year over year is -- first half, second half is the tolling -- increased tolling.
year-over-year is tolling because we didn't not last year, as well as plants come back online and efficiencies in the plants, better operation in the plants year-over-year. so there's a bit of difference between first half, second half and year over year there. on what we're using that carbonate for when we told it in china, it's going into the lfp market. i think what we've -- i don't know what we said a year ago, but what we said more recently is that the carbonate market, the tolling network is able to produce sufficient battery grid quality to supply the lfp market for batteries in china.
so that's where we are selling that material currently. and then i'm going to ask your help again. the last question was --
chris kapsch -- loop capital markets -- analyst
yes. so since you're addressing that via the tolling relationships currently when you ramp la negra next year, will you fade those relationships? or do you still intend to participate via tolling? obviously, this has mix implications given the higher feedstock costs and the fact that tollers need to make a margin. so curious if you'll fade those tolling relationships? or maybe would there be a bar hub like you've done in the past with tolling partners that you're comfortable with?
eric norris -- president
it will be a bit of both. i mean our strategy for a lot of what we produce out of la negra's growth, la negra three and four, is to put it under a contract commitment in some form. that might be for price by only a year and for performance might be a couple of years. but that's our strategy for that volume.
our strategy for the toll volume is either to use it as a bridge to build a customer relationships when we have a megatrend some of those customers we're currently selling total volumes for, we will take advantage of selling la negra three, four to as well. but in today's market, which is particularly tight is also opportunistic to play in what is a pretty tight market. and there, we're really playing on a spot basis. so while we have higher cost to produce this total volume, we're taking advantage of currently higher spot prices than contract.
chris kapsch -- loop capital markets -- analyst
that's helpful. thanks a lot.
operator
ok. and our final question comes from the line of kevin mccarthy with vertical research.
kevin mccarthy -- vertical research partners -- analyst
good morning. thank you for squeezing me in. i wanted to ask about your catalyst business. if we look at margins in the first half of the year in broad strokes, they're running maybe half of historical levels yet.
in the prepared remarks, i think you indicated you anticipate a strong rebound in the business. so -- just wondering if you could flesh that out in terms of what you're seeing in your refinery catalyst order books? and when might we expect those margins to get back to historical levels, might that be as soon as '22 or more likely '23 or later?
raphael crawford -- president, catalyst
hey. good morning, kevin. this is raphael. just to respond, one -- there's been a series of effects.
i mean in the first half of the year, we certainly had an impact from the winter storm. we have residual impact from the pandemic. a lot of that pandemic impact was a down trade of high-performance catalysts to maybe more workhorse catalysts, that has an effect on margins and as well as on our mix. looking forward, i think we would see recovery.
i mean some of our best products, what we're known for, for example, is our high-performance hydroprocessing catalysts. as the market is recovering as change out start to a faster clip in 2022, we're going to start to see that come back. again, we have great partnerships for great performance catalyst. those are the higher margin that will improve our mix.
and i think it's that mix impact going into 2022, you'll start to see that improvement in our margins. we already see it today, kevin. we have customers that are -- they down traded to lower performance catalysts when they were under margin pressure. we just had a customer meeting this week with a large north american refiner who was telling us that because they're starting to operate at higher rates, they're needing to run under more severe conditions, they need higher-performance catalysts.
those command higher margins for us. so we think it's a favorable trend. it will probably start to materialize in 2022 where you'll start to see them.
kevin mccarthy -- vertical research partners -- analyst
and then secondly, if i may, for eric, in a prior answer, i think you alluded to the news out today that the u.s. is now targeting 40% to 50% of new auto sales as evs by 2030, although i thought i read that it might be non-mandatory. so just curious about your view on that? is it incrementally accretive to your demand outlook in any way? or are the u.s. automakers already tracking the similar levels? or what do you think about the potential market impact of that announcement?
kent masters -- chief executive officer
yes. so this is kent. it's early news. it's just out today.
and i don't -- from my understanding was it's not mandatory. it's kind of something that is trying to lead legislation to something maybe like that. it's -- so i'd say it's early days. and i'm not -- and it's probably in the ballpark of what the car companies are already thinking.
maybe it's a little more aggressive, but it doesn't shift late from our perspective. i don't think -- i think our view would be that's neutral.
kevin mccarthy -- vertical research partners -- analyst
thank you very much.
operator
and now we will -- i would like to turn the call over to kent masters for closing remarks.
kent masters -- chief executive officer
thank you, carol, and thank you all again for your participation on our call today. as you can see, we have a lot to be excited about at albemarle, and we see extraordinary opportunities for growth. we are implementing a comprehensive operating model that will enable us to execute on our objectives effectively and efficiently. we look forward to discussing this in greater detail during our investor day on september 10th, and we hope you will all be able to join us then.
thank you, and that concludes our call today.

operator
good morning, and welcome to the q2 2021 albemarle corporation earnings conference call. [operator instructions] as a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. i will now like to turn the conference over to your host, meredith bandy, vice president of sustainability and investor relations. please go ahead.
meredith bandy -- vice president of sustainability and investor relations
thanks, operator, and welcome, everyone, to albemarle's second-quarter 2021 earnings conference call. our earnings were released after the close of market yesterday, and you will find the press release, earnings presentation, and non-gaap reconciliations on our website under the investor relations section at www.albemarle.com. joining me on the call today are kent masters, chief executive officer; and scott tozier, chief financial officer. raphael crawford, president, catalyst; netha johnson, president, bromine specialties; and eric norris, president, lithium, are also available for q&a.
reminder, some of the statements made during this call, including outlook, guidance, expected company performance and timing of expansion projects may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws. please note the cautionary language about forward-looking statements contained in our press release and earnings presentation, that same language applies to this call. also note that some of our comments today refer to non-gaap financial measures. a reconciliation to gaap financial measures can be found in our earnings release and appendix of the presentation, both are posted on the website.
and finally, as a reminder, albemarle will be hosting our 2021 investor day the morning of friday, september 10, webcast live from our charlotte offices. registration webcast is also available on the investor relations section of our website. and now i'll turn the call over to kent. 
kent masters -- chief executive officer
good morning, and thank you all for joining us today. on today's call, i'll highlight quarterly results and our recent strategic achievements. i'll also introduce the new operating model we are implementing to support albemarle's growth strategy. scott will give you more detail on our results, outlook, and guidance.
our businesses continue to execute well as global markets improve. second-quarter net sales were $774 million and adjusted ebitda was $195 million, both of which marked a slight improvement compared to the second quarter of last year. note that we closed the divestiture of fcs on june 1. so second-quarter 2021 included only two months of fcs results.
excluding fcs, net sales increased 5% and adjusted ebitda was up 13% compared to last year. and our financial release issued yesterday after the close, we revised our guidance for the year, in part to reflect higher lithium performance, but also supply chain disruptions for our bromine business. we've also updated full-year guidance to reflect the sale of fcs. scott will walk you through those changes in more detail in just a few minutes.
we continue to execute on our next wave of growth projects to capitalize on attractive long-term fundamentals in the markets we serve. we recently completed the construction of la negra three and four as planned, and we are progressing through the commissioning stage. finally, i want to briefly describe the operating model we are launching to drive greater value, improve performance and deliver exceptional customer service. and you see that on slide 5.
our operating model, which we call the albemarle way of excellence, or awe, serves as a framework for how we execute, deliver, and ultimately accelerate our strategy. awe is based on four pillars: sustainable approach includes responsibly managing our natural resourcing and engaging with our stakeholders; high-performance culture includes focusing on safety leadership and fostering an agile, engaged corporate culture; competitive capabilities means we are ensuring we have the right talent, resources, and technologies; and finally, operational discipline is about embracing lean principles and operational excellence across the organization. the operating model helps us connect our strategy with day-to-day initiatives, prioritize projects, clarify resource allocation, ensure accountability and drive efficient and profitable execution. we will discuss the operating model in more detail at our upcoming investor day on september 10.
now turning to slide 6. we've completed the construction of la negra three and four in chile and are in the commissioning stage. we expect commercial production from these two trains beginning in the first half of next year, ramping to 40,000 tons of lithium carbonate per year by 2024. this brownfield project allows us to increase existing capacity and leverage our world-class brine resource in chile, just one of the avenues of growth that we have as an established lithium producer with a global footprint.
we also continue to progress our kemerton conversion facility in western australia. to mitigate risk related to the tight labor market and covid-related travel restrictions in western australia, we have modified our execution strategy to prioritize kemerton 1 over kemerton 2. kemerton 1 remains on track for construction completion by the end of the year. we now anticipate completion of kemerton 2 by the end of the first quarter next year, a delay of about three months.
these delays and higher labor rates have also increased capital cost. it's been a difficult situation in a labor market that was already tight, but we have been able to maintain the schedule for kemerton 1 with only a three-month delay for kemerton 2. we continue to expect commercial production for both kemerton 1 and 2 during 2022. importantly, we are making progress on our wave three lithium projects, and we'll provide further details at investor day in september.
site selection is underway, and we are negotiating with the authorities to include investment agreements. we're also expediting investments in bromine to meet increasing demand. we completed the first well at magnolia ahead of schedule and under budget. unfortunately, we're unable to take advantage of that additional capacity in the second half due to shortages of chlorine in the supply chain.
we also have two projects in arkansas that are currently in the select phase. these projects are designed to increase production capacity of clear brine fluids and hydrobromic acid. a third project to increase the capacity of our brominated flame retardants is in the evaluate stage. i'll hand the call over to scott, who will provide an overview of our financial results for the quarter.
scott tozier -- chief financial officer
thanks, kent, and good morning, everyone. i'll begin on slide 7. we generated net sales of $774 million during the second quarter, which is a slight increase from the same period last year, driven by stronger sales from our lithium and bromine segments. higher sales, as well as strong operating margins, resulted in an adjusted ebitda of $195 million, which was 5% higher year over year.
gaap net income of $425 million includes an after-tax gain of $332 million related to the divestiture of our fcs business to w.r. grace. adjusted eps, which excludes the gain on fcs, was $0.89 for the quarter, up 4% from the prior year. let's turn to slide 8 for a look at adjusted ebitda by business.
excluding fcs, second-quarter adjusted ebitda increased by 13% or $22 million compared to the prior year. higher adjusted ebitda for lithium and bromine was partially offset by higher corporate costs related to incentive compensation and foreign exchange movements. lithium's adjusted ebitda increased by $19 million, excluding fx compared to last year, primarily driven by higher volumes, customers under long-term agreements continue to pull orders forward and we shipped higher spodumene volumes from our talison joint venture. adjusted ebitda for bromine increased by $16 million due to higher volumes and pricing.
end market demand continues to very strong following the winter storms experienced in q1 with very limited excess capacity or inventory to meet that additional demand. catalyst adjusted ebitda declined just $1 million from the previous year. cft volumes were down due to shipment timing, sec continued to be impacted by a change in the order patterns from a large north american customer, although the fcc demand trend was generally higher. this was partially offset by excellent ts results which benefited from a favorable customer mix.
slide 9 highlights the company's financial strength. since the beginning of the year, we have taken significant steps to strengthen our balance sheet. the strategic decision to divest our fcs business added cash proceeds to the balance sheet and reduced our leverage ratio to 1.5 times. that transaction further demonstrates our ability to drive value by prudently managing our asset portfolio.
our strong balance sheet and investment-grade credit rating gives us the financial flexibility we need to accelerate profitable growth and continue to provide a growing dividend. turning to slide 10. i'll walk you through the updates to our guidance that kent mentioned earlier. and there are several key changes from our previous guidance.
first, higher net sales guidance reflects higher lithium sales volumes and improving catalyst trends, offset by a lower bromine outlook. adjusted ebitda guidance is the same reflecting higher net sales, offset by higher corporate costs and foreign exchange expense. guidance on adjusted diluted eps and net cash from operations is improving from an expected reduction in interest expense and tax rates. the timing of working capital changes is also expected to benefit net cash from operations.
and finally, we see capital expenditures trending toward the high end of our previous $850 million to $950 million range based on the tight labor markets in western australia, as kent discussed. in the far right column, pro forma revised guidance ranges are adjusted for the sale of our fcs business on june 1 this year, removing the guidance on fcs for the rest of the year. i'm turning to slide 11 for more detail on the gbus outlook. adjusted ebitda for lithium is expected to increase by 10% to 15% over last year, an improvement from our previous outlook.
lithium volume growth is expected to be in the mid-teens on a percentage basis, mostly due to higher tolling volumes as well as the restart of north american plants at the beginning of the year and improvements in plant productivity. our pricing outlook is unchanged. we continue to expect average realized pricing to increase sequentially over the second half of the year, but to remain roughly flat compared to full-year 2020. we also continue to expect margins to remain below 35%, owing to higher costs related to project start-ups and incremental tolling costs.
margins should improve as the plants ramp up commercial sales volumes. our outlook for catalyst hasn't changed since the first-quarter report with adjusted ebitda anticipated to be lower by 30% to 40%. however, we are more optimistic as fuel markets continue to improve globally. lower year-over-year results are primarily related to the impact of the u.s.
gulf coast, winter storm in the first quarter, and the ongoing impact from the change in customer order patterns in north america. finally, for bromine, we now expect mid-single-digit year-over-year growth in adjusted ebitda, which is down from our previous outlook due to a force majeure declaration from our chlorine supplier in the u.s. like many industrial companies, we are -- increased costs and supply disruptions for raw materials, but it is partially offset by price and productivity improvements. results are expected to be lower in the second half as production is constrained due to the chlorine shortage.
we are accelerating our expansion plans in bromine. however, we have been unable to take advantage of this new capacity yet due to the chlorine disruption. looking ahead to 2022, we expect sales and ebitda increases for all three businesses. lithium results are expected to improve on the higher volumes as the new plants ramp up.
bromine results are expected to rebound from short-term supply chain disruptions and the winter storm impacts, and catalyst results are expected to rebound strongly from 2021 levels, assuming continued improvements in global transportation fuel demand. and with that, i'll hand it back to kent.
kent masters -- chief executive officer
ok. thanks, scott. on slide 12, we continue to execute on our strategic objectives for 2021. first, we are growing profitably.
construction is complete at la negra, and we are commissioning this project with commercial volumes expected in the first half of next year. both kemerton trains are expected to contribute volumes in 2022 as well, despite the restructuring of our execution plan at kemerton. as previously discussed, we are making progress on our wave three lithium projects and expediting investments in bromine to meet increasing demand. second, we are increasing productivity.
we are on track to achieve at least our targeted $75 million in productivity improvements this year. we expect to continue to build on these improvements as we implement our operating model and build a culture of continuous improvement. third, we are maintaining our disciplined approach to investments and continue to optimize shareholder value by actively managing our portfolio of assets, including the recently completed fcs divestiture. finally, all of our efforts are being driven with sustainability in mind.
and our annual sustainability report published at the beginning of june, we disclosed initial sustainability targets, including plans to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and fresh water use. we are also working closely with customers, investors, and esg rating companies to make sure they are up to speed on all these developments and have a full appreciation for our efforts. so with that, i'd like to open the call for questions.
meredith bandy -- vice president of sustainability and investor relations
operator, we're ready for questions now.
",2021-Q2,ALB
0.6367499999999999,1.0,,,":
operator
thank you sir. [operator instructions] your first question comes from the line of john roberts with ubs.
matt skowronski -- ubs -- analyst
this is matt skowronski on for john. in the past, you mentioned that kemerton may be able to ramp to 40% to 50% of capacity in a year following its commissioning and qualification process. is this still the case for that first line that's supposed to be done with construction at the end of this year? or is it going to take some additional time due to the constraints going on right now?
kent masters -- chief executive officer
so i think we've got to get through mechanical completion, then we've got the commissioning and qualification. so then i think what we said is after that, and that's about a six-month process. then after that, we think we would be able to ramp to maybe 50% in the first 12 months. that's probably a little aggressive, but that's what we're targeting.
and then i think the labor and all those issues are primarily around construction. we've got operators staffed and onboard and they're helping with commissioning. so i mean the labor market is going to be tied, and we may fight to keep the ones we want. i'm not sure, but the real labor issue is around construction.
matt skowronski -- ubs -- analyst
and then, scott, you mentioned the huntsman arbitration issue could impact your ability to opportunistically take hold of growth opportunities. is that organic or just inorganic opportunities?
scott tozier -- chief financial officer
yes, i think it's really more -- it's really two. i think partly on the organic side, it's our ability to accelerate or further accelerate our projects. we'll be able to do some of it, but clearly, it's a big drag. and then the second is any sort of larger type of inorganic would need some sort of more creative type of financing to do.
operator
your next question comes from the line of p.j. juvekar with citi.
p.j. juvekar -- citi -- analyst
yes. good morning. so now that you expect lithium prices to be flat to up for this year in sort of down, you must be expecting price gains in 4q that are well into double digits. can you comment on that? and then as you look forward into next year, what percent of your contracts will be renewed next year and do you have any early look into negotiations?
eric norris -- president, lithium
so p.j., good morning. it's eric here. i want to make sure i understand your first question. your first question was, would they be double digit in q4? is that what you said?
p.j. juvekar -- citi -- analyst
yes. i was wondering into double digits for q4 for your pricing?
eric norris -- president, lithium
the way to think about pricing and the flat to down comment is that it's progressive throughout the year. prices were at their lowest point late last year and early this year and have been gradually rising as we've gone through the year due to two factors. one is the exploration and a concession we gave against a fixed-priced long-term agreement. and the second would be just the movement of spot prices for that portion of our business is exposed to those markets, which i'm sure you're aware, no, those prices have gone up significantly and throughout the course of the year.
so as the guidance we've given that scott gave at investor day for next year was at least 15% to 20% year-on-year increase for 2022 versus 2021. and certainly, that's a progressive sort of trend. so you could certainly see those kinds of increases starting to happen in q4 versus a year ago.
p.j. juvekar -- citi -- analyst
ok. great. and then on marbl, you're restarting one of the three lines. rock prices have skyrocketed.
so why just one line? and then where would you concentrate that rock? would that be at kemerton, would that be in china? can you just talk about that?
kent masters -- chief executive officer
yes. so p.j., it's kent. so i mean we're going to get started on one and we'll ramp other facilities over time, but it's really our capacity to convert. so we're not really mining rock to sell spodumene into the market.
we're mining rock to convert spodumene into finished products. and then we'll do that at kemerton initially. i mean, i guess we haven't worked out exactly kind of what the logistics are. so that product may go to china and other products go to kemerton.
so we just have to balance our sourcing of facilities, but that's the next tranche of our product in that part of the world.
operator
your next question comes from the line of laurence alexander with jefferies.
laurence alexander -- jefferies -- analyst
first, on the bromine pricing, can you discuss how much of that you feel is transitory versus sustainable given the demand trends you're seeing? and can you give any sense of the magnitude of the chlorine headwind for this year so that the -- we have some better context for the larger than this year kind of headwind next year?
scott tozier -- chief financial officer
yes. i think in terms of the pricing, we could probably figure most of that is this transitory. it's based on the raw material pricing that we pay and then the ability for us to absorb that and manage that as we price forward. and in terms of the chlorine impact, it's more of a timing issue.
we're going to get more chlorine next year, probably at different price than we're going to get this year. so you'll see that really impact us starting mostly in q1 next year throughout the year.
laurence alexander -- jefferies -- analyst
and then with catalysts, the recovery next year, how much should that be lagging or coincident with production ramp-ups at the refineries?
raphael crawford -- president, catalyst
laurence, this is raphael. the fcc business is very ratable to miles driven and that correlates to refining output. so i think fcc has as was mentioned, sequentially, continues to improve from a volume standpoint. so that one you would see first, and there's usually a lag on hydro processing, which is a 12- to 18-month lag.
as conditions improve in refineries, they get more capital availability and then reinvest in change-outs for hpc. so that has more of a lag effect. but overall, look, we see sequential improvement. we see refining conditions improving.
we're very tied to that with our performance products. so we see that as a favorable outlook going forward.
operator
your next question comes from the line of bob koort with goldman sachs.
mike harris -- goldman sachs -- analyst
yes. this is actually mike harris sitting in for bob. if i could, my guess a question around the lithium business. looking at the energy storage-related sales, why is there a potential 1- to 2-quarter lag behind the ev production versus those sales actually maybe leading?
eric norris -- president, lithium
yes, mike, it's eric here. it's simply a factor of the length of supply chain. lithium is consumed in the cathode material, which then is formulated into an electrode that's put into a battery, the battery is then assembled and then put into an ev car. so it's just the length of time that takes and the geographies involved.
most of the cathode -- nearly all the cathode production and a good amount of the battery production still is in asia. and of course, cars are produced at various points around the world. so it's just the length of the supply chain. we see that lag, but recall, we're well positioned.
we're able to supply anywhere in the world. so we're well positioned to grow with the industry, but that lag is likely to remain there given the length of the supply chain.
mike harris -- goldman sachs -- analyst
got it. ok. that helps. and then also just as a follow-up.
when i think about lithium recycling, can you give me an idea of what kind of assumptions you guys have made around recyclement and perhaps the potential impact on your business, if any at all?
kent masters -- chief executive officer
recycling is a phenomenon that follows the end of life of batteries and further still one has to factor in potential reuse of batteries. and given the 10-year life cycle that is warranted on most batteries produced for automotive production, that's the kind of lag you're looking at. so batteries being produced today wouldn't even be considered for recycle until 10 years from now. when we look at that, that means that we see recycling becoming important as the decade wears on, but still by the middle of the decade being fairly small amount of lithium needed in the supply chain and maybe reaching a double-digit amount of -- low double-digit amount of possible coming back into the stream by 2030.
operator
your next question comes from the line of david begleiter with deutsche bank.
david wang -- deutsche bank -- analyst
this is david wang here for dave. i guess, first, can you talk about your feedstock forcing strategy for the 150,000 ton of lithium hydroxide capacity you're adding in china?
kent masters -- chief executive officer
i'm sorry. so that was the feedstock strategy for the 150 new projects in china?
david wang -- deutsche bank -- analyst
yes.
kent masters -- chief executive officer
so they'll be fed with spodumene coming out of australia.
david wang -- deutsche bank -- analyst
ok. and then secondly, are there any incremental headwinds or tailwinds to your 2022 guidance you provided at investor day, especially for bromine and catalyst? or do you still stand by those guidance?
kent masters -- chief executive officer
yes, we haven't updated our guidance since investor day. so we're going through our annual operating planned process right now. in fact, the next meeting is next week. and we'll give you a more definitive guidance in our fourth quarter earnings call.
operator
your next question comes from the line of joel jackson with bmo capital markets.
bria murphy -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
this is bria murphy on for joel. just back on the pricing discussions in 2022. can you just give us a little bit more color on how these discussions with your lithium contract customers are going? and then our pricing mechanism is going to be similar in '22 to '21? or is there a move more to benchmark pricing?
kent masters -- chief executive officer
so generally speaking, bria, the discussions we're having with our customers are for price increase next year and that aligns with the guidance i gave in a remark just a few moments ago. we have a book of contracts we've had in our basket, i should say, for some years now. those are going back while the fixed portion of those contracts are going back to the original long-term agreement, which is significantly higher in some cases than the average price that we're seeing for 2021. and then there's many of those contracts have a variable component.
and there's no one contract that looks exactly like the other, but that variable component can -- we'll also see increases. some of those variable components are tied to indices. others are just an annual increase nomination that's possible, our max increased nomination. and then finally, we have a good deal of technical grade contracts, where we'll see rising prices based upon an adjustment to what the rises we've seen this year as we roll into next year.
the last piece will be our china spot business, and that's hard to say that we'd see a pretty big increase on that next year because prices are already extraordinarily high in china right now. but we'll continue to see possibly some upside on a year-over-year basis, particularly in the early part of the year next year on that. so those are all the components that are driving our increase and the types of discussions we're having with our customers, which will give us nice leverage -- upside leverage to the improving market conditions.
bria murphy -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
ok. that's really helpful. and then i guess just like given the large upswing in lfp demand and recent tesla commentary, with that background, i just want to understand how you're thinking about investments into carbonate versus hydroxide. it seems kind of your incremental investments are mostly focused on hydroxide currently.
kent masters -- chief executive officer
we monitor this very closely. we have a lot of analytics suite and customer dialogues up and down the supply chain from oems all the way back through the battery and cathode producers to assess those trends. what we believe and has been confirmed in our discussions with customers is while there is an uptick in lfp demand, there's also been an uptick in vehicle production outlook as well for electric vehicles. and where lfp is occupying a sweet spot is in the lower cost and lower driving range portion of the vehicle mix.
for some automotive producers, that will be a larger percent of their mix than others. bottom line, we see strong growth in both of those products, albeit we see still pretty -- the growth rate in hydroxide will be higher over the coming five years. and hence, we feel we're extremely well positioned. we're bringing on 40,000 tons of carbonate capacity as we speak.
and we have the hydroxide expansion strategy in addition to the kemerton ramp that kent earlier described and feel we're well positioned to meet both lfp demand and rising high nickel demand for cathodes.
operator
your next question comes from the line of jeff zekauskas with jpmorgan.
jeff zekauskas -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
you've described your lithium prices as perhaps being up 15% to 20% or more next year. is the 15% to 20% representative? given market conditions, could it be up 30%?
kent masters -- chief executive officer
well, i think it depends as you might think, jeff, on market conditions. there's a portion of our business that is exposed to pure market conditions the majority of our business, even while they're under these long-term contracts, there's a variable component that the anchor around that is going to be around the fixed price, which is also going up because of the exploration and concessions we gave. so at this point, it's probably too early to say what we think about price be above 15% to 20% because our guidance was at least 15% to 20%. so we'll have to provide you as the quarter wears on and the discussions continue, that guidance as we get into the february call, the earnings call that we'll have in february.
jeff zekauskas -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
ok. and then for my follow-up, when i look at quoted bromine prices in china. maybe since august, they're up 60%, something like that? is that a representative price for what's going on in the market or it's not a representative price? or can you speak to bromine pricing in asia and where it's been and where you see it going? what's driving it?
netha johnson -- president, bromine specialties
yes, jeff, this is netha. that's a reflection of a couple of things. first of all, demand is up clearly across the market and raw material pricing are up to produce brominated products that are being required. so what you're seeing is that's what's driving an inordinate amount of price increase in the chinese spot price.
operator
your next question comes from the line of ben kallo with baird.
ben kallo -- baird -- analyst
one of the things that we're thinking about is i'd love to hear your perspective is with materials maybe being a bottleneck for ev production in sales. that's how you guys view that as a risk, just overall meaning is there enough lithium? is there enough copper? is there enough nickel? and then how are customers, i guess, approaching you and your competitors for security in the supply chain. does your scale and your diversity of your resources give you an advantage there over other people are trying to wrap up.
kent masters -- chief executive officer
so we'll talk a little bit about lithium. so copper, nickel, i don't know that we want to weigh in on that. but i'll make a few comments and then eric can add some detail to it. but i mean we're investing heavily to kind of keep up with that demand and maintain our share, which has been our strategy.
and so we're investing along with our customers. and security of supply has always been a key part of the value proposition from albemarle to their customers and particularly around lithium, as you mentioned, the diversity of resources, the diversity of locations where we produce and we have carbonate and we have hydroxide today, and then we'll continue to evolve those chemistries as the market shift over time. so i think the network that we built is really a lot of that is focused around security of supply and part of the key value proposition that we talk about constantly with our customers.
eric norris -- president, lithium
ben, i'd just add on the lithium side of material risk, there's enough material. there's enough lithium out there. the issue is the investment required to get there. and the fact that it's going to be at a higher cost, right? the cost curve is upward sloping as you go to lower-quality lithium resources that are out there.
the discussions we're having with our customers are ones of deep desire for commitment and partnership. that's both the existing ones we've had and as we bring on new capacity, new ones that we would look to target. and that's at various points in the value chain, but i would tell you the most significant and ardent discussions around security are the closer you get to the automotive oem. and so i think our track record of executing gives us that advantage for sure.
and i think that's where the discussions land as us being sort of a baseload partner from any of these automotive and battery firms. so i do think there is an advantage we have for sure.
ben kallo -- baird -- analyst
and not to get too ahead of ourselves here, but are you at a point that you are allocating to customers. so you're picking your customers and more than they're picking you? or is it not like that?
eric norris -- president, lithium
so i would say that's the merit of the partnership and why we have the discussions we do because any one -- any volume who is not committed to us in a long-term way. so that could be a spot buyer on the battery side, that could be tech grade buyer on the industrial side is does risk not getting the volume that they would like as we roll into 2022. so that's the basis for the partnership discussions that we're having is that desire for security of supply, given the points and time of the supply in the coming five years where things will be tightened, they are quite tight right now.

your next question comes from the line of vincent andrews with morgan stanley.
angel castillo -- morgan stanley -- analyst
hi. this is angel castillo on for vincent. thank you for taking the question. just back to the huntsman arbitration, curious what other alternatives are there in terms of discontinued process? i know you mentioned you've started to have discussions around settlement.
so what other kind of from a legal perspective, what other alternatives are there? and then how should we think about the timing of all of this?
kent masters -- chief executive officer
well, i think it's a range, right? and we're not going to get into too much of this an active process. so it is either through the arbitration process or from discussions that we've initiated that we could potentially reach agreement and resolve that matter. but those are the options and it's time frame is pretty wide.
angel castillo -- morgan stanley -- analyst
understood. and then as we think about kemerton and your ability to fulfill those contracts, i guess, particularly kemerton ii, given the longer delay. will those be fulfilled through more tolling? or how should we think about kind of the volume and how that will be, i guess, allocated, i guess, as we think about next year or 2023, would that be kind of less volume overall or just kind of lower margin from tolling?
kent masters -- chief executive officer
well, i think you'll see us -- we'll fill that with tolling. and with this acquisition that we've done, and we expect to get that up to speed relatively quickly. i mean there'll be some -- we expect to do make rights to get it to our standard and the quality that we want, but we'll be aggressive around that. and those will be the two kind of methods that we use to stay on our plan.

your next question comes from the line of kevin mccarthy with vertical research.
cory murphy -- vertical research -- analyst
hi. good morning. this is cory murphy on for kevin. i wanted to follow on -- i think it was p.j.'s question earlier about wodgina, you said you were starting up one line, and it looks like it's going to start production maybe in the third quarter of 2022.
can you help me understand what the delays are or why the restart process seems to take maybe upwards of six to 10 months. and then given spodumene prices, why wouldn't you start up or try to start up all three lines? are you able to sell the spodumene in the spot market? or is it that there's contractual reasons not to?
kent masters -- chief executive officer
well, it's on the selling spodumene really strategic reasons is that we want to convert it and sell the finished products to customers where we make commitments, and we have long-term arrangement. so we might sell some spodumene here and there, but that's not our strategy. and then just starting up. i mean, we're going to start the first train than the other.
it's really meant to be in line with our conversion capacity. and then that time line that you referenced or whatever the time frame is to get it going, you've got labor issues in western australia, we face the same things there that we do at kemerton to some degree. and really, the lead time is on some of the big equipment that's necessary in mining. some they call it yellow equipment that's necessary in operating these mines and the lead time on that.
cory murphy -- vertical research -- analyst
understood. that's very helpful. and then i just wanted to ask about tolling as well. it sounds like there's more tolling due to labor shortages or labor strikes in chile.
how would your volume trend without tolling? and when do you anticipate rolling off the tolling contracts related to the la negra start-up. i think you said you were bridging some capacity with that.
kent masters -- chief executive officer
right. well, i would say tolling is a strategy we use for bridging. that is correct. we do that.
we expect to continue to toll next year for the business of la negra but also for the purposes of cameron. look, i mean, it's a bridging strategy, but the market is extremely strong right now. and because kemerton has been delayed, there's spodumene that we can take advantage of. and as long as we have qualified tolling partner that is someone with whom we have a good relationship, we trust our quality.
we have a business relationship where we can collaborate together, then we'll take advantage of that, both to bridge and to take advantage of the strong market that's before us. so i think it's a variety of purposes. when it rolls off, it's hard for me to say, but we will have it as part of next year for sure.
operator
your next question comes from the line of colin rusch with oppenheimer & co.
colin rusch -- oppenheimer and company -- analyst
thank you so much for all of this information. i'm curious about the order patterns from your customers, and this is across the units. if you're seeing any sort of double ordering that you can track or and try to follow the sell-through for those individual customers. it seems like that there may be some folks trying to build some inventory or really trying to get prepared for any other incremental demand that they can pay.
eric norris -- president, lithium
colin, eric, from a lithium perspective, i would say that there we touch all aspects of the supply chain. and so i don't see any double ordering. and furthermore, to buttress that remark, i would say that the discussions we have with our customers, we know they don't have any inventory. they are hand to mouth.
so we know that because with the crisis existing around the global supply chain, you can imagine we're not always able to precisely target the week or the day at which a shipment is going to arrive, and that causes pain for the customer, right? it does for us, it does for them as well. so it's a very tight market still in lithium.
netha johnson -- president, bromine specialties
and colin, on bromine, we're not seeing any double ordering quote. customers are not trying to build inventory at their sites in anticipation of supply chain disruptions. supply chains are tight and things are difficult, but we've been able to manage it to a certain extent to where we can deliver within a window that they can live with. so we're not seeing those double orders or customers try to build up inventory by ordering more than they need right at this time.
raphael crawford -- president, catalyst
nor in catalyst either, colin.
colin rusch -- oppenheimer and company -- analyst
ok. and then just on the lithium content per kilowatt hour. are you guys seeing any real trend lines on that certainly, as some of these battery chemistries change and also looking to figure out how to optimize some of the materials. are you seeing lithium content increase, decrease, or kind of hold steady? and where would you pick that level right now?
eric norris -- president, lithium
for the most part, i don't think as we sit here and look at the year 2021, we've seen any material change. certainly, we would expect it over a period of years as prelithiation enters the equation on the anode side and as further as progress on solid-state or lithium metal anode technology progresses, that's definitely going to increase the content as it does, obviously, the energy intensity, which is sort of the whole point of those technology innovations. but i'd say as we sit here today, i think that the technology trends are alive and well, but it's on a quarterly basis during 2021, we really haven't seen significant change necessarily in that.
operator
your next question comes from the line of arun viswanathan with rbc capital markets.
arun viswanathan -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
great. thanks for taking my question. i guess i had a question just on the contracting process here. what are you hearing from your customers as far as length? are those contracts in lithium extending out now to four or seven or 10 years? and then when you do those contracts how do you kind of bridge the divide between this huge spot price of $28,000 plus per ton and something more reasonable and more in line with increases from where you are on the contract side.
i guess i'm just asking, have you seen a material rise in the cost curve that would justify contracts going closer to spot?
eric norris -- president, lithium
arun, i would say that the duration of requests from customers are increasing. i think we've characterized in the past that on average, it's about three years in our current mix. the new contracts under discussion, which would be slated to supply against the china expansions that kent described or future kemerton expansions, sorry, or even down the road expansions we could have in the u.s. those discussions are either five-year plus or they don't even start until '24, '25.
so we're having discussions with certain customers who are contracting for increments of time into the future, say, '23 to '26 or '24 to '28. those are the kinds of durations that people are thinking about, and that's largely driven by the investments made on the automotive side. from a pricing standpoint, you can imagine because prices are rising, there's certainly a desire on behalf of those buyers if they can to not have to pay spot prices. but the reality is they're either -- the discussion is either toward a much higher fixed price if they want some stability in their pricing term or we're pricing against that an established index so that it will rise with time.
now remember, the price you gave was a spodumene price when you said $28,000 plus per ton. the pricing in china is on a u.s. basis is in high 20s, close to 30 on a delivered basis. when you look at many of the indices around the world, most of these people are buying against a blend.
and so the pricing around that is not quite as high, but it's still well into the high teens, if not the low 20s of where a lot of those pricing indices are. so we continue to have a discussion with customers and those are some of the dynamics at play, which are leading us to long-term contracts with significantly higher price potential than what we've seen in the past.
arun viswanathan -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
great. thanks for that. and then i guess i just wanted to ask about if there's any risk you see on the political front in chile. yes, just a broad question, i guess, in the next month or two or so.
kent masters -- chief executive officer
yes. well, there's a lot happening in chile. so there's definitely political risk in chile. they rewrite the constitution and things are changing.
and we watch it closely and we operate there. so we're pretty close. i mean, we're close to the government. we see what's happening, but they're rewriting their constitution and there'll be changes in chile.
i think that chile wants to participate in lithium industry. they're looking to expand their participation, the contracts, the agreements they have with us are very progressive, so they participate as prices go up. so that's an upside for them. so i believe they want to participate in that economically, but there's a lot happening in chile at the moment, and we're watching it very closely.
operator
your next question comes from the line of matthew deyoe with bank of america.
matthew deyoe -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
so we touched a bit on tolling. but i wanted to kind of delve a little bit into it a little bit more because i know you said it's a bridging strategy and maybe we can be opportunistic. but you're sitting on a fair amount of latent capacity at greenbushes. and the read seems to be that converters are struggling to find enough merchant supply of spodumene to actually kind of continue to operate in some respect.
so why not get more aggressive on the volume? i have to think, one, prices right now are really attractive. but, two, almost somewhat concerning as it relates to the potential for overinvestment and overheating in markets and things like that. i feel like with your volume, you might have an ability to kind of regulate this a little bit.
kent masters -- chief executive officer
yes. so i'll make a comment, eric can add some color. i mean, we don't -- we can't just turn a toller on because they're going to our customers, we have to qualify them. so there's a process there.
and not all of those tollers would qualify with our customers. so we just can't just turn them on. it's not quite that simple even if we had the product. so now we're ramping and getting more spodumene going to give us optionality from spodumene standpoint going forward, but we still have to make sure we choose the ones and eric talked about it before, there are people -- there are tollers that we have relationships with that have been previously qualified or currently qualified with our customers.
so you have to fit in all those elements into it. and to really ramp it up, it's not a six-month strategy. it's going to take a little longer to implement that. eric, you want to add anything?
eric norris -- president, lithium
ok. no, i think you've handled it well. i don't think of these conversion as a dime a dozen. there are people who are in the industry, but there's only several that we would consider as being partners or meeting our standards for serving our customers.
so that's why there's a length involved that in the qualification process. so if there's opportunities, we'll take advantage of them. but we're very discriminating in how we approach that when it comes to serving our customers.
kent masters -- chief executive officer
yes. and key for us i mean, that again, security of supply, quality for the customer, customer has to trust us. so if we're going to toll, we have to make sure that product meets our specs and our customers' standards as well.
matthew deyoe -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
yes, fair point. and we almost got there with jeff's question, but if you look at chinese bromine price, i know in the past, it's been kind of comments are maybe it's not correct on an absolute basis, but directionally it's consistent with what you're seeing. so i mean given the move, should we think of this move as real and capturable in any capacity? and if so, is this a two-year process, a one-year process, a three-year process? it would seem like there's a lot of room to offset higher chlorine costs as well, but i'm not sure if that's the case or not.
netha johnson -- president, bromine specialties
yes, this is netha. those prices are real and they're really driven by demand. the demand is outstripping the supply. it takes almost two years to really bring on additional bromine supply in a meaningful way.
so you'll continue to see that demand outstrip supply and similar to what we said in our investor day for the next planning period that we use, and we think that will continue. the question is by how much. we've announced processes and things we want to add, and i'm sure others have as well. but right now, it's not complex.
demand is really exceeding supply, and that's what's driving the chinese bromine price up.
operator
your next question comes from the line of christopher parkinson with mizuho.
harris fein -- mizuho securities -- analyst
this is harris fein on for chris. turning back to wodgina. so how should we be thinking about the cost that's associated with bringing that back into production? and then understanding that greenbushes is in a class of its own when it comes to cost per ton, how should we be thinking about the relative cost of spodumene that comes out of wodgina?
scott tozier -- chief financial officer
yes. this is scott. so i think, as you said, talison spodumene world class, right, low cost in the world. wodgina, we haven't operated yet, but we do believe it's going to be relatively close.
ultimately, it does have a lower concentration. so it won't meet it, but it will be relatively close.
kent masters -- chief executive officer
maybe, say, in the ballpark.
scott tozier -- chief financial officer
yes. it's up.
kent masters -- chief executive officer
and i think, scott, the cost for this, harris is asking about how to think about that, we captured them in the guidance we provided, both capital and cash flow. it's largely joint venture capital cost to acquire this yellow equipment that we've talked about and ramp the jv.
harris fein -- mizuho securities -- analyst
got it. and then a lot of the wave iii announcements that you made so far, actually, all of them that have been disclosed are really planned in china. so i'm curious what the strategic rationale was to focus so much on china. and i'm wondering whether it was a matter of lower capital cost or whether or not you see the chinese market drifting more toward high nickel and whether or not you expect most of those tons to stay domestic or make their way into other markets?
kent masters -- chief executive officer
yes. so i mean, eric can get into detail, but kind of at the high level. i mean we do see lower capital costs there. that's probably not the driver of the driver.
that's where the market is today. and then that product can either serve chinese market or be exported as well. and then i mean we anticipate seeing the battery supply chain shifting to the west and then we will invest ahead of that. but for the near term, we see that market in china today.
and then we see that kind of -- as we go forward, you hear us talking about north america and europe, to some degree, but we see that moving west and then we'll invest with it. eric, do you want to?
eric norris -- president, lithium
i mean i think if you look at the percent of production of cathode on the world market, china is well over half of it today, and that will increase between now and the middle of the decade. so china is the center of the world for all cathode technologies. now many of those are being developed. the supply chain is being developed prospectively to come into and match up to battery production ultimately in north america and europe.
and that's why we have a way for plan that addresses that, and we'll speak to those opportunities to localize supply, and it's an active program with us. but as we've said many times, wave iii is largely asia-centric, heavily china-focused because that's where the market is. and we will build that repeatability of capital design and execution there that will serve us well as we continue to grow around the world. it's also where a large amount of our resources are in the asia, albeit australia but in the asia region as opposed to the -- in the western part of the world.
so those are all the elements that play that strategy, and we look forward to growing with our customers as they expand into the west.
operator
there are no further questions. i would now like to turn the call back over to mr. kent masters for closing remarks.
kent masters -- chief executive officer

ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the q3 2021 albemarle corporation earnings conference call. [operator instructions] i would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, david burke, director of investor relations. thank you. please go ahead.
david burke -- director of investor relations
thank you, and welcome to albemarle's third quarter 2021 earnings conference call. our earnings were released after close of market yesterday, and you'll find our press release, earnings presentation and non-gaap reconciliations posted on our website under the investors section at www.albemarle.com. joining me on the call today are kent masters, our chief executive officer; and scott tozier, our chief financial officer; raphael crawford, president of catalyst; netha johnson, president of bromine specialties; and eric norris, president of lithium, are also available for q&a. as a reminder, some of the statements made during this call, including our outlook, guidance, expected company performance, and timing of expansion projects may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws.
please note the cautionary language about forward-looking statements contained in our press release and earnings presentation. same language applies to this call. please also note that some of our comments today refer to non-gaap financial measures. a reconciliation to the gaap financial measures can be found in our earnings release and the appendix of our earnings presentation, both of which are posted on our website.
now i will turn the call over to kent. 
kent masters -- chief executive officer
thanks, david, and thank you all for joining us today. on today's call, i will highlight our quarterly results, provide an update on our goals for 2021 and discuss the progress of our ongoing expansion plans. scott will provide more detail on our results, outlook, and guidance. we reported another solid quarter with net sales of $831 million and adjusted ebitda of $218 million.
sales improved by 11% on a year-over-year basis, while adjusted ebitda was relatively flat compared to the third quarter last year. excluding fcs from our third quarter 2020 results, our net sales were 19% higher and ebitda was up 14%. scott will get into more detail on our financials in a few minutes including favorable revisions to our guidance. as we stated in our earnings release this morning, we increased our guidance based on the third quarter results.
during our recent investor day, we did a deep dive into our accelerated growth strategy and provided color on how we think about the near-term expansion of our lithium business as well as our disciplined investment approach. since that event in early september, we are pleased to have announced several updates on those efforts. this includes signing an agreement to acquire guangxi tianyuan new energy materials, or tianyuan, which owns a recently built conversion plant near qinzhou. we are totaling to ensure the plant operates as advertised and expect to close this transaction in the first quarter of next year.
this puts us on track for first sales from this plant in the first half of next year. in addition to this plant, we have signed two recent agreements for investments in china to support two greenfield projects, each initially targeting 50,000 metric tons per year. these projects position us for initial added conversion capacity of up to 150,000 metric tons of lithium hydroxide on an annual basis to meet our customers' growing demands. in addition, our marbl joint venture announced the restart of the wodgina lithium mine in western australia.
on slide 5, you will see the objectives we set for 2021. when we set these goals, we did so with the intent of challenging ourselves with plans that were aggressive, but achievable. as we approach the end of the year, i'm excited by the significant progress and proud of the effort our team has put into achieving these goals. as you see on this slide, we have accomplished the vast majority of what we set out to do.
for example, we are successfully progressing high-return, fast payback bromine projects at both magnolia and jbc. these projects will increase our capacity and improve the efficiencies of our operations. we've also made significant progress on our lithium growth projects. now let's turn to slide 6.
first, at la negra iii and iv, our team continues to execute to plan. i'm excited to announce that we recently completed a major milestone by achieving first lithium carbonate production in late october. initial production volumes will be used to qualify the plant and the material with our customers to ensure we are meeting their requirements. this qualification process is proceeding on track with first sales expected in the first half of next year.
in western australia, the ongoing labor shortages and pandemic-related travel restrictions have continued to significantly impact virtually all companies in that region and show no signs of easing in the near term. despite these efforts and with herculean efforts, our team has managed to hold kemerton i construction completion to year-end 2021. we now expect kemerton ii construction completion in the second half of 2022. while we are facing challenges at these projects, our strategy to consolidate resources and prioritize the first train continues to mitigate additional risks.
on slide 7, i'll highlight the progress we've made on our wave iii program since we last spoke to you at our investor day. at the end of september, we announced an agreement to acquire tianyuan for $200 million, including a recently built conversion plant near the port of qinzhou designed to produce up to 25,000 metric tons of lithium per year with the potential to expand to 50,000 metric tons per year. we expect this acquisition to follow a similar path as our acquisitions of xinyu and chengdu facilities back in 2016. following the close of the transaction, which is expected in the first quarter of next year, we plan to make additional investments to bring qinzhou plant to albemarle standards and ramp to initial production of 25,000 metric tons.
this acquisition enables us to accelerate conversion capacity growth and leverage our world-class resource base. together with our partner, we agreed to restart operations at the wodgina lithium mine in western australia. initially, wodgina will begin one of three processing lines, each of which can produce up to 250,000 metric tons of lithium spodumene concentrate. this resource will be critical as we ramp our conversion capacity in western australia with our kemerton sites.
we also signed agreements to invest in two greenfield conversion sites in china at zhangjiagang and meishan. we plan to build identical conversion plants with initial target production of 50,000 metric tons of battery-grade lithium hydroxide at each site. these investments offer additional optionality for future growth and have expansion potential. investing in china offers capital-efficient, high-return growth with proximity to our low-cost australian spodumene resources and many of our major cathode and battery customers.
we continue to explore global expansion of our conversion capacity as the battery supply chain shifts west. turning to slide 8 for a review of our global project pipeline. as you can see, albemarle is executing a robust pipeline of projects all around the world. for example, our bromine business is pursuing incremental expansions in jordan and the united states.
these high-return projects leverage our low-cost resources and technical know-how to support customers in growing and diverse markets, like electronics, telecom and automotive. in chile, the salar yield improvement project allows us to increase lithium production without increasing our brine pumping rates utilizing a proprietary technology to improve efficiency and sustainability. in australia, we continue to progress study work on additional kemerton expansions to leverage greater scale and efficiency with repeatable designs. finally, in the united states, we are expanding our silver peak facility in nevada to double lithium carbonate production.
this is the first of several options to expand local u.s. production. in kings mountain, north carolina, we continue to evaluate restarting our mine. and at our bromine facility in magnolia, arkansas, we're evaluating the process technologies to leverage our brines to extract lithium.
we'll continue to update you periodically on our pipeline. i hope this gives you a sense of the diversity and optionality albemarle has as a global lithium producer. i'll now turn the call over to scott for a look at the financials.
scott tozier -- chief financial officer
thanks, kent, and good morning, everyone. let's begin on slide 9. during the third quarter, we generated net sales of $831 million, an 11% increase from the same period last year. this improvement was driven by strong sales for our lithium and bromine segments.
adjusted ebitda was essentially flat on a year-over-year basis, resulting from the sale of fcs and increased freight and raw material costs. the gaap net loss of $393 million includes a $505 million after-tax charge related to the recently announced huntsman arbitration decision. while we continue to assess our legal options, we have also initiated discussions with huntsman regarding a potential resolution. excluding this charge, adjusted eps was $1.05 for the quarter, down 4% from the prior year.
now let's turn to slide 10 for a look at adjusted ebitda by business. third quarter adjusted ebitda of $218 million increased by 14% or $27 million compared to the prior year, excluding the sale of fcs. higher adjusted ebitda for lithium and bromine was partially offset by a $13.5 million out-of-period adjustment regarding inventory valuation in our international locations, impacting all three gbus. lithium's adjusted ebitda increased by $25 million year over year, excluding foreign exchange.
we were able to offset the limited impact of a one-month strike in the salar in chile, thanks to higher tolling volumes and higher spodumene shipments from our talison joint venture. adjusted ebitda for bromine increased by $5 million compared to the prior year due to higher pricing partially offset by increased freight and raw material costs. volumes were flat given the chlorine constraints in the quarter. and catalyst adjusted ebitda declined $4 million from the previous year.
this was due to lower sales and cost pressures, partially offset by higher-than-expected joint venture income, which included a favorable tax settlement in brazil. slide 11 highlights the company's financial strength that is key to our ability to execute our growth plans over the coming years. our net debt to ebitda at the end of the quarter was 1.7 times and is below our targeted long-term range of two to 2.5 times. this provides us with capacity to fund growth while supporting modest dividend increases.
we don't expect the recent arbitration decision to impact our current growth plans, but it could temporarily reduce our flexibility to take advantage of upside growth opportunities. turning to slide 12, i'll walk you through the updates to our guidance that kent mentioned earlier. higher full year 2021 net sales and adjusted ebitda guidance reflects our strong third quarter performance. net cash from operations guidance is unchanged due to the timing of shipments to customers and increased raw materials and inventory costs.
capital expenditures were revised higher related to the continuing tight labor markets and covid-related travel restrictions in western australia, as well as accelerated investments in growth. turning to slide 13 for a more detailed outlook on each of our gbus. lithium's full year 2021 adjusted ebitda is now expected to grow in the mid- to high teens year-over-year. that's up from our previous guidance due to higher volumes and pricing.
the volume growth is driven primarily by tolling. and our full year average realized pricing is now expected to be flat to slightly higher compared to 2020. as a reminder, most of our battery-grade lithium sales are on long-term contracts with structured pricing mechanisms that are partially exposed to the market. we also benefit from stronger market pricing on shorter-term technical grade sales and on spot and tolling sales of battery-grade lithium.
full year 2021 average margins are expected to remain below 35% due to higher costs related to the project start-ups and tolling partially offset by productivity improvements. bromine's full year 2021 adjusted ebitda growth is now expected to be in the low double digits. that's also up from previous guidance due to the continued strength in demand and pricing for flame retardants. our bromine volumes remain constrained due to sold-out conditions and a lack of inventory.
the outlook for chlorine availability has improved since last quarter, but the market remains tight and the impact of higher chlorine pricing is expected to be felt more in 2022 than in 2021 due to the timing of inventory changes and shipments. year-to-date, higher bromine pricing has mostly offset higher raw material and freight costs. catalyst full year 2021 ebitda is now expected to decline between 20% and 25%. that's also an improvement from our previous guidance, owing to the higher-than-expected joint venture income.
the year-over-year decline in adjusted ebitda is primarily due to the impact of the u.s. gulf coast winter storm earlier in the year, product mix and the previously disclosed change in our customers' order patterns. catalyst fourth quarter margins will also be impacted by product mix, including a greater proportion of lower-margin fcc and cft resid orders. fcc demand continues to improve with increasing global fuel demand, while hpc orders continue to be delayed.
overall, market conditions are improving but volumes and catalysts are not expected to return to prepandemic levels until late 2022 or 2023. in total, we expect ebitda margins to be lower in the fourth quarter due to higher raw materials, energy and freight costs across all 3 of our businesses. we are closely watching several key risk factors, including global supply chain disruptions, global impacts of the energy rationing in china and chip shortages. supply chain and logistics challenges are the most immediate.
our teams are working day and night to navigate these port issues, the lack of drivers and upstream supply disruptions to ensure our customers get their orders on time. we also continue to monitor the global situation with regard to chip shortages. we recognize that the auto industry has been struggling with those shortages. but to date, we have not seen a direct impact on either our lithium or bromine orders.
and with that, i'll hand it back to kent.
kent masters -- chief executive officer
thanks, scott. i'll end our prepared remarks on slide 14. as scott mentioned, we are disappointed by the outcome of the huntsman arbitration decision. but regardless of the ultimate outcome of that dispute, albemarle will continue to focus on the execution of our growth strategy.
as we highlighted during our investor day in september, we have a well-thought out and focused operating model that we are implementing across our businesses. this model, the albemarle way of excellence, provides us with a framework to execute our objectives effectively and efficiently and will help us to remain on target as we pursue significant growth opportunities ahead. and as we pursue these opportunities, we will be disciplined in our approach to capital allocation. our primary capital priority is accelerating high-return growth.
this means that we will invest not just to get bigger but to create tangible shareholder value and maintain financial flexibility to take advantage of future opportunities. utilizing this approach with our low-cost resources, we believe our annual adjusted ebitda will triple by 2026. finally, at the core of all of this is sustainability. as one of the world's largest lithium producers and innovators, we were able to work closely with our customers to create value and drive better sustainability outcomes for all stakeholders.
with that, i'd like to open the call for questions. i'll hand over to the operator.

[operator instructions] our first question comes from david deckelbaum with cowen. your line is open.
david deckelbaum -- cowen and company -- analyst
morning, guys. thanks for taking my questions. i was curious if you could talk a little bit about the lithium pricing outlook. you raised your outlook to 40% to 45% increase in '22.
when you think about that, and you talked about renegotiating your fixed price contracts, how do we think about your exposure to spot market fluctuations now as we head into 2023? and i guess, in conjunction with that, would you expect that you would see further pricing increases into 2023 based on your outlook today?
eric norris -- president, lithium
david, this is eric norris. so our pricing outlook -- let me start first with the composition, what we see in 2022. we have, as scott and kent indicated in the prepared remarks, moved our pricing structures to be more variable. about upwards of close to 50% of our existing battery-grade contracts have a variable component to an index with a price and a ceiling.
those indices are not what you would see in china. those are indices based upon global publicly available indices, such as benchmark minerals, fast markets, and the like. the remaining 10% of our business is spot in china, so that is going to be exposed to what you see. and the rest is largely, at this point, fixed.
although as scott indicated, as we continue to approach customers and then they seek to add to their volumes through our expansions, we are in those discussions asking them and considering moving to more variable with them as well. so we have bottom line increased our exposure to pricing upside, but i think you need to consider that the contracts that we -- or excuse me, the indices we're using largely are the global indices, not the china indices, where you see much higher price in the china market than you do globally. so in terms of the outlook going forward, i mean, i would say that we expect -- it really comes down to what china pricing does. it is the lead, sort of the tip of the spear.
where that goes, the indices follow globally. those global industries are about half, in some cases, of current china prices. so there's probably room to go in those indices, but there's -- with prices where they are in china, one could only speculate what they would go. and could they go down? we don't know.
so there's -- there'll always be some variability on that 10% of our business that's in china.
david deckelbaum -- cowen and company -- analyst
appreciate that. my follow-up is just on the capital raise, a $200 million increase this year to the budget. it sounds like that's accelerating some of the conversion assets in china. could you just give a little bit more color around that? and when do you expect to see some of the volumetric impact relative to your original outlook?
kent masters -- chairman, president, and chief executive officer
ok. so i'm not sure, volumetric impact -- so you're talking about our wave three expansions when we see those volumes coming on? is that --
david deckelbaum -- cowen and company -- analyst
it sounds like that the timing has now accelerated around wave three. so i guess per your -- if you were to look at it based on your original vision that you laid out at the investor day, how much time are you pulling forward with that additional $200 million around the conversion assets?
kent masters -- chairman, president, and chief executive officer
yes. so we brought it forward because of the meishan, zhangjiagang -- the acquisition zhangjiagang. so that was not -- we were hoping to do an acquisition. the hadn't plan didn't have that, nailed down at the -- when we did the equity raise and the comments that we made then.
so that brought it forward. and we've increased the capacity about 50,000 tons in that wave. so the time frame has been pulled a bit forward because we've confirmed that acquisition, and then we've increased that wave by 50,000 tons. and as we said before, the two greenfields we think will be on by the end of 2024.
david deckelbaum -- cowen and company -- analyst
thank you all.
operator
our next question comes from bob koort with goldman sachs. your line is open.
bob koort -- goldman sachs -- analyst
thank you. good morning. kent or eric, i was wondering if you could talk about your strategy on contracting to customers in a growing and very tight market. is there an approach to not contract all your volume to ensure your customers can get deliverability? do you want to have as much as possible fixed volume obligations? how do you think about that?
kent masters -- chairman, president, and chief executive officer
yes. so i'll just -- at a high level, and eric can give you a little more detail on it. but i think we've talked about it. we want to have a portfolio across the range of those projects.
so we're not tying up all the volume on long-term fixed contracts. but we do want to have that element of it. it's becoming a probably a bigger part. we're probably fighting to make sure that we keep the portfolio the way we envision it.
eric norris -- president, lithium
yes. i don't have much to add, bob. you heard how i answered david's question just before you on the mix. we've seen an influence that to have up to a half on some sort of variable price that has some floors and ceilings a bit of spot and then the rest fixed.
and we still strive to have, as we grow the business and add capacity, an amount that we can play in the spot markets. and that gives us excess to flex with our contract customers as they grow as well. strategy still remains to be a partner to our customers and to seek those partnerships for their long-term growth, and that's becoming in this market a very important topic, that security of supply.
bob koort -- goldman sachs -- analyst
can i ask a follow-up? what was the reason? and what are the ramifications of changing your mrbl agreement?
kent masters -- chairman, president, and chief executive officer
yes. so we're -- i mean we're in the middle of that. so i don't really want to front run the discussions that we're having with our joint venture partner. but i mean it's really about -- it's expanding it to giving us more reach and mitigating some of the risks that we see in the marketplace by sharing it with a partner.
bob koort -- goldman sachs -- analyst
gotcha. thanks again.
operator
our next question comes from jeff zekauskas with j.p. morgan. your line is open.
jeff zekauskas -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
thanks very much. when you look at your lithium carbonate, your lce production from now to 2025. does your cost per ton change very much and in what direction?
eric norris -- president, lithium
well, jeff, as kent described -- this is eric, first off. as scott described, wave three is hydroxide-based and spodumene-based in that regard. those are -- that's a higher cost of production than carbonate production out of chile. so generally speaking, because of the higher cost to produce hydroxide versus carbonate out of brine, the average cost goes up slightly.
but that's a function of resource and product mix. we continue to drive productivity throughout the portfolio to ensure that we're operating at a low conversion cost to take advantage of the good resources we have.
jeff zekauskas -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
and i think scott said that the first quarter would have the -- of '22 would have the highest ebitda total of the year. why is that given that lithium production would be much greater in the second half?
kent masters -- chairman, president, and chief executive officer
so there are a couple of dynamics happening there. so first is we've been aggressive around pricing given inflation coming through. and in the first quarter, we're selling out of inventory where that inflation has not actually hit our cost base yet. so -- and that's true across all of our businesses.
so that inflation catches up to us in the back half of the year, and we've already implemented pricing. so that there's a lull on that. and then it's really the same answer on lithium. that's across all the businesses, but particularly in lithium.
spodumene prices have gone up dramatically. in the first quarter, we're selling out of inventories, which have '21 costs. and in '22, those cost increases come through the p&l. and that was the dynamic scott was talking about, where our ebitda becomes tax-affected because it's minority interest from jv income.
because even though we're protected from those spodumene prices going up, it shifts from being in our peer ebitda minority interest, which gets added to ebitda but on an after-tax basis. so those are the -- really the two drivers for why the first quarter is the highest ebitda level.
jeff zekauskas -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
great. thank you so much.
operator
our next question comes from p.j. juvekar with citi. your line is open.
p.j. juvekar -- citi -- analyst
yes. good morning. how quickly do you see the wodgina ramp-up? and is that limited by available conversion capacity in australia and china? and then talking about conversion capacity, your potential north american/european conversion capacities in wave four, what does it take to move it to wave three?
kent masters -- chairman, president, and chief executive officer
i'm going to take the second question first and then probably talk to eric for the first. but -- so what we define -- i mean the waves are really just -- those are our definition of projects. so nothing else is going to change. it's not going to move north america from four to three because three is defined, and we're well into execution on those projects right now.
and we're still defining exactly what we will do in wave four. but we would -- we look to accelerate those, but they'll still remain in wave four.
eric norris -- president, lithium
and p.j., on your first question about wodgina, we are only with our joint venture partner ramping up the first train of wodgina with 50,000 tons of 6% spodumene, a little over 30,000 tons on an lce basis. we look at the china, the growth in conversion capacity and hydroxide from wave three that kent described as the output -- or excuse me, the consumer for that material. as a side note, spodumene tends to come on pretty quickly. it's a different kind of plan operation than a conversion -- chemical conversion plant, which tends to ramp over two years.
a spodumene plant can come up within 6 months.
kent masters -- chairman, president, and chief executive officer
plus those trains are already built.
eric norris -- president, lithium
plus the trains, yes, fair point. plus trains are built and they're just being restarted. so we would expect by midyear to see spodumene flowing from that and put it into the assets that we talked about in wave three. and the balance, we'd consider looking at tolling for the balance.
and then as we continue to progress wave three and other expansion activities, we'd look down the road. we've made no decisions yet on the second and third train at wodgina, but those would be for down the road, giving us plenty of dry powder, so to speak, to support our growth as we continue to build out conversion capacity.
p.j. juvekar -- citi -- analyst
great. and you guided to lithium volume growth of 20% to 30%, which i would think is in line with where the industry is growing. but you have so much new capacity coming online in '22, first half and second half. so i would have thought that your volumes would grow faster than the industry.
any reason why it's not growing faster than the industry?
eric norris -- president, lithium
well, certainly, we'd like to continue to maintain our position in the industry and growth of the industry. and you're right, with this growth guidance, we were doing that. but underneath that are the practical realities of capacity limitation. so the guidance we've given, p.j., speaks to -- we give you dates of when we think these plants will come online.
we -- and we first have that first qualification standpoint. we have a six-month period before it can be qualified, and then we have about a two-year ramp to ramp that. when you back-calculate that math, that's on our fixed base of 88,000 tons last year. that is the growth increment you get.
so it happens to correspond to market growth, but it's going as fast as we can on our capacity expansion.
p.j. juvekar -- citi -- analyst
understood. thank you.
operator
our next question comes from christopher parkinson with mizuho. your line is open.
christopher parkinson -- mizuho securities -- analyst
great. thank you very much. just two quick questions. just the first would be for the western oems, let's say, all in on the ev front.
just what's your assessment of their own perceptions just regarding some of the newer competitor supply additions and how that product will or potentially will not be accepted in the marketplace in the ultra, let's say, near to intermediate term? any color would be helpful.
eric norris -- president, lithium
yes. so by that, you're referring to western oems' view of new lithium competitors coming into the market who are trying to bring capacity to market. look, i mean, i think you'd have to ask their view on things. i will say this, security of supply is a very, very big concern in the market.
i think that's why in a pure spot market like china, you see prices that are in order of magnitude higher than they were a year ago. it's folks trying to get supplied at any price. so that is true, certainly in china given those prices, but that same sentiment is true here in the u.s., particularly as western oems or in europe as well, underwrite big investments. so they are looking for lithium wherever they can get it.
i think the offering that albemarle brings and is part of our dialogue with them is we have the resources. we have the execution capability, and we're reliable in bringing on supply. so we're an attractive partner for them in those dialogues, and we're in the middle of all those discussions now as we bring on this new capacity and look into the future to bring on future capacity, particularly as kent referenced, as we look to localize capacity in north america and europe.
christopher parkinson -- mizuho securities -- analyst
that's helpful. and just a quick follow-up. just what would just be your latest thought process? on the demand front, you already hit on a few things. but just in terms of battery technologies, energy density.
just any color on what you've seen in terms of new model launches and potentially advancing high-nickel cathode chemistries? that would be very helpful.
eric norris -- president, lithium
yes. so on battery chemistry for electric vehicles, we still see over the five- and 10-year view -- or sorry, i'll put it another way, over the 2025 and 2030 view that we've characterized in our growth charts in the earnings deck. we still see nickel -- high nickel being the key to higher range. and we further see innovations on the anode side in prelithiation and new technologies that will further allow more energy density and cost-effectiveness of those nickel chemistries with that parity to internal combustion engines and coming in within that 18- to 24-month period.
that being said, it's pretty clear and our projections would show that lfp for lower energy density for lower-range vehicles, lower-cost vehicles is going to remain a segment of this market, not only now but through this 10-year period. and it's a double-digit percentage over that period of time, a low double-digit percentage but a double-digit percentage of the market. but most of the growth will be hydroxide.
christopher parkinson -- mizuho securities -- analyst
thank you very much.
operator
our next question comes from alex yefremov with keybanc. your line is open.
alex yefremov -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
thank you. good morning, everyone. i think as i look at your pricing guidance for lithium segment, it was a very strong. if i even assume some level of cost inflation, that cost number to get to your ebitda and eps guidance ends up being very high based on my model, at least, maybe as high as 40% or more per ton.
is there anything else beyond the spodumene and talison dynamics that you already described in terms of cost that we should keep in mind for '22?
kent masters -- chairman, president, and chief executive officer
so i mean, i think you have to appreciate we're bringing on new plants. and when we bring them on, they're not loaded, right? so there's a lot of -- we're doing multiple facilities doing that. so there's high fixed costs associated with lower volumes. but other than that, i mean, the pricing movements are pretty aggressive and pretty consistent.
we've moved our portfolio quite a bit. we've been talking about that, and we've more or less done that. so we're more exposed to the market than we have been in the past. but i think you have to keep in mind that fixed cost piece about bringing on new facilities that are not loaded.
alex yefremov -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
ok. appreciate it. and then i wanted to follow up on the pricing side. i guess, given the approximately 50% of your volume have these indices, would any of these indices reset during the year? and could you end up above the 45% sort of upper bound of your lithium guidance -- price guidance?
eric norris -- president, lithium
it's eric. i can answer that. it's -- they are all based on indices that continue to move. the recent movement has been upward in the past three months.
again, sort of the tip of the spear being china prices, which are significantly higher. where the market goes long term, we don't know. if there is a downward sort of correction in china prices, that will hit the china spot volumes we have. if however the spot -- these indices for the large part of our business is variable fixed ceiling floor, those are well below those spot prices.
it's very hard to say. if the prices remain high, we could definitely be to the higher end of our range on price.
kent masters -- chairman, president, and chief executive officer
and i think -- i mean, i think part of your question was about are they fixed through the year. so they aren't. those -- that move of the market can move during the year.
alex yefremov -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
understand. thanks a lot.
operator
our next question comes from steve richardson with evercore. your line is open.
steve richardson -- evercore isi -- analyst
hey. good morning. i was wondering, again, just back on the capital piece. scott, could you give us any more color just in terms of how much is cost inflation versus pull-forward? i appreciate that you kind of addressed this a little bit earlier, but it is something that continues to come up in our conversations and would be helpful.
and then on the cost piece, just on the previous question, i appreciate that you're dealing with a lot of fixed costs in terms of some of these new project starts. but could you maybe tease out, at least in terms of your unit cost, how much is process-related in terms of just general costs associated with the process versus what you're seeing in terms of this mismatch between volumes and fixed cost versus variable?
kent masters -- chairman, president, and chief executive officer
yes. so let me take the first part of your question, scott, and then i'll kick over to scott to talk about the margin piece and the conversion costs. so looking at the change in our capital forecast, it's at least half acceleration. i mean there is -- i mean we have had additional cost executing projects in western australia during the pandemic has been a challenge for us, and we've had additional costs as well as extending the projects on that.
and we also see inflation impacting the projects that we're kicking off now that we didn't see a year ago. so it's probably -- how accurate we can be around that, but it's probably half acceleration and half additional costs associated with inflation and pandemic cost. and scott, i'll kick to you for the margin question.
scott tozier -- chief financial officer
steve, as you look at the lithium margins going into this year, the two factors are these plant start-ups and not being at full capacity. and that's probably $100 million drag in the year, somewhere in that range. and then the impact of the spodumene prices going up and changing the dynamic between cost of sales, so increasing our cost of sales but also increasing our equity income on an after-tax basis, that's probably north of $200 million. so those are the two biggest kind of movers as you look at the lithium margin.
steve richardson -- evercore isi -- analyst
great. i appreciate the additional clarity. and one follow-up, if i may, just for eric, on the lithium outlook on the demand side. the $1.5 billion number is obviously huge relative to where the market had been, and i see the logic on the demand side.
can you address your view, like the industry's ability to hit this from a supply perspective and at least how does this play out? do we just end up seeing ever higher incentive price to bring marginal projects to bear? or do we have a limiting factor here in terms of the supply side's ability to hit that number? and certainly, the $3 million in 2030 is a huge number as well.
eric norris -- president, lithium
ok. i would say, steve, that it's going to take -- it's a hard run, right? it's going to take everybody being ourselves and our competition being successful at hitting their milestones in order to provide that to meet that supply. so it's an all-out effort to get there. so i don't want to sugarcoat it.
it's -- i think it's the reason the industry is so tight is because there's a view it takes a while and it's -- and it doesn't go as it's -- always as expected. in terms of price, i don't have a crystal ball. i don't -- i never would have predicted a $65 carbonate price. so i don't know how to think about where that would go in the future.
it does reflect that hard slog i just referred to, i think, that everybody's got to step up and execute well in order to meet that demand.
steve richardson -- evercore isi -- analyst
thank you very much.
operator
our next question comes from joel jackson with bmo capital. your line is open.
joel jackson -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
hi. good morning, everyone. some years ago, you guys had talked about kind of a 40% ebitda margin for lithium as kind of being what i think you make it over the course of the cycle. we're now at 34%, 35% range over the last three years to much different pricing scenarios every year.
and you talk about now fully loaded plants and how that may affect margin. you're going to be, of course, ramping on plants indefinitely or for a long time. so should we be thinking about this as the right cost base going forward, this margin as the right kind of base going forward for lithium?
kent masters -- chairman, president, and chief executive officer
i think what we've said in the past in the long term is we stand by that. so i think we've got one of the things you have to understand is as spodumene prices go up, that impacts our ebitda margin because of the nature of the jv. so ebitda effectively becomes tax-affected to some degree because of the product we purchased from talison. and that will -- and that won't be different with mrbl going forward.
so that has an impact on the pure ebitda margin, but it still flows through the p&l once you get fully to the bottom line. so i think to kind of answer your question, we still stand by the guidance that we've provided in the long term. we still think it's in that range.
joel jackson -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
the next question is, it's great to have a 3 million-ton demand forecast for lithium for 2030. but let's be honest, we're never going to get there. there's no supply out there. even if there's supply, we're not going to get there in eight years for 3 million tons, right? you've got to have new resources, you got to have new technology, dle whatever.
you have to have lots of assets that aren't producing now in lots of strange places, new feedstocks. so we're never going to get to 3 million tons. would you agree with that? and if that's the case, what's going to happen? so does that mean the ev acceleration has got to come down, oems have to change your plan? or do i have it wrong?
kent masters -- chairman, president, and chief executive officer
eric said it before, that it's a slog, but it's doable. i think the industry has to be aggressive and has to execute well. and i think you're seeing and some of that -- that we're getting through some of those growing pains. we think we're probably as experienced as anyone at doing these large conversion facilities and bringing on new resources.
but it's a combination of resource and conversion capacity. it is a stretch, but -- and it does require some new technology and operating in some places where historically, the lithium industry hasn't done that, but it's not impossible.
joel jackson -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
thank you.
operator
our next question comes from vincent andrews with morgan stanley. your line is open.
vincent andrews -- morgan stanley -- analyst
thank you, and good morning, everyone. kent, just wondering if you could mark the wave three total capex for us. i think you originally said it at $1.5 billion, and i think you mentioned half of the increase for '22 was related to inflation. but it seems like maybe some of that was transitory if covid indeed calms down.
so how would you tell us to think about wave three now versus the original $1.5 billion?
kent masters -- chairman, president, and chief executive officer
yes. well, it's -- i mean it has stretched a little bit because we've accelerated and we've had inflation. so that inflation is -- if it goes away in three years doesn't matter because we're building the projects in the next couple of years. so there is some impact on that.
so it's -- we've accelerated because there's additional capacity associated with that. so that is half of the difference and the other half is inflationary. so it's -- you got to add that on. and that -- and even if it goes away, i mean, we're not going to be necessarily in western australia, but there's still going to be -- and we see -- our forecasting says inflation in the capital equipment that we're buying in the next year and two.
vincent andrews -- morgan stanley -- analyst
so if we thought of something like it was going to be like a $1.8 billion to $2 billion now instead of $1.5 billion, is that good for a ballpark number?
kent masters -- chairman, president, and chief executive officer
i think i want to start estimating what the projects are going to turn out to be. but it's up definitely from $1.5 billion. part of that is the acceleration. so i'm kind of focused on the inflation part.
but overall, that's probably not a bad estimate.
vincent andrews -- morgan stanley -- analyst
ok. and just on the salar de atacama technology projects, can you just talk to us about what milestones are left to hit on that so that you'd be confident that you'll be able to execute it?
kent masters -- chairman, president, and chief executive officer
yes. so we're just getting going into the real execution phase of that particular project, but i don't know that -- it's not as complicated a project as a conversion facility. so i think we feel pretty good about executing on that. we are -- we've lost a little bit of the float we had in the schedule, but that's it.
we're still on plan and on the schedule that we had, but we have lost a little bit of the contingency from a time standpoint that we originally had built in.
vincent andrews -- morgan stanley -- analyst
ok. very good. thank you. i appreciate the answers.

our next question comes from kevin mccarthy with vertical research. your line is open.
kevin mccarthy -- vertical research partners -- analyst
yes. good morning. a couple of questions on your catalyst business. first, i think you had announced some price increases in early january.
can you talk about the magnitude and the flow-through with regard to realization of those increases? and also related to catalysts, any update on your level of confidence with regard to the ongoing strategic review?
kent masters -- chairman, president, and chief executive officer
sorry, raphael. let me touch on the strategic review and then let you talk about pricing. so i mean we're going through that process, and it's going well. the timing we had said, we think we'll have an answer by middle of the year.
and i don't really want to front-run it or comment too much on it beyond that. raphael?
raphael crawford -- president, catalysts
yes. sure. thanks, kent. kevin, as we -- as you saw, we announced a price increase in january.
that's really to help offset the inflation that we've seen starting in the second half of 2021 into this year, particularly around natural gas. so that's building momentum. so i think we'll see north of $10 million worth of pricing in our forecast. again, that's really to offset what we've seen on raw materials.
as you know, kevin, we are -- we produce performance products. so we create a lot of value for our customers. we think our pricing is justified. it's mostly around fcc catalyst where we're in a near sold-out position right now.
all that being said, we've got a lot of confidence in what we shared as our long-term forecast for the business at investor day. we think some of the raw material headwinds will be covered with price over time, and we'll be on track to deliver what we said.
kevin mccarthy -- vertical research partners -- analyst
and then second, kent, i think you mentioned in your prepared remarks you've begun to build some relationships with the incoming administration in chile. can you talk through what has changed in that country, i suppose politically, but also there's an ongoing effort to rewrite the constitution. what in your mind will be fixed or remain the same? what are you watching in terms of potential changes? and how are you thinking about it in terms of capital allocation moving forward beyond la negra 3 in country versus alternatives you may have in australia, china, u.s., or other countries?
kent masters -- chairman, president, and chief executive officer
ok. so -- yes, so there's a lot going on in chile. and new administration is not really in place. and we're trying to build our relationships out in front of that with our local team there.
but there have been discussions going on about rewriting the constitution and all of them. the mining royalties across multiple industries have been -- those discussions have been happening for the last six months, if not a year. so there's been a lot of discussion. so we're trying to build relationships with the new government, stay close to it.
we don't anticipate a wholesale change in the direction that the government goes with respect to extractive industries, but we do think there'll be changes. most of that is going to be as you look forward as opposed to on existing on existing businesses, particularly around lithium. so we don't see a wholesale change in the way that lithium is -- the existing business is done in chile or our royalties that we pay. as an example, we think they're very progressive, probably the highest in the world on lithium for sure and probably even in extractive industry.
and we think that that will hold and maybe become an example for some of the other resource-based industries in chile. so we're pretty optimistic about our position in chile. from a capital allocation standpoint, i mean, we have -- we're spending money now there on the salar yield project. we've got the la negra 3 and 4 project is really done, and we're in the process of ramping that up.
so we won't really need to make a capital allocation decision vis-a-vis chile for a while. so we'll have a much better view of what's happening in chile and what the new administration, the direction that they're going and what the rules of the road are before we have to make a significant capital allocation decision there.
kevin mccarthy -- vertical research partners -- analyst
perfect. thank you very much.
operator
our final question comes from chris kapsch with loop capital market. your line is open.
chris kapsch -- loop capital markets -- analyst
good morning. thank you. so slightly more nuanced follow-up on the pricing and then also the security of supply concept, something that eric mentioned a couple of times. so obviously, it's an increasingly important theme, i think.
and this is really juxtaposed against these new demand scenarios that you put out this morning, the 1.5 and the 3 million ton demand scenarios by '25 and 2030. so at your analyst day in september, you talked about just how the industry's demand -- or sorry, cost curve will be steepening. and even your own portfolio, i would say it's -- you're going to experience that. but as you ramp wave three, even pulling forward the 50,000 metric tons, you're talking about 200,000 metric tons.
that's only 20% of the increased industry demand from now to 2025, it looks like. so in terms of security of supply, we think these customers are just increasingly concerned about their ability to source lithium at reasonable prices. so my question really is, are they coming to a big and well-established and reliable integrated supplier like albemarle and saying like, the pendulum swinging back toward this concept of being willing to pay higher fixed costs in order to ensure that supply. i know you've gone from sort of those floor pricing contracts to more of a variable structure.
but i would think, given how acute this potential shortage is shaping up to be that they'd be more motivated to do that. and is that something you're considering? just wondering kind of -- i was kind of asking a couple of others in different ways. but it just seems like there's -- this is going to be a tough scenario, and the only answer is going to be for higher prices to induce more supply. anyway, any more color around that would be appreciated.
kent masters -- chairman, president, and chief executive officer
yes. so i'm going to take the first shot of that. and eric, you can fill in if i miss some of the key points. but i guess the first thing is security of supply has always been a key part of our value proposition.
and in our view, we -- it didn't get the attention that we thought it deserved in the past. we've always built on having multiple resources, different locations, diversification in our supply base and security of supply. albemarle has a portfolio that is unlike anyone else in the industry. and that's from both a conversion, geopolitical resource, cost base, brine, rock everything.
so that said, it is getting more attention. and i think the oems and the battery manufacturers, but probably the oems more than anything else, are paying more attention to that. they're seeing that there may be a structural deficit or at least they want to make sure they align with the most reliable players. and we're having conversations with different people.
they're just conversations about different pricing structures. in the industry, we've shifted our -- the portfolio shift that we've done now is really something we started a couple of years ago, put it on hold when prices went so low because we didn't want to renegotiate contracts at a trough. but we've been able to do that now, and that will probably continue to evolve. the structure that we have now is probably not the one that lasts for the balance of the industry.
so i suspect there are changes in those structures to come, and a lot of it will be based on security of supply and quality and the ability to bring on projects and deliver what you say you're going to do.
chris kapsch -- loop capital markets -- analyst
and i just have one follow-up. the -- just on -- i don't know if, eric, you want to add to that. but also just on your decision to sell spodumene, because i thought that you had explained in the past that that would be for captive conversion to hydroxide, but now you've elected to, it sounds like, opportunistically, sell some of the spodumene into the market.
kent masters -- chairman, president, and chief executive officer
yes. i wouldn't read into that that that's a change in our strategy. it was opportunistic, and it was a product that we had sitting in inventory that had -- was made several years ago and had just been sitting. and we took the opportunity to sell that into the market because there was just an opportunity, and we took advantage of it.
it's just opportunistic. you shouldn't read into that that we've changed our view on selling spodumene in the market.
operator
that's all the time we have scheduled for today's call. i'd like to turn the call back over to kent masters for closing remarks.
kent masters -- chairman, president, and chief executive officer
ok. thank you, michelle, and thank you all for your participation on our call today. our successes in '21 have positioned us well to capitalize on the strength in the markets that we serve. and this coming year is about execution.
i'm confident in our team's ability to drive value for all of our stakeholders by accelerating the growth of our business in a sustainable way and to lead the industry by example. thank you.

good day, and welcome to the fourth quarter albemarle corporation earnings conference call. [operator instructions] as a reminder, this call is being recorded. i would like to turn the call over to meredith bandy, vice president of investor relations and sustainability. you may begin.
meredith bandy -- senior vice president, investor relations, treasury, and risk management
all right. thanks, michelle. thank you all, and welcome to albemarle's fourth quarter 2021 earnings conference call. our earnings were released after close of market yesterday, and you'll find our press release and earnings presentation posted on our website under the investors section at albemarle.com.
joining me on the call today are kent masters, chief executive officer; and scott tozier, chief financial officer. our gbu presidents, raphael crawford, netha johnson, and eric norris are also available for q&a. as a reminder, some of the statements made during this call, including outlook, guidance, expected company performance, and timing of expansion projects may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws. please note the cautionary language about forward-looking statements contained in our press release and earnings presentation.
that same language applies to this call. please also note that some of the comments made today refer to non-gaap financial measures. a reconciliation to gaap financial measures can be found in our earnings release and the appendix of our earnings presentation. now i'll turn the call over to kent. 
kent masters -- chairman, president, and chief executive officer
thanks, meredith, and thank you all for joining us today. on today's call, i will highlight our quarterly results, recap our 2021 successes and update you on our expansion plans. scott will provide more details on our financial results, outlook, and capital allocation priorities. and finally, i'll walk you through our 2022 objectives.
2021 was a transformative year for albemarle. our strategic execution and ability to effectively manage the challenges of the global pandemic enabled us to capitalize on the strength of the lithium and bromine markets and generate results that exceeded expectations. for the year, excluding our fine chemistry services business, which was sold in june of 2021, we increased net sales by 11% to $3.3 billion, which was in line with our previous guidance. adjusted ebitda grew 13% in 2021 to $871 million, surpassing the upper end of our guidance.
looking ahead, our outlook for 2022 has improved based primarily on favorable market conditions for lithium and bromine. we expect adjusted ebitda to grow between 35% and 55% versus 2021, excluding fine chemistry services. to continue driving this growth, we are focused on quickly bringing capacity online with accelerated investments. la negra 3 and 4 is currently in commercial qualification, and we expect to start realizing first sales from this facility in the second quarter.
in november, we achieved mechanical completion of the first train at kemerton. the construction team is now dedicated to the second train, and we will be able to leverage our experience from train one to improve efficiencies and timeliness of this project. and we recently signed a nonbinding letter agreement to explore the expansion of our marbl joint venture with increased optionality and reduced risk. now looking at slide 5.
we introduced this slide early last year to lay out our 2021 objectives designed to support the four pillars of our strategy: to grow profitably, to maximize productivity, to invest with discipline, and to advance sustainability. i would like to thank our teams for their extraordinary efforts. virtually all the goals we set last year were met or exceeded despite challenges related to severe weather, supply chain issues, and the ongoing effects of the pandemic. the focus of our people around the world is what drove our strong year and underscores our ability to deliver on our commitments.
these accomplishments have also set the stage for us to take advantage of the growth opportunities ahead. just as important as driving growth is an ongoing dedication to strong esg values. i'm very proud of what you see on slide 6. since i became ceo in 2020, one of my main priorities has been continued improvement in sustainability.
i'm pleased to see that these efforts are increasingly being recognized externally, but it certainly isn't a new initiative for albemarle. sustainability is not just doing the right thing but also doing it the right way. for example, the lithium market is expected to see significant demand growth in the coming years. as a leader in lithium production, we expect to be an example and help define the standards of sustainability in this market as it goes through this fundamental shift.
now turning to slide 7 and more on the lithium market outlook. based on our current market data, ev trends, and regular interactions with our customers, we are revising our lithium demand outlook upwards once again. we now expect 2025 lithium demand of approximately 1.5 million tons, up more than 30% from our previous estimates. beyond 2025, we anticipate continued growth with lithium demand of more than 3 million tons by 2030.
ev sales growth is accelerating as consumers become more energy-conscious, governments incentivize clean energy, technology improves, and evs approach pricing parity with internal combustion vehicles. in 2021, global ev production nearly doubled to over 6 million vehicles from 3 million in 2020. by the end of the decade, evs are expected to account for close to 40% of automotive sales. when you look at last year's growth rate of nearly 50% and the auto industry's ambitions for a rapid transition to evs, it's easy to see why demand expectations are so bullish.
however, meeting this demand will be a challenge. turning to our wave two projects on slide 8. la negra 3 and 4, which will add conversion capacity for our chilean brine resource in the salar de atacama, is currently in the customer qualification process. we anticipate incremental volumes and revenue contribution from this project in the second quarter of this year.
while there are significant changes taking place to the political landscape in chile, we do not anticipate any material impacts to our business. we support the chilean people's right of self-determination and applaud the peaceful leadership transition in that country. our team has already begun building relationships with the incoming administration. as i mentioned earlier, kemerton 1 reached mechanical completion late last year and is currently in the commissioning phase.
this puts us on track to begin first sales in the second half of this year. kemerton 2 remains on track to reach mechanical completion by the end of this year. the oems and battery manufacturers have been investing heavily in growth, including commitments in north america and europe, and the lithium industry must do the same. turning to slide 9.
we provide an overview of how albemarle is investing to support downstream growth. since our investor day, we have accelerated and further defined our wave three projects, including the announcement of three strategic investments in china. this wave of investments will provide albemarle with approximately 200,000 tons of additional capacity. that's up from 150,000 tons of capacity originally planned for wave three.
we've also continued to progress our growth options for wave four. based on discussions with our customers, we are analyzing options to restart our kings mountain lithium mine and the potential to build conversion assets in north america and europe. our vertical integration, access to high-quality, low-cost resources, years of experience bringing conversion capacity online, and strong balance sheet provide us with considerable advantages. i'm on slide 10 now.
in china, we expect to close the acquisition of the qinzhou conversion facility in the first half of this year. this transaction is progressing well, and we continue to work through the appropriate regulatory reviews. the qinzhou plant is currently being commissioned, and we have begun tolling our spodumene to assist with that process. we continue to progress the two greenfield lithium conversion projects in meishan and zhangjiagang.
we have started site clearing at meishan and expect to break ground at zhangjiagang later this year. we expect mechanical completion of both projects by the end of 2024. the restart of one of three processing lines at the wodgina mine is going well, with first spodumene concentrate production now expected in the second quarter. at greenbushes, talison continues to ramp production from the cgp 2 facility to meet design throughput and recovery rates.
in addition, the tailings project at talison is on track. before i turn the call over to scott, i'd like to highlight our bromine growth projects on slide 11. our bromine business is investing in innovation and capital projects to take advantage of growth opportunities. we expect new products to make up more than 10% of annual bromine revenues by 2025, up from essentially a standing start.
the first of these products to launch is saytex alero, our next-generation polymeric flame retardant. we first discussed saytex alero at our investor day last year, and i'm excited to say that we have achieved first commercial sales in january and expect to scale production throughout the year. we've also invested in the resource expansion at the smackover formation in arkansas, and we continue to grow our conversion and derivative capacity in both arkansas and jordan. with that as an overview, i'll turn the call over to scott to discuss recent results and our outlook.
meredith bandy -- senior vice president, investor relations, treasury, and risk management
scott?
kent masters -- chairman, president, and chief executive officer
scott, you might be on mute.
scott tozier -- chief financial officer
hello? can you hear me now?
kent masters -- chairman, president, and chief executive officer
yes. we hear you.
scott tozier -- chief financial officer
ok. sorry about that. i was on mute. thanks, kent, and good morning, everyone.
i'll begin on slide 12. for the fourth quarter, we generated net sales of $894 million, which is an increase of $15 million compared to the prior-year quarter. this was driven by higher sales from lithium and bromine, partially offset by the loss of revenue from our fine chemistry services business, which was sold in june 2021. excluding fcs, we grew by 11%.
the fourth-quarter net loss attributable to albemarle was $4 million, reflecting an increased cost estimate to construct our kemerton lithium hydroxide plant due to anticipated cost overruns from the impact of pandemic-related issues on the supply chain and labor. fourth-quarter adjusted diluted eps of $1.01 was down 14% from the prior year. the primary adjustment to eps is the $1.13 add-back of that kemerton revision. let's turn to slide 13 for more detail on adjusted ebitda performance.
excluding fcs, fourth-quarter adjusted ebitda was up 12% from the prior year. lithium results remained strong driven by higher volumes as well as higher pricing. bromine results were roughly flat year over year, reflecting strong performance in late 2020 and repeating it in 2021. and catalyst improved in the fourth quarter as refinery markets continue to rebound and the business saw benefits from onetime items.
our second-half sales grew 13% from the first half of the year, following a relatively flat growth since mid-2020. this acceleration of growth is expected to continue into 2022. on slide 14, you can see we are expecting both volume and pricing growth in all three of our business units in 2022. we expect net sales of between $4.2 billion to $4.5 billion and adjusted ebitda in the range of $1.15 billion to $1.3 billion.
this implies an adjusted ebitda margin of between 27% and 29%. adjusted diluted eps and net cash from operations are also expected to improve year over year. we anticipate healthy growth in adjusted ebitda in all four quarters this year, and we expect q1 to be the strongest quarter for several reasons. all three gbus are expected to benefit from lower-cost inventory sold at prices that have been raised in anticipation of inflation.
in the first quarter, lithium also has the benefit of strong shipments from our talison joint venture to our partner as well as a onetime spodumene sales material produced at wodgina on initial start-up in 2019. and finally, going forward, higher spodumene transfer pricing increases are going to increase our cost of sales and only partially be offset by higher talison joint venture income, which is included in our ebitda after tax. and this creates a tax-impacted ebitda margin drive. as kent mentioned, capex is expected to increase to the $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion range this year as we accelerate lithium investments to meet increased customer demand.
the key actions to meet or exceed this guidance include: first, successful execution of our lithium project start-ups; second, closing the acquisition in china; third, solid performance at our sold-out plants in lithium, bromine, and fcc catalysts; fourth, continued strength in our end-use markets and favorable pricing environment; and lastly, solid procurement to combat inflation. let's turn to slide 15 for more details by gbu. lithium's full year 2022 ebitda is expected to be up 65% to 85%, a significant improvement from our previous outlook. we now expect volume growth to be up 20% to 30% for the year with the new capacity coming online as well as ongoing efficiency improvements.
average realized pricing is now expected to increase 40% to 45% compared to 2021 due to strong market pricing as well as the expiration of pricing concessions originally agreed to in late 2019. in some cases, as these concessions rolled off, pricing reverted to legacy contracts with significantly higher variable pricing. and as we've been saying, we've also taken the opportunity to work with our strategic customers to renegotiate contracts to more variable-rate structures. catalyst ebitda is expected to be up 5% to 15%.
this is below our previous outlook, primarily due to cost pressures related to high natural gas pricing in europe and raw material inflation. volumes are expected to grow across segments with overall refining markets improving. we continue to see volumes returning to pre-pandemic levels in late 2022 or 2023. fcc volumes are already there, but hpc volumes are lagging.
bromine ebitda is expected to be up 5% to 10%, slightly above our previous outlook based on strong flame retardant demand supported by macro trends, such as digitalization and electrification. volumes are expected to increase based on the expansions we began in 2021. and as discussed, higher pricing and ongoing cost and efficiency improvements are expected to offset higher freight and raw material costs. now turning to slide 16, i'll provide some additional color on lithium volume growth.
this slide shows the expected lithium production volume ramp from the new conversion facilities we expect to complete this year. we begin the year with a baseload production of 88,000 metric tons in 2021, which includes silver peak, kings mountain, xinyu, chengdu, and la negra 1 and 2. and you can see that this is virtually a 50-50 split of carbonate and hydroxide. as our wave two projects come online, output will begin to favor hydroxide.
generally speaking, we expect it to take about two years to ramp to full conversion capacity at a new plant, including approximately six months for commissioning and qualification. therefore, we expect to reach our full 200,000 tons of conversion production by early 2025. before i turn it back to kent, i'd like to update you on our capital allocation priorities, and i'll turn to slide 17 to do that. our capital allocation priorities remain the same.
our primary focus is to invest in profitable growth opportunities, particularly for lithium and bromine. strategic portfolio management and maintaining financial flexibility are important levers to support this growth. for example, we have divested non-core businesses like fcs and reallocated funds to organic/inorganic growth opportunities, like the expected acquisition of the qinzhou plant. the strategic review of catalyst is progressing well and is on track for us to make an announcement of the outcome in the first half of this year.
we'll also continue to evaluate bolt-on acquisitions to accelerate growth or bolster our portfolio of top-tier assets. as always, future dividends and share repurchases are subject to board approval. however, we expect to continue to support our dividend. given the outsized growth opportunities we see in lithium, we don't anticipate share repurchases in the foreseeable future.
and with that, i'll turn it back to kent.
kent masters -- chairman, president, and chief executive officer
thanks, scott. i'll end our prepared remarks on slide 18, outlining our 2022 objectives aligned with our long-term strategy. first, we will continue to grow profitably. this means completing our wave two expansions and progressing wave three expansions to grow lithium conversion capacity and volumes.
we'll also focus on safely and efficiency starting up those facilities. next, we will continue to maximize productivity, and this is even more important in today's environment with rising cost for raw materials. we will leverage our operational discipline to offset inflation through manufacturing excellence, implementing lean principles, and embracing smart technology to improve hse, cost, reliability, and quality. our procurement cost-saving initiatives and manufacturing excellence projects will be key to offsetting higher raw materials and freight cost as we work to achieve adjusted ebitda margin of between 27% and 29%.
we will invest with discipline. as scott discussed, portfolio management and maintaining our investment-grade credit rating are both high priority for us and will continue to be a focus in 2022. importantly, we plan to complete the catalyst strategic review later this year, which will maximize value and set that business up for success while enabling us to focus on growth. finally, we will advance sustainability.
that means driving progress toward our goals for greenhouse gas emissions and freshwater use and setting additional sustainability targets. we'll also continue to work with our customers to improve the sustainability of the lithium supply chain by completing our mine site certifications, scope 3 greenhouse gas assessments, and analyzing product life cycles. so with that, i'd like to open the call for questions, and i'll turn it back to michelle.

[operator instructions] our first question comes from pj juvekar from citi. please go ahead, pj.
pj juvekar -- citi -- analyst
yes. good morning. good pricing initiatives. given that your leverage is down substantially, it's a real advantage for you right now.
would you consider more m&a in lithium or getting into recycling or potentially going downstream? how would you view those options from a 60,000-foot view?
jerry masters -- chairman, president, and chief executive officer
so pj, i think -- i mean, we've always -- we're looking at m&a on a regular basis, so i don't think i really -- our view has changed. so we do want to be in recycling, and we feel like we have a plan we're working toward being in the recycling business. we look at resources on a regular basis for acquisition, and we look at conversion assets as well. so our strategy has not changed.
we may have a little more firepower now than we did in the past. but i think the strategy is the same areas, and we're pretty focused on those areas.
pj juvekar -- citi -- analyst
also in argentina, in antofalla, what are the permits or hurdles that are remaining before you proceed? and similar for kings mountain, what could be some environmental concerns there, which has impacted other projects in the region? thank you.
jerry masters -- chairman, president, and chief executive officer
yes. i'll just comment at a high level. i mean it's all the permits that we need. i think we're closer in argentina than we are in kings mountain, but we're early in the process in north carolina.
but eric can talk about more details there.
eric norris -- president, lithium
yes. these are classical studies -- pj, it's eric here. that you would do for any pre-feasibility work. there are -- the antofalla site has -- is a greenfield site.
it has not ever been mined before so there are a host of different permits from environmental onwards that would have to be achieved, and those are underway. and then we would progress from there. in the case of kings mountain, this is a brownfield site. and so much of the work has to be done similarly on testing groundwater testing, environmental.
there's a lot of work we're doing also with the community. we've engaged them very early on and did so earlier this quarter to participate in that process. and so as kent said, that's a little earlier on, but it's also a brownfield site so it will have a slightly different trajectory than, say, a greenfield site like antofalla.
pj juvekar -- citi -- analyst
thank you.
operator
our next question comes from jeff zekauskas from j.p. morgan. please go ahead, jeff.
jeff zekauskas -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
thanks very much. you have a very clear idea of the capacity expansions you wish to execute over the next five years. what's the trajectory of capital expenditures from the $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion level?
jerry masters -- chairman, president, and chief executive officer
i'm not sure -- the question -- you mean over past the next five years?
jeff zekauskas -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
yes. exactly right. how do you expect your capital expenditures to change over that period?
jerry masters -- chairman, president, and chief executive officer
yes. i think we -- i think you're probably -- we expect them to be in that range, right, over the next five-year period and going forward. i mean, it depends on what on opportunities. so resources, if we had additional resource, that would change that profile.
if we were able to acquire or identify additional resource, that could change that. but i think our baselines, which we've laid out in our investor day is kind of capital in that range over the next five-year period.
jeff zekauskas -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
great. so lithium prices have really moved up. and are there limits to what cathode manufacturers or battery manufacturers can absorb? or do you see any ceilings or we'll just see what the market brings?
jerry masters -- chairman, president, and chief executive officer
well, it's difficult to call what the market is going to do, so i think we have to see what the market is going to bring. i mean i think there are economic factors that come into play, but when you look at the overall cost of a vehicle, i mean, there are a lot of components that go in there. lithium starts to become a little bit material, but it's still a small percentage of that overall cost. so i mean, look, our view is that prices -- the market is moving.
they have recently just come down a little bit. suspect that's because demand in china is off because of covid-related issues and so it has softened recently. but we're trying to structure our contracts. we've talked about this for a while, so we move with the market.
so where we're not dislocated to the market in either in an upmarket or downmarket.
jeff zekauskas -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
ok. great. thank you so much.
operator
our next question comes from david deckelbaum from cowen. please go ahead, david.
david deckelbaum -- cowen and company -- analyst
yeah. i think about expansion and your growth projects in north america, you discussed accelerating some activity at silver peak, growing out the kings mountain facility and restarting the mine there, and looking at, obviously, the magnolia brine operations. one, is there an interest or should we expect albemarle to be filing any loan applications to look for some low-cost financing with any of these projects? and then my second part with that would be, do you anticipate building out conversion facilities in and around the kings mountain that would be sort of greater than your u.s.-based resource on the upstream side?
jerry masters -- chairman, president, and chief executive officer
ok. so there were a couple of questions in there. so i think, first, i mean, loans, i think we'd be interested if we can get economically viable loans better than we can do on our own, we're definitely interested in that to help us build out the battery supply chain in north america. and we would be looking to build conversion capacity locally.
our customers want local conversion -- local resource and conversion capacity. and then i think your question would be outsized conversion vis-a-vis the local resource that we have. so we'll have to work that out over time. but we -- the way we see it, we've got to convert the local product, we'll probably have to supplement local product with product coming from outside the u.s.
and then we want to make sure that we -- as we do this, we're considering recycling as well. so we want to have not only virgin lithium coming from the resources in the united states and outside the u.s. but capacity for recycling as well. and we see that as an integrated facility that does that.
david deckelbaum -- cowen and company -- analyst
i appreciate the color on that. and then just my follow-up quickly. maybe if you could just characterize the situation. you reiterated your outlook around volumes and obviously increased the outlook around pricing.
are you seeing any impacts, i guess, from some of the shipping woes that we hear getting into china or getting product into china, are you anticipating that? and then have you experienced little friction moving spodumene concentrate into your converters in china? and how do you see that situation kind of progressing throughout the year?
jerry masters -- chairman, president, and chief executive officer
well, i mean we see that in all of our businesses, right? so we're fighting the supply chain. as you hear in the news and with every other business, we're fighting it, but we've been able to manage through it. today, we can't say we don't have issues, but we've managed through it. but maybe not -- eric, you guys could comment a little bit on specifically what you see in, i guess, really around china and spodumene in and out.
eric norris -- president, lithium
yes. so relative to china and the lithium business, just recall that we are an exporter as well as an importer. so a lot of the hydroxide production that we make in china goes to that market and then a chunk goes outside and surrounding asia countries as well. and in addition, as you point out, we're bringing spodumene from australia entirely support those operations.
we have not -- we've experienced some customer impacts. we haven't been able, due to logistics, to hit certain time lines. but we haven't had any material impact to our revenues or to our contracts with these customers. and it comes down to just a very active supply chain team that is constantly managing various ports across the east coast of the eastern seaboard of china to find the right way in and out for those products.
but there are thousands of ships sitting off the coast of china now. so it's no small task, and so we'll manage it on a day-to-day basis. the covid crisis and how it's being managed there in china has definitely made this challenging, and we expect to continue to have that challenge and be very astute in how we manage it. but no impact of material variety so far.
netha johnson -- president, bromine specialties
and i think for us in bromine, china, we are a net importer. so for us, getting material in is the same for eric, an extreme challenge. but we're also getting, on the back end, seeing containers return from china to allow us to load up our facilities in america and in the middle east. that's probably the bigger issue.
and that's part of the macro supply chain challenge and container movement around the world. we've got a great logistics team here at albemarle in supply chain with a brand-new leader, and we're excited about what they're doing to manage this difficulty. but again, no material impact. we got a great team, and they're managing that very well for us.
david deckelbaum -- cowen and company -- analyst
thanks, eric. thanks, netha.

our next question comes from vincent andrews from morgan stanley. please go ahead, vincent.
vincent andrews -- morgan stanley -- analyst
thank you. scott, i just was wondering if you could give us a bit more color on the working capital and how it works, just given so much of the increase in guidance was price related. so is it just a question of receivables are going to spike for a period of time as these prices flow through? or is there anything going on, on the inventory side as well?
scott tozier -- chief financial officer
yeah. vincent, i think you've nailed it. so as prices go up, obviously, the receivables go up. we're generally averaging between 55 and 60 days as a total company.
so we basically have two months of receivables and the impact of that. so that's a driver. the second one is on inventory, rising costs and inflation. we're seeing, obviously, our inventory costs go up as well even though the quantities are about the same or actually a little bit lower from what we saw last year.
so those are the two big drivers. we see a little bit of benefit from -- in the payables to offset that inventory, but that's what's going on.
vincent andrews -- morgan stanley -- analyst
ok. and just as a follow-up, you mentioned that there are some contracts that might be renegotiated midyear off of 6 to variable. do you have a rough idea of what percentage of your mix that could be or that's at least in discussion?
scott tozier -- chief financial officer
yes. so if you actually look at the chart that we put in the presentation that breaks down our revenue, those fixed contracts make up about 30% of our battery-grade revenue. and those are the ones that are in discussions right now. so we'll see.
if we're successful, there would be additional upside to the guidance as we move those to variable pricing.
vincent andrews -- morgan stanley -- analyst
but it's all of the 30%, not a subset of it that's in play.
scott tozier -- chief financial officer
eric, do you want to provide some additional detail there?
eric norris -- president, lithium
yes. i would -- just knowing the mix of business we have, vincent, i would say it's a subset. we still have a double-digit percentage there. it wouldn't go to 0, but it could come down from 30% if we prevail.
vincent andrews -- morgan stanley -- analyst
ok. excellent. i appreciate the help.
operator
our next question comes from joel jackson from bmo capital markets. please go ahead, joel.
joel jackson -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
good morning, everyone. i want to ask a question, and it's not just you, it's obviously the business and your peers, what you thought pricing would be in margins with a lot different look only three months ago, but into february into that quarter and q1. and suddenly, the way your contracts are working with index pricing, suddenly now, it's a lot higher pricing, it's a lot better margin. the story is really different.
so i want to ask what really changed? and if things could change so quickly in three months, how can you be confident pricing in your base case can stay flat for the rest of the year?
jerry masters -- chairman, president, and chief executive officer
yes. so i mean we've been talking about moving to these variable price contracts for over a year. and so -- and coming into the year, i mean, we're basically in the same position that we were at the beginning of the year. most of the discussions that we've done with most happened that changed our contract structure happened at the end of last year, toward the end of last year.
what's changed is pricing. the indices have moved up. market has tightened. the market has gotten stronger from an ev demand standpoint and particularly in china.
so that's really, i think, was the driver. those were the first prices to move and other prices followed that. and it's a tight market. i mean the demand is strong, and the supply is -- it's tight.
it's a little bit of an imbalance, and that's what's driven pricing. well, how it stays there, i mean we have -- but there are lags on our contracts. so we feel like we understand the second quarter pricing very good, and we don't see it dropping dramatically. that's why we're comfortable giving guidance holding what we see for the second quarter for the balance of the year.
what it does going forward after that, it's difficult to call. but the market is still tight. it's gotten a little soft because the demand is off in china over covid issues. some of the ev plants were shut down.
they're mostly back up now, but they are at lower rates. so demand is a little bit slower, which has caused a pause in the market, and pricing has come off a little bit. it's hard to see how that comes down over time. i mean, it can, but it's hard to see that happening very quickly.
joel jackson -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
ok. if i follow up on that, so if you're now more exposed to spot and not as much as fixed or price moving around a lot more, how does that change how you manage the business? because you can have a view right now like you just said, but obviously, that could change in a month or two. and that may change how you look at things, your risks, how you handle working capital, what level -- how comfortable you are with leverage. because it seems like your business now is going to be more variable with spot prices of lithium, which have surged and they're way more volatile than they were in the past.
how does that change how you view the business month-to-month, quarter to quarter, how you manage to plan for it?
jerry masters -- chairman, president, and chief executive officer
yes. so our contracts, i mean, they're not all spot. so they are -- these are contracts that we have. some are shorter term in the variable category.
some are short term with -- that are indexed to the market. the longer-term contracts we have are indexed to the market but tend to have callers on them with floors and ceilings. so that takes some of that variability out. so this is -- i mean, it's an evolution of our strategy around pricing.
we are more indexed to the market today than we were a year ago, definitely. and that was by design. and i think -- but we're confident in the volume growth. and then pricing, it will move up and down, but we have a very good cost position with the resource base that we have and our cost position.
we still think that we can invest capital to grow for this business and have confidence in that.
joel jackson -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
thank you.
operator
our next question comes from alex yefremov from keybanc. please go ahead, alex.
alex yefremov -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
thanks. good morning everyone and congrats on renegotiating the contracts. a question on volumes, you raising your wodgina production goals for this year, and yet your overall volumes are about the same for this year. could you kind of explain what's going on with your volume assumptions in lithium?
eric norris -- president, lithium
yes. so the volume -- good morning, alex, and thanks for your words. the volumes that we have guided to are 20% to 30% above last year's numbers of about 88,000. that's described to you in the chart on page 11.
we had already contemplated in our guidance that some form of wodgina 1 would be used to support that volume growth. wodgina 2 coming on is to follow the strategy that can't indicate of having an excess of resource capacity to conversion growth. and there's -- and we will look potentially, there could be some possible upside. if that goes smoothly, it won't come on until the second half of this year.
there's some possibilities to toll or sell that as we indicated during our prepared remarks. so that would be certainly in excess to the 20%, 30% the range, which is our internal production.
alex yefremov -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
ok, understood. and the second question on pricing. i mean, you indicated three to six months lag effect for half of your battery grade revenues. so if we take second quarter, for example, your expectation for second quarter pricing, and then we assume that these indices kind of stay flat where they are today.
does that imply that third quarter price and perhaps fourth quarter price go up sequentially? would that be right logic given these lags?
eric norris -- president, lithium
if -- yes. given the lags, we only can see out of, as kent said, out three months because of the nature of these lags. but if market prices stay where they are, yes, there's upside. very clear, there's upside.
and i think we said in our guidance that, that have to be a material decline in market prices. and what we've seen in the past couple of weeks in china does not represent a material decline. so there has to be a much more significant decline before that would have a downward impact on our guidance.
great. thanks a lot.
operator
our next question comes from matthew deyoe from bank of america. please go ahead, matthew.
matthew deyoe -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
good morning, everyone. so questions on minres marbl joint venture. like one, have they paid you for the 10% stake yet? two, who controls the decision to run wodgina and at what pace? is that minres? is that you? is that a joint decision? and then you move to 50-50, is that going to establish after-tax accounting for that business as well?
jerry masters -- chairman, president, and chief executive officer
so i may try and take that. so they've not paid us for anything and it's a concept, and we're negotiating that at the moment. so we're operating at a 60-40 structure that we had previously. so we're under discussions, and i would say, negotiations around expanding that jv, which -- and that expansion would move it to be 50-50 at wodgina.
but that's -- we've got to conclude all of that, and none of that will change until we conclude the discussions and get the final documents. so the accounting, scott, i'll leave that to you.
scott tozier -- chief financial officer
yes. so on the accounting, some of this depends on how those negotiate. so with a 50-50 joint venture, there's some complex accounting rules around control that we'll have to go through and evaluate that once those agreements are there. so there's two potential options there.
one is that it is a consolidated joint venture on our books with minority, similar to what we do with jbc. or with no control, and it will just run through equity income, which would then create that tax impact that you asked about. so more to come on that. it all depends on how the negotiations and the final contract comes out.
matthew deyoe -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
all right. that's helpful. and then what are you -- what are the assumptions for second half 2020 to spodumene internal transfers, if i were looking at sizing that impact, is it still $17.70, or have you moved that up?
scott tozier -- chief financial officer
no. no. that's moved up. it's almost doubled.
it's almost doubled from that. so i think it's -- eric. level. yes.
yes, or will double, right?
eric norris -- president, lithium
it's based on a formula with we've agreed to the jv as agreed to with the authorities in australia for tax and royalty purposes. and then it's based upon a lagging basis of how spodumene prices in the market, several different indices have fared. so based on that, what you see with spodumene prices rising with -- certainly, with the salt prices as well that we talked about earlier, that average price is probably going to be on the order of double where it's been.
matthew deyoe -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
yeah. understood. ok. thank you.
operator
our next question comes from christopher parkinson from mizuho. please go ahead, christopher.
harris fein -- mizuho securities -- analyst
this is harris fein on for chris. thanks for taking my question. so your competitors have been discussing that there has been a noticeable step change in your customers' willingness to enter into contracts and more of an acknowledgment that the world will be short lithium in the coming years. so i was wondering if you could give your perspective on that based on what you're seeing.
and i know it's early, but how -- what that implies for the setup for 2023 pricing? is it reasonable to expect that you would be able to maintain these levels?
eric norris -- president, lithium
so, harris, this is eric. i'll start and maybe others will add. so the market -- there is certainly a very big concern about security of supply. with the rapid commit -- with the significant commitment that automotive manufacturers are making toward evs and the excitement that, that brings with it.
there's a concern as well that the -- whether the industry can spool up quickly enough to meet that demand. and in one regard, that might be why the spot prices are so high. it's just a fundamental concern in that regard. and that's leading to long-term partnership discussions.
and fortunately, that falls squarely in the strategy we've had for years now, which is picking the right partners, partnering with them long term, leveraging our world-class resources and our ability to execute well to give them comfort that we're the right partner for them to ease that concern around security of supply. price is, as we've discussed at length in this call, is a function of what happens with the market indices for a large measure of our revenue. currently, 50% of our battery bid revenues are going to be impacted by that. it is -- and that's going to be what the market does.
so there will be structures we take on with these sorts of partners that, as kent earlier said, will probably be index-based and have some coloring on either side of them. and the long-term commitment from these customers to buy and for us to supply. where that price is, is going to be a function of the market. so hard to call that right now.
harris fein -- mizuho securities -- analyst
got it. and piggybacking off that, in the past, we've been looking at sort of a 40% long-term ebitda margin bogey for lithium. and 1q looks like a little bit of an anomaly. but given the current price setup that you're seeing, is there any meaningful change to your long-term normalized margin outlook? it's a bit higher in 2022.
and if you could also talk about helping us come up with the framework for quantifying how start-up costs are going to play into that over the next few years, that would be really helpful.
scott tozier -- chief financial officer
yes. so i would say that our long-term view, as we laid out last year in our investor day was in the mid-40s for the lithium business at mid-cycle pricing, so through the cycle. and i would say that our view really hasn't changed at this point in time. we'll continue to evaluate that and adjust as we need to as we better understand the long-term pricing outlooks.
of course, as you mentioned, our plant start-ups do have an impact on that. it's bigger today because we're doubling our capacity versus, as you go forward in time, the next increment is going to be a smaller and smaller percentage and eventually just be part of -- just part of our normal operating activities.
operator
our next question comes from arun viswanathan from rbc capital markets. please go ahead.
arun viswanathan -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
i mean, first off, i guess, just wanted to go back to the pricing discussion. so we have had some majors announce some new capacity announcements, i think an fang and some others, as you know. and that would kind of potentially signal some confidence that we are in a new price regime. you've also taken up your guidance for the full year.
i'm just curious what you think the new level of, say, peak to trough pricing in lithium is as you move into '23. i mean do you think you can build off of this base that you're at right now?
jerry masters -- chairman, president, and chief executive officer
so we're not going to call lithium pricing going forward. so i mean what we've done is we've structured our contracts so we move with the market, and we've given ourselves a little bit of stability. that's been part of our plan for some time, and it gives our customers visibility of what the price is relative to the market. i mean they have the same visibility going forward as we do and as you do.
so it's difficult for us to say where it goes in '23. we think the market is tight. when we look at the demand from evs and demand on lithium and what we see is capacity coming on, the market is tight for years. so for at least through our planning period, which i would call it five years.
so we see it being pretty tight. now there will be periods where there's a little -- there's some oversupply, but the growth in the market, it catches up very quickly. so we think the market is tight, but we're not going to call lithium prices for '23.
arun viswanathan -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
understood. and then i guess, we haven't really asked about bromine yet, so maybe i'll just ask quickly there. maybe you can just provide a couple more details on your thoughts there. do you expect continued price upward momentum there? and what's the outlook, i guess, from a demand standpoint.
netha johnson -- president, bromine specialties
yeah, arun. in terms of pricing, i think we should see pretty stable pricing. we're pretty fortunate that the applications and digitalization, electrification continue to grow. and that those applications are growing slightly faster than supply can come on to the market.
so similar to what we saw in our investor day last fall, we expect this market to be fundamentally undersupplied for the next five years of our planning period. so -- and we're adding capacity. so we expect the pricing to stay relatively strong for the foreseeable future.
arun viswanathan -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
thanks.

next question is from ben kallo from baird. please go ahead.
ben kallo -- robert w. baird and company -- analyst
hey. good morning, all. just two questions. first, hydroxide versus carbonate and how do you decide on where to make the investment on the two? and then political risk, just as you invest in countries, there was a headline out yesterday about mexico nationalizing their lithium resource.
but as you look to argentina and making that investment in chile, we get a lot of questions about that. so how do you think about that going forward? thanks.
eric norris -- president, lithium
ben, this is eric. i can take the hydroxide and myself or kent can address the geopolitical risk one. so first on hydroxide versus carbonate. the prior question was about the trend toward long-term partnerships and security of supply.
we -- one of the benefits of the customer partnership approach is to leverage that -- their commitment to us in making commitment firmly to the product form that they wish it. there's also -- and this does relate to the geopolitical risk side of things in that there's also a discussion around where they want it and increasingly a concern and a desire to have localization of supply. so we leverage the commitments we're trying to get in these contracts of these customers to narrow down those two issues, the product risk and the regional risk for the two. as an added comment, we currently are seeing that maybe carbonated or lfp chemistries are about maybe 20%, 25% of the market.
that's our current view. we continue to monitor that carefully. kent, do you want to comment just on how we think about risk?
jerry masters -- chairman, president, and chief executive officer
yes. i mean i would say, i mean -- important for us given the locations where -- and we look at it kind of at a macro level and by country. so -- and we look at it for particularly kind of we get deeper and deeper as we make a new investment, but we monitor that. so a lot happening in chile, as you know.
we talked about on these calls before. argentina, as we make investments there, we'll have to make sure that we're looking at those risks and monitoring that. australia, less of an issue. china, another area that we have to focus on and make sure we have our risk assessment, but we monitor those.
we try and combine it with government -- active government relations on making sure that we're doing the right thing in the country. so we're seeing as a good actor and that we're bringing value to them as well that others can't necessarily brings. and that's a big part of how we feel it we mitigate the risk in some of those geographies.
ben kallo -- robert w. baird and company -- analyst

our next question is from colin rusch from oppenheimer. please go ahead, calum.
colin rusch -- oppenheimer and company -- analyst
good morning, guys. can you talk a little bit about the potential for incremental customer deposits or customer-funded capex? you guys are spending a ton of money to grow capacity. and i'm just wondering about some of the alternative strategies for financing then.
scott tozier -- chief financial officer
yes, colin, i think it's a good question. i think given the environment that we're in and the concern around supply from our customers, we're exploring all sorts of options, partnership type of options like eric talked about, prepayments, there's a variety of different things there. i think the key for us is to ensure that those types of agreements are giving us incremental return versus what we could do on our own. so clearly, our strong balance sheet, strong support from investors give us plenty of capacity to be able to do it on our own.
but if we can get incremental returns, we'll take a look at it.
colin rusch -- oppenheimer and company -- analyst
ok. and then just given the expertise that you guys have around cathode materials and formulation, i'm wondering about your willingness or interest in additional vertical integration. obviously, you don't want to compete with your customers, but it seems like you guys have enough expertise that you could do some real work in that space.
jerry masters -- chairman, president, and chief executive officer
is that a cathode question? or i'm just trying to make question.
colin rusch -- oppenheimer and company -- analyst
yeah. no, you. i'm wondering if your vertical integration there.
jerry masters -- chairman, president, and chief executive officer
yes. so i mean, look, we look at the different options, but we're from -- we look at it from a material standpoint. and our interest in batteries and cathodes is to make sure that we're producing and developing the right chemistries that go into our customers' processes. so we're not looking to be in the cathode business, but we're looking to be an excellent supplier to those cathode makers and the oems that have vested interest in the battery and the cathode technology.
eric norris -- president, lithium
yes. and i'll just expand. colin, part of doing that is being able to understand that application very well, but not integrate forward into it. and as i would also say, though, that as we look at other advanced forms of lithium, we'll look at the -- again, question exactly how we want to play in that.
it's still be a material player, but what material are we supplying? and so we're looking at -- as you look at solid-state chemistries, there's a variety of different ways we can play in that area. and we're doing a lot of work currently with partners and customers in that area to determine the future.
colin rusch -- oppenheimer and company -- analyst
that's [inaudible]. thanks, guys.

operator
hello, everyone, and thank you for joining the q1 2022 albemarle corporation earnings conference call. my name is darius, and i'll be moderating your call today. before handing over to host meredith bandy, [operator instructions] i now have the pleasure of handing you over to meredith bandy, vice president of investor relations and sustainability. please go ahead, meredith.
meredith bandy -- vice president of investor relations and sustainability
all right. thank you, and welcome, everyone, to albemarle's first quarter 2022 earnings conference call. our earnings were released after the close of market yesterday, and you'll find the press release and earnings presentation posted on our website under the investors section at albemarle.com. joining me on the call today are kent masters, our chief executive officer; scott tozier, chief financial officer; raphael crawford, president, catalyst; netha johnson, president, bromine; and eric norris, president, lithium.
as a reminder, some of the statements made during this call, including our outlook, guidance, expected company performance, and timing of the expansion projects may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws. please note the cautionary language about forward-looking statements contained in our press release and earnings presentation. that same language applies to this call. please also note that some of our comments today refer to non-gaap financial measures.
a reconciliation to gaap financial measures can be found in our earnings release and the appendix of our earnings presentation. and now i'll turn the call over to kent. 
jerry masters -- chairman, president, and chief executive officer
thanks, meredith, and thank you all for joining us today. on today's call, i will highlight our results and achievements during the recent quarter. scott will provide more details on our financial results, outlook, and balance sheet. i will then close our prepared remarks with an update on our growth projects and sustainability before opening the call for questions.
albemarle's leadership positions in lithium and bromine and our team's ability to execute have enabled us to generate increasingly strong results. in the first quarter, we generated net sales of $1.1 billion, up 44% compared to prior year. and that's excluding fine chemistry services in the comparison, which we sold in june of last year. this fundamental strength allowed us to more than double our ebitda year over year.
the supply/demand balance remains tight in the markets we serve. this has enabled us to significantly increase our 2022 outlook based on continued pricing strength in our lithium and bromine businesses. scott will dive into the key elements of that outlook later in today's presentation. in terms of operational highlights for the quarter, the restart of our wodgina lithium mine in our marbl joint venture is progressing well.
first, spodumene concentrate from train 1 is expected in may. we've agreed with our partners to accelerate the restart of train 2 with the first spodumene concentrate from that train lie. together, these two trains can feed conversion assets with annual capacity of around 70,000 tons of lithium hydroxide. now i'll turn the call over to scott to walk through our financials.
scott tozier -- chief financial officer
thanks, kent, and good morning, everyone. i'll begin on slide 5. during the quarter, we generated net sales of $1.1 billion, a year-over-year increase of 36%, including the fcs business, which we sold in june last year. this is due primarily to increased pricing as well as higher volumes driven by strong demand from diverse end markets, especially for our lithium and bromine businesses.
for the first quarter, net income attributable to albemarle was $253 million, up $158 million from the prior year because of the strong net sales, partially offset by inflationary cost pressures. this includes the impact of natural gas prices in europe on our catalyst business. adjusted diluted eps for the first quarter was $2.38. the primary adjustments to earnings were $0.07 add-back for a loss on property sales and a $0.19 add-back for tax-related items.
on slide 6, i'll walk you through our first quarter adjusted ebitda. for the first quarter, our adjusted ebitda was $432 million, up 107% year over year. the primary driver -- pricing, driven by the move to index referenced variable price contracts and higher market pricing. lithium also benefited from the sales of lower-cost inventories, including a onetime sale of spodumene stockpiled during the initial start-up of wodgina.
bromine was also favorable year over year, reflecting higher pricing driven by tight market conditions and a slight uptick in volumes. that was partially offset by raw material and freight inflation. catalyst was down relative to the prior year, primarily driven by higher raw material costs and lower volumes. that was partially offset by pricing.
and lastly, corporate expense and foreign exchange were mostly flat year over year. moving to slide 7. we have meaningfully increased our 2022 outlook primarily to reflect continued strength in our lithium business. i'll discuss our lithium outlook in greater detail in just a moment.
for the total company, we now expect 2022 net sales to be in the range of $5.2 billion to $5.6 billion, up about 60% to 70% versus prior year. adjusted ebitda is expected to be between $1.7 billion and $2 billion, reflecting a year-over-year improvement of 120% at the midpoint of the range. this implies a total company ebitda margin in the range of 33% to 36%. and together, this translates to updated 2022 adjusted diluted eps guidance in the range of $9.25 to $12.25, compared to $4.04 in 2021.
additionally, we are maintaining our capex guidance range of $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion as we drive our lithium investments forward to meet increased customer demand. you may have noticed that we widened the range of our outlook to prudently reflect greater volatility in pricing for sales, and inflation for cost of goods sold against the backdrop of a turbulent macro environment. and regarding the quarterly progression of sales and ebitda, on our last call, we indicated that we expected q1 to be our strongest quarter of the year, primarily due to higher pricing and sales of low-cost inventory. given the continued strong pricing and rising volumes, we now expect our second half results to be about 55% of the total year.
turning to the next slide for more detail on our lithium outlook. lithium's full year 2022 ebitda is expected to be up 200% to 225% year over year, up from our previous outlook for growth of around 75%. we now expect our average realized selling price to be about double last year. this is the result of our efforts to move toward index referenced variable price contracts and a significant increase in index prices.
we also have better line of sight to price in the full year. from the beginning of the year to today, indices are up between 85% and 125%. we're also assuming that our expected q2 selling price remains at that level for the rest of the year. if current market prices remain at historically strong levels for the balance of the year, there would be upside to this guidance.
there could also be additional upside if we transition additional existing contracts from fixed to variable pricing. however, if we see material declines from current market pricing or volume shortfalls, there would be downside to this guidance. there's no change to our lithium volume outlook for the year. we still expect year-over-year volume growth in the range of 20% to 30% as we bring on new conversion assets, particularly la negra 3 and 4 and kemerton 1.
for bromine, we are raising our full year 2022 ebitda expectations with a year-over-year improvement of 15% to 20%. this revised guidance reflects higher pricing related to strong fire safety demand, supported by macro trends such as digitalization and electrification. we also expect higher volumes following our successful expansion last year in jordan. for catalysts, 2022 ebitda is expected to be flat to down 65% year over year.
this is below our prior outlook due to significant cost pressures primarily related to natural gas in europe and certain raw materials and freight, partially offset by higher pricing. the large outlook range for catalyst reflects increased volatility and lack of visibility, particularly related to the war in ukraine. given the extraordinary circumstances and the resulting changes in oil and gas markets, the business is aggressively seeking to pass through higher natural gas pricing to its customers. as previously discussed, we continue to expect a strategic review of the catalyst business to be completed later this quarter.
the review is intended to maximize value and position the business for success while enabling us to focus on growth. i will now turn to slide 9 for a deeper dive on our lithium contracts and pricing. with the change in guidance, you can now see we have more exposure to changing market indices. our segmented approach gives more flexibility to customers while still allowing albemarle to preserve its upside and returns on our growth investments.
this slide reflects the expected split of our 2022 revenues updated for current pricing. battery-grade revenues are now expected to make up 70% to 80% of our 2022 revenues, of which 20% is expected to be from purchase orders on higher short-term pricing; about half are expected to be from contracts with variable pricing mechanisms, typically indexed reference with a three- to six-month lag; and the remaining 30% is from fixed-price contracts. these fixed contracts also have price opener mechanisms to change prices over time. we continue to work with these customers to transition to contracts with variable index reference pricing.
these negotiations are ongoing and progressing well. if we are successful, this could provide additional upside to our current outlook for the lithium business. following our last earnings call, we received a lot of questions regarding our expected lithium margins, so i wanted to provide some additional color on the moving pieces on slide 10. we expect lithium margins to improve in 2022 driven by higher pricing, partially offset by the progressive commissions we pay in chile under our corfo contract.
another item to consider is the impact from higher fixed costs related to the start-up and ramp of our new facilities such as the wodgina mine and our la negra and kemerton conversion assets as well as the potential acquisition of the qinzhou conversion plant. these plants are expected to more than double our lithium production. over time, the impact of fixed costs on margins will diminish as production ramps and costs are absorbed. as a reminder, albemarle calculates ebitda by including joint venture equity income on an after-tax basis.
this year, because of higher spodumene transfer pricing from our greenbushes mine, this tax impact is much more meaningful than it has been in the past. this is simply a result of the line item where the tax hits our income statement. albemarle remains fully integrated from resource to conversion. so effectively, we pay ourselves this higher spodumene pricing.
on a completely pre-tax basis, lithium ebitda margins are expected to be between 55% and 60% in 2022. slide 11 highlights our expected volume ramp as our new lithium conversion facilities are completed. last year, we converted 88,000 metric tons lce including conversion at silver peak and kings mountain, xinyu and chengdu in china, and la negra 1 and ii in chile. we are in the process of more than doubling conversion capacity with the expansions at la negra and kemerton, plus the acquisition of the qinzhou plant.
we typically expect it to take about two years to ramp to full capacity at a new plan, including roughly six months for customer qualification. tying all of this together, we expect to achieve 200,000 -- 2025. total lithium volumes are expected to be higher than that, including technical-grade spodumene sales of about 10,000 tons per year, tolling volumes of anywhere between zero and 20,000 tons per year, depending on market dynamics and the spodumene, plus any additional conversion capacity we buy or build during this period. finally, let's turn to slide 12 to look at our strong balance sheet and cash flow.
our 2022 revised operating cash flow guidance is $650 million at the midpoint. relative to 2021, you can see incremental cash flow driven by the higher net income, adding back higher depreciation. this is partially offset by higher working capital related to higher sales volumes and pricing, plus higher cost of raw materials and inventories. as a reminder, working capital typically averages about 25% of net sales.
our balance sheet is in great shape with $463 million of cash and liquidity of almost $2 billion. current net debt to adjusted ebitda is approximately 1.9 times. with rising ebitda from higher pricing and volumes, we expect leverage to remain at or below our target range of two to 2.5 times. our balance sheet supports the capex for our lithium investments to meet growing customer demand.
following our equity offering early last year, we repaid debt with the intention of relevering as needed to fund capital projects. we are actively evaluating options to do just that. we are planning to be in the debt market this quarter if market conditions are favorable. we remain committed to maintaining our investment-grade credit rating, and the debt markets provide a favorable avenue of acquiring additional capital.
with that, i'll turn it back to kent for an update on our projects on slide 13.

thanks, scott. first, let's look at a few of our expansions in asia pacific. albemarle was focused on expanding global lithium conversion capacity to leverage our low-cost resource base. the acquisition of the qinzhou conversion facility is now expected to close in the second half of this year as we continue to work through regulatory approvals.
we look forward to closing this transaction to bring an additional 25,000 tons of lithium to the market. the commissioning process at kemerton i is progressing well. we have introduced spodumene into the process, and we expect to achieve first product by the end of the month. kemerton 2 remains on track for mechanical completion later this year.
at our china greenfield expansions, we have broken ground at meishan to construct a 50,000 ton per year hydroxide conversion facility. there are also options to expand that facility. the second china greenfield project at zhangjiagang is currently in the engineering phase, and we are looking at options to produce either carbonate or hydroxide. importantly, with our ownership stakes at the wodgina and greenbushes lithium mines, we already have access to low-cost spodumene to feed these conversion facilities.
as i mentioned previously, the restart of the wodgina lithium mine by our jv partner, mineral resources, is going well. and we continue to negotiate agreements to expand and restructure the marbl joint venture, and we'll update the market when we have more information. we also have a 49% stake at greenbushes, one of the highest quality lithium resources in the world. the talison joint venture is ramping up cgp-2 and has approved construction of cgp-3.
and that's expected to begin later this year. in addition, construction of the tailings retreatment plant was completed during the quarter and commissioning is progressing to plan. our intention is to ramp lithium resources in advance of conversion assets. in which case, in the near term, we could be net long spodumene.
if so, we may elect to toll or sell spodumene. the expansions in australia and asia are just a portion of the globally diverse lithium projects we have defined to meet growing customer demand. we remain focused on growing our global conversion capacity to leverage our world-class resources in australia, chile, and the united states. our wave three projects should provide albemarle with approximately 200,000 tons of additional lithium conversion capacity, which is higher than the 150,000 tons that we originally planned.
additionally, we continue to progress our growth options for wave four, which is expected to bring an additional 75,000 to 125,000 tons of capacity. this includes continued evaluation of options to restart our kings mountain lithium mine and build conversion assets in north america and europe. our high degree of vertical integration, access to high-quality, low-cost resources, years of experience bringing conversion capacity online, and a strong balance sheet provide considerable advantages for the foreseeable future. looking now at slide 15.
as you can see, albemarle is executing a robust pipeline of projects all around the world. our bromine business is pursuing incremental expansions in jordan and the united states. these high-return projects leverage our low-cost resources and technical know-how to support customers in growing and diverse markets like electronics, telecom, and automotive. in chile, the salar yield improvement project is progressing and is expected to allow us to increase lithium production without increasing our brine pumping rates, utilizing a proprietary technology to improve recovery, efficiency, and sustainability.
we also have access to a lithium resource in argentina called antofalla. we anticipate restarting exploration at antofalla later this year after securing all necessary permits. in australia, we continue to progress study work on kemerton expansions to leverage greater scale and efficiency with repeatable designs. finally, in the united states, the expansion of our silver peak facility in nevada is on track to double lithium carbonate production.
this is the first of several options to expand u.s. production. in kings mountain, north carolina, we've begun a pre-feasibility study to evaluate restarting the mine. and then our bromine facility in magnolia, arkansas, we're evaluating process technologies to leverage our brines to extract lithium.
this robust pipeline, coupled with our industry knowledge and strong balance sheet provides significant growth opportunities for albemarle. moving on to our sustainability initiatives on slide 16. creating sustainable shareholder value requires our company to continue to drive progress on our own esg and sustainability efforts, and i'm proud of what we are achieving on that front. we will publish our 2021 corporate sustainability report on june 2nd.
in that report, you will see strong progress in our work toward hitting our target reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and freshwater usage, our initial scope 3 emissions assessment, and our first full life cycle assessments for lithium products. you will also see further definition of our sustainability-related targets, including diversity and inclusion. in addition to publishing our new sustainability report, we will host a webcast on june 28th, and i hope you will join to listen in. in that presentation, we will discuss next steps, including full cdp disclosure with tcfd goals and disclosures and third-party irma assessment at the salar at atacama.
as you can see, we have accomplished a great deal, and we are committed to continue that progress. so this concludes our prepared remarks. and now we will open the call for q&a.
