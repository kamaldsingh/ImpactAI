chris comparato -- chief executive officer
thanks, alice. welcome, everyone, to our first earnings call as a public company. i am chris comparato, ceo of toast. i'm excited to be with you today to share my thoughts on our company, our opportunity, and our q3 performance. given that it's our very first earnings call, i'd like to start by zooming out a bit and providing you an overview of our business, the restaurant industry, and our opportunity.
toast provides restaurants with an all-in-one technology platform that combines point of sale, front of house, back of house, and guest-facing technology integrated with financial technology and payments all built with the restaurant's success in mind. toast works for all restaurants regardless of size, concept, or cuisine; from independent cafes to enterprise brands. at toast, our mission is to empower the restaurant community to delight their guests, do what they love, and thrive. when we say restaurant community, we mean every stakeholder; from the guest to the gm or owner, to the waitstaff, to the chef, to the suppliers, and the entire ecosystem.
together, we believe we can delight guests with fast and seamless service; make employees happier with higher wages, tips, and a better work experience; and help restaurants be more successful with increased sales, deeper customer relationships, and lower employee turnover. our success is tied to our customer's success, and working with them to be better together, underpins everything that we do. at no time was that commitment tested more than during the onset of the covid-19 pandemic. we responded by accelerating certain product releases, which empowered restaurants to provide a contactless dining experience, fulfill online takeout and delivery orders, and communicate with their customers as we all navigated constantly changing public health business and consumer pressures. in addition, we supported grassroots campaigns and lobbied congress directly on behalf of restaurants.
we are proud to see that these efforts have resulted in overall same-store sales of toast customers, exceeding pre-covid levels, and continuing to improve. market research suggests that there are approximately 860,000 restaurants in the u.s. alone. collectively, the industry is one of the largest employers, providing jobs to more than 11 million people and generating nearly $700 billion of sales each year, around 3% of the u.s. gpv.
yet, it has one of the lowest levels of tech spend as a %age of sales of any sector. if you've worked in a restaurant, you know it's a complex business with a lot of moving parts. they operate with low margins, high employee turnover, highly perishable products, and complex regulations. yet, many restaurants continue to run on legacy systems, pen and paper, or disconnected horizontal and point solutions; each with their own costs and barriers to scalability. so, we believe there is a massive opportunity for us to support this industry as it grows and evolves, and as its tech spend closes the gap with that of other sectors. we're conservatively estimating our current serviceable addressable market or sam at approximately $15 billion.
we see an approximately $55 billion total addressable market or tam in the u.s. for restaurant technology spend by 2024. this tam at least doubles if we look globally. as we continue to grow and add more products to our portfolio, we believe we have the right strategy to go after this massive opportunity. this strategy starts with our relentless focus on product innovation, our powerful platform integrates software with our payment processing system supporting over 15 products.
because our platform is all in one, covering every aspect of a restaurant's operation, toast restaurants are empowered to use that data to unlock new insights and further optimize their businesses, which has led to higher sales and margins, more seamless operations, and lower employee turnover. our customers provide us tremendous insight into our product roadmap. a major example of this is our recent acquisition of xtrachef in june. we heard from customers how challenging it has been to manage their supply chain, especially during the last year and a half. in a survey, over half of our customer community told us that high operating costs and food costs were a top challenge.
by simply snapping photos of supplier invoices, coding, and categorizing, our customers will have access to digitized line-item details that are accurate and available to their team from anywhere and can unlock insights into purchasing behavior, supplier optimization, financial performance, and ultimately savings. our unique go-to-market strategy serves as a competitive differentiator for us. knowing that the restaurant market is hyperlocal, we've invested in a sales force and a customer success team of localized, field-based industry experts trusted by these local communities. our employees live in these communities and dine in these restaurants night in and night out and are true partners to our customers. when we create raving fans, they spread the word throughout our region.
this is why approximately two-thirds of our new locations come from inbound channels and one-fifth from customer or partner referrals. this creates further efficiency in our go-to-market motion, and our sales productivity typically increases as our positive reputation spreads within a local restaurant community. our ongoing expansion is supported by our customer success team, who brings vast technical and industry knowledge to the restaurants we work with quickly accessible through a single point of contact, 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year; critical to avoiding downtime in an industry that is always on and does so much of their business on weekends and holidays. we also have a robust ecosystem of over 150 suppliers tech and local partners. these relationships enable us to deliver more value to customers while providing significant visibility into customer adaption. this data can lead to valuable insights into selectively pursuing m&a opportunities, which was the case in our acquisition of straex for payroll management and xtrachef for invoice and accounts payable solutions.
now, i'd like to go into the details for the quarter. in q3, we delivered strong results across the board. we grew revenue 105% year over year to 486 million, an annual recurring run rate or arr growth, 77% year over year to 544 million. this was driven by strong gross payment volume or gpv growth of 123% year over year, landing at 16.5 billion, and strong customer adaption of our products. as of q3, 56% of our toast locations used four or more products on top of our integrated pos and payments solution, compared to 44% a year ago. we continue to see a consistent trend of guests returning to restaurants, as well as off-premise trends such as online ordering, delivery, and takeout sustain, which demonstrates that these consumer behaviors are here to here to stay for the long term. let me now share with you some customer wins in the quarter.
we signed a new deal with fat tuesday, a national chain known for its frozen drinks. fat tuesday is rolling out toast at 40 locations nationwide and will build its entire technology stack on toast; starting with our point of sale, order & pay at the table, kitchen display screens, and multi-location management products. organic juice bar, clean juice, has franchise locations in 28 states and is making ordering, payments, and delivery more seamless with toast. in q3, clean juice expanded with toast, renewing its agreement for 121 locations, and adding a commitment to bring toast to 15 that new locations.
clean juice uses toast point of sale, toast go devices, toast flex terminals, toast kitchen display systems, and kiosks, along with our gift card software, multichannel location management, and api ecosystem integrations. we also expanded our relationship with eggs up grill, a rapidly growing breakfast, brunch, and lunch brand. eggs up grill currently uses toast point of sale, toast flexes, toast go devices, and toast printers. this quarter, they signed an agreement to expand toast to an additional 30 locations. with new revenue channels developed during the pandemic, eggs up grill saw a 13% increase in 2021 sales compared to 2019, and 60% ahead of 2020.
next week, on november 16, we'll host spark, our inaugural restaurant innovation event. at spark, we will share major new product releases and provide a sneak peek into our innovation roadmap. the name for our event is a reference to the spark that lights a stove or an oven to make the magic of a restaurant happen. it also alludes to the spark of imagination that leads to innovation and transformative change. this all-virtual, two-hour event will consist of keynotes, product updates, and guest speakers, including world-renowned chef, restaurateur humanitarian, and toast's customer, jose andres.
you'll hear about how we're moving the restaurant industry forward with innovative new products that empower the restaurant, the guest, and employees. if you'd like more information on attending the event, please contact our investor relations team at ir@toasttab.com or visit our website for more information and to sign up. as part of our continued efforts to support the restaurant community, we recently signed a public letter from the independent restaurant coalition advocating for replenishment of the restaurant revitalization fund. we've also joined the pledge 1% movement to donate our capital to fund social impact programs through our philanthropic group, toast.org. before i turn the call over to elena to walk you through the financials, i wanted to thank our employees, our customers, our partners, and our shareholders for their support in helping us achieve a major milestone in becoming a public company. restaurants are resilient, and they make up the social fabric of our community.
and we believe our commitment to aligning our success with the success of the restaurant community will lead to a stronger and exciting future ahead. now, i'd like to hand it over to our cfo, elena gomez.
elena gomez -- chief financial officer
thanks, chris. before i begin, i want to take a moment to recognize the entire toast team on their efforts to become a public company. and a special callout to my own toast finance team. it's because of the collective efforts of this team that we are where we are today.
i also want to thank our existing and new shareholders. we are excited to be on this journey with you as a public company. while we are proud of this milestone, we are just getting started. as chris mentioned, we believe we have a total addressable market of 55 billion in the u.s., and we estimate the global tam to be twice as large. as a leader in one of the world's largest industries, we've built a unique business model to address this opportunity and support rapid growth at scale. before i go into the results of the quarter, let me share with you why we have a powerful business model.
first, we have proven we can achieve high growth at scale. second, we have an integrated software and payments model. thus, we benefit from not only the predictability of saas but also from the increase in transaction volumes as our customers grow. third, our all-in-one platform combined with our boots-on-the-ground, go-to-market strategy keeps our customers happy and drives strong retention. finally, as our customers continue to expand with us, we've been able to maintain strong unit economics.
now, let me walk you through how we generate revenue. we generate revenue in four ways: subscription services, financial technology solutions, hardware, and professional services. we consider subscription services and financial technology solutions as our recurring revenue streams. subscription services revenue is generated from our saas products such as digital ordering, delivery, and team management to name a few.
financial technology solutions revenue is generated primarily from facilitating payment transactions and also includes fees earned for loans we offer through our toast capital program. we recognize our financial technology solutions revenue on a gross basis. we consider other two revenue streams, hardware and professional services revenue, as one time and effectively part of our customer acquisition costs. we price them competitively to minimize barriers to entry. since the majority of our revenue comes from financial technology solutions, we believe annual recurring run rate or arr, which excludes transaction-based costs is the operational metric that best reflects the scale and growth of our business.
you can find the full definition of arr in our earnings press release and our form 10-q for the third quarter. the key drivers of arr include growth of restaurant locations on our platform, the adaption of our saas products, and the total gpv processed. before i turn to the results for the quarter, please note again we will refer to both gaap and non-gaap financial measures. please refer to today's press release for the reconciliation of gaap to non-gaap financial performance and additional disclosures regarding these measures.
i'll now turn to the results for the third quarter. we delivered strong performance in the first quarter as a public company. in q3, we continue to see growth from both new locations, as well as an increase in gpv on our platform as a restaurant the industry continues to recover. additionally, customers continue to adapt more toast products. as a result, in q3, we delivered revenue of 486 million, up 105% year over year; and arr of 544 million, up 77% year over year.
our subscription services grew 67% year over year to 46 million in the third quarter, driven by the increase in customers adapting more of our saas products. in q3, 56% of our toast locations use four or more products on top of integrated pos and payment solutions as compared to 44% a year ago. our financial technology solutions revenue grew 115% year over year to 404 million in the third quarter, driven by our strong gpv of 16.5 billion in q3, up 123% year over year. we anticipate our financial technology solutions revenue to normalize as gpv per location returns to normal patterns. for the third quarter, non-gaap gross profit, which excludes stock-based compensation expense came in at 89 million, up 75% year over year, driven by growth in our customer base and higher revenue per location, driven by an increase in saas arpu and elevated gpv.
as we shared with you previously, our freight costs are elevated in q3 due to supply chain dynamics. while they're not as high as anticipated, we do believe they will remain elevated through the near term. despite increased costs, we continue to be very confident in our ability to deliver hardware for our customers. now, let's turn to our operating expenses, which i will review on an adjusted non-gaap basis, which excludes stock-based compensation expense for each line item. before i do, i do want to remind you that we use customer acquisition cost and payback metrics to measure the performance of our business and guide our investment decisions. with this in mind, in q3, we continue to invest in sales and market -- sales and marketing and research and development to capture our tam and build out our platform.
general and administrative expenses were elevated due -- to our transition to a public company and rebuilding the foundation to scale our business. adjusted ebitda for the third quarter was negative 10 million compared to roughly breakeven a year ago. in q3, we had free cash flow negative of 21 million compared to roughly breakeven a year ago, and positive 53 million in q2. our q2 free cash flow result was primarily impacted by a one-time benefit related to interchange billing terms. now, let me turn to guidance.
for the fourth quarter, we expect revenue to be in the range of 465 million to 495 million, which represents 98% growth at the midpoint. we expect adjusted ebitda to be in the range of negative 50 million to negative 40 million. for the full year 2021, we expect revenue to be in the range of 1.655 million to 1.685 million, which represents 103% year-over-year growth at the midpoint, and adjusted ebitda to be in the range of negative 46 million to negative 36 million. while i'm not providing 2022 guidance, i want to remind you that financial technology solutions revenue is benefiting from elevated gpv per location, which we anticipate will normalize as we exit 2021 into 2022. in closing, our strong q3 performance demonstrates our success and continued to execute and capture market share as the industry continues rapid digital transformation. built to serve a large and growing addressable market, we've shown we can execute at scale with healthy unit economics.
with this foundation in place, we believe we are uniquely positioned to drive durable growth for ourselves and for the restaurants using our platform. now, i'd like to turn the call back over to the moderator for our q&a session.
alice lopatto
right. thanks, chris and elena. we'll go ahead and start our q&a session. our first question comes from will nance of goldman sachs. will, please go ahead.
will nance -- goldman sachs -- analyst
hi, everyone. good afternoon and congrats on a strong quarter. you highlighted the strength in the same-store sales at toast customers and, you know, i think you also called out the potential for volume per live location to normalize over the course of 2022. can you maybe just expand a bit on kind of what you're seeing on a per location, and how elevated are we relative to trend? and then, if i think about some of the things going on today, you know, maybe a little bit higher inflation, and just the fact that your customers, relative to the -- you know, prior to pandemic, are using so much more technology, you call that the higher attach rates.
you know, is there a potential that we could run rate at a higher level of sales per live location on the other side, just given the investments that your client base has in the technology? 
elena gomez -- chief financial officer
yeah, it's a fair question. let me try to characterize that. so, we're definitely seeing elevated gpv per location, but as we continue to go into the deeper part of the tam, we also expect that to get closer to the average. so, i would just consider that as you think about your long-term modeling.
will nance -- goldman sachs -- analyst
that's helpful. and then maybe just on the attached rate that you're saying, you know, the nice momentum and increased adaption of these four more products. i mean, can you talk about, you know, where you think the biggest opportunity is from your existing product lineup is? what's kind of resonating the most in the market?
elena gomez -- chief financial officer
yeah, no, definitely. i mean, i think, obviously, our toast go devices and our digital products are clearly things that we're encouraged by, but we're also really encouraged by the adaption of our payroll product. and we're seeing a significant amount of our new restaurant openings attached as we continue. and so, we're continuing to see that from a lot of, like i said, our new customers, and equally starting to see a little bit of that even from our existing customer base. so, one thing i talk about often is for our total arpu, and you can see that -- you know, i use an example just to give you perspective of what's possible.
we have a customer, a donut shop, that can do in our platform 23k of arpu. so, just kind of speaks to, you know, what's possible with arpu. 
will nance -- goldman sachs -- analyst
got it. super helpful. appreciate you taking on my questions, and congrats again on the first quarter at the gate.
elena gomez -- chief financial officer
thanks.
alice lopatto
our next question comes from josh baer of morgan stanley. josh, please go ahead.
josh baer -- morgan stanley -- analyst
great. thanks for the question. i wanted to ask about tam and the opportunity ahead from a couple of different angles. so, one, within the u.s., like where specifically are you investing and focusing on? is there a greenfield in the u.s?
chris comparato -- chief executive officer
thanks for the question, josh. i mean, listen, in the u.s., as of the end of q2, we were only 6% market penetration for the tam in the u.s. so, we see a broad-based opportunity to go after the majority of tam. you know, if you serve 860,000 restaurants, we believe at least two-thirds of that are accessible to toast today, both in smb and mid-market, and i'd say, the lower end of enterprise. so, we think there's a very long runway for tam adaption and location acquisition, and we've seen broad-based momentum across the u.s.
there's no specific geographic differences. we've just been penetrating multiple markets in parallel.
josh baer -- morgan stanley -- analyst
great. and then on the maybe lower end of enterprise or upmarket, are there products or features that are needed to more fully address that? i don't know if fast food or just upmarket enterprise, like how should investors think about that opportunity within your tam? thank you.
chris comparato -- chief executive officer
sure. we continue to innovate on the platform. for example, on multi-location management, the ability to manage menus and pricing across locations, the ability to publish across multiple locations. so, those innovations are organic and continue.
i would say the other area i would point you to is our strong partner ecosystem. it's super important to have strong apis and an ecosystem of partners that you can cultivate so that you can offer to an enterprise brand a best-of-breed architecture. so, i'd say those are the two areas that jump out at us in terms of levels of investment and what we need to do to support larger customers.
josh baer -- morgan stanley -- analyst
thanks, chris. congrats.
chris comparato -- chief executive officer
thanks.
alice lopatto
right. our next question comes from josh beck of keybanc. josh, are you there?
josh beck -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
yes, i am. can you hear me?
chris comparato -- chief executive officer
we can.
alice lopatto
yes, we can.
elena gomez -- chief financial officer
we can hear you, yes.
josh beck -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
excellent. well, i thank your team for the question here. i wanted to go back to xtrachef. obviously, the supply chain has, you know, unfortunately really been rattled and a lot of different ways in the last year and a half.
and certainly, you know, it's been felt in the restaurant industry. so, maybe just help us understand where you are with that acquisition, what type of strategic discussions it's enabling, and really where you'd like to take that in the next few years?
chris comparato -- chief executive officer
sure. great question, josh. our progress with xtrachef is going extremely well. the integration process has gone well.
the team is continuing to execute well in terms of performance, and we're investing pretty heavily in backing innovation in and around what i would call accounts payable automation, as well as food cost optimization. we think there's a unique opportunity to automate even more of the back office. if you think about monetizing things like bill pay and other activities on the back end of restaurants that are critical to their success to interface with suppliers, but then also optimize their costs and optimize their inventory. you know, running a restaurant is really difficult. and if you think about razor-thin margins and the focus on operational efficiency, we think xtrachef really is that the cornerstone of back-office automation. so, we're super excited about investing in that roadmap.
but, you know, first steps first, we need to make sure that we execute the integration well and continue to gain adaption, and you'll see more of that in 2022, and i'll talk a little bit about this next week at spark. 
josh beck -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
fantastic. and maybe just a follow-up question around the sales and marketing efficiency. obviously, you are starting to rightfully invest in this opportunity. we can look at some external metrics like incremental revenue, recurring revenue per sales, and marketing dollars.
and all these metrics look very healthy. so, maybe just provide us some qualitative context with the efficiency, how that's trending, and where you'd like to see that ahead of the future?
elena gomez -- chief financial officer
yeah, i'm glad you asked a question, josh. we are relentless in our focus on payback periods and just our efficiency overall, and we continue to see customers adapting in a soft directed mode as an example. so, there's many ways that we can continue to monitor efficiency. so, i would say i feel very confident with what our payback periods are today, and we'll continue to monitor them over the next, you know, several quarters ongoing.
josh beck -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
very helpful. thank you.
alice lopatto
right. our next question comes from stephen sheldon of william blair.
stephen sheldon -- william blair -- analyst
hi, chris. hi, elena. thanks for taking my questions.
chris comparato -- chief executive officer
hi, stephen.
stephen sheldon -- william blair -- analyst
i wanted to ask about the labor shortages and the hiring challenges that are facing the restaurant. and i guess it's kind of two-part or -- one, is it influence the urgency of restaurants to sign up for your platform or increased demand for the uptake of specific modules like handhelds and order & pay at the table? and then two, has the issue changed any priorities from a product development standpoint to bring to market solutions that could help the restaurant, you know, especially if there's going to be a persistent issue? i know maybe we need a way for spark for that but just thought i'd ask.
chris comparato -- chief executive officer
yeah, i'll take it. great question, stephen. so, yeah, your premises is dead on. you know, restaurants are being forced to adapt and derive as much operational efficiency as they can with minimal staff. and, you know, much of our product around team management and handhelds allows them to sort of adapt and engage their employees and allow them to offer a better service to consumers.
so, if you think about order & pay at the table and toast go devices, for example, that allows the staff to be that much more efficient to handle not just existing guests but even increase the number of tables within the restaurant that they can serve. we've seen examples of restaurants that have increased their tables while maintaining or lowering their staff but becoming as efficient as they were in the past. so, we think order & pay at the table and digit -- what we call digital dining, as well as the toast go device, allowing you to build new service models within the restaurant itself are critically important. and restaurants recognize that and they recognize that these innovations really benefit them and create better employee engagement, as well as better consumer experiences to be honest with you. so, i think that's going to continue to hold true even past the covid pandemic. as far as where we're investing, you know, we're investing i'd say broadly across many of these tools.
if you look at sort of the digital dining experience, we're continuing to invest heavily in scan and pay at the table,  order & pay at the table. we're continuing to make sure that it works in conjunction with the toast go device. so, if the consumers and the waitstaff need to complement each other, there's this continued service model where it's not one or the other but it's both. that way a waitstaff can manage many more tables but consumers can also have the delightful experience of order & pay at the table. but then we're also broadly investing in other areas of team management in and around payroll. for example, the ability to manage tips.
so, tune in next week and you'll hear a little bit more about some of these products. but i'd say it's broad-based investments across the board.
stephen sheldon -- william blair -- analyst
great. thank you. congrats.
alice lopatto
our next question comes from brent bracelin of piper sandler. please go ahead.
brent bracelin -- piper sandler -- analyst
thanks for taking the question here. i want to build on the narrative of the talent shortage in the restaurant industry. anecdotally, we're seeing and using the digital dining options that you guys are enabling here more often. what is the penetration rate? what's the adaption? as you look at the broader customer base, do or half of the customers now kind of empowering a naval of digital kind of ordering at the table, or is there a broader opportunity across all those? just give us the starting point kind of where we're at today, and then the potential to help some of those smaller restaurants address these issues. and one quick follow-up for elena. 
chris comparato -- chief executive officer
yeah, brent, great question. i think we're in the early days of this adaption. i mean, we're talking about new service models within the restaurant itself. so, you see employees adapting to these new service models, but then you also see in parallel consumers adapting to how to use these products and consumers starting to get used to it. so, i'd say we're in the early days of adaption.
but i think we're super excited about the growth ahead because then the methodology within the restaurant starts to change and the restaurants that are really embracing these technologies are doing much better than non-toast restaurants that aren't adapting a similar set of technology. so, we're seeing the proof points, but i'd argue much of the runway is ahead of us, and much of that opportunity is ahead of us.
brent bracelin -- piper sandler -- analyst
helpful color there. and then, elena, as we just think about the subscription services revenue, it looks like growth accelerated year over year slightly versus kind of the year growth last quarter. is that just driven by lands with new customers that are taking more products and modules? is that driven by cross-selling? what kind of drove some of the strength in subscription services growth this quarter?
elena gomez -- chief financial officer
yeah, it's all the above. i think the metric i'd point you to, brent, is the percentage of customers with more than four modules. you see that steady increase over time, and we're really encouraged by that. and when you look at initial implementation, we still have most customers adapting more than four products at one time.
and so, at initial launch, so i think all of that is really driving that sas revenue. it's multiple dimensions. 
brent bracelin -- piper sandler -- analyst
at a higher cross lands and expands. thank you.
elena gomez -- chief financial officer
yep.
alice lopatto
our next question comes from dj hynes of canaccord. please go ahead.
dj hynes -- canaccord genuity -- analyst
hey, chris and elena, congrats on a good start here. chris, i want to ask -- look, i think some of the drivers for new restaurants to onboard toast during the pandemic were a little bit unique, right? you got things like online ordering and curbside pickup, and delivery all became really important. i'm wondering if you're seeing any change or maybe normalization, the drivers of new customer acquisition today? and maybe could touch on some of the cohort dynamics of that covid group, you know, expansion, growth, that sort of thing would be helpful.
chris comparato -- chief executive officer
you know, the first thing, dj, is we -- i mean, we've seen broad momentum. if you zoom out, we've seen broad momentum of growth of our platform within restaurants in and outside of covid, right? and i think there's three things that really drive restaurants to leverage our platform. number one, the depth and breadth of the platform and the restaurant specificity to the functions and features that the restaurants need to operate. so, we feel like we've got the broadest and deepest restaurant-specific platform in the market. number two, you know, we're obsessed with customers' happiness and building trust on the platform.
and that starts in the go-to-market motion and carries through all the elements of toast downstream. so making sure that restaurants have a great experience when they use our platform is critically important. and then number three, it's really the engine of innovation. i mean, we've been innovating on this platform for nine years. i mean, we launched integrated online ordering back in 2014.
so, many of the products that restaurants are adopting were pre-covid products that are now built into the platform, simple and easy to use, and we're expanding upon those products. but then also looking for other control points that make the lives of restaurants difficult. and what can we do to collapse those control points into this unified operating system to make their life easier? so, i'd argue that restaurants are starting to see the benefits of this type of platform to their future. and, you know, toast restaurants are proving that they can perform and perform quite well. they've been incredibly resilient and we're proud of that. so --
dj hynes -- canaccord genuity -- analyst
yeah, super helpful color. and maybe just a follow-up for elena. you had a comment on your prepared remarks around, you know, confidence to procure hardware to serve your customers. i just want to double check there and make sure that, you know, we're not going to have any supply chain issues sneak up on us, and -- that you'll have what you need to kind of onboard all your new customers in q4 and, i guess, into next year.
elena gomez -- chief financial officer
yeah, no, i feel actually confident in this, dj. as you know, during covid, obviously, that was a real battlefield tested in terms of supply chain and we felt it was really important to make sure we did not disrupt our customer's onboarding and making sure they had what they needed to get going. and so, it's no different now. i think we're paying attention, of course, to the elevated freight costs and being thoughtful about that. but we're confident we are focused on not disrupting our customers and not disrupting our growth rate either as a result of supply chain issues.
dj hynes -- canaccord genuity -- analyst
yeah, good stuff. thanks, guys.
alice lopatto
thank you. our next question comes from tien-tsin huang of jpmorgan. please go ahead.
tien-tsin huang -- jpmorgan chase and company -- analyst
hi. thanks. congrats on the listing and the great results at the gate here. just on the supply chain stuff, i want to make sure on the hardware side if there's anything surprising there? do you have a good read on what's happening there? looks like hardware came in quite strong in the quarter.
i'm assuming that's more tied to new locations versus refreshes?  just curious what trend you're seeing on the hardware side.
elena gomez -- chief financial officer
yeah, no, it's definitely tied to new locations. and we feel really good like i mentioned with dj about our confidence and making sure we get the hardware in the customer's hands that need it. and we've been able to prove -- navigate that fairly well. i'm actually proud of our hardware team for navigating so well during the pandemic.
tien-tsin huang -- jpmorgan chase and company -- analyst
good. the -- and just to zoom in on the fourth quarter, revenue got a little bit -- i guess the midpoint is a little bit below, the third quarter sequentially. i'm just trying to think about the factors as we think about seasonality and weather and other factors. any callouts there?
elena gomez -- chief financial officer
yeah, i mean, i think you hit it on the head. it's really the seasonality that we typically see on the payment front that is reflected in our guidance, but we'll continue to see growth and in our sas revenue et. so, the guidance reflects that seasonality.
tien-tsin huang -- jpmorgan chase and company -- analyst
good stuff. thanks.
alice lopatto
our next question comes from mayank tandon of needham. please go ahead.
mayank tandon -- needham and company -- analyst
thanks, alice. good evening, chris and elena, congrats on the quarter. i was going to ask you if a topical question. can you share any metrics around win rates, competitive takeaways to give us a feel for how a tool is faring versus some of your competition like, let's say, touchbistro, square, clover, etc? maybe just some any metrics that would be helpful to put your share gains in perspective that'll be very helpful.
thank you so much.
chris comparato -- chief executive officer
yeah, no, it's a good question. i mean, we're not going to comment specifically on win rates, you know, versus any one competitor. you know, we've seen a lot of success across the board. like i mentioned, it's mostly due to the depth and breadth of the platform and our obsession with customer happiness, and then the innovation behind that.
but in general, we compete against legacy players, cloud 1.0 players, and point solutions. but we feel like we're in a good position to compete well and differentiate ourselves, and sort of win the hearts and minds of restaurants moving forward.
mayank tandon -- needham and company -- analyst
elena, a quick follow-up for you. could you provide any perspective on the payments margin? any noticeable shift in terms of debit, credit, and card present versus not present just so when you think about our models into 2022?
elena gomez -- chief financial officer
yeah, it's a fair question. so, you know, card not present has been stabilizing, but i would say it's elevated a little bit above, you know, pre-covid levels. and we think that's in part because we've been investing in a lot of our digital products. so, there is a little dynamic there.
but take rate, obviously, in q3 came down a bit, and that's on its way to normalization. and then debit-credit mix is also trending back to pre-covid levels and i would expect that over time to normalize.
mayank tandon -- needham and company -- analyst
great. thank you so much. 
elena gomez -- chief financial officer
sure.
alice lopatto
thank you. our next question comes from dan dolev of mizuho. please go ahead. might not really seeing -- 
elena gomez -- chief financial officer
dan, you're on mute.
chris comparato -- chief executive officer
yeah, dan, you're on mute.
dan dolev -- mizuho securities -- analyst
am i better now? can you hear me now?
elena gomez -- chief financial officer
yeah, we can hear you. 
chris comparato -- chief executive officer
yeah, we got you.
dan dolev -- mizuho securities -- analyst
ok. sorry about that. congrats on the first quarter out. so, on the s-1, you gave a lot of detail on locations, and correct me if i'm wrong, i didn't see that in the press release. and sorry, i jumped on late because we were on another earnings.
i just want to know if -- did i miss that metric or is it not available or --
elena gomez -- chief financial officer
yeah. dan. so, it's a fair question. we're going to be disclosing locations more likely on an annualized basis.
but -- the primary reason is because we're focused on --  you know, as we talk about our powerful business model, we talk about both integrated payments, so saas and payments together. and so, arr is a metric we believe is most reflective of the growth of our business and really how we manage the business internally. so, i would tell you both locations were in line with expectations even though we're not going to disclose our number, and arpu was slightly ahead of our expectations for the third quarter.
dan dolev -- mizuho securities -- analyst
understood. and then my follow up is on just close payment volume, and you might have covered it and i apologize because i did jump on late. but kind of the sequential deceleration in our -- in gpv growth, q3 versus q2, and then that big jump, q2 versus q1. is there any -- are there any data points you can provide, some color on what's causing that, or maybe that q2 was abnormally high? that kind of -- 
elena gomez -- chief financial officer
well, typically summer months have some seasonality in their so you should consider that in your models. q2 and q3 are typically elevated but we're seeing -- you know, as i noted in the script, some elevated gpv per location and we expect that over time to normalize.
dan dolev -- mizuho securities -- analyst
understood. thank you, and congrats again on the first quarter.
elena gomez -- chief financial officer
thanks, dan.
chris comparato -- chief executive officer
thanks, dan.
alice lopatto
and our last question comes from andrew bauch of smbc. please go ahead.
andrew bauch -- smbc nikko securities -- analyst
hey, guys. thanks for squeezing me in here. just wanted to touch upon the ebitda guide here. i mean, i know that you're investing pretty heavily against the big market opportunity. but, you know, thinking about this business in the long run, you know, how should we think about what ebitda margins would look like under, you know, certain levels of growth, and maybe a sense of the, you know, long-run kind of profile this business? 
elena gomez -- chief financial officer
yeah. you know, the -- so, for the near term, we view this opportunity as massive and we're going to invest for growth. and that's what we've been talking about for some time. obviously, over -- we will continue to focus on payback period and unit economics. so, just to appreciate that behind the scenes, we have that good hygiene internally to make sure we're managing how we invest, where we invest, focus on investment to drive growth. and so, as we get further into the public markets, i'll share more about our long-term profitability.
but for the near term, we should focus on the fact that we will be investing for growth.
andrew bauch -- smbc nikko securities -- analyst
great. thank you. and looking forward to spark.
chris comparato -- chief executive officer
thank you.
alice lopatto
all right, everyone, well, that concludes our call. thank you so much for joining us today, and we look forward to speaking with you next quarter. have a good one.

chris comparato -- chief executive officer
thanks, edward, and thank you all for taking the time to join us today. toast delivered a strong fourth quarter in fiscal year 2021 as restaurants' need for an all-in-one platform to help them thrive has only become more important. before i jump into our results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year, i want to provide you with an overview of our business. first, let me remind you about our big ambitions.
we have an amazing opportunity to empower the restaurant community around the world to delight their guests, do what they love, and thrive. that is our mission. toast provides restaurants with an all-in-one digital technology platform that combines point-of-sale, front-of-house, back-of-house, and guest-facing technology integrated with financial technology and payments all built with the restaurant's success in mind. toast works for all restaurants, regardless of size, concept, or cuisine, from independent cafes to enterprise brands.
we serve every stakeholder, from the guest to the gm or owner, to the waitstaff, to the chef, suppliers, and the entire ecosystem. this past year was transformational for toast as we executed on our plan and became a publicly traded company. our initial public offering in september was a big milestone for our company and our customer community, and the momentum continued through the end of the year, resulting in a very strong q4. our community grew rapidly as we added more restaurants to our platform and as the percentage of live customers on our platform using four or more modules continue to increase.
this is a result of our strong focus on execution. let me share a few financial highlights. during the quarter, revenue increased 111% year over year to $512 million. and annualized recurring run rate, or arr, increased 74% year over year to $568 million.
this was driven by continued strength in gross payment volume, or gpv, the addition of new locations to our platform as we capture market share, and continued customer adoption of our growing portfolio of products. the industry continues to rebound from the impact of covid-19, and gpv on our platform increased to $17 billion in q4, a 125% increase year over year. we ended the quarter with approximately 57,000 live locations on our platform, up from approximately 40,000 locations in q4 of 2020, representing a 41% increase year over year. as our customer community grew, we also saw accelerated adoption of our platform as the percentage of customers using four or more core modules beyond point-of-sale and payments increased from 48% in q4 of 2020 to 59% in q4 of 2021.
as a result, our software-as-a-service arpu increased year over year by 30% from q4 of 2020. finally, as customers rely on toast to run their businesses, our net retention continues to be strong and was 135% for 2021, as elena will discuss in a few minutes. now, i'd like to take a moment and provide some context on the industry as a whole. throughout 2021, the operating environment remained challenging for restaurant operators as they faced the dual challenges of shifting workforce dynamics and a sustained labor shortage alongside rising input prices due to supply chain disruption and accompanying inflation.
as you can imagine, it is challenging to run a restaurant in this environment, and we are committed now more than ever to being the true partner to the restaurant industry, just as we've been since the onset of the pandemic and for the last 10 years. with this backdrop, what we have learned in our history serving the industry is that restaurant operators are incredibly resilient. even before covid-19, the industry was transforming. dining itself was changing from mobile order and pay at the table to delivery and online ordering.
the pandemic accelerated these changes. when looking at the performance of restaurants on the toast platform, we have been impressed by their ability to take full advantage of the platform's capabilities to reinvent their business and navigate the impact of covid-19. later this month, we will publish the first edition of our quarterly restaurant trends report, which gives visibility into the overall state of the restaurant industry through sales data from restaurants on the toast platform. let me share a few highlights today.
as the industry rebounded from the impact of covid-19 in 2021, restaurant sales, as measured by same-store gmv, or gross merchandise volume, on the toast platform increased by 41% year over year from 2020 to 2021. overall same-store sales of toast customers continue to exceed pre-covid levels, as evidenced by gmv per location increasing nearly 6% from q4 2019 to q4 2021. these are just a few strong signs that the restaurant industry, while continually battle-tested, is resilient. we will continue to lobby congress to replenish the restaurant revitalization fund, but we are also glad to see toast adoption contributing to restaurant success and helping restaurants navigate through this difficult time.
to better support our customers in the restaurant industry at large as they reimagine their businesses, we hosted thousands of restaurant operators for a virtual edition of spark, our restaurant innovation event, where we previewed the newest toast technology. during the course of the day, we unveiled an entire suite of new products designed to help restaurants take control of their finances, navigate the labor shortage, regain control of third-party delivery, and better manage their p&ls. the response from our customer community was overwhelmingly positive. so, let me share two examples.
as many of you know, there is substantial demand for faster access to capital in the restaurant industry as both their point-of-sale and payments processor for restaurants, we have unprecedented visibility into the health of their business. nearly two years ago, we introduced toast capital, which allows restaurants to borrow money and pay that money back as a percentage of daily sales. restaurants absolutely love this product as they pay back more on busy days and less on slow days. at spark, we introduced a new longer-duration loan product, and the demand for this new product has been robust.
during calendar year 2021, we originated over $100 million in total toast capital loans. a second highlight from spark was the introduction of an enhanced suite of products designed to help restaurants maintain control of takeout and delivery. with orders hub, toast has helped more than 20,000 restaurants manage both takeout and delivery orders from first-party toast ordering channels and third-party providers. toast is the first restaurant technology platform to deliver direct integrations with the five largest third-party delivery brands: doordash, caviar, grubhub, postmates, and uber eats.
and our performance center provides unique visibility into the profitability of each channel. when used together, this new suite of products enables our customer community to truly take control of their takeout and delivery business. we're excited about how our customers are using these new products announced at spark and how they further our position as the leading all-in-one platform for restaurants. throughout the quarter, we experienced robust demand in the market for the toast platform.
in 2021, we added around 17,000 new restaurant locations on the platform. throughout q4, we saw incredible demand across all segments, from single-location smb restaurants to regional mid-market and large enterprise brands. this quarter, we signed a new deal with sinelli concepts, the holding company for multiple national restaurant and retail brands, including which wich superior sandwiches, paciugo gelato caffe, birdguesa tenders & tots, supernova, and earth burger. sinelli concepts is looking to improve efficiency by moving its business to a digital platform.
it will be rolling out toast to 250 locations nationwide for point-of-sale, kitchen display systems, and kiosks. we also signed a new deal with cohn restaurant group, which is rolling out toast for front of house with toast go and order & pay at the table and back of house with our kitchen display system. cohn restaurant group will use toast at 35 locations, both in california and hawaii, and will continue its efforts in converting its entire technology stack to a best-in-class cloud-based platform. pavement coffeehouse, an independent and locally owned coffee house with eight shops in boston and cambridge, purchased toast pos and payroll in q4.
toast is replacing multiple vendors for loyalty, payroll, gift cards, and online ordering. by consolidating on toast, customers like pavement coffeehouse can see lower total cost and experience the benefits of an integrated platform, common ui, shared data, and a single-partner relationship to manage. in addition to the exciting growth across our customer community, we also welcomed a new board member to our board of directors in q4. hilarie koplow-mcadams joined the toast board of directors on november 30.
if you're not familiar with hilarie, she has spent more than three decades in operating and leadership roles devoted to accelerating high-growth software companies through sales, business development, customer success, and more. currently, she is a venture partner with new enterprise associates, nea, a venture capital firm. prior to nea, hilarie served as the president of new relic, president of global sales at salesforce, and also held executive roles at intuit inc. and oracle corporation.
we are really excited about having hilarie on our board. welcome to the team, hilarie. before i wrap up and pass the call to elena, i thought it would also be helpful to tee up our primary focus areas that we look forward to updating you on in 2022. the first is our focus on being the trusted platform of choice for the restaurant industry.
there are approximately 860,000 restaurant locations across the u.s., and we see an enormous opportunity ahead within this large addressable market. as evidenced by our growth in q4, there is tremendous demand for the toast platform as restaurant operators navigate the new normal. toast is the all-in-one technology platform built exclusively for restaurants by people who understand their specific needs. second, our industry has been through a massive transition during the past two years.
to help our customer community navigate this transition, we will continue to invest in their success through our commitment to customer success and support. third, given our momentum in mid-market and enterprise, we are confident in our ability to serve restaurants of all types and sizes. i shared earlier just a few examples of mid-market and enterprise wins this past quarter, and we will continue to invest in our capability here. finally, we have a substantial opportunity to provide our platform to international locations.
as discussed earlier, we estimate our total addressable market at least doubles the u.s. opportunity if we look globally. in late 2021, we started our initial investment to seed our international expansion. with that, i will close by saying i am honored and humbled to be part of supporting the restaurant industry through this past year.
i'm also equally excited about 2022. restaurants are resilient. they make up the social fabric of our community, and we believe our commitment to aligning our success with restaurant success will lead to a stronger and exciting future ahead. i'd like to thank our customers, our partners, and our toast employees for their hard work and support in 2021.
the financial results we're sharing today wouldn't be possible without your confidence in our platform, commitment to the industry, and unwavering support for our vision. now i'd like to hand it over to our cfo, elena gomez.
elena gomez -- chief financial officer
thanks, chris, and i just want to echo the thank you to our employees and to our customers. 2021 has been an unforgettable year, and i appreciate your commitment and dedication to our company. so, i'm going to remind you as i get into results that we will refer to gaap and non-gaap measures. refer to today's press release for a reconciliation of gaap to non-gaap financial performance and additional disclosures regarding these measures.
as chris mentioned, we had a strong q4 to exit 2021, and to cap off the year, we became a public company. with continued momentum in q4, we outperformed all key metrics, which is a testament to the strong execution of our collective team. we are proud of the new locations we added to our platform through 2021, which reflect the value of our all-in-one digital platform. in q4, we generated revenue of $512 million, up 111% year over year and $1.705 million for the full year 2021, a 107% increase year over year.
we closed the year at $568 million in arr, up 74% year over year. we continue to believe arr is our north star metric. as chris said, we ended the year with approximately 57,000 live locations on our platform, compared to 40,000 in q4 2020, representing a 41% year-over-year growth. in addition, we are also proud to report that our net retention rate, also referred to as nrr, which we reported in our s-1 to be greater than 110% for the last five years, was 135% in 2021.
nrr comprises both saas and fintech solutions revenue, both of which had a retention rate above 110%. saas nrr was strong through the expansion of locations from our existing customers, as well as customers adding more products. from a fintech perspective, we have shared with you that in 2021, we benefited from higher debit and credit mix, as well as higher card-not-present volume. in 2022, we anticipate these trends will have largely stabilized, and as such, we expect nrr going forward to trend closer to 110%, as we shared in the s-1.
our subscription services revenue grew 86% year over year to $54 million in the fourth quarter, driven by an increase in customers adopting more of our saas products. as of the end of 2021, 59% of our toast locations use four or more core products on top of our integrated pos and payment solution as compared to 48% a year ago. our financial technology solutions revenue grew 117% year over year to $421 million in the fourth quarter, driven by gpv of $17 billion, which had an increase of 124% year over year. gpv is driven by transactions processed on our platform.
since early 2021, annualized gpv per processing location continues to remain strong at an average of $1.3 million per location. as a reminder, our gpv per location dropped by 45% at the onset of covid but has steadily returned to above pre-covid levels. as we have stated before, there's quarterly seasonality with our financial technology solutions revenue as restaurants, on average, generally perform better in the second and third quarters. given that we continue to anticipate seasonal fluctuations in the annualized gpv per location from quarter to quarter, however, on an annualized basis, our gpv per location is consistent and remains durable.
for the fourth quarter, non-gaap gross profit, which excludes stock-based compensation and depreciation and amortization expense, that was a mouthful, came in at $82 million, up 54% year over year. in addition to the growth in our customer base, this growth was driven by higher revenue per location, which in turn has been driven by continued growth in average revenue per unit, known as arpu, for both saas and financial technology solutions. we are pleased with our arpu performance as a driver to non-gaap gross profit, and we believe that such performance can be sustainable. drilling down into our arpu performance, we've seen our saas arpu increase as a result of continued adoption of our platform by both new and existing customers.
we continue to invest in our technology and remain highly focused on driving innovation across our product portfolio. our fintech solutions arpu is up more than 50% from q4 2019 or pre-covid levels, primarily as a result of gpv per location and card-not-present volume. as a reminder, two factors that influence fintech solutions arpu are the mix of card-not-present volume and the debit-credit mix. consumers continue to utilize digital channels, and as such, we believe the card-not-present volumes will remain elevated.
the debit-credit mix has returned to pre-covid levels. turning to hardware cost of revenue. as shared in the last earnings call, our freight costs remain elevated due to supply chain dynamics. we continue to believe they will remain elevated through the near term.
despite increased hardware costs, however, we remain confident in our ability to deliver hardware for our customers. before i turn to operating expenses, i want to remind you that we use customer acquisition cost and payback metrics to measure the performance of our business and guide our investment decisions. we are proud to share that our payback period for the full year 2021 was approximately 12 months. our healthy unit economics and strong payback periods continue to make us feel confident in our ability to invest for durable growth.
now, let's turn to our operating expenses, which i will review on a non-gaap basis. in q4, we continued to invest in sales and marketing and research and development to capture tam and build out our platform. additionally, general, and administrative costs increased as a result of operating as a public company. this includes costs from the adoption of the new credit loss -- of the new credit losses accounting standard in q4 and increased investment to support the growth of our business.
as a result of these investments, adjusted ebitda for the fourth quarter was negative $45 million for q4 and negative $42 million for the full year 2021. now, let me turn to guidance. for the first quarter, we expect revenue to be in the range of $469 million to $499 million, which represents 72% year-over-year growth at the midpoint. we expect adjusted ebitda to be in the range of negative $65 million to negative $55 million.
for the full year 2022, we expect revenue to be in the range of $2.349 million to $2.409 million, which represents 40% year-over-year growth at the midpoint, and adjusted ebitda to be in the range of negative $240 million to negative $200 million. as you can see, we are deliberately investing to drive long-term growth. the stakes have never been higher for restaurants. the restaurant industry is going through massive change, driven by undeniable trends in the world across labor, supply chain, and guest adoption of technology.
our investments in 2022 are reflective of this opportunity we have ahead of us. with only approximately 7% market share here in the united states, we continue to believe we are in the early innings of this opportunity. as such, we will continue to invest in research and development, as well as in sales and marketing to cost-effectively capture our market share. our primary focus is on being the trusted platform of choice for the restaurant industry.
our business is performing well, and there's enormous demand for the toast platform as restaurants need to streamline their operations, increase revenue, and retain great employees. our ambition continues to be to serve restaurants all around the world. and with that, we will be making foundational investments in 2022 to drive growth internationally. we look forward to updating you on this multiyear journey in future quarters.
in closing, our strong 2021 performance demonstrates our success in capturing market share. we are built to serve large -- built to serve a large and growing addressable market, and we've shown we can execute at scale with healthy unit economics. we continue to believe we are uniquely positioned to drive durable growth for ourselves and for restaurants using our platform. now, i'd like to turn the call back to the moderator for our q&a session.
edward parker
all right. thank you very much, chris and elena. let's go ahead and start our q&a session. please use the raise the hand function in zoom to ask your question.
and our first question comes from josh baer at morgan stanley. josh, please go ahead.
josh baer -- morgan stanley -- analyst
great. thank you for the question. so, i wanted to get some context on the pace of location additions in '22. if you could provide any insight into kind of how you're thinking about that and maybe tying into the ramp of sales reps and capacity.
like where are you today or in '22 versus 2019 from that perspective?
elena gomez -- chief financial officer
yeah, i can start. at the highest level, without me guiding for locations, we've intentionally invested, josh, in adding to our sales force. and we've often said that tam is our no. 1 priority and then arpu will follow.
we're actually balancing both, but we're pretty excited about the locations we added on our platform in 2021. and we see no reason why we wouldn't continue to have success adding locations, frankly, very efficiently, too, with the 12-month payback period that we experienced in 2021. we feel confident to make this investment, and we'll continue to see growth on our platform.
josh baer -- morgan stanley -- analyst
great. and related, as far as the location additions that you've been seeing, any way to break down where you're having the most success or where you're strategically focused as far as competitive wins, new geographies in the u.s. that are underpenetrated? and if it is competitive, is it from legacy vendors? or are you going after cloud replacements? and then i guess, lastly, new restaurant formations and if that's a strategic priority, just winning an outsized share of the new restaurant formations. thank you.
chris comparato -- chief executive officer
i can jump in. 
elena gomez -- chief financial officer
yeah. i can -- yeah. go ahead.
chris comparato -- chief executive officer
either way. josh, we've seen broad momentum across multiple sectors of our business in multiple geos. i wouldn't say there's any one geo or sector that has grown faster. we're seeing really good traction in smb, really good momentum in mid-market and enterprise, as i referenced with those examples.
and we have teams across the u.s. embedded in local communities going after their market. so, we feel good about our position. i'd say we believe that we have the capability to serve restaurants of different types, formats, and sizes than any of our competition.
so, we feel good about our position, and we're seeing steady demand on that front.
edward parker
thanks, josh. let's go to tien-tsin huang at jpmorgan, please.
tien-tsin huang -- jpmorgan chase & co. -- analyst
hey, thanks so much. good to see all of you all here today. thanks for the time. just -- i hear you loud and clear on the investing.
i think it makes a lot of sense. the time is now to do it. so, with the investments across developing new products, i know you're working really hard to build new products and, of course, customer acquisitions. just trying to better understand how you're prioritizing those two.
has it changed versus maybe 90 days ago? and is your ltv-to-cac thinking still the same versus 90 days ago? just trying to better understand the opex given the wider ebitda loss for the year.
elena gomez -- chief financial officer
yeah. no, it's a good question. let me just start by saying we have a ton of confidence and conviction about our opportunity, and that has not changed at all, actually. in fact, i would say after our performance in 2021, we have even more conviction.
and so, our prioritization has always been let's focus on capturing the opportunity ahead with the tam. and we know we're in the early innings, as you know. and we also have seen some data points, proof points. demand continues to be strong and customers engaging on our platform, whether that's nrr, as you saw that we talked about, or just consistent addition of locations to our platform.
and so, we're going to remain very disciplined and have a lot of rigor about our investments and point investments to things that will drive growth. and then, of course, back to your timing point, the pandemic really amplified the need that customers have for technology and to make their operations more efficient. and we believe when you put all that data together, we're well-positioned to capture that opportunity. so, it's really important that we're intentional about this investment.
i would tell you it doesn't mean we're not thinking about profitability, so i don't want you to take that from this at all. in fact, in our executive alignment -- in our comp plans, we've aligned on the fact that we do, at the right time, need to drive operating leverage, right? we're going to drive and orient to durable growth today. but of course, over time, we will drive operating leverage.
tien-tsin huang -- jpmorgan chase & co. -- analyst
yeah. that makes great sense. if you don't mind, just a quick follow-up. just thinking about the first quarter, elena.
just any puts and takes there with revenue. and i know seasonality is always something to think about. i know we're coming out of it, hopefully. and i don't know if there's anything to call out with gmv or locations, return, or growth in the first quarter versus the fourth.
thank you.
elena gomez -- chief financial officer
yeah. that's a great question. so, i would just point to a couple of things. as a reminder, last year at this time, vaccines were -- we're coming back, and people were coming back, right? so just don't forget that as -- you guys, i know a lot of you look at sequential moves.
so, pay attention to that because we had a big surge last year. we didn't expect that to repeat this year, right, because we've now been unfortunately used to this kind of quasi environment we're operating in. but even without that dynamic from last year, there's always seasonality in our payments, as you know. so, q1 tends to be a quarter where the seasonality is such that we have lower gpv than, say, q2 and q3.
so, that was not much -- that's not what -- that did not surprise us. i would tell you we had a little bit of omicron in the early part -- late days of december and early part of january, but we believe that's transitory and, frankly, behind us at this point. the other thing i'll point to that you may not see in the guidance is we anticipate saas will continue to increase. so, you will see that sequential increase q4 to q1.
so, i hope that gives you enough color to kind of give you the backdrop for q1.
tien-tsin huang -- jpmorgan chase & co. -- analyst
it does. thank you.
elena gomez -- chief financial officer
great.
edward parker
thanks very much. let's go to josh beck at keybanc. josh?
josh beck -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
thank you so much for taking the question. i wanted to maybe start with a higher-level question. i think one that is surfacing a lot is really what's the impact of a full reopening, hopefully, as we progress through the year. there's obviously puts and takes against your model.
so, just kind of curious how you're trying to embed that into the outlook. and what are some of the more important factors we should be keying in on there?
chris comparato -- chief executive officer
yeah. i mean, i could jump in at a high level, and elena, feel free to support it. but i mean, listen, we're excited about 2022. we're seeing really strong demand.
we're executing well. so, our mindset is sort of a growth-oriented mindset to go after locations in the tam and support the restaurant community as it starts to recover. if you zoom out, this is an industry that's largely been underserved by great technology. and in the past two years, they've gone from crisis to survival to recovery and now to a time frame that i think it's time to thrive.
so, personally, as a team and as a management team and a company and a board, we're excited about 2022 because we think it's going to be a little bit of a renaissance coming back to the restaurant industry. though it's been difficult for the past two years, we're certainly excited about what lies ahead and some of the momentum that we may see across the entire business.
elena gomez -- chief financial officer
yeah. i mean, i think in our guidance, as we entered into the year, there's a few trends that, really, we pay attention to that you guys are familiar with. card-not-present is one of those, debit and credit mix, all those impact our fintech arpu. so, for card-not-present, as i said in my script, we do believe consumer behavior has largely changed.
i think all of us are probably using online ordering more than we did in the past. and so, we believe some of that behavior is going to persist. and therefore, we believe cnp will remain somewhat elevated. debit and credit mix has largely come back to pre-covid levels.
so, we factored that into our thinking. and then i would just call out on the cogs side, as i mentioned in the script, we have elevated freight costs, and we believe that's going to persist for the near term. we're keeping an eye on it, of course. but those are the things that come to mind when you ask a little bit about what do we think about recovery.
i think we've seen omicron come and go, which is great. i think it shows restaurants are resilient. and so, we're considering that in our calculus as well.
josh beck -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
very helpful. just a follow-up. the payback period, i believe you said, was 12 months, which is well below the pre-covid level. so, i imagine there's perhaps some positive surprise there.
as you think about the future, what range are you comfortable that trending toward? maybe over what time? just curious if you could give us any thoughts on how we should be thinking about the payback period from here.
elena gomez -- chief financial officer
yeah. no, i mean, we're proud of our payback. i wouldn't say it was a surprise. i think my finance team would get really mad at me if we said it was a surprise because, actually, it wasn't a surprise.
like i think we are so focused on unit economics and payback periods. but we did benefit from -- in the first part of the year, we had -- if i say the puts and takes in the first part of the year, we had higher card-not-present and just higher take rates, obviously. but then you counter that with freight costs being elevated, so all those puts and takes really come into play there. but as i think about the future, and as we said in our s-1, as long as our payback period is in the mid-teens, i'm happy with that.
obviously, we're always going to do better. we're always going to try to make our operation more efficient. but i'm happy with that. so, i would think about that as more of a longer-term trend than what we had in 2021.
josh beck -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
excellent. thank you.
edward parker
great. thanks, josh. why don't we go to brent bracelin at piper sandler? brent, you there?
brent bracelin -- piper sandler -- analyst
guys, good afternoon. thanks for letting me on here. two questions if i could. maybe, chris, we'll start with you.
i'd love to hear early feedback on the toast restaurant card, pay card, pay now features. what have you learned so far? i know we're really early but can be a pretty exciting and incremental lever for you over time. so, i'd love to hear any sort of early feedback there on those cards. and then one quick follow-up for elena.
i can't hear you, sorry.
chris comparato -- chief executive officer
sorry about that. yeah, brent, good question. i think it's still early. i mean, we launched them in november.
it's been a couple of months, not even a full quarter. but we remain really excited. we're putting a lot of investment behind those teams to make sure that those cards have a good product-market fit. listen, we believe in faster payments to restaurants.
we believe in faster early wage access for employees. we believe those two fundamental dynamics help the restaurant industry succeed and for each restaurant operator to have better control of their financials. so, they make a ton of sense, but it's early days. we're excited about the products, and we're continuing to test and iterate and gain customer feedback and listen to our customer base about what we need to tweak to make them better and better.
so, stay tuned.
brent bracelin -- piper sandler -- analyst
perfect. and then, elena, i saved a tough one for you. if i go back and look at quarterly seasonality, we only have post-covid quarterly seasonality. and so, in some regards, we have a big sequential drop in q2 in one year.
another year, we have a big sequential rise in q2. i'm just -- as we kind of think about going forward toward a normal environment, do you have any general sense for us how we should think about like quarter-to-quarter seasonality of the business given it's been so dynamic in the last couple of years?
elena gomez -- chief financial officer
yeah. no, brent, that's a really good question. i had to go back myself for the reason you described, and it was before my time. but i think the thing we'll call out is q2 and q3 summer months tend to be our high gpv per location quarters.
q1 tends to be the lower quarter. and same with q4 with the holidays and whatnot. so, warm weather gets people out, and that's why you see a lot of increase in our gpv going in q2 and q3. so, you should expect that more, hopefully, more normal this year going into 2022.
and that's how we think about it, too. that's how we planned.
brent bracelin -- piper sandler -- analyst
perfect. helpful color there, and look forward to seeing it.
edward parker
thanks, brent. next question, let's go to mayank tandon from needham.
mayank tandon -- needham & company -- analyst
thank you. chris, you mentioned the investments in international and enterprise. could you talk about what are the unique challenges you expect to face as you penetrate these opportunities? in other words, what are the keys to success based on your experience so far with toast?
chris comparato -- chief executive officer
sure. now, let's start with enterprise. so, we've been in the enterprise space for years and collaborating with our largest customers. it's really making sure that, number one, the platform is as scalable and reliable as possible to support their needs on expansion.
so, that includes a lot of above-store reporting, multilevel analysis of their business. so, it just needs -- we need to make sure that the platform is a core centerpiece of their architecture as they scale their businesses. so, that's number one. number two, it's important to make sure that we've got strong apis.
as i mentioned back in the ipo, we've got 150-plus technology partners that stitch into our platform on a daily basis. and large enterprises require more complexity around architecture. so, they love the fact that we've got a strong partner ecosystem and strong apis that go along with it. i'd say the third dimension is making sure that the enterprise has strong reporting.
so, just the data elements and the data sharing capabilities of the platform are critically important. so, we continue to invest in those pieces of the road map so that the enterprises have the right analytics and insights that they need to properly run their business. but we're confident about our position in the mid-market and enterprise space. and as i referenced, the win with sinelli, it allows us to really accomplish enterprises that are different.
they could be an fsr. it could be a qsr. but the strength of the platform to support multiple segments of the restaurant industry is pretty strong. on international, it's going to be early days.
i mean, this is more about building the proper foundation to go to market in key markets with the product-market fit that helps every restaurant be successful in the early days of those international markets. so, i'm going to temper expectations that it's going to be a foundational year and a building year for international as we put the team in place, the products in place, and our execution in place to make sure that customers have a fantastic experience. and elena, you may want to add to that. but it's just a reminder that international is going to be the early days.
so, in terms of location count and driving arr, it's going to be lower than perhaps, obviously, what we've seen in the u.s. for years.
elena gomez -- chief financial officer
yeah. i think the only thing i would add is just making sure that we get the product localized for -- if there's any languages that we need to consider, of course, that's important and making sure that we invest in that over the long term but also being measured about our investment and just making sure we learn in 2022 is really important to us.
mayank tandon -- needham & company -- analyst
and then as a quick follow-up, just given the war for talent, are you able to hire the salespeople and the engineers and other key people to be able to hit those demand targets that you've set for yourself?
chris comparato -- chief executive officer
yeah. no, i mean, big shout-out to our people team and our talent acquisition team. they've stayed on goal. so, when we look at 2021 and the momentum going into 2022, that team's done a fantastic job to find the best talent in key markets and help us scale and execute.
so, yeah, we've been able to keep pace.
mayank tandon -- needham & company -- analyst
thank you.
edward parker
thank you. our next question is from stephen sheldon of william blair. stephen, please go ahead.
stephen sheldon -- william blair & company -- analyst
hey, thanks. really nice job on top-line results, and great to hear that you're starting to focus more on the international opportunity. wondering if you could just talk some about the trends you're seeing when you first win new customers. what trends are you seeing in terms of the size of initial packages? and what are some of the main products that newer customers are frequently, i guess, including when they're first signing up for toast?
elena gomez -- chief financial officer
yeah. i mean, i can tell you, stephen, so when we looked a couple of years ago, our initial -- our customers would typically add about two products. that's well over four now. and we talked about 50% of our customers more than four products.
the typical products are online ordering, toast co. devices, gift cards. those are all really -- loyalty, all really popular products. and also with our new customers, a lot of them are adopting the payroll product.
we see the majority of our new customers adopting the payroll product. so, we're excited about that. and of course, there's an opportunity to sell that to our existing installed base as well.
stephen sheldon -- william blair & company -- analyst
got it. that's helpful. and then i guess just when i think about the -- as we think about the sales capacity investments, i guess, where are you focusing incremental sales resources at this time? has there been any shift toward maybe focusing more on gaining market share in existing markets versus expanding into new markets? i mean, i would just love an update on what you're seeing in terms of sales efficiency, especially some of the markets where you've been operating maybe the longest.
chris comparato -- chief executive officer
that's a good question. i mean, it's a little bit of both, making sure that we're broadening our presence in newer markets and adding reps into those markets. again, we're constantly testing and iterating how many reps it takes to accomplish our tam goals within a market. so, i'd say on one front, it's, again, broadening that base of reps in new markets.
but then similar to markets like new england, we continue to put reps into new england to go after deeper sections of tam and then really just make sure that we've got broad brand awareness within those older legacy markets where toast has been executing, but we can actually put more reps into it and even be more successful. so, i think it comes back to the fact that we're still in the early days or early innings, as elena mentioned, of our tam penetration. today, we're 7% of the u.s. tam.
so, that gives us strong belief that there's enough demand to continue to ramp that go-to-market engine.
stephen sheldon -- william blair & company -- analyst
great. thank you.
edward parker
thanks, stephen. our next question is from dan dolev at mizuho. dan, please go ahead.
dan dolev -- mizuho securities -- analyst
hey, thank you. appreciate taking the questions. two quick ones. i saw the take rate.
i think, elena, you mentioned that the debit-credit mix stabilized to pre-covid. i may have misunderstood you, but it looks like the take rate has been stable sequentially. can you maybe give us some more detail on what's driving the stabilization in the take rate sequentially despite kind of the movement, the shift from debit to credit? thank you.
elena gomez -- chief financial officer
yeah. so, actually, our take rate, i think, is slightly down in q4, and that's primarily because we're getting back to normal on debit and credit. cnp is remaining elevated, and so i feel comfortable with where we are. and stable is probably a pretty solid term in terms of how we think about 2022.
but i would just remind you, the beauty of the model, right, is both take rate but then we also have an opportunity to monetize through saas. so, i would just encourage you as you think about our growth, consider both the take rate but also the saas arpu as well.
dan dolev -- mizuho securities -- analyst
got it. thank you. and then just a quick follow-up, more from a strategic perspective. i believe ncr made an announcement last week that they're considering alternatives.
obviously, they're a huge player with aloha. obviously, you're not going to discuss any specific m&a, but is the strategy now still pretty much organic? or will you be willing to look at maybe opportunities to opportunistically bolster your portfolio? thank you.
chris comparato -- chief executive officer
yeah. it's a good question. i mean, dan, listen, i mean, our organic growth engine continues to be really strong. and the team's executing at an extremely high level.
so, i think that motion and that growth lever is going to continue. will we assess strategic opportunities when we see them on the landscape, whether it's within a line of business or more broadly? perhaps, like i think those opportunities will exist as a growth lever in our future. we've proven that with our acquisition of xtrachef and then also our acquisition of stratex two years ago. so, we feel confident in our m&a stance, but i'll remind everybody that the organic growth engine continues to execute extremely well, and we're going to continue to prioritize that.
dan dolev -- mizuho securities -- analyst
got it. really appreciate the color. thanks again.
edward parker
thanks, dan. our next question is from andrew bauch of smbc nikko. andrew, please go ahead.
andrew bauch -- smbc nikko securities -- analyst
hey, guys. thanks for taking my question. nice set of results considering the covid challenges that you're facing in the quarter. i wanted to speak to the capital business.
you mentioned the $100 million originated in 2021, which is pretty promising. and you also said that the long-duration loans that you introduced at spark were a key variable in that accelerating growth. i mean, how much of that contributed to the $100 million, if you could contextualize it? and maybe higher level, what percentage would you -- or kind of how should we think about what's addressable within your base for that product?
chris comparato -- chief executive officer
yeah. it's a good question. i think if you step back into the shoes of a restaurant, restaurants desire capital to run their business. they want to have working capital.
they want to grow, whether it's new locations or renovate or add a patio. they want to purchase equipment, or they may need emergency funding. so, we actually think capital is deeply strategic to help the restaurant industry thrive moving forward. having multiple products within lending is key because it's not one-size-fits-all.
so, you're going to see us continue to innovate and test different types of products within toast capital. it's still the early days of what toast capital could be as a percentage of our entire business. so, we're not going to give you sort of the splits between products, but we know that we are on the right path with what we're seeing. and we feel like we've got a significant advantage because we have all the data that flows through the restaurant.
so, that allows us to effectively underwrite restaurants and really have visibility into the effectiveness and then the payback on those loans. so, we feel like we're in a strong position. we're going to continue to invest in this aspect of the business. but i'll remind you, it's still a small portion of the business today.
andrew bauch -- smbc nikko securities -- analyst
definitely understood. then my follow-up would be the four-plus module adoption rising 10 points from last year is obviously super impressive. i mean, how should we think about where that metric goes, be it in 2022 and maybe in the long term?
elena gomez -- chief financial officer
yeah. i mean, i think that's a really good question. i would say our arpu growth will be steady, but having a steep growth is probably not the way i would model it. i would just plan for steady improvement in our arpu over time.
and that's with the innovation we have today, not to mention the innovation that's coming. so, that's how i would think about it, andrew. and then on toast capital, the only thing i would add is the growth we've seen is -- obviously, we're very encouraged by it. chris is right, it's early days.
the impact to our financials is not material today. but what we love about that program is we're testing and learning, right? we're testing and learning each time. so, we started out with 90-day loans. now we're testing longer-duration loans.
and that's a motion that we're going to continue to try to do as we expand what's possible with toast capital.
andrew bauch -- smbc nikko securities -- analyst
got it. thank you for the color, guys.
edward parker
thanks, andrew. our final question comes from kartik mehta of northcoast research. kartik, please go ahead.
kartik mehta -- northcoast research -- analyst
thank you. i'm wondering for you, as you've had so much success, what the competition has done and if they've done anything different in the last six months.
chris comparato -- chief executive officer
yeah. i can take that. i mean, listen, as i mentioned earlier, the restaurant industry has been underserved by great technology, so it's no surprise that there's been competition for the past 10 years. i mean, it's a competitive space.
but what i like about our position is, number one, we're seeing really strong demand for the platform, and that's a very good signal for us to continue to execute. number two, we're seeing healthy win rates. and you're seeing strong payback periods, healthy win rates, so that gives us even more confidence in our execution. so, while there's competition, we feel like we are the leading platform to help the restaurant industry grow.
and it comes back to the platform. being an end-to-end restaurant-specific platform that's not multiproduct but is a true platform across the board from front-of-house to back-of-house, that's a key success factor, and we're going to continue to execute on that path. so, we feel good about our position within the competitive landscape. and while there's been announcements over time -- i mean, there's been announcements for the past few years on the competitive landscape of restaurants.
but we just continue to execute and raise the bar and support our customers. at the end of the day, we want to make sure that every customer has a fantastic experience when they run toast.
kartik mehta -- northcoast research -- analyst
perfect. thank you very much. i appreciate it.
edward parker
well, all right, everyone, thank you very much. that concludes our call. we look forward to speaking with you all next quarter, and have a great afternoon.
chris comparato -- chief executive officer

operator
thank you, elena. [operator instructions] we'll pause here for just a moment to compile the q&a roster. your first question is from the line of tien-tsin huang of j.p. morgan.
tien-tsin, your line is open.
tien-tsin huang -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
hey. thank you so much for the great results here. appreciate all of your comments. chris, i wanted to ask about your -- i think i wrote down here driving efficient growth, heightened discipline, those kind of things.
i think elena, you also talked about watching discretionary expenses. can you just elaborate on what that might look like? what investments are nonnegotiable for you in terms of growing? and where you might see a little bit of belt tightening, if you want to call it that? thank you.
elena gomez -- chief financial officer
yeah. chris, i can comment if you want and you can add.
chris comparato -- chief executive officer
sure.
elena gomez -- chief financial officer
so at the highest level, great question. so things that are non -- not something we would not invest in, right? we're going to really focus -- continue to focus in sales. we're going to continue to focus on r&d. we're going to focus on areas that really drive high roi, that's really important.
it's nonnegotiable for us to not go after this market opportunity given the momentum we're seeing, given the signals that we're getting from our customers, etc. so those are nonnegotiables for us. areas where we're focused on discretionary -- on managing tightly are things such as overhead discretionary expenses, of course, the typical t&e type of things. and also, over time, really trying to gain leverage in our g&a functions.
tien-tsin huang -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
perfect. thank you for that. my quick follow-up, just the 5,000 net new locations, records, ahead of where we had, can you keep it up? is that nominal level sustainable, given what you see? any call-outs on churn or types of restaurants or channels that did especially well? thank you.
chris comparato -- chief executive officer
yeah. so i can try and my answer is that -- ok. i was going to say absolutely. we believe we're grabbing market share in multiple segments.
our core segment, our core smb segment is performing extremely well, and it continues to drive the largest portion of opportunity. and then we're continuing to see success upmarket, in mid-market, and enterprise. and we're seeing some pull in that market. so we absolutely believe that we can sustain the growth that we're seeing on location acquisition.
and i'll remind you that we're still very early in our tam penetration. today, we're only about 7% of the 860,000 restaurants across the u.s. so we're certainly focused on consistent execution. and our unit economics tells us that we should continue to go fast on that lens.
tien-tsin huang -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
appreciate it. thank you.
operator
thank you, tien-tsin. the next question is from the line of stephen sheldon with william blair. stephen, your line is open.
stephen sheldon -- william blair -- analyst
hey. thanks for taking my questions. i wanted to kind of follow up on the location additions, great results there, and you just talked about some of the areas you're seeing growth. curious if you've seen any changes on the churn levels? i mean i think you have some natural churn, just given the heavy weighting toward smb, but your customers, i think, they're significantly better than industry average during the pandemic.
so curious if you continue to see moderation there and just general outperformance versus industry averages.
elena gomez -- chief financial officer
yeah. no, we've actually not seen that. we've actually seen churn remain low, something we're really proud of, and it's just a testament to the power of the platform. so we're really encouraged by the fact that churn has remained relatively low.
stephen sheldon -- william blair -- analyst
got it. that's great to hear. on the expansion into qsr, i guess, from a product side, are you needing to build out or develop anything new to support these customers? and i guess, just as an example, clearly, qsrs have a much bigger focus on drive-thru. so just curious what the expansion into qsr could mean when you think about the product roadmap?
chris comparato -- chief executive officer
yes. so we have a solid qsr customer base today, but we feel we have the potential to grow faster moving forward. so think of the platform as we have this restaurant breadth and depth platform, but now we're adapting it to specific segments to further accelerate our growth. so take qsr, it's basically a tailored set of products that are packaged and priced in a way that makes sense for qsr businesses.
so tying mobile ordering to kds and then the ability to sms text message a guest when the order is ready, that's a superfast flywheel, and we're seeing results where restaurants are telling us, a good example is there's a restaurant chain called velvet taco. they're telling us when they apply that packaging and configuration to their concept, they're increasing throughput by more than 20%. so really think about our segmentation work as adapting the platform to be really concept specific, which allows these concepts to then move faster. so that's really what's happening with the segmentation strategy, which is -- qsr is just one example.
toast for hotel restaurants is yet another example.
stephen sheldon -- william blair -- analyst
it's great to hear. congrats on the results.
operator
thank you, stephen. next question is from the line of timothy chiodo of credit suisse. timothy, your line is open.
timothy chiodo -- credit suisse -- analyst
great. thanks a lot for taking the question. i wanted to ask about what's implied in the guide in terms of the payback periods? they've been incredibly impressive and stable. i was just wondering if you could just give a comment on what might be implied there for that stability for the rest of the year, particularly in light of the comments that you made around some of the cost savings initiatives in terms of the shipping costs that you might be looking at? and also, the potential for the hardware cost to normalize, maybe not this year but over time? thanks a lot.
elena gomez -- chief financial officer
yeah. great question. thanks. so we actually have very healthy payback periods and consistent with what we -- and thus, despite the elevated hardware costs that we've experienced over the last couple of quarters.
our goal, as i mentioned in the last call, continues to be in the mid-teens, and we have confidence we'll be able to accomplish that through this year.
timothy chiodo -- credit suisse -- analyst
excellent. thank you, and very helpful. and a follow-up is on the financial technology solutions take rate. it was a little bit higher than maybe some of us would have expected.
maybe you could just comment on was there anything that came through there maybe from the capital side that might have contributed? or was that really just more the pure payments and net take rate was a little bit higher than maybe we had forecasted?
elena gomez -- chief financial officer
yes. that's -- toast capital continues to be just not material for our total results. but as i mentioned, some of the debit -- we had a little bit higher debit in q1 than typical. so that's really the dynamic that is causing our take rates to be what it is.
i would just tell you that we believe the take rates that you see in q1 is a reasonable take rate for the near term. and then i would always just take this opportunity to make sure to zoom out and just think about take rate is -- it's just one dimension of our business, right? we really think about our business beyond take rate. and you saw the performance in our saas business as well. so i would just encourage you to look at the broader picture beyond take rate.
timothy chiodo -- credit suisse -- analyst
excellent. really helpful. looks like there might have been something else there, but that's really helpful, clarify. thank you.
elena gomez -- chief financial officer
sure.
operator
thanks, timothy. the next question is from the line of josh baer of morgan stanley. josh, your line is open.
josh baer -- morgan stanley -- analyst
great. thanks for the question and congrats on a great quarter. i wanted to talk about gpv. i guess, to what extent from your data were restaurants able to pass on some higher cost to customers and just thinking about the benefit to you as far as your payments revenue stream from gpv? and then i have a follow-up.
elena gomez -- chief financial officer
yeah. we had a -- so thanks for the question. we've seen really healthy gpv per processing location. and obviously, we know that it's an inflationary environment, and we're seeing our customers, of course, play with pricing.
but really, the demand has been really strong. so we're encouraged by that. and that's really what's reflecting in our confidence, in our guide, but also just strong execution in q1 and really strong demand all the way around.
josh baer -- morgan stanley -- analyst
great. and that's clear, especially given omicron impacts were real in january and q1. i guess like on the strong guide, maybe thinking month-to-month throughout q1 or into april or even into may, just wondering if you are seeing like any signs of consumer weakening just given the focus on macro environment and inflation in thinking about forward expectations on gpv?
chris comparato -- chief executive officer
i can jump in. yeah. so we've not seen any material impact on the current sort of macro trends. there's no evidence of a slowdown from our perspective on restaurant spend.
in fact, like we feel restaurants are seeing healthy demand from consumers. and a good example is dine-in. if you look at restaurants across the u.s. running toast, dine-in is up 46% year over year from q1 of 2021 to q1 of this year.
so that's a really healthy dynamic that tells us that consumers are going back into restaurants and doing it quite frequently, especially post-covid. so we think that trend will continue, and we think the consumer demand is high, and we believe that restaurants have pricing power to play with pricing to continue to serve those consumers. so we don't see any evidence of the slowdown or a material risk on that front.
josh baer -- morgan stanley -- analyst
very helpful, thank you.
operator
thank you, josh. your next question is from the line of will nance with goldman sachs. will, your line is open.
will nance -- goldman sachs -- analyst
hi, guys. good afternoon and good evening. thank you for taking my question. i wanted to maybe ask a few questions on the efficiency initiatives that you guys talked about.
obviously, very nice to hear, particularly in the current environment about taking a second look at spending. i'm sure that will be well received. i guess my question is more longer term, and i totally get that investing in profitable growth is the focus for now. and there's no reason to slow down.
and i don't think any of us want to pin you down on a near-term target of profitability. but as you guys look out further on how this business can kind of scale to profitability over time, how do you think about the long-term profitability profile? and maybe what's the sort of the path of the building blocks to getting there?
elena gomez -- chief financial officer
yeah. great question. i'll take that. so we don't have a specific target to share today.
but it's really important that we're balancing sustained sort of durable growth with improving profitability, which is a huge priority growth, which i hope came through in our scripts. and at the highest level, we're positioning the business for consistent margin improvement as we look into the back half of 2022, which was reflected in the guide. and going forward from there, we want to focus on consistent improvement in our margin profile. and longer term, we believe an integrated model, which we always talk about and we have multiple monetization streams which will be highly profitable in a steady state.
so when you look at the various components, you think about strong unit economics, you think about investing in r&d and then really getting scale in our g&a. so there's a bunch of levers we have, but we are focused on building a lean cost structure, which will allow us to pivot and really continue to sustain this high growth profile with a very lean cost structure along the way. so with that, i would say that we will see consistent improvement in margins over time, but i'm not going to share a specific time frame or target today.
will nance -- goldman sachs -- analyst
got it. ok. i appreciate the question. and, yeah, that definitely comes across in the script.
second question unrelated is more on the software side. interesting stat on the new business coming in at around 6,000 arpu, it's like 50% higher than where the business is today. as you look -- maybe could you talk a little bit about the process of upselling on the existing customer base? what does that look like? and what's the success you've had in getting some of the existing customers to adopt, say, something like the payroll products or additional modules?
elena gomez -- chief financial officer
yeah. we've -- and aman, i'll let you comment as well. but we've been investing in upsell. we started an upsell team in 2020.
we also have an ability for our customers to go on to toast shop, which allows them to buy products online as well. but our upsell team is very much focused on building that muscle of selling incremental products to our existing installed base. and payroll has been a great example of that. we're early in that opportunity.
but we're definitely -- and this upsell team was an investment we made in 2020, built on it in 2021, and continue to invest and see good signal there as well. and that's what's reflected in all of our overall arpu growth. and as well, even in the consistency of our execution and positioning the entirety of the platform naturally having impact across our entire sales base. but i'll let aman comment.
aman narang -- chief operating officer
thanks, elena. i think you hit it actually. we are focused on scaling up our sales and marketing team, both on new business, as well as upsell and we're also scaling up our self-service capability into the e-commerce and toast shop to let our customers buy from us however they want.
will nance -- goldman sachs -- analyst
got it. thanks for taking my questions. appreciate all the color and very nice results today.
aman narang -- chief operating officer
thank you.
operator
thank you, will. your next question is from the line of dave koning with baird. dave, your line is open.
dave koning -- baird -- analyst
hey, guys. a couple of questions. i guess, first of all, a little similar to the last one. your subscription revenue up 103%.
i think it was mid-40s growth in locations and mid-40s growth in average revenue per location. but how much of that is just bigger locations? and then how much of it is kind of what you described before, just a lot more selling to your kind of existing group of locations.
chris comparato -- chief executive officer
this is chris. i don't think it's -- go ahead, elena, if you want.
elena gomez -- chief financial officer
it's a little bit of both. i mean, first, just kudos to the sales team for their great execution and what you're seeing in the saas growth being over -- up 100% and having record locations. it's really adoption from both new and existing customers and also higher sale of booking, which is -- which we talked about on the script. and that's really coming back to the positioning of the entirety of the platform upfront, which is obviously really important and an indicator of our confidence in our ability to position the entirety of the platform and have a higher booking -- arpu booking at upfront.
chris comparato -- chief executive officer
yeah. one clarification is it's not -- one clarification is it's not bigger locations. it's just doing a much better job at selling the entirety of the platform, both upfront, as well as downstream. but it's not as if we're going after bigger locations.
it's really just making -- doing a better job at some of the platform story to existing locations that are similarly sized.
dave koning -- baird -- analyst
yeah. gotcha. that's what i was kind of getting at. so no, that's really -- that's great.
and i guess my second question, sequentially, i think your guidance is revenue up something like 19% to 24%. and i guess that's very normal seasonality to be up. but are all segments expected to be up kind of in that same range? or is there going to be some divergence?
elena gomez -- chief financial officer
yeah. i would say we're seeing strength across our entirety of our business.
dave koning -- baird -- analyst
ok. gotcha. a great job. thank you.
operator
thank you, dave. your next question is from the line of josh beck with keybanc. josh, your line is open.
josh beck -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
thank you for taking the question. i wanted to drill down on the subscription arpu, certainly continues to grow at a really nice clip, even though the multiproduct adoption just very slightly expanded less. so does this mean that your customers are gravitating toward some of these larger products? just not sure if there's any call out on the drivers there.
elena gomez -- chief financial officer
yeah. i mean i think --
chris comparato -- chief executive officer
yeah. i think what i'm hearing -- sorry, josh. effectively, our customers are telling us that they want more and more from the platform. so i think what you're seeing is you're seeing us better position the platform story upfront, as well as downstream.
and then they're telling us that they want to see even more innovation within those modules across the platform. so a good example is what elena referenced for payroll. we're doing a much better job at attaching payroll upfront, as well as upselling it downstream. but then restaurants are coming back to us saying, over time, we'd love for you to -- when you look at the employee value proposition to recruit onboard, develop, manage, pay, retain employees, that has its own roadmap of opportunity, and that will be over the long haul that we continue to innovate on top of the existing arpu base.
so we expect we will continue to see the modules used by average customer tick up but then we'll continue to evolve that module landscape over time.
josh beck -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
ok. great. and maybe just a follow-up on the guidance. certainly, you're taking up the full year revenue at the midpoint, nicely above the b, i think it's about $95 million.
just listening to the answers, it sounds like it's pretty broad-based across the business. any callouts where things just materialize quite a bit better than what you were maybe forecasting 90 days ago to drive this kind of upward revision in the full year?
elena gomez -- chief financial officer
yeah. no, i think heading into the year, if you think back 90 days ago, we had a little bit of omicron ahead, that was a big macro that we factored into our guidance. and what we've really seen is strong gpv growth and strong momentum in our business. and so that's really what's reflected in the guide.
and actually, i would say that what we're balancing now is the same thing. we're balancing the macro, we're balancing, making sure we're investing in a lean cost structure and just being prudent with what we see.
josh beck -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
fantastic. thank you both.
operator
thank you, josh. your next question is from the line of brent bracelin with piper sandler. brent, your line is open.
brent bracelin -- piper sandler -- analyst
thank you. i guess one for chris and a follow-up for elena. chris, you were excited about payroll, i think nine months ago, clearly, payroll continues to kind of perform well, both with new customer attach, and now it sounds like better cross on the installed base. you have 62,000 locations today, looking out three to five years, what's the potential here? do you think a third of those locations could attach to payroll? could you get that 50% penetration? love to better understand based on success here, where it could look like in five years?
chris comparato -- chief executive officer
yeah. i'm not going to give you a number, but what i know in talking to restaurants every day is that they need more technology capability to not just pay their employees, but to recruit, onboard, develop them, plan their schedules, pay them, and then retain them. so we see that value chain just within the employee stakeholder, and we build out a roadmap from there on what this piece of the platform could become. and it excites us because we know every restaurant needs this.
like every restaurant needs to get off of manual processes and spreadsheets to better attract and retain their employees and pay their employees and employees want to be paid faster. so we're excited about this section of the platform. it continues to perform well. but there's a long journey ahead on its potential.
i'm not going to give you a number, except that every restaurant grapples with how to attract and retain their employees. and we see opportunity there.
brent bracelin -- piper sandler -- analyst
got it. so like payroll is just the start of a much bigger ambition you have relative to layering on software?
chris comparato -- chief executive officer
exactly.
brent bracelin -- piper sandler -- analyst
perfect. and then elena, as a follow-up, clearly, everyone is asking about the cost structure and payback and philosophy. so i'm going to ask it a slightly different way. if i look at the plan here to lean in, you clearly are going to have some heavier free cash flow investments here this year and next, but you do have a strong balance sheet, $1.2 billion in cash.
even with those two years of heavy investments, it looks like you're going to have about $900 million in cash exiting 2023. my question for you is with that much cash, even after two years of heavy investments, is the model fully funded to a path to free cash flow? or do you think you'd have to raise more money? just trying to better understand how much cash you actually need to get to a positive free cash flow state. thanks.
elena gomez -- chief financial officer
yeah. no, it's a fair question. and i feel like we're in a good position where with our performance and consistent execution, we're looking to get to free cash flow breakeven in the -- over the near term, i would say, brent. so i'm not worried about additional funding needed to help us succeed and go after this opportunity.
brent bracelin -- piper sandler -- analyst
that's helpful. thank you. that's all i had.
operator
thank you, brent. next question is from the line of andrew bauch with smbc nikko. andrew, your line is open.
andrew bauch -- smbc nikko securities -- analyst
hey, guys. thanks for taking my question. just wanted to touch upon the international opportunity that you guys are starting to invest in this year. i mean, maybe what have you learned over the first three months? and what's the sort of timeline we should think about before you're actually launching live locations outside the u.s.?
elena gomez -- chief financial officer
yeah. no, that's a great question. we're in the early innings. and i would just remind you that our 2022 year is really a foundational year for us.
we've got a few customers live, and we're getting some really great feedback, and we're learning that the demand is strong. but that said, we're in the early innings, and this is sort of a multiyear journey for us. so i think we're a ways from having meaningful impact on our p&l, but we're encouraged by the early signal from the customers that we're engaging with.
andrew bauch -- smbc nikko securities -- analyst
yeah, absolutely. i mean even having a couple of live is a good test run. and then touching on a more modeling point. you mentioned that the hardware cost of goods sold came down pretty considerably as freight costs kind of came off-peak.
i mean it's even more impressive on a net new location basis. so how confident are you that line item kind of remains relatively stable through the rest of 2022? and does it even have room to come down over time?
elena gomez -- chief financial officer
yeah. no, we -- so you're right. we had some benefit in q1, some one-time benefits and also we had lower freight costs in q1. i do expect a little bit of a tick-up in q2.
but over the long term, i feel like we can keep -- definitely keep our payback periods in order, which is the goal of ours, but also i would remind you that we do anticipate hardware costs to remain elevated, but definitely something we can manage. and we've been strategically shifting to having more inventory, which is allowing us to lower that shipping cost. so i have a bit more visibility into that. but other than the uptick in q2, i think we've got a good handle on it.
andrew bauch -- smbc nikko securities -- analyst
great. fantastic quarter. thank you.
operator
thank you, andrew. we will now take our last question from the line of harshita rawat of bernstein. harshita, your line is open.
harshita rawat -- alliancebernstein -- analyst
hi. good afternoon. i want to ask about b2b. so you acquired xtrachef last year, cogs is a significant portion of your restaurant expense base.
tell us about how you're cross-selling xtrachef into your restaurants? and more importantly, in what ways can you participate in b2b or ap automation flows? thank you.
chris comparato -- chief executive officer
yeah, great question. i'll remind everyone that it's still early for xtrachef, and we're excited about the opportunity ahead. we just enabled our entire sales force to position and sell xtrachef in q1, so we're excited about their performance. it was ahead of our plan in q1, but we're very much in the early stages of the product roadmap on b2b.
for example, xtrachef today does a great job of ap automation, great job at inventory management and recipe management, so we can do really good fleet cost optimization. but over time, the opportunity for this section of the platform is very similar to payroll. if you think about the opportunity to better manage the books and work with accountants, the opportunity to better work with suppliers and consider bill pay to suppliers. so we see a tremendous opportunity in the back office around supplier management, and we're very much in the infancy of this product roadmap.
so that's exactly why we went after xtrachef, and they've been an integral part of our toast team in building out this vision, but a really good question.
harshita rawat -- alliancebernstein -- analyst
thank you.

chris comparato -- chief executive officer
thank you, michael, and good afternoon, everyone. toast delivered a strong first quarter, coming in well ahead of expectations across the board. we added a record number of net new locations to our platform as we continue to lead the digitization of the $800 billion restaurant industry and penetrate our $55 billion market opportunity. our performance is a function of continued execution on our three core growth drivers: increasing the number of restaurant locations on our platform, delivering product innovations, so restaurants use more of our platform to drive success with all of their stakeholders; and deepening our ability to serve all segments of the market.
despite being one of the largest industries in the world, restaurants have been underserved by technology with one of the lowest levels of digitization of any sector. running a restaurant is also an incredibly complex and competitive business. the pandemic, a tight labor market, supply chain constraints, and inflation have only magnified the challenges. the stakes have never been higher for restaurant owners to embrace technology to help them improve operational efficiency and increase sales so they can thrive in this dynamic new world.
over the next several years, we expect every restaurant to operate on a unified digital platform. and just like we've seen in other industries, restaurants that embrace a digital platform performed better. as the restaurant industry goes through this wholesale digital transformation, we expect restaurant spend on technology to increase closing the gap with other industries. amid this secular shift to digital in the cloud, toast is executing on a generational opportunity to become the trusted partner restaurants need and to serve as the industry's technology backbone.
we are leading restaurants into a new era of hospitality. with our laser focus on restaurants and a proven track record of innovation, we've built the best-in-class platform that offers restaurants everything they need to win, to delight their guests, attract and retain employees, manage supplier relationships and ultimately do what they love and thrive. we understand the unique needs of restaurants of any size or concept in a way that no other platform can and we are adding more capabilities to help serve every segment of the market and expand our reach. now turning to our results for the quarter.
revenue increased 90% year over year to $535 million in the first quarter, and arr increased 66% year over year to $637 million. this was driven by an acceleration in subscription revenue growth from the addition of new locations and continued customer adoption of our growing portfolio of products, as well as strong growth in gpv. customers using four or more core modules beyond point-of-sale and payments reached 60% in q1, contributing to the robust 103% year-over-year growth in subscription revenue. gpv on our platform increased 98% year over year to $18 billion in q1.
and for the first time ever, we exceeded 5,000 net new locations in a quarter. we ended q1 with approximately 62,000 live locations on our platform, up nearly 45% year over year, and we're still just scratching the surface of this massive long-term opportunity. even as our arr has more than tripled over the past two years, it still represents only about 1% of our $55 billion market opportunity in the u.s. on the back of our strong start to the year, we increased our full year revenue guidance by 6% at the midpoint of the range, which implies 48% year-over-year growth.
we also improved our adjusted ebitda outlook as we focus on driving efficient growth. i want to add additional context on our investment levels this year. our q1 results are further evidence of the momentum in our business and the reason we have conviction to invest to capture the massive market opportunity in front of us. at the same time, the current environment calls for heightened discipline and we're actively evaluating our spend to make sure we scale in a sustainable, efficient manner.
that means identifying efficiency opportunities throughout our business and directing our investments only to areas that drive growth and have a proven return profile. we've shown in the past we can grow efficiently and deliver profits with a proven go-to-market approach that gains leverage with scale, healthy unit economics and disciplined cost management. we're confident we will drive sustained strong growth and healthy long-term profitability. our updated guidance implies a margin improvement in the second half of the year and we expect to continue on that trajectory moving forward.
now i want to turn to how we're executing on our core growth drivers. as the restaurant industry undergoes the secular shift to digital in the cloud, driving location growth is a key priority, and we're leaning into this in a number of ways to build on our momentum. we continue to benefit from our proven scalable go-to-market formula. the restaurant industry is a uniquely local business and our model feeds on that.
as we've seen in our most established markets as our penetration increases and more customers in a market experience our superior product offering, the number of referrals and inbound leads accelerate, creating a flywheel effect that drives strong and efficient growth. we're investing in less developed markets to build that same flywheel. and as we build this muscle broadly across more markets, we expect it to continue to drive efficient location growth. not only are we rapidly adding locations, we are seeing that our new customers are leveraging more of our products from the onset, a strong signal of the demand for our broader platform.
software arpu for locations booked in q1 approximately doubled from just two years ago. we've seen strong uptake for our guest modules as we've significantly enhanced our products to help customers cater to the evolving guest needs over the past two years. our payroll and team management offering is also building momentum, and we continue to see a significant opportunity to attach more products to our existing customer base, an important indication of our long-term arpu growth potential. let me share with you a few examples of the strong demand we are seeing across restaurant segments.
this quarter, we expanded our relationship with union square hospitality group, which has created some of new york's most beloved restaurants, cafes, and bars. they're expanding toast to 16 total locations, including gramercy tavern, union square cafe, the modern, and their daily provisioned concepts. in addition to our toast go handheld point-of-sale and kitchen operations, ushg will manage their multiple concepts and menu configurations using our multi-location menu management. they are also planning on using toast for hotel restaurants to manage their marta location, allowing them to seamlessly charge the hotel rooms during the payment process.
this quarter, we also expanded our relationship with nothing bundt cakes, a national bakery chain. nothing bundt cakes expanded its relationship with toast, purchasing our product for 70 new locations in q1, which would increase our partnership to over 500 locations in the next 12 months. they are using toast to drive revenue and help build a seamless purchase process for their guests. tacombi, a growing fast-casual mexican food chain, expanded with toast in q1.
they were live with toast in 13 locations using our toast go, our toast flex, and multi-location management products, and they signed a contract to add several more locations in the next 12 months using all of these products. additionally, tacombi is adding our kitchen display system in their current locations. in addition to our broad and growing platform, we also continue to grow our extensive partner ecosystem, which now includes more than 180 partners across large national food and beverage suppliers, technology integration partners, and local partners. this quarter, we extended our reseller partnership with u.s.
foods, a leading foodservice distributor that works with approximately 250,000 restaurants and foodservice operators. we focused on continuing to strengthen our partner network to give our customers seamless access to every product and service they need, further enhancing the value our platform provides. shifting to product innovation. i talk to many of our customers every quarter and a consistent theme i hear is they didn't get into the restaurant industry because they love technology, but they do realize that the industry is going through a digital transformation and they need a partner who they can grow with so they can do what they love.
that's why we consider toast an extension of r&d for the restaurant industry. we give restaurants all the tools they need to run their business, integrated point-of-sale and payments mobile ordering and delivery, marketing and loyalty, team management, friction access -- frictionless access to capital, and a growing array of integrated services to meet the evolving needs of our customers. we've built an array of products that serve restaurant owners at their core, but also create a better experience for all stakeholders in the restaurant ecosystem, guests, employees, and suppliers. there tends to be a flywheel between happier employees, leading to happier restaurant guests and both contributing to more successful, better-run restaurants.
we're continuing to invest in products to further differentiate our platform by enhancing and deepening the touchpoints between restaurants and each stakeholder. and with our integrated platform, as restaurants add more of our products, it strengthens the flywheel, creating powerful network effects for our customers. in supplier management, we're making great progress with our xtrachef product, which provides accounts payable automation and inventory management. with restaurants facing supply chain challenges and inflation, we're seeing just how important it is to help our customers manage profitability by easily comparing the cost of a menu item versus what they're charging.
and longer term, we have opportunities to expand the services we offer restaurants in this area and further optimize and automate their supplier management. our payroll and team management products speed up employee onboarding, simplify payroll and ensure employees are paid on time. with restaurants still facing labor challenges, if you're not providing a great employee experience and paying your employees quickly, it will be more difficult for you to hire and retain great talent, which impacts the guest experience and sales. we believe both selling payroll into our existing customer base and continuing to innovate in this space to help restaurants offer employees even more services that can differentiate them in this tough labor market represent meaningful growth opportunities going forward.
as we continue to build scale and drive growth in our core segments, another key growth strategy is to position toast to increase penetration in all restaurant segments and expand to new markets. with our laser focus on serving the restaurant industry, we're uniquely able to adapt our platform to meet the specific needs of different types of restaurants. one example from this quarter is targeted for quick-service restaurants. we've built an offering that better suits the needs of these restaurants and helps them get results even quicker.
as i mentioned, we also announced toast for hotel restaurants, a new solution designed to meet the unique needs of hotel restaurant operators. toast now integrates with several hotel management software providers, allowing us to better serve this segment and we're focused on continuing to adapt our product and packaging to serve the specific needs of each type of restaurant in order to drive deeper penetration across segments. in addition, as we discussed last quarter, we've seeded an initial investment in international this year. we believe our best-in-class product offering and go-to-market approach translate well to other markets, which will enable us to tap into our broader tam and become another driver -- growth driver longer term.
before closing, i wanted to thank our customers and employees, the restaurant industry remains resilient even amid the many macro challenges across the globe, and we are incredibly proud to be able to partner with our customers as they navigate these challenges and thank you to our great employees for helping get toast off to a great start in 2022 and build on our terrific operating momentum. we're still very early in our journey. and we're confident that by continuing to relentlessly execute on our strategy, we'll create significant value for our customers and shareholders over the long term. finally, before i pass the call over to elena to go through our financials, i want to congratulate her on her one-year anniversary at toast.
what an incredible year it's been. elena, i'm excited to partner with you on this journey ahead. and now, elena, i'll turn it over to you.
elena gomez -- chief financial officer
thanks, chris. one year went really fast. and equally, i'm excited about the partnership. and thank you, everyone, for joining.
to start, i wanted to echo chris in thanking both our customers for their continued partnership and the entire toast team, whose dedication and tireless work led to another great quarter. it's thanks to them that we got off to a great start in 2022 coming in ahead of our expectations across our key metrics. this is evidence of our solid operating momentum and the power of our industry-leading platform. we're still in the very early stages of this massive opportunity to provide restaurants with all the products and services they need as the industry transitions to digital and navigates new challenges.
as chris mentioned, the number of net new locations added to our platform accelerated in q1 to over 5,000 and we ended the quarter with approximately 62,000 locations. driving location growth is one of our key priorities, and we're investing to build on this momentum and continue to efficiently increase our market penetration. total revenue grew 90% year over year to $535 million and arr hit $637 million as of the end of q1, up 66% from last year. as we've discussed, arr is our core operational metrics and the best indication of our underlying growth, and we continue to see healthy trends in both our recurring revenue streams, saas, and payments, which underpin our arr growth.
subscription services revenue growth accelerated to a robust 103% in the first quarter, driven by our strong growth in new locations, as well as increasing adoption of our portfolio of saas products by new and existing customers. as of march 31, 2022, 60% of our toast locations used four or more core products, on top of our integrated pos and payment solutions compared to 51% a year ago, reflecting the benefit of our continued product innovation. with customers using more of our end-to-end platform, our saas arpu continues to increase at a healthy clip. the growing arpu is particularly evident in our new locations.
the average saas arpu for new bookings in q1 has more than doubled in just two years to nearly 6,000 as customers continue to adopt more of our products at booking. in addition, we still have a meaningful opportunity to drive deeper product adoption among our existing customer base over time. we believe the trends in new bookings and the upsell opportunities point to a long runway to drive continued arpu growth. one example is the growing adoption of our payroll product, which chris alluded to.
in q1, approximately 30% of our total bookings included toast payroll on initial sales, up from 15% last year. we're seeing early benefits from expanding our sales efforts to focus on existing restaurants that switch to the toast platform. in addition, the majority of new restaurant openings coming on to our platform continue to attach toast payroll at the time of booking. we're still early in this opportunity and as an example where we can continue to increase attach rates of bookings and drive upsell to existing customers to drive further arpu growth.
longer term, we have the potential to layer on more features and services for our restaurant employees, helping our customers differentiate themselves in a tight labor market while unlocking incremental monetization on our platform. moving to financial technology solutions. revenue grew 93% to $438 million. fintech solutions gross profit, which is net of payment transaction costs and what we operationally -- what we operationally as a second component of our recurring revenue, was $91 million in the quarter, a 66% year-over-year increase.
that was driven by gpv growth of 98% to $18 billion. annualized gpv per processing location remained strong at an average of $1.2 million. as a reminder, we typically see seasonally higher gpv per processing locations in the second and third quarter. as we noted last quarter, our debit and credit mix has returned to pre-covid trends, while the mix of card, not present volumes, continues to moderate with consumers increasingly returning to dining and restaurants.
total gross profit grew 38% year over year and 23% quarter over quarter to $101 million. gross margin improved by over 250 basis points compared to q4 to 18.9%, boosted by improvements across our subscription services, fintech solutions, and hardware margins. looking at our recurring revenue strength subscription and fintech growth profit totaled $135 million for a 73% increase year over year, reflecting the strong customer growth and healthy arpu increases across both saas and fintech solutions. turning to our customer acquisition costs.
we're focused on maintaining efficient unit economics as we invest to scale the business and our track record of attractive payback periods continue to give us the confidence to lean into the significant opportunity in front of us. as a reminder, operationally, we manage our hardware and professional services growth profit as customer acquisition costs. hardware costs remain elevated and increased year over year due to higher freight and product costs related to supply chain dynamics. compared to q4, hardware costs improved quarter over quarter as trade expenses declined off peak levels, and we benefited from one-time adjustments.
we're in the process of strategically increasing our hardware inventory, enabling us to shift to lower-cost shipping methods while continuing to deliver products to our customers in a timely manner. while we expect hardware costs to remain high over the next few quarters, we believe they will normalize over time as we leverage lower-cost shipping methods and focus on optimizing other parts of our supply chain. sales and marketing is our other customer acquisition expense. after reducing our sales force at the onset of covid, we're investing to rebuild the team in order to continue to drive market share.
as part of that investment, we're strengthening our presence in less penetrated areas. the power of our go-to-market approach is that we increased market share in a territory, we see increasing inbound leads through referrals and from brand awareness, resulting in higher productivity for our sales reps. that flywheel effect enables us to scale efficiently as we gain traction. and we're investing to build the foundation to kick-start that flywheel in more and more markets.
even as we increased investment in sales and marketing, we've maintained consistent efficiency. we believe measuring sales and marketing expense as a percentage of recurring revenue is the best indication of how we're executing. sales and marketing as a percent of recurring revenue declined significantly after the cost cuts in the first half of 2020 and has now held in the same range, seven quarters since then. that's been driven by an increasing number of new locations we're adding to the platform each quarter and continued growth in arpu.
this gives us further conviction to lean into the large opportunity we have ahead. as we do so, we continue to manage our unit economics, and we're confident that as we gain scale, we'll deliver leverage on our sales and marketing costs over time. moving down the p&l. we're also investing in research and development to build out our platform.
this includes deepening the integration and features on newer products like payroll and xtrachef, which we believe represents strong monetization opportunities longer term. in addition, as chris mentioned, we're adding capabilities to better serve different restaurant segments, which will position us to penetrate segments where we've typically had less of a presence. similar to last quarter, the increase in general and administrative costs were mainly due to public company-related expenses. overall, adjusted ebitda of negative $45 million in q1 was better than our expectations.
the outperformance reflects continued strength in gpv and saas revenue growth in addition to the progress on reducing hardware costs as we navigate the challenging macro environment. now let me turn to guidance. for the second quarter, we expect revenues to be in the range of $635 million to $665 million, which represents 53% year-over-year growth at the midpoint. we expect the adjusted ebitda to be in the range of $60 million to negative $50 million.
for the full year, we're increasing our revenue expectations by 6% at the midpoint to reflect the momentum in software revenue growth and our expectation for gpv growth to remain strong. we now expect full year revenue to be in the range of $2.5 billion to $2.55 billion, which represents 48% year-over-year growth at the midpoint. following our strong q1 performance, we're also raising our adjusted ebitda guidance to be in the range of negative $195 million to negative $175 million for 2022. this reflects the targeted investments we're making across sales and marketing and research and development to drive the core growth strategies that chris highlighted.
given the incredible demand for our product, growing arpu as customers do more with us, and the massive market opportunity in front of us, we're confident that these investments will deliver strong returns. while these investments are resulting in higher burn today, make no mistake, we remain focused on working toward long-term profitability and the current environment has only increased our urgency. we're actively driving efficiencies across the company and tightly managing all discretionary spend in order to help fund our key growth initiatives while improving profitability. making sure we have a lean cost structure is a priority.
it will enable us to stay nimble as we rapidly grow and gain operating leverage with scale. our guidance implies that ebitda margins will improve by 200 basis points in the second half of the year compared to the first half, and we're positioning the business to continue to deliver consistent margin improvement with durable top-line growth in 2023 and beyond. in closing, we're off to a great start in 2022, evidence of our strong execution and industry-leading platform. the restaurant industry is going through a generational shift to digital.
and our priority is to further cement our leadership position as the trusted platform of choice for the restaurant industry. we believe through our portfolio of offerings, we can help restaurants boost sales, improve efficiency, retain employees, and thrive in one of the most competitive industries. and as we execute on that, we believe it will translate into strong durable growth and healthy profits over the long term. now i'll turn the call back over to the operator to start our q&a.

operator
[operator instructions]. the first question is from the line of will nance with goldman sachs. please proceed.
will nance -- goldman sachs -- analyst
hey, guys. good afternoon. nice results today. i wanted to ask on some of the comments that you made around operating leverage starting in next year as well as a lot of the progress that you've made year-to-date in controlling costs and, obviously, raising the ebitda margin expectations for the year.
i don't think you guys have given a long-term profitability target, but i think last quarter, you guys talked about kind of getting the cash flow breakeven over the near term. i'm wondering if you can kind of update us on your latest thoughts on when you guys would expect to get there over the next couple of quarters, particularly as we look out to 2023 and you're kind of signaling more operating leverage to come.
elena gomez -- chief financial officer
yes. thanks for the question. so hopefully, you can tell that improving profitability is one of our biggest priorities. and we've made great progress in the first half of the year on ebitda, and you can see that reflected in our guidance.
and we believe we'll exit this year in a position to balance the investments of growth and margin improvement. and i just want to be mindful of the macro. so i mentioned in my prepared remarks that our guidance reflected some of that, which is also part of the reason we didn't want to give guidance beyond 2022 because we want to be incredibly balanced in that. and we also, frankly, want to take advantage of this market opportunity that's presented to us.
we still believe and have a ton of conviction that there's a lot of growth to come, and we're in the early innings. so we're trying to balance that growth with also cost discipline, as you guys can see in our results.
will nance -- goldman sachs -- analyst
got it. that's helpful. and then maybe just a follow-up on some of the take rate dynamics in the quarter. i know you mentioned mix and then some of the optimization things going on.
any color on the recent kind of small business interchange changes that the networks announced? and how much -- how meaningful that was to you guys net take rate?
elena gomez -- chief financial officer
yes. the biggest impact really was the mix shift from credit -- from debit to credit. so that's really the primary driver, offset by some of our own cost optimization efforts. so i would say that's the primary story.
there is nothing different to report on that.
will nance -- goldman sachs -- analyst
got it. appreciate taking the questions.
operator
thank you. the next question is from the line of josh baer with morgan stanley. please proceed.
josh baer -- morgan stanley -- analyst
thanks for the question, and great quarter. wanted to ask about the 6,000-plus location additions. any more commentary on regions of strength or market segments that were driving the location additions or any big restaurant groups, restaurant chains? just looking for more context on that success on the location number.
chris comparato -- chief executive officer
yes, josh. good question. on the whole, the bookings trends remain really solid, and we're pleased with how the sales team is executing across the board. and we're pretty encouraged with the incremental demand from some of our recent  product announcements.
the team continues to do quite well in fsr as well as qsr. and i'd say it's broad growth across the board. and there's no segment specific breakout. it's really just been across the board.
josh baer -- morgan stanley -- analyst
ok. got it. and then one on sling. any financial impact to the model to call out?
elena gomez -- chief financial officer
the impact of sling is just not material to the numbers today. so we're not going to call it out.
josh baer -- morgan stanley -- analyst
ok. great. thank you.
operator
thank you. the next question comes from the line of stephen sheldon with william blair. please proceed.
stephen sheldon -- william blair -- analyst
hey, good afternoon. congrats on the really strong performance here. wanted to ask about consumer behavior. i think you said you're being a little cautious with your assumptions there in the guidance.
but just based on the visibility you have, have there been any shifts in the way consumers are engaging with your restaurant clients as the macro environment has gotten tougher, as consumer sentiment has weakened here? any general changes to call out there during the quarter and into july?
chris comparato -- chief executive officer
sure. thanks, stephen. first, we're not seeing any signs of a drop in consumer demand or pull back in spending in our business. restaurants are seeing healthy demand.
consumers continue to spend on services like dining, and the gpv trends are strong. that said, we're pretty mindful of the mixed macroeconomic signals, and we're monitoring closely. we still have -- and even through july, we haven't seen any pullback on consumer demand. and while we're not immune, consumer spend at restaurants has held up relatively well during past recessions, and we've been looking at past recessions.
and we feel pretty confident in what consumers will spend within the restaurant market. and then the last point i'd make is for restaurants, our platform becomes even more valuable in a tough market. so if we did see signal, you could rest assured that we've got scenarios planned, and we feel like our platform is in a good spot to help restaurants adapt and navigate uncertainty. so we feel pretty good on that consumer dimension.
stephen sheldon -- william blair -- analyst
very helpful. and then just as a follow-up. as you talk about a bigger focus on profit and margins, just want to make sure i understand how you plan to manage things there. is that more -- the margins will continue to stabilize? or are you also expecting absolute losses to moderate as we think about 2023 and beyond?
elena gomez -- chief financial officer
yes. i mean i think the way to think about it is what you guys probably don't see is we're metering our hiring and really focusing on investments in high roi areas. we're taking a deep inspection in areas that don't drive revenue today and being incredibly ruthless in our prioritization there. and so as we think about margins, you should see a steady improvement over time and a commitment from this management team to get to breakeven and profitability over the near term.
operator
thank you. the next question is from the line of dj hynes with canaccord. please proceed.
dj hynes -- canaccord genuity -- analyst
hey, guys. thanks for taking the questions, and congrats on the results. chris, just thinking strategically in context of the industry challenges you mentioned, right, you guys have tons of data. you have areas of regional concentration.
you talked about heightened food cost. is there an opportunity to create a group purchasing solution? like would that make sense as part of the finance suite? i know there are others that do this, but i just think that you guys would be really well positioned to participate in that opportunity.
chris comparato -- chief executive officer
yes, dj. it's a good question. i'm not going to comment specifically on that opportunity. but as elena had mentioned in her script, about 20% of our r&d investment goes toward medium- and longer-term growth initiatives.
this includes opportunities that sit within our existing product portfolios. for example, xtrachef and what we could be doing with xtrachef over the long term. you look at team management and what we could be doing with payroll, now with sling and with pay card in the future. so each of our product lines of business within the platform have substantial innovation ahead of them.
and then on top of that, we continue to experiment and invest in new ventures. and these are things that i'm not going to talk about today, but we're planting the seeds for how restaurants will thrive in the future. and we're talking five to 10 years down the road, basically the next acts for how we think restaurants will operate. so this 20% of our r&d is super important because you'll continue to see us experiment, listen to our customers and then adapt to their needs.
but i'm not going to speak specifically to group purchasing as an idea.
dj hynes -- canaccord genuity -- analyst
yes. yes. understood. we'll stay tuned there.
elena, just on the 68,000 locations, can you remind us the ballpark mix of quick serve versus full service and how that feeds into the distribution curve of gpv per location?
aman narang -- chief operating officer
ok. dj, so this is aman, by the way. we had -- look, if you look at our quick serve segment of the market, we have had customers in quick serve for a long time. that's been core to how we've grown.
and over time, we have added capability within our platform to help serve this segment better. and so a couple of things. one, in q2, we saw that as a percentage of our overall bookings, qsr increase, and we're confident that, that can continue going forward as well. as chris mentioned, you saw jamba, right, piloting in the enterprise space, jamba [inaudible] our kiosk solutions.
and really, if you look at our core capabilities that we offer, that qsr we depend on, some of the things that i'll highlight, one, are [inaudible] display, right, our self-ordering kiosk, our kitchen display screens, online ordering and loyalty. and then some of the capabilities that i think are unique to the toast platform that qsrs really benefit from are things like -- a little bit specific, but [inaudible] of a buzzer for example, the ability for a [inaudible] to text someone when their food is ready. mobile order and pick, the ability to add to order to see you go through the line and then add -- want to add a coffee or dessert later, right? toast delivery services, the ability to have integrated delivery is partly online ordering or single-use promo codes. and so there's a lot within that platform that's easily accessible for qsr, and that's what gives us confidence in our opportunity ahead in the segment.
dj hynes -- canaccord genuity -- analyst
ok. thanks for the color, guys. i appreciate it.
operator
thank you. the next question is from the line of timothy chiodo with credit suisse. please proceed.
timothy chiodo -- credit suisse -- analyst
i want to talk -- given your comments about the restaurant operating environment, i want to see if you could give us some more context around when we look at your gross adds, so not the net adds, but the gross adds, and we think about what portion of those are coming from either a brand-new restaurant that was just started, just a brand-new company versus an existing restaurant that either is using another system or no system, what is the mix of that within your gross adds? and then the follow-up is, has the trend in that mix been pretty stable? or has it changed over time?
chris comparato -- chief executive officer
yes. so, tim, it's a good question. it's really a balanced growth across our bookings and our net adds. we certainly see restaurants that are already operating move to toast, and they believe in a digital platform.
and these are existing restaurants that are hyper local go-to-market team, knows how to tap into, and we see those restaurants move to toast. secondly, we're seeing restaurants already on toast expand, and those are net adds as well. so we're seeing quite a bit of expansion within our portfolio from existing customers. and then thirdly, we certainly see net new locations in the form of new constructions.
and it's always been a sort of a balanced attack across those three. i think as a reminder, i want to remind you that we're still [inaudible] of the u.s. total addressable market. so our reps in these markets have a lot of surface area to go after, and we're in the early innings of them penetrating these markets to create, call it, flywheel market.
so it's a little bit of a balancing attack in these markets across those three dimensions. the other thing that i'll mention is beyond net adds -- just remember that net adds on locations is only one lever that we play with. the second lever is arpu. so as we win a customer and build trust, we're growing more of the platform that the average restaurant is using.
and that's a really important lever for us because restaurants are adopting more and more of our modules. so it's a little bit of a balanced attack across those growth levers.
timothy chiodo -- credit suisse -- analyst
excellent. thank you for the context.
operator
thank you. our next question is from the line of josh beck with keybanc. please proceed.
josh beck -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
thank you for taking the question. i wanted to ask a little bit about some of the secondary effects of what you're seeing in the industry. obviously, restaurants, like you said, have record inflation in a lot of their input costs. so i'm just curious if that is effectively pressing the case for automation and if, in any way, it's helping either improve the top of the funnel activity or the sales cycle in any way.
chris comparato -- chief executive officer
yes. so i'll start with macro. and so we've been at this for 10 years. and at the macro, we fundamentally believe that the restaurant industry is going to shift.
that's a secular shift to a unified digital platform that powers all of the stakeholders across the landscape. and it's been in existence for 10 years, and it's going to continue for many years to come. so we're seeing restaurants transition to digital, both to drive same-store sales, to drive operational efficiency, to drive staff productivity and then to drive automation in the back office. so it's really across the spectrum, josh.
and i think in the back office, there's a unique opportunity for restaurants to really understand food cost optimization. it starts with xtrachef, and that's why we're seeing momentum with xtrachef, but it's going to go beyond xtrachef with innovations in the back office that help restaurants understand their menu profitability, understand where they're wasting money, understand where they can drive better pricing and better food costs, as i mentioned. so i think we're just in the early stages of the opportunity in and around xtrachef. and it's exciting for us because we're helping restaurants really adapt and adapt quickly in the back office.
aman, i don't know if you want to add anything else to that.
aman narang -- chief operating officer
i think, look, the xtrachef launch has been strong for toast. we only started selling this in q1. and i think what's exciting about what we're doing with xtrachef is how easy it is for restaurateurs to be able to process invoices just by taking a picture on their phones, right? and that allows our accountants and restaurateurs to actually get a sense of food cost really efficiently. and one example is one of our customers out of cincinnati, they -- with all the inflation that we're all seeing, notice just through the reporting with the xtrachef [inaudible] scanning invoices, they saw the cost of beef and potatoes were up 20% less.
and just getting that visibility allows them to pay attention to it, and they're able to find a different provider for beef. they looked at ways to increase -- to purchase in bulk and profit increase on the burgers by 20%, which is the top  item they sell. and it's really meaningful, right, for -- given just as chris mentioned, how much of a restaurant spend is on food.
josh beck -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
very helpful. maybe just a follow-up on the subscription arpu. it certainly seems to have had another nice sequential jump this quarter. my thought was that maybe that would slow down a bit as we went from, say, more front office-oriented adoption maybe during -- and coming out of the pandemic to maybe more back-office types of functionality.
so just would be curious to unpack that within the quarter. and then, really, how we should think about the pace of expansion moving forward?
elena gomez -- chief financial officer
yes. no, i think it's a good call out. so as you can tell from our prepared remarks, increasing arpu is such an important part of our growth strategy. and we continue to see the sales team execute.
we talked about toast shop. we talked about our growth team and our sell team. and then really, our go-to-market team, our reps are very good at positioning the entirety of the platform. they've been trained to do that and to really position that upfront.
so all of that, combined with the innovation that you're seeing in team management and xtrachef, is really coming together to drive that outcome that you're seeing. so we feel confident that we'll continue to see progress on arpu. i won't guide to it specifically, but you continue to see -- as we add new customers, our newer customers are actually having higher arpu as well, which i mentioned in my prepared remarks. so really encouraging.
and if i look at what's really driving that, it's a combination of our core products -- our core commerce products, but also xtrachef and payroll, which are very early for us. so really encouraging to see that growth.
operator
thank you. our next question is from the line of david koning with baird. please proceed.
david koning -- baird -- analyst
yes. hey, guys. thanks so much. nice job.
and maybe if i could ask just the arpu has been going up so consistently, i think five quarters in a row of 7% to 12% yield growth, i guess, you could say arpu growth in that subscription line. do you have insight into how fast that grows in the future? or are we at a point now -- i can't imagine it continuing to grow quite that rapidly on a sequential basis. but is there a way for you to almost see -- give some insight, like could that grow 3% sequentially for a while still? or how should we think about that?
elena gomez -- chief financial officer
yes. i just answered that. but at the highest level, obviously, that's something that we're completely used on. i'm not going to guide, obviously, to the future.
but what i can tell you is, as we're bringing on more locations, the newer customers that are coming on are coming on with more products. so that should give you a sign that as we're growing, and we're growing fast, we'll start to see that improve over time.
david koning -- baird -- analyst
ok. and then secondly, just on the hardware revenue. that's been pretty stable, 29 to 31 or so per quarter for a long time. but inventory has grown significantly, i think up 40% sequentially, up 100% year-over-year, give or take.
why isn't hardware revenue growing faster? and maybe how should we see that in the future?
elena gomez -- chief financial officer
yes. so there's a couple of things. so we did -- there's a couple of things going on there. one is we had lower year-over-year growth in our new customers.
so q2 was our strongest quarter ever for net location adds. but keep in mind, q1 last year was still depressed by covid. so the year-over-year growth rate in q1 was meaningfully higher. and then even while our realized price for hardware sales improved, gaap accounting requires us to proportionately allocate revenue across bundled products.
so this meant we shifted some revenue out of hardware in q2. but on the whole, when you take out the noise, i look at the revenue and say it's been relatively consistent.
operator
thank you. and our next question --
elena gomez -- chief financial officer
i would -- i'll also add that -- and i mentioned this in my prepared remarks. we have been strategically adding inventory to insulate us from supply chain -- near-term supply chain issues. so i feel confident that our guide reflects all of that.
operator
thank you. our next question is from the line of andrew bauch with smbc nikko. please proceed.
andrew bauch -- smbc nikko securities -- analyst
thanks for taking the questions. nice set of results here. i wanted to hone in on the gross margin side, and specifically, trying to understand kind of pricing flexibility you have be it in saas or on fintech solutions. and then on the cost of revenue side, can you give us a little bit more color on where you can drive efficiency in fintech and in saas?
elena gomez -- chief financial officer
yes. so i love the question because you're reinforcing something that we think is really important to our business model, which is the opportunity to monetize both on the fintech side and on the saas. so that's an important part of our model over time. on the fintech side, we have opportunities to continue to drive more volume to our platform, which obviously would drive more gpv on our platform and higher take rates.
but then at the same time, and we've mentioned this a few times, we have a team really focused on cost optimization. and these are operational things that they're doing behind the scenes, including some r&d efforts, etc. so the combination of those two is sort of how we think about the monetization and the pricing impacts over time on fintech. and then on the saas side, obviously, we're going to continue to innovate.
and the combination of those two really drive over time our ability to continue to grow.
andrew bauch -- smbc nikko securities -- analyst
got it. and then i know it's still early days, but a lot of questions have been asked here. so any update on the investments you've made in international and what you learned thus far that's working or may be scaling back?
elena gomez -- chief financial officer
yes. no, we're still very committed to international. our investment, as you guys know, wasn't a significant investment, but it's perceiving as planned. we have some early customers.
the reit is really good with those initial customers. and just as [inaudible], their 2022 is really a year of building the foundation. so this is a multiyear journey for us. and like you said, very early innings, but we're encouraged by what we see with the initial customers we have.
operator
thank you. our last question will come from the line of jeff cantwell with wells fargo. please proceed.
jeff cantwell -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
thank you for squeezing me in. i wanted to ask you a quick one on efficiency. and your slide 11 talks about two-thirds of your new locations are coming from inbound channels, and one-fifth are coming from restaurant partner referrals. so can you just remind us what that might have looked like a year ago, two years ago? i just want to get a sense of how the trend is about over time because i think that has implications for your ability to continue to scale and grow more efficient over time.
so i was just hoping for any additional color you might provide on that. thank you.
aman narang -- chief operating officer
sure. thanks for the question. look, i think we're seeing consistency in our funnel, whether across segments, as chris mentioned earlier. the percentage of inbound, percentage of referrals has remained consistent.
and i think the thing that we're most focused on is continue to invest in our go-to-market team and our customer-facing teams because we know that as we increase tenure on the sales reps and we increase market density, that's the no. 1 driver of efficiency and growth in our business.
jeff cantwell -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
ok. great. and then on your arr, can you talk just a little bit more about that? because we noticed that the growth come from last year was pretty impressive growth this quarter off of a growth come from last year. so can you just remind us about typical seasonality, 1q, 2q, 3q, just so we can be aware of what expectations should be for arr as we look at it up? thanks again.
elena gomez -- chief financial officer
yes. i think the way to think about it is two things. one is both from a location standpoint, typically, q2 is our highest -- or seasonally higher than q3, and then it comes back in q4. so that's the location side.
gpv per location also tends to be higher in the summer months. so just keep that in mind. so that's probably the two things i'd say about seasonality.
operator
thank you. i would now like to turn the call back over to the presenters.
chris comparato -- chief executive officer
ok. thank you, everyone. we appreciate your time. we appreciate the good questions, and we'll be in touch.
so have a great night.

chris comparato -- chief executive officer
thank you, michael, and good afternoon, everyone. toast continues to build on our operational momentum in q2, posting strong efficient growth, exceeding both our revenue and profit expectations, and delivering another record quarter of new location additions. this momentum stems from the consistent execution of our core growth strategy, driving location growth, deepening our ability to serve all segments of the restaurant industry and delivering product innovation for restaurants. on that front, last month, we announced the acquisition of sling to further expand our team management suite and help restaurants deepen their relationship with employees.
we're excited to welcome the sling team to the toast family. while we have tremendous momentum across our business, we're also cognizant of the current macroeconomic backdrop and what it means for our customers. restaurants are operating in a challenging environment, facing heightened food cost inflation, labor constraints, higher wages, and uncertainty in this broader economy. but the restaurant industry has faced challenges many times before and proven incredibly resilient over time.
restaurants adapted and bounced back from unprecedented conditions during covid and have successfully navigated prior economic downturns. it's a testament to how much people enjoy the restaurant experience. even in the most challenging times, people love eating out, and restaurants are often at the center of our communities. turning to our results for the quarter.
revenue increased 58% year-over-year to $675 million in the second quarter, and arr was up 59% to $787 million. gpv remains strong, growing 62% year-over-year to $23 billion in q2. we also continue  to drive on location growth. after adding over 5,000 net new restaurant locations in a quarter for the first time in q1, we now exceeded 6,000 net new restaurant locations in q2, just incredible growth that is being driven by our strong bookings pipeline as well as continued low churn.
as a result of our consistent execution and first half performance, we are raising our full year revenue guidance by 5% at the midpoint of the range, which implies 55% year-over-year growth. driving toward profitability is a key priority for our team, and the progress is clear in the significant adjusted ebitda margin improvement in q2. with the increased focus on efficiency and rigorous prioritization of our investment opportunities, we expect to sustain these improvements, and we're raising our adjusted ebitda outlook for 2022 by $35 million at the midpoint to reflect that. elena will provide more detail on our outlook shortly.
with the restaurant industry in the midst of a generational shift to cloud-based digital solutions, we continue to seamlessly execute our proven go-to-market strategy to capitalize on that opportunity. as we increase density in more established territories, we benefit from the flywheel effect that drives referrals and inbound leads, driving higher and more efficient productivity. at the same time, we're gaining traction in less developed markets and are on a path to replicate that flywheel effect as we gain share. in addition to the strong growth in new locations, customer churn remains low.
our industry-leading platform adds tremendous value to our customers, helping them grow and creating a passionate and loyal customer base. the success of the toast restaurants we support lie at the heart of our business model. we grow as our customers grow. in q2, we continue to see success with all formats and types of restaurants.
i'll highlight a few examples. in enterprise, we expanded our relationship with jamba juice by 40 locations, bringing our partnership to more than 700 total locations. as part of the expanded relationship, jamba is piloting the addition of the toast kiosk product to streamline checkout and help combat heightened labor costs. jamba juice showcases how toast is designed to increase throughput in high-volume environments like qsr and fast casual and how some of our largest customers continue to adopt more of our platform to increase efficiency and drive growth.
chip cookies selected toast in q2 to support its growing 13-location business. from making it back-of-house more efficient with our payroll, xtrachef, and multi-location management products to using our point-of-sale and delivery services to more efficiently serve customers, chip cookies saw the value of toast as an all-in-one solution that could help them grow while managing their business more efficiently. by leveraging more than 10 of our modules, chip cookies is a great example of how the benefits to customers increase as they leverage more of our integrated platform. while chip highlights how new customers are using more of our platform, we also have a significant opportunity to help customers find more ways to leverage the full expense of our platform to create value for their businesses.
our e-commerce offering, toast shop, provides customers an efficient self-service options to seamlessly add products and has been a consistent source of incremental saas arpu. last year, we also started a growth sales team, solely focused on selling to our existing customers to complement toast shop. we continue to invest in and evolve that team, and the second quarter marked the first time the entire growth team with selling our full product set. this enables each of our reps to efficiently partner with customers on ways to utilize the full breadth of our platform.
a good example of the benefit of our growth team that -- a good example of the benefit our growth teams can bring customers is maize mexican grill, a fast casual restaurant group. maize initially inquired about adding our loyalty product across its locations. our growth team worked with the customer to highlight the benefits of our full platform, which led to them adopting several of our guest products as well as payroll and xtrachef. this showcases the power of having a team focused on upsell and reps equipped to help customers take advantage of the full power of our integrated platform.
while we are pleased with the initial results, we're still early on in this area. we see a big opportunity to drive broader adoption of our platform among existing customers. one of toast's key differentiators is our focus on restaurants and our ability to deeply serve different customer segments regardless of size or format. earlier this year, we announced toast for hotel restaurants, a powerful new solution designed to meet the needs of hotel restaurant operators by seamlessly integrating leading hotel property management system with the toast platform.
as a result of that new capability, in q2, we signed a regional hotel chain for its full-service restaurant concept across over 10 locations. this hotel chain will use our handheld point-of-sale for table-side order and pay, our kitchen display systems to expedite orders and our multi-location management to efficiently manage menus. this is evidence of the opportunity we have to go much deeper in the hotel restaurant segment with our new offering.  shifting to products. as we continue to enable our customers to deeply connect with all of their stakeholders, i want to focus on the critical employee touch point.
in the midst of an extremely challenging labor market, winning the hearts and minds of employees is more important than ever. last month, we announced the acquisition of sling, a leading employee scheduling and communications solution. innovated scheduling and communications into our platform alongside our other team management products, including payroll, tips manager, and paycard, will help restaurants deepen their relationship with employees, more efficiently manage labor and create a differentiated employee experience. employee communications and scheduling is a high-engagement product, and it's also an important new touch point for toast, with more than 11 million restaurant workers in the u.s.
similar to our prior acquisitions, our relationship with sling started as a partnership, which launched early last year. the strong customer signal informed our view on how the product can enhance our entire team management suite. after incorporating sling into our sales motion, our win rate was higher when customers evaluated sling and payroll together compared to when only quoting payroll. this offers early proof of how sling complements our existing team management suite and can enhance overall value proposition to our customers.
with sling as part of the toast family, we plan to fully integrate the offering into our platform to provide customers a seamless experience. the acquisition also allows us to accelerate product development in alignment with the road map for our team management suite and continue to build features specifically targeted for our restaurant customers and their employees. sling makes our team management suite more robust and is another example of how, with our cloud-based platform, purpose built to meet the specific needs of restaurants, no partner is better positioned to help the industry adapt and thrive than toast. while restaurant industry sales have fully bounced back from covid and are above 2019 levels, as i noted earlier, restaurants are facing challenges.
labor and food are two -- are the two biggest expenses for restaurants, and the current environment has amplified the pressure on both. inflation is at a multi-decade high, and the restaurant workforce is still about 6% below pre-pandemic levels, creating staff and constraints. but our platform is built to help restaurants navigate these challenges. we provide restaurants with an array of products to automate processes and increase efficiency across their workflows so they can focus on what matters the most, the food, their guests, and their employees.
xtrachef not only automates manual invoice processing and inventory management, it also provides restaurant managers with real-time data on food cost trends to inform decisions on menu pricing and sourcing to help preserve profitability. with the help of xtrachef, [inaudible] valley hospitality group in texas was able to reduce costs by 3% on average across their locations, saving over $330,000 per year. this is an invaluable tool with food costs rising at historic levels, and we are seeing adoption of xtrachef increase as restaurants seek to optimize margins. products like our toast go handheld, kiosks, and mobile order and pay allows savvy operators to better manage labor expenses and employees to handle more orders per hour, leading to higher tests  while also providing a better guest experience.
more qsr and fast casual restaurants are rolling out these digital touch points for guests to overcome staffing shortages while meeting evolving customer preferences. and toast is well positioned to lead that transition. for example, new england lobster market & eatery, a fast casual restaurant, is using our mobile order and pay solution for the majority of its on-premise transactions. in addition to requiring less staff, tips have more than doubled and are automatically split among employees, helping the restaurant significantly reduce turnover without incremental wage pressure.
in summary, the toast platform is more relevant and valuable than ever to our customers as they navigate these changing conditions. as customers use more of our platform, they can drive efficiency across their business to mitigate costs while continuing to offer a great guest experience. simply put, our goal is to get restaurants all the tools they need to adapt and thrive. restaurants deserve a trusted partner who shares their vision for a future where the restaurant in the entire industry thrives, and their businesses flourish, a partner who helps restaurants spend more time delighting customers and less time confused by technology, a partner who will advocate for the industry, and toast is that partner.
in closing, i want to thank our employees for a great first half of the year. i'm proud of how we're executing and our team's tireless effort to add value for our customers. now i'll turn the call over to elena.
elena gomez -- chief financial officer
thanks, chris, and thank you, everyone, for joining. and a big thank you to the toast team. all your hard work and dedication to serving our customers led to another quarter of great results. both revenue and adjusted ebitda came in ahead of expectations in q2.
the power of our integrated software and payments model, together with our industry-leading platform, continue to drive strong top line growth. and our commitment to cost discipline was evident in our significant adjusted ebitda margin improvement. not only are we proud of the strong results this quarter, we're also excited to welcome the sling team to toast. as chris mentioned, sling strengthens our team management product suite and will serve to further differentiate our platform as we focus on being the technology backbone for the restaurant industry.
our proven go-to-market strategy investments to scale the sales team continues to pay off. net new location adds further accelerated in q2 to over 6,000, increasing the number of total live locations on our platform to approximately 68,000. the continued market share gains highlight the tremendous value our platform provides restaurants, which also contributes to our consistently low churn rate. it's worth noting that q2 is seasonally our strongest quarter for net location adds.
summer is the peak season for restaurants. and with some less likely to switch platforms during their busiest period, we typically add fewer new locations in q3 than in q2. we've seen the seasonal pattern in our business over several years and expect the same this year. that said, our pipeline remains strong.
the value proposition is clearly resonating, and we are well positioned to sustain our momentum. turning to our quarterly results. total revenue grew 58% year-over-year to $675 million. arr, which is our core operational metric, ended at -- ended q2 at $787 million, up 59% year-over-year and 24% compared to q1.
total arpu eclipsed 11,000 for the first time driven by strong growth in both our recurring revenue stream, saas, and payments. subscription services revenue increased 100% year-over-year in the second quarter, benefiting from our location growth and increased product adoption as both new and existing customers leverage more of our platform. as of the end of q2, 61% of our toast locations use four or more products on top of our integrated pos and payment solution, but even a higher percentage of new live customers join the platform with four or more products. as a result, saas arpu continues to increase for each new quarterly cohort of live customers and is above the average for our platform.
as we think about our long-term arpu potential, we also believe upsell will be a big contributor. as chris mentioned, our toast shop e-commerce store has been an efficient channel for existing customers to add products. with our gross sales team now complementing the e-commerce solution and all those reps selling our full array of products, we have an opportunity to drive deeper adoption of our products like xtrachef and payroll and help customers leverage more of our integrated platform to create value for their business. total upsell across toast shop and our growth sales team contributed over 20% of the incremental saas arr in q2, and we see a big opportunity to unlock incremental arpu growth over time.
on the fintech solutions side, revenue grew 59% to $562 million, and gross profit was up 54% year-over-year to $114 million in the quarter. as a reminder, saas revenue and fintech gross profit comprise what we operationally view as recurring revenue. fintech gross profit benefited from sustained strength in gpv, which increased 62% to $23 billion in q2. average annualized gpv per processing location was up 16% year-over-year to $1.4 million.
the growth in gpv per processing location is a result of both higher average ticket and the continued rebound in customer transaction, which was slightly below 2019 levels in q2. the net take rate of 49 basis points was within the range we expect in the near term. debit mix declined quarter-over-quarter, in line with typical seasonal patterns, partly offset by the benefit of our continued cost optimization efforts. total gross profit grew 33% year-over-year and 24% quarter-over-quarter to $125 million, resulting in gross margin of 18.5%.
looking at our recurring stream, subscription and fintech gross profit totaled $169 million, up 67% year-over-year, driven by our continued location growth and strong arpu increases across both saas and fintech solutions. looking at customer acquisition costs. we continue to tightly manage unit economics to maintain healthy payback periods even as we navigate headwinds on the hardware side and invest to scale the business. as we noted last quarter,  hardware margin declined quarter-over-quarter.
we expect hardware margins to improve in the second half of the year as we benefit from the shift to lower cost shipping methods. our decision to strategically increase inventory not only drives cost savings on shipping, but also insulates us from short-term supply chain disruptions, allowing us to continue to seamlessly serve our customers. before discussing our other cost lines, i want to provide context on the pace of our overall operating expense growth. over the past year, we accelerated hiring across the business to rebuild our teams following the staff reductions in early 2020 to sustain our momentum as the business rapidly scales and to position toast to capitalize on this large opportunity ahead.
we're now largely past that ramp in hiring. with what's reflected in our updated outlook for the rest of 2022, we believe our cost structure will align with the scale and growth trajectory of the business. that positions us to continue to invest in key growth areas to sustain top line momentum while further improving profitability going forward. sales and marketing expense declined as a percentage of recurring revenue in q2.
the initial benefit from scaling our sales team is already evident in the strong location and arpu growth. last quarter, we discussed how our go-to-market strategy creates a flywheel effect. as we increased market share in a territory, inbound traffic and referrals grow and our sales reps deliver higher productivity. we expect that to be a tailwind going forward, particularly as we gain traction in the less penetrated territories that we're investing into.
in addition, our sales reps naturally become more productive as they gain experience. by ramping hiring over the past year, the average tenure of our sales force has naturally declined. with our sales rep base closer to our target level, we plan to increase the team at a more steady state and expect our average tenure to increase, which historically led to increased productivity. we expect both of these dynamics to contribute to increased efficiency in sales and marketing expenses over time.
research and development is another area where we accelerated investment over the past year. this includes continuing to develop and broaden our platform and scaling the team to support the incredible growth we've experienced over the past two years. we now have more than doubled the number of locations on our platform than the onset of covid, and our ambitions have grown significantly. we're investing to build platform scalability and stability in order to support hundreds of thousands of restaurants over the coming years.
product innovation also remains core to our growth strategy. our strong arpu growth gives us conviction on the roi of our product investments. and we still have a huge opportunity to add more products that restaurants want and provide features and functionality that will enable us to both broaden and more deeply penetrate our tam. in the first half of 2022, approximately 20% of our r&d spend went toward products and initiatives that represent less than 5% of our arr today.
we expect these areas to become important drivers over the next few years. that investment is skewed toward products where we've already seen initial traction like our team management suite, notably payroll. a smaller portion is allocated to initiatives that we expect to be meaningful drivers in the medium term. we're committed to maintaining a balanced r&d profile, investing to drive continued innovation in our core products and to scale our platform while allocating capital to emerging areas that we have high conviction can increase our arpu potential and expand our market opportunity.
moving down the p&l. the year-over-year growth in general and administrative expenses continue to be primarily related to public company-related expenses. the growth in g&a should decline to a more steady-state level in q4 as we fully lap the initial step-up from late last year. we intend to remain disciplined in managing overhead and expect to deliver operating leverage in g&a starting in 2023.
total q2 adjusted ebitda was negative $33 million, well ahead of our guidance, and margins improved 350 basis points quarter-over-quarter to negative 4.9%. our increased focus on efficiency and cost discipline contributed to the beat. additionally, with gpv seasonally higher, we typically see greater quarter-over-quarter margin improvement in q2, and that was amplified with gpv exceeding expectations. now turning to guidance.
for the third quarter, we expect revenue to be in the range of $700 million to $730 million, which represents 47% year-over-year growth at the midpoint, with adjusted ebitda expected to be in the range of negative $40 million to negative $30 million. following our strong first half of the year, we are increasing our revenue expectations for the full year by 5% at the midpoint. we now expect full year revenue to be in the range of $2.62 billion to $2.66 billion, a 55% year-over-year increase at the midpoint. we are also raising our adjusted ebitda guidance range to negative $160 million to negative $140 million for 2022.
this includes the integration of sling, which is a modest drag on ebitda. the midpoint of our updated range is a $70 million and 360 basis point margin improvement compared to the initial '22 guidance we gave in february. in addition to our strong execution and continued top line momentum, the improvement reflects our increased cost discipline and current pace of hiring as we focus on delivering durable efficient growth. our current outlook puts us on track for a 130 basis point margin improvement in the second half of the year compared to the first while continuing to make targeted investments in key growth areas to position toast for a sustained location and arpu growth for years to come.
improving profitability is a top priority across the company. our results and our improved outlook are indicative of our focus on efficiency and cost discipline. these efforts will enable us to drive toward profitability faster. as we look ahead, while our business remains healthy into q3, we recognize the economic outlook in the u.s.
is mixed. given that, we have been measured in our guidance for the rest of the year to factor in that uncertainty and the potential for slower consumer trends. overall, we've made great progress on positioning our cost structure for the scale and growth profile of our business, which will enable us to deliver operating leverage and move even faster on growth opportunities to sustain top line momentum. it also gives us the flexibility to adapt quickly to any change in the business or macro environment.
looking back at the first half. while we are very pleased with our performance, we're still early -- in the early innings, with only 1% penetration of this massive $55 billion market opportunity. we remain focused on our goal to serve as the technology backbone for the restaurant industry, continually bolstering our platform with more products and features to add value for our customers and to help them outperform their competitors. and we're confident that continuing to execute on our mission will drive sustained location and arpu growth and create significant long-term shareholder value.
now i'll turn the call back over to the operator to start our q&a session.

operator
[operator instructions] your first question comes from the line of tien-tsin huang j.p.morgan. please proceed.
tien-tsin huang -- jpmorgan chase and company -- analyst
hey, great. thanks so much. great results here. i wanted to ask, like slide 18, if you don't mind going to that.
was helpful to see. i'm curious how hard or how big a focus is it to narrow this arpu gap between the '21 cohort and the pre-'21 class, it looks like. what are some of the big products you need to do it with? and i think it sounds like the product upsell team will be tasked to do that. any detail there would be great.
aman narang -- chief operating officer
hi, tien-tsin. thanks for the question. this is aman. look, i think one of the things we're really proud of is just a great performance by our go-to-market team in q3.
you're seeing not only that with new customers are booking, they're booking at a higher arpu. and you're also seeing that core of customers over time, as you saw on slide 18, are expanding arpu over time. and it's really across the board, right? we've got -- on the upsell team, our growth is getting more familiar with these newer products. as elena mentioned, the attach rates of some of these products like employee cloud and xtrachef is lower, and their high arpu products.
and then on to shop, we've got products like our guest products, even capital, as chris talked about, and also our core products in terms of just adding more hardware and software subscriptions through kiosks and such. and so, across the board, seeing really good momentum, and it's really both on new business bookings, as well as an upsell as well.
tien-tsin huang -- jpmorgan chase and company -- analyst
great. and just my quick follow-up if you don't mind, just bigger picture question around risk appetite. going into a less certain macro, just risk appetite in general with underwriting new locations, the capital business, you talked about xtrachef. what do you, what signals are you watching there to dial it up or down? thanks.
elena gomez -- chief financial officer
yeah. so, our just capital business, first of all, we see a lot of the data with our customers, so we're well positioned to really understand their ability to pay, their sort of their payment volume, and so on. so, the risk is largely managed. we pay careful attention to signals, but we're not seeing anything so far in our loan portfolio that leads us to believe that default rates are out of line.
in fact, they're very much in line with our expectations, tin. so, we're not seeing that risk. but of course, we're going to keep monitoring it in light of the backdrop that we're in.
tien-tsin huang -- jpmorgan chase and company -- analyst
gotcha. thank you.
operator
thank you. the next question comes from the line of dj hynes of canaccord. please proceed.
dj hynes -- canaccord genuity -- analyst
hey, guys. yeah. thanks for taking the question. nice set of results here.
elena, maybe i'll start with you. i wanted to ask about inflationary impacts on gpv per location and how we should think about that going forward that there's kind of a mix of pros and cons, right? on the one hand, high prices are a good thing for payment volume. i presume, at some point, it works against traffic. so, how should we be thinking about that as we factor the data points into our model?
elena gomez -- chief financial officer
yeah. no, that's a great question. so, inflation is definitely a factor, and we know that in our gpv per location, and we know that we're benefiting from that. and we're also benefiting from higher transaction volumes.
and i sort of commented on the fact that our ticket is being up, but also our transaction levels are close but not all the way back to 2019. so, we're going to benefit a bit as that with respect to pre-covid levels. then the other interesting data point we look at is the cost of food. at home and the cost of food away from home, and we're seeing that the cost of food at home is growing faster than the cost of food away from home.
so, as diners have become more comfortable, and we're seeing that trend of consumer demand shifting to food away from home. we expect to continue to benefit from that as well.
dj hynes -- canaccord genuity -- analyst
yeah. interesting. ok. and then maybe a more strategic follow-up.
just around like the importance of building out the self-serve product-led motion to the long-term margin profile of the business. and i'm just thinking like as you scale refilling the natural customer attrition do you see with kind of lower and lower cost of acquisition channels is obviously going to be important. but would love to get your thoughts, a, on progress there; and, b, just how important that is.
chris comparato -- chief executive officer
yes. dj, this is chris. i think you want to put yourself in a position to support the restaurants demands whether it's a net new customer upfront, as aman mentioned, bundling more of the platform up-front in efficient motion to win that customer. but then over time, given existing customers the flexibility either through self-service, product-led growth, or the upsell motion to have really clear accessibility to our platform and all of its modules.
so, we spend a lot of time looking at that customer journey for restaurant segments of all types to identify what is the right channel for which they can get exposed to the right products, and then we capitalize on those efforts. and we're seeing that those teams are becoming more and more productive over time. so, that's what we look at. but then we complement that with making sure that the platform has all the needs that address the restaurant's pain points, and we continue to select and build the right products to address those pain points.
dj hynes -- canaccord genuity -- analyst
that's helpful color. thank you, guys. keep it up.
operator
thank you. the next question comes from will nance of goldman sachs. please proceed.
will nance -- goldman sachs -- analyst
hey, guys. good afternoon. appreciate you taking my questions. nice results today.
it's great to see the strength on the top line and particularly in the subscription revenues. and i guess i wanted to follow up on, i think, tien-tsin's question on the subscription arpus. i thought slide 18 was great as well. wondering if you could maybe dig into the step function change in arpus in the 2021 cohort.
i mean, is that primarily a result of payroll and maybe a little bit of extra shafts? or is there something specific you would kind of point us to that drove that step function? and then the follow-on is, what does the sales motion look like, the upsell motion for the back book to get some of these higher arpu products kind of penetrated in the base? thank you.
elena gomez -- chief financial officer
sure. i'll take that, and aman, feel free to chime in as well. so, that step-function is really broad-based as we started testing different bundles that resonate with our customers. we started understanding that customers are actually, our sales team is getting really good at positioning the breadth of the platform.
that's really the important part. they're getting used to solution selling. and in that, they're selling all elements of the platform, whether it's the guest products, online ordering, things like that, as well as hardware, so it's really the breadth of products, payroll on xtrachef, payroll more obviously played a role, but we still have a continued opportunity with payroll. and xtrachef is too early to have that big of an impact.
in fact, in 2021 was really nascent. so, i would -- i don't even know it shows so early in 2021. so, it's really a payroll and the broad breadth of the platform versus any one product.
dj hynes -- canaccord genuity -- analyst
got it. that's super helpful. you know, the take rate came in a bit ahead of where we were looking for, it sounds like there may have been some contribution from toast capital in there. just wondering if you could talk through the trajectory of to capital over the last couple of quarters.
it sounded like it was a little bit bigger than maybe we thought it was running. so, any color you could provide on what the cadence of adoption of those capital has been over the last several quarters would be great. thank you.
elena gomez -- chief financial officer
yeah. no, we're really encouraged by toast capital, and we commented on it because we wanted to give you guys more transparency. but we launched a 360-day product in q3, and the take rate benefited from that. our take rate, though, is a combination of two factors.
it's not just to capital, but also the improving the focus we have on improving our payment operations and infrastructure. so, there's always going to be that focus. we have a whole team focused on that all the time. but in q3, the primary -- the two primary drivers for both of those things, not just to use capital.
dj hynes -- canaccord genuity -- analyst
makes a lot of sense. appreciate taking my questions.
elena gomez -- chief financial officer
sure.
operator
thank you. the next question comes from mayank tandon of needham. please proceed.
mayank tandon -- needham and company -- analyst
thank you. good evening. congrats on the quarter. elena, you commented i think that you expect to be ebitda profitable exiting 2023.
could you just maybe walk through the different levers, specifically in terms of what you would then have to deliver on gross margins on the recurring revenue? any kind of framework around that? and then what are some of the levers on the opex line that would need to come through to get to that level?
elena gomez -- chief financial officer
yeah. i mean, i'll start by saying we're very early in our -- or we're in the middle and not early, but we're in the middle of our 2023 planning. so, i'll have more specifics at our next earnings call. but at the highest level, we're going to continue to focus on cost discipline that we've -- and we've shown you guys for the last several quarters.
so, that's number one. we're going to continue to gain leverage in the obvious places like g&a. but i want to remind you, we have a massive opportunity ahead. so, we're going to continue to invest in areas that are going to drive long-term sustainable growth.
and that's how i would think about it as a very balanced approach to 2023 in light of the macro.
mayank tandon -- needham and company -- analyst
right. it's still encouraging to hear also definitely should be viewed positively by investors. but just as a follow-up, chris, i think a few months ago, you had identified the hospitality opportunity, i believe, in the press release, you had 40,000-plus locations as a target market. i guess my question there would be, typically, when we think of hospitality, those terminals are usually integrated into the property management systems, where i think a company like micro is the incumbent.
so, any progress around that? how do you go about displacing someone that has been an incumbent for so long? i would just love to hear any color around your progress on the hospitality side and how do you see the opportunity playing out.
chris comparato -- chief executive officer
sure. so, we're very excited about the hotel opportunity. we continue to build out our pms integrations and they're well beyond oracle's pms. there's a span of pms integrations that we are now capable of interfacing with at hotel properties, but the team continues to build out that foundation.
we're very confident that we can support the restaurants within those hotels. we've got a number of opportunities in our pipeline that are exciting. but i'll caution you that it's still early days. we're winning hotels.
but again, we're building that muscle as we speak. and over the course of the next few quarters, you'll see us continue to execute within that segment, and we're excited about it.
mayank tandon -- needham and company -- analyst
got it. thank you so much.
operator
thank you. the next question comes from josh baer of morgan stanley. please proceed.
josh baer -- morgan stanley -- analyst
thanks for the question, and congrats on the quarter. i wanted to ask about locations, the 5,500, better than expected, given i think we were looking for the lower seasonality in q3. just wondering about the linearity of location adds. was there any deterioration going month to month from september to october or even into november?
elena gomez -- chief financial officer
yeah. so, i'll talk about q3. and you're right, q3 net location adds came in better than we expected, and that's really a testament to the onboarding team. they were converting existing restaurants that were switching to toast and converting them faster.
so, we saw a great performance from that team. that pulled some locations into q3. based on the current pipeline, you know, i commented in my prepared remarks, we expect q4 net location to be in a similar range to q3, and we're still on track for strong growth in the full year.
josh baer -- morgan stanley -- analyst
great. and then one on guidance. just wanted to make sure i heard right. you were saying that guidance reflects a decline in gpv per location that was similar to historical trends.
elena gomez -- chief financial officer
yeah. typically, gpv per location, and in my prepared remarks, i mentioned that it's seasonally higher in q2 and q3 and dips down into q4. so, that's not unusual. it's typical of historical patterns and our revenue guidance reflects that.
josh baer -- morgan stanley -- analyst
ok. i guess the question is on macro and consumer spending. i guess, is there any like level of prudence around macro and potential shift in consumer spending that's incorporated in that guidance? thank you.
chris comparato -- chief executive officer
well, josh, i'll jump in. we're not seeing any signs of changes in consumer demand or spending across our business. restaurants continue to see healthy demand in line with what we think are historical seasonality trends. and that said, we're mindful of the macro environment.
we believe consumer spend on dining has proven resilient during past recessions. and then the last thing i'll leave you with is for restaurants, we fundamentally believe that our platform becomes even more valuable in a tough market. restaurants are turning to us for driving efficiency, growing their business, as we mentioned, things like invoicing and new service models, maintaining their teams, and then driving operational costs across the board. so, we think we're in a good spot when it comes to looking at the macro and the situations that have been looming.
elena gomez -- chief financial officer
and just to comment on your guidance comments, in october, we're seeing the same seasonal pattern we've seen historically.
josh baer -- morgan stanley -- analyst
great. thank you very much.
operator
thank you. the next question comes from timothy chiodo of credit suisse. please proceed.
timothy chiodo -- credit suisse -- analyst
great. thanks for taking the question. first one is a simple one just around the subscription services. the gross margins were up nicely quarter over quarter.
maybe just dig into a little bit of that was there pricing, with some cost leverage? and what were some of the drivers that helped that? and then in terms of the follow-up, just in terms of the credit losses on capital, maybe you could just recap again the mechanics around when you take the lawsuits versus your partner, what the sharing is, what the thresholds are there in terms of that working its way into your p&l?
elena gomez -- chief financial officer
yeah, sure. so, on saas gross margin, it's really scaling the business. and of course, you saw a healthy beat on the top line in both in the subscription side, and that's really our dress positioning the platform and our arpu being strong, etc., that we've talked about. so, that's really what's the story on saas gross margin.
on your other question was bad debt related. is that right?
timothy chiodo -- credit suisse -- analyst
yeah, the mechanics.
elena gomez -- chief financial officer
ok. yeah. so, basically, as we expand our toast's loan program, we have to add and accrue for related future potential default rates. and our default rates have not been out of line with what we're expecting, and we should expect that to continue to grow.
but overall, the toast capital program is a healthy business and actually accretive to the business, tim.
timothy chiodo -- credit suisse -- analyst
excellent. thank you for taking the questions.
operator
thank you. the next question comes from the line of stephen sheldon of william blair. please proceed.
stephen sheldon -- william blair and company -- analyst
hey, thanks for taking my questions. first one here, just another really strong quarter location growth. and so, i'm just curious if you're seeing any changes in the types of wins that you're getting. are these still mostly greenfield wins and situations where you're replacing legacy vendors? or are you starting to also see wins where locations or previously on competitive saas solutions? just curious if that's changed at all this quarter or this year relative to what you've seen historically.
aman narang -- chief operating officer
sure, stephen. great question. look, i think we, as chris and elena mentioned, are really proud of the results in q3. the sales team is really efficient in terms of driving growth.
and it's really the story of q3 is really consistency across the board. we saw really healthy win rates across legacy and cloud providers. we saw -- when we go into a buying decision, we tend to win more than 50% of the time as we've shared in the past. we've talked about, in previous calls, we talked about our focus on with our qsr launch, and that start to make an impact, and the balance in qsr, it's starting to improve.
we've seen -- as chris mentioned, we saw some good momentum in mid-market with things like the walk on's win. we also had expansion of enterprise customers, nothing bundt cakes and jamba juice. and even in terms of trends like new and existing, you know, we -- just coming out of covid, we've seen some small tailwind on new restaurants opening up and are seeing a good healthy balance in new and opening, existing restaurants as well.
stephen sheldon -- william blair and company -- analyst
great. that's really helpful. and then just as a follow-up, i know it's very small. you're really talking, i think, about placing seed investments on the international side this year.
but love an update on the progress you're seeing there, how you're thinking about investing behind international next year? and any thoughts on when international could be a revenue contributor? or are we still kind of a ways away from that?
elena gomez -- chief financial officer
yeah. no, i'll start by saying we're super early in the international opportunities but very encouraged already by what we're seeing, but i would view -- we view 2022 is really a building year and into 2023, frankly. we talked earlier in the year about our investment level. it hasn't changed.
we're kind of on the low end of the range of $10 million to $20 million that we talked about. and i would tell you, as the year has gone on, the investment has been increasing, obviously, as we're building the team out. but it's still early. we're evaluating all the things that you would expect the go-to-market motion, making sure we understand the product that we want to put out there in international.
we've got a few early customers in canada, dublin, and u.k. so, we're learning from our early customers. and so, far, the feedback has been really encouraging. so, we're going to continue to make that investment into 2023.
stephen sheldon -- william blair and company -- analyst
great. thank you.
operator
thank you. the next question comes from harshita rawat of bernstein. please proceed.
harshita rawat -- alliancebernstein -- analyst
hi. good afternoon. so, i have a question on churn. so, elena, how would you think about the kind of industry-level restaurant churn you've seen in the past year or so? is that much lower versus history? and more importantly, how can you kind of let your net location as can change if the churn kind of, i guess, becomes big in a downturn? and i fully appreciate that, you know, restaurants in toast do better versus an average restaurant.
thank you.
elena gomez -- chief financial officer
yeah. no, we haven't seen any change in our churn. and even during covid, which was a pretty difficult time for restaurants, our churn was relatively low and consistent. so, i wouldn't expect that we would see a change in pattern.
we have and we'll keep watching it, of course, but we haven't seen a change in our pattern. and also, when we double-click on the churn, most of the churn historically has been for restaurants that go out of business versus restaurants that are leading to us to another platform. but it continues to be low single digits -- i mean, in the single digits. so, we're encouraged by that.
chris comparato -- chief executive officer
the one thing i'll add -- this is chris. the one thing i'll add is some of these questions related to churn are oriented toward the short term. and i just want to remind the audience that we're still only at 9% of our total addressable market for u.s. locations alone, and we're less than 2% of our total addressable market when you look at arr as a potential.
so, we want to be mindful that the restaurant industry is going through a transformation to digital, and it's happening across the back of house to the front of house, and we believe we're still in the early days of leading this transformation. so, just a reminder, because as we talk about recession warnings, we believe these are short-term considerations, but on the long term, we are increasingly excited about the opportunity ahead.
harshita rawat -- alliancebernstein -- analyst
and just to follow up on capital allocation, so roll-up of scale smaller restaurant software providers kind of like very good sense in this valuation environment, but at the same time, a good balance sheet is also guidance has done going into a downturn. so, how do you -- how are you kind of like thinking about the balance between these two? thank you.
elena gomez -- chief financial officer
sorry, can you clarify your question? are you asking the balance between a strong balance sheet and investing?
harshita rawat -- alliancebernstein -- analyst
and acquiring some of the smaller -- you know, continuing to acquire some of the smaller providers, especially in this environment?
elena gomez -- chief financial officer
yes. yeah, fair. i understand the question. yes, look, our m&a strategy hasn't really changed.
i think, obviously, the backdrop has changed. so, we're going to continue to canvass the market like we always do. and our guiding principles around acquiring assets to the platform would be consistent with they've always done, which is, is it going to get us to market faster, is it going to be something that is an adjacency to our platform that really solves a pain point for the customer? so that's not changing. of course, the valuations are different now, and so we're paying attention to that.
so, we'll be opportunistic if there's a fit.
harshita rawat -- alliancebernstein -- analyst
thank you.
operator
thank you. the next question comes from rayna kumar of ubs. please proceed.
rayna kumar -- ubs -- analyst
good evening. thanks for taking my question. you had a very strong net take rate in the quarter, 53 basis points. just wondering what the key drivers are there.
and if there's anything unusual to call out as in one-time items?
elena gomez -- chief financial officer
yeah. so, i'll repeat what i said earlier, which is there's really two factors driving the take rate benefit. one is our continued focus on just payment optimization, and we have a whole team focused on that. and then, of course, we had healthy demand from our toast capital product, and we benefited from launching the 360-day loan, which was encouraging.
so, it's a combination of those. and really, when you zoom out and think about our take rate and monetization opportunity, you want to think beyond take rate and really think about the power of the platform and the fact that we have an opportunity to monetize on the saas side. and then over the long term, we're going to continue to drive product innovation that will drive more payment volume to our platform and continue to drive more digital digitization of our platform. and as we do that, we'll have more opportunity to drive more volume through the platform and more monetization.
but i would zoom out and think of it broader than just the in-quarter take rate.
rayna kumar -- ubs -- analyst
thank you. that's very helpful. and just one follow-up. if you can just comment on your progress moving upmarket to more enterprise larger restaurants, please? thank you.
aman narang -- chief operating officer
sure. so, look, i think that this is a spectrum, right? we started the business in smb and have gradually gone into bigger and bigger groups. and, you know, as i just mentioned, we -- in mid-market and enterprise, we saw some good expansion in wins this year. so, things like nothing bundt cakes, which has been a customer for us for a while, expanded test about 400 units out of texas.
jamba juice expanded with toast as well. chris called out, walk on out of louisiana. and i think there's a lot of interest in our enterprise offering. so, the amount of inbound we're seeing continues to grow as well.
and when i think about like just for some context, the four walls of a restaurant, right? the value proposition we offer to an smb or a larger chain in many ways is similar. things like handhelds improve operational efficiency, digital tools to improve automation, self-service. it's certainly outside the four walls, where things like config management, menu management, security, and compliance, right through. and we continue to work on a lot of those capabilities, and we're confident over time that we're going to grow into that time gradually.
rayna kumar -- ubs -- analyst
thank you.
operator
thank you. we will now take our final question from the line of josh beck of keybanc. please proceed.
josh beck -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
thank you for squeezing me in. i also was a big fan of slide 20. certainly, has had really good progress in the flywheel markets, but they're still less than 10% of the total. so, i guess my question is, in future years, is this trajectory likely to continue? or is there some element of the emerging markets that you're just investing in that could maybe limit the slope of the flywheel markets? just curious about how this trend progress over time.
aman narang -- chief operating officer
yeah. look, great question. look, we are really proud of the performance of our sales team and what we accomplished in q3. and as you correctly pointed out, you know, just for context, audience-level markets where we have about 20% or more penetration, and that's less than 10% of our overall market.
and we continue to see the same trend we've seen for a while now, where, as we see rep tenure because end market tend to improve, we tend to see productivity continue to improve. and there's nothing that's telling us that that trend should not continue.
josh beck -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
excellent. and then maybe a follow-up, just to close on the invoicing products, certainly seem like an exciting launch at the spark event. when you look across your existing base of customers, i'm curious how applicable the product is. i'm also curious, does it help you get into new segments? just curious where the strongest product-market fit may lie for that product.
chris comparato -- chief executive officer
yeah, josh, it's extremely applicable. in my script, i talked about the different service models that restaurants are deploying to attract and deliver demand. catering and invoice is one of those key service models. we believe that roughly 70% of our customer base and the industry has a need to drive catering, whether it's events, whether it's different types of meals, whether it's certain types of opportunities off of the kitchen, we believe the majority of restaurants have this need.
it's in the early days for us. so, on top of invoicing, you'll see this evolve to a broader catering platform. restaurants today tend to use either manual processes or point solutions to deliver those engagements but doing it on an all-in-one integrated platform makes it a lot easier for the restaurant operator. and then they could drive more invoicing.
as i mentioned, dos toros tripled the amount of their invoicing usage over the course of the past three months, and the payments volume for the restaurants increased 17% and, so we think it's a unique opportunity. it's still early days, but we'll continue to tell stories on how that evolves over the next few quarters.
operator
thank you. i would like to turn the call back over to the presenters.

chris comparato -- chief executive officer
thank you, michael, and good afternoon, everyone. before i jump in, i'm going to apologize up-front for any coughing outburst or sips of hot tea as i'm recovering from a nasty cold. so, let's jump in. this past quarter marked the first anniversary of toast ipo.
i want to thank all of our employees for their focus and dedication, as well as our partners, customers, and investors. we look forward to our ongoing partnership. and while we've accomplished a lot over the past year, we're even more excited about the opportunity in the years to come. toast delivered a strong q3, delivering continued efficient time growth and improved profitability.
in addition to topping our revenue and ebitda expectations, we surpassed $100 billion in annualized gpv for the first time. these results are a testament to the consistent execution of our core strategy, driving location growth, deepening our ability to serve all segments of the restaurant industry, and delivering product innovation. on the product front, last month, we hosted spark, our annual innovation event, where we announced the new product updates to help restaurants grow and expand their business and overcome key challenges. a key highlight is toast invoicing, a new product to help restaurants seamlessly manage catering and wholesale orders alongside their in-store takeout and delivery businesses.
a great example of our continued product innovation and how we're leveraging new products to better serve different restaurant types. while the fundamentals in our business remain strong, we continue to closely monitor the uncertain macroeconomic environment that both we and our customers are operating in. toast customers continue to see solid consumer demand, and the restaurant industry remains healthy. we're focused on partnering with both new and existing customers to ensure they are able to adapt and thrive in this dynamic environment.
in addition, we are equally prepared to adapt our business to any macro changes in the restaurant industry. in the third quarter, we grew revenue 55% year over year to $752 million, and arr was up 60% to $868 million. gpv remains healthy, increasing 53% year over year in q3. we also continue to drive strong location growth, adding approximately 5,500 net new locations and ending the quarter with approximately 74,000 total locations, sustaining over 40% growth in total locations even as our scale grows is indicative of our powerful go-to-market strategy and industry-leading platform.
as a result of this consistent execution, we are raising our full-year revenue guidance by 3% at the midpoint of the range which implies 59% year-over-year growth. we're also increasing our adjusted ebitda guidance by nearly $30 million at the midpoint. the continued margin improvement in q3 is further evidence of our focus on cost discipline and efficiency efforts and our progress toward profitability. we remain committed to balancing investments in our most important areas to go after the massive market opportunity in front of us with disciplined cost management and healthy unit economics to sustain that efficient growth as we scale.
our ability to scale our proven go-to-market strategy gives us confidence that our unit economics will continue to improve over time. we've discussed the flywheel effect that drives increasing referrals and inbounds as we increase penetration in a local market. that results in higher and more efficient productivity. that higher productivity leads to more arr and better profit contribution as these markets scale.
over the past year, the percentage of total smb restaurant locations in markets to have over 20% penetration has increased by more than five times, and we continue to gain share in these markets, proof that we still have significant room to keep increasing share even in our more established markets. a large majority of our markets are still below that 20% penetration, and we're investing to replicate that flywheel effect in more markets. when you combine the significant untapped smb opportunity with our nascent share in the enterprise and international segments, we still have a long runway of growth ahead, and we're well-positioned to capitalize on the digital transformation in the restaurant industry. demand for toast across the full spectrum of the restaurant types remains strong, and our new customers continue to take advantage of more products across our platform to operate more efficiently and grow their business.
i'll highlight a few examples from the past quarter. antoine's, one of new orleans' storied french quarter restaurants, selected toast as its technology partner, known for its classic fine dining experience antoine's wanted a new partner who could modernize its back-of-house while also preserving its special front-of-house experience. in addition to our robust all-in-one platform, antoine was attracted to our payroll and toast's manager solution to help eliminate the inefficiency of making multiple back-office trips each night to aggregate tips with their legacy pos. they're also using 13 of toast's kitchen display systems in their spans kitchen, along with several of our guest modules.
antoine came to us via a strong referral from another new orleans toast customer. a great example of the relationships our local go-to-market team builds and how that flywheel effect works as we gain traction in these local markets. walk on's is excited to leverage toast across its growing footprint of nearly 100 existing and planned locations across the south and midwest, co-owned by nfl star drew brees and named the no. 1 best sports bar in america by espn and the no.
1 sports bar franchise two years running by entrepreneur walk on's has started to toast's at some of their locations. seem to enhance their technology, walk on's is adopting our pos for its ease of use, our toast go handhelds to help navigate seas of sports fans, and our api integrations to provide superior service through all of our ordering channels. taco maya is a fast-casual qsr with six existing and four planned locations throughout chicago and illinois. taco maya will be implementing 10 toast's module assets footprint, including xtrachef for better visibility into costs, multi-location management for easier menu updating and online ordering, and mobile order & pay, among others, to provide an efficient, seamless customer experience.
every location also includes a patio, which taco maya will equip servers with our toast go handhelds to service. it's a great use case for our toast gos, which have proven to benefit staff productivity. taco maya is just one example of the momentum we're building in the qsr segment. earlier this year, we announced toast for qsr.
and in q3, qsrs represented nearly half of our bookings, its highest level in recent years. one important benefit of our vertical focus on the restaurant industry is the ability to leverage the toast platform to develop offerings tailored to the needs of specific restaurant types, enabling us to deepen our penetration across restaurant segments. with restaurants operating in an increasingly dynamic environment, it's critical that we constantly speak to and stay connected with our customers. we recently conducted our annual voice of the restaurant industry survey to gain insights into the major challenges facing restaurants and how tech can help them thrive.
similar to themes we've seen this year, labor shortages and inflation are the challenges facing our customers. one in three restaurants said they've had a difficult time hiring in 2022 and almost 40% started tracking the prices of key ingredients. the survey also highlighted employee scheduling as one of our customers' biggest technology pain points, reinforcing the importance of adding sling to our team management product suite. in addition, our customers are also diversifying their businesses to meet the evolving needs of guests and to develop new revenue streams.
on average, restaurant surveyed employed seven different service models such as on-premise, takeout, delivery, catering, wholesale, curbside, and drive-thru. our recent product innovations highlight how toast is uniquely positioned to help restaurants navigate these challenges and take advantage of new opportunities to transform and grow. at spark, we announced toast invoicing, which enables restaurants to efficiently manage wholesale and catering orders along with their core restaurant business in one integrated system. our customers can save time on managing paperwork and multiple systems while getting paid faster and seamlessly capitalizing on the opportunity to grow their business with more service models.
toast invoicing showcases our ability to deeply serve hybrid locations and provide a seamless billing and payment solution for both b2b and b2c. we estimate over 70% of restaurants already offer catering in addition to their on-premise business, and catering is one of the top three focus areas for restaurant owners and operators as we head into 2023. a great example of how customers are leveraging our new invoicing offering is founders table, which operates two qsr dos toros taqueria and chopt creative salad and is a great strategic partner of ours. they went live with invoicing in june at 19 of their dos toros locations in order to streamline their operations and payments for catering into one platform after previously using a separate point solution.
in addition to the efficiency of managing this through a single integrated platform over the past three months, dos toros monthly invoice and usage with toast's more than doubled. and in september alone, invoicing drove a 17% uplift in their payments volume on toast. at spark, we also featured our xtrachef price tracker. as i mentioned earlier, this is a major pain point for restaurants due to the inflationary environment.
our customers can access the price tracker directly from our newly designed xtrachef dashboard to stay on top of fluctuating ingredient prices and costs. restaurants like plaza pizza are watching price fluctuations week to week and in response to these insights have engaged in negotiations with food distributors. plaza pizza was able to successfully reduce food costs by nearly 10%. other customers are monitoring key price changes to make strategic decisions about their menus, their recipes, and pricing.
our ability to help customers navigate this important issue is evident in how quickly the attach rate for xtrachef has ramped. after only adding it to our sales motion in q1 this year, the percentage of locations that went live in q3 using xtrachef is already in the mid-teens, and we continue to see a significant opportunity to reach customers and further develop our product suite to help restaurants manage their suppliers. finally, i'd like to highlight toast capital, where our data on restaurant performance enables us to help offer restaurants seamless, low-friction access to capital. the majority of applicants received an approval decision in one business day, and on average, funds are dispersed to customers just two days after signing their loan agreement.
that differentiated customer experience is evident in customer retention. among the 2021 customer cohort, over 70% have taken a second loan and in some cases, multiple additional loans. in q3, we exceeded our offering, adding a 360-day loan with larger available loan sizes to give customers more choice and meet a wider range of use cases. the strong customer value proposition of toast capital and the different offerings we've added over the past year continue to drive healthy growth with smb businesses underserved by the banking community in an estimated two-thirds of all smb businesses having financial needs each year.
we have a clear opportunity to leverage our expanding portfolio of banking products to both add significant value for our customers and drive strong growth going forward. in summary, toast delivered strong execution and continued momentum in q3, balancing targeted investments to drive product innovation with focus on healthy unit economics and disciplined cost management. amid uncertain times, we are more committed than ever to our mission to empower the restaurant community, to delight guests, do what they love, and thrive. we believe that serving as the restaurant industry trusted technology partner and giving restaurants the tools they need to adapt and succeed will benefit our customers while helping toast deliver durable, efficient growth for many years to come.
now, i'll turn the call over to elena.
elena gomez -- chief financial officer
thanks, chris, and thank you, everyone, for joining. before jumping into the results, i want to thank the entire toast team for another great quarter, the sustained execution, and momentum we've built in the year since our ipo, thanks to the hard work and dedication of our great team. that execution contributed to another strong quarter with revenue and adjusted ebitda both coming in above the high end of our guidance in q3. our integrated software and payments model together with a differentiated go-to-market approach is built to scale efficiently.
and our balanced top-line growth and improved profitability is early evidence of that. we're still less than 2% of the $55 billion us market and have a huge opportunity ahead as we lead the restaurant industry's digital transition. we're confident that continuing to invest in innovation scale, our integrated business model will enable us to sustain both strong growth and margin improvement. in q3, we added approximately 5,500 net new locations, increasing the number of total live location on our platform to approximately 74,000.
the growth is broad-based with a healthy balance of existing restaurants switching over to toast, existing customers expanding their footprint and new restaurants partnering with those. as evidenced by the examples chris just shared, we're gaining traction across different types and segments of restaurants, thanks to the breadth of our industry-leading platform and the ability to deeply serve the entire industry. we expect to sustain our momentum in q4 with net location adds in a similar range as q3. turning to our financial results.
arr, which is our core operational metric ended q3 at $868 million, up 60% year over year. total revenue grew 55% year over year to $752 million. looking at what we operationally view as recurring revenue, subscription revenue and fintech gross profit totaled $224 million, up 82% year over year, driven by our continued location growth and healthy arpu increases across both saas and fintech solutions. subscription services revenue increased 96% year over year in the third quarter, benefiting from our sustained location growth and increased product adoption.
total shop arpu grew more than 20% year over year, driven by both new and existing customers. as we've discussed, new customers are joining the platform at higher arpu than in prior years as they leverage the expanding breadth of our platform. chris alluded to the increasing attach rate of nascent products like xtrachef, that's just one example of how our sales team is attaching more products at booking contributing to higher saas arpu for our more recent customer cohorts. existing customers are leveraging upsell channels to add more products.
the arpu for each of our pre-2022 annual customer cohorts is growing at double-digit rates, and we're still only scratching the surface on the potential for upsell. new products like payroll and xtrachef are still early on their growth and have much higher penetration with new customers than older cohorts. plus, we have an exciting pipeline of new products for our customers to benefit from. as we continue to develop our upsell team and refine our sales motion, we believe we can continue to increase saas arpu across our annual customer cohort.
on the fintech solutions side, revenue grew 55% to $628 million, and gross profit was up 74% year over year to $134 million in the quarter. gpv growth remains healthy and increased 53% to $25 billion in q3. average annualized gpv per processing location of $1.4 million was roughly flat with q2 and up 8% year over year. the growth in gpv per processing location is a result of higher average ticket and the continued rebound in customer transactions, which remains slightly below 2019 levels in q3.
in addition to healthy payments volume, we're also benefiting from our growing portfolio of fintech products and services led by toast capital. those products drove $17 million of gross profit in q3. toast capital offers a strong value proposition, and we have a great opportunity to further penetrate the significant restaurant lending, marketing opportunity as we expand the offering. in addition to toast capital, our portfolio of non-pos fintech products with nascent offerings like paycard and payout and other products currently in development highlight the strategic benefit of our fintech capabilities and the opportunity to build products that add value for our customers while differentiating our offering and driving additional monetization.
the combined -- the combination of continued optimization efforts from our payments platform investments, coupled with the growth in other fintech products resulted in a net take rate increasing to 53 basis points. as a reminder, gpv per processing location is typically higher during peak season in the second and third quarters each year. we expect gpv per processing location to seasonally decline quarter over quarter in q4 and in q1 each year. total gross profit of 8% year over year and 31% quarter over quarter to $164 million, resulting in gross margin of 21.8%.
we delivered gross margin improvement in each of our reporting lines leading to over 300 basis point gross margin improvement compared to q2. turning to customer acquisition costs. hardware margins improved quarter over quarter due to lower shipping costs. hardware harbor revenue decreased year over year mainly due to tough seasonal comp and accounting guidelines that require allocation of revenue across bundled products.
we've seen upsell to existing customers revert to a typical seasonal pattern with q2 benefiting from more hardware sales to existing customers in preparation for the outdoor season followed by a drop-off in q3. last year with in-person dining still recovering after covid, hardware upsell sales in q3 were stronger than usual. on operating expenses, we continue to take a balanced approach to position for sustained top-line momentum as we lead the digitization of the restaurant industry while putting in place a lean, flexible cost structure. our hiring is focused on key investment areas with the strongest roi potential, and we're rigorously prioritizing those opportunities as we tightly manage expense growth.
at the same time, we're closely monitoring the dynamic macro backdrop and maintaining the flexibility in our cost structure to adapt to the changing environment. moving to our other customer acquisition costs. sales and marketing expense growth slowed to 54% year over year and further declined as a percentage of recurring revenue in q3. our go-to-market engine is well-positioned to scale efficiently.
as we drive sustained share gains and build flywheel effect an increasing number of markets, we expect rep productivity to increase, driving deeper market penetration and improving unit economics. the recent spark event and release of our toast's invoicing products, the latest example of how our investments in research and development are driving innovation to help our customers grow their business and improve their bottom line. we believe our balanced investments across core products, emerging growth products, and our pipeline of new products will continue -- contribute to continued arpu and location growth. general and admirative expenses were 25% of recurring revenue.
our g&a expenses include bad debt and credit-related expenses, which were approximately $13 million in q3. excluding bad debt and credit-related expenses, g&a grew 66% year over year as we continue to absorb public company costs. with our emphasis on disciplined cost management, we expect growth in the core g&a expenses to moderate in q4 and anticipate operating leverage on g&a going forward. bad debt and credit-related expenses include bad debt on outstanding receivables, as well as liabilities related to toast capital and other fintech offerings.
our data advantage allows us to closely monitor the health of the restaurant and its repayment ability to maintain low default rates and manage our risk. and while we expect bad debt and credit expenses related to capital to grow as we expand the program, the overall operating margin is healthy and accretive to the business. total q3 adjusted ebitda was negative $19 million. our negative 2.6% margin was a 230 basis points improvement quarter over quarter.
q3 is a great example of our ability to drive healthy top-line growth, continue to invest in key areas that will help sustain growth while operating efficiently to improve profitability. we remain focused on optimizing our cost base and rigorously prioritize investments in order to sustain this trajectory going forward. now, turning to guidance. for the fourth quarter, we expect revenue to be in the range of $730 million to $760 million, which represents 46% year-over-year growth at the midpoint, with adjusted ebitda expected to be in the range of negative $30 million to negative $20 million.
we continue to see healthy gpv trends into q4 and our guidance reflects a seasonal decline in gpv per location similar to our typical historical trend. based on strong q3 performance and q4 guidance, our full-year 2022 revenue expectations are higher at the midpoint. we now expect full-year revenue to be in the range of $2.69 billion to $2.72 billion, a 59% year-over-year increase at the midpoint. our updated full-year adjusted ebitda guidance range is negative $127 million to negative $117 million, a nearly $30 million improvement at the midpoint from our last guidance.
this implies an adjusted ebitda margin of negative 4.5% for the year at the midpoint. our focus on efficiency and disciplined cost management this year has enabled us to both meaningfully improve margins the last few quarters and invest in key areas that we believe will contribute to durable efficient growth. we intend to maintain this balanced approach going forward, investing in areas of product innovation as we go after the big market opportunity in front of us while driving operating leverage. the progress we've made to adopt our cost structure this year, along with our continued focus on efficient growth puts us on a trajectory to deliver a quarterly adjusted ebitda profit by the end of 2023.
this assumes the current macro environment remains relatively consistent. we're closely monitoring the key indicators. and if there were a meaningful change to the macro environment that impacts the restaurant industry, we would reassess that timing, but we have a proven ability to navigate changing market conditions and with the improvements in our cost structure, we're prepared to quickly adapt our business to any changes. in closing, we had a great third quarter, posting strong financial results on building on our operating momentum.
i want to reiterate my thanks to our team for their focused execution. in the face of this dynamic operating environment, restaurants need a trusted technology partner more than ever to help them drive efficiency, offer differentiated guest experiences, and enable new service models. our relentless focus on being that partner to the restaurant industry and solving their biggest pain points is driving the strong growth in our business. and with investments to further strengthen our industry-leading platform, put toss in a great position to lead the digital transition for the restaurant industry.
now, i'll turn the call back over to the operator to start our q&a.
