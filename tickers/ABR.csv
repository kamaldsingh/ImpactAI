[operator instructions] we'll take today's first question from steve delaney with jmp securities. please go ahead.
steve delaney -- jmp securities -- analyst
thanks. good morning. ivan and paul, congrats on a strong close to a year that i think would have been hard for us to imagine when we were sitting here last march, for sure. you mentioned several times in your remarks, you talked about diversity.
so with my questions, i'm going to go there away from the two main agency and structured businesses if i may. couple of days ago, we saw a bloomberg article, talking about a transaction that starwood that was contemplating about a $300 million loan -- institutional loan on 1,600 single-family properties. and it looked like it was just going to be a single -- they were trying to do a single borrower cmbs execution. so that's in the market.
and i know single-family rental, ivan, is something you've been talking about for, i think, about a year now. if you could just give us an update, your thoughts about that product and opportunity, and kind of where your operation stands as we sit here today? thank you.
ivan kaufman -- president and chief executive officer
sure. we have significantly ramped up and have become the leader in single-family build-to-rent communities. i believe, we have close to $0.5 billion in our pipeline and have an equal amount in underwriting and ready to close. i would project that that volume will double, and that is a great business for us.
we do the construction lending, which turned into a bridge, and then we do the ultimate securitization on those loans. so each transaction, we get 3 turns on. i love that business. we were able to build those communities at a similar cost that you can build a multifamily.
with covid, you're seeing certainly a move to it less-density. and also what you're seeing as well is that's a preferable option for people instead of buying a home if they don't have the down payment and if they think they're transient and don't want to go through the transaction cost for that being an option. they're great communities. we're working with a few developers that have really developed the skill set to be able to build those products in a very efficient way similar to a cost for multifamily project, and we love it.
we're continuing to provide financing for people who are aggregating pools of single-family rentals with the idea of ultimately doing a securitization. we're selling them off in pieces, depending on whether we think we can get to the securitization market in time or whether we want to just distribute those products. so those are the two avenues we've invested in, starting two years ago. they're starting to bear a lot of fruit right now and they're going to represent a significant amount of growth for the firm, and we just love that business.
steve delaney -- jmp securities -- analyst
right. and the construction and bridge loans, are they currently -- they're on the books so they currently carried in the structured portfolio?
ivan kaufman -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. paul, you can answer that.
paul elenio -- chief financial officer
yes. hey, steve. so, yes, as ivan mentioned, we're building a pretty strong build-to-rent business, as well as the construction into bridge. so if it's a bridge, it's in the bridge product.
the build-to-rent obviously funds over time, so you don't see a significant amount of that in the volume numbers we present. as the drawers get done, you do, but the committed volume is something that's pretty significant. but, yes, it all ends up in the structured side of the business bucket for now.
steve delaney -- jmp securities -- analyst
and, ivan, to be clear, and last part on this question, eventually, you're going to go to a permanent loan. and you're in the process, i guess, of some bridge loans getting to the point where they're stabilized and they're going to go into a permanent. but to this point, you've not executed a securitization. is that correct? but maybe, that's a 2021 --
ivan kaufman -- president and chief executive officer
no. they actually resemble very much multifamily loans. some are agency eligible. some go on top of our label program.
so it doesn't need its own securitization. it fits right in, which is remarkable. so it fits right into our business flow in process, and it's just accretive to what we're doing.
steve delaney -- jmp securities -- analyst
ok. thank you for that clarity. the second piece is on the resi jv. i mean, it's been a great year for that business.
obviously, we've seen a lot of ipos in the space. could you just remind us, on cardinal, the channels that they're focused on, whether it's direct or wholesale, and the percentage of the business that is refi versus purchase? i know, there's a lot of, obviously, concern that refis will -- the refi side of the business will come down pretty materially. not right away, but maybe by the end of 2021. thanks.
ivan kaufman -- president and chief executive officer
first, we've been extraordinarily cautious in the way we've been forecasting and been exceeding our own forecast by a lot, every single quarter, quarter by quarter by quarter, and that's been going on for quite some time. with respect to the strategy, it's more of a retail strategy, not a wholesale strategy, but we also are supplying channels. and paul, you can answer the financial-related questions.
paul elenio -- chief financial officer
yes. so it's like you said, steve, it's consumer direct and retail. it has been, and probably continues to be for a period of time here, a pretty big refi component, as you know. i don't have the numbers in front of me, but it's a really high percentage of the volume.
however, having said that, the business is national across the country. it has a tremendous retail presence. as you know, homeownership is on the rise. and so, we do expect that the refi business will slow down a bit and margins will compress a little bit.
but we have a tremendous network and a tremendous infrastructure and a big focus on technology and believe that that business will do quite well on the home purchase side as well.
steve delaney -- jmp securities -- analyst
right. i mean, the roes are so insane right now. it can go down -- volume and revenue can go down quite a bit and still have incredible roes. thank you both for your comments.

we'll take our next question from charlie arestia with j.p. morgan. please go ahead.
charlie arestia -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
hey, good morning, guys. thanks for taking the questions. a bit of a follow-up, i guess, to the first question in terms of the topic, but kind of looking at it through a different lens. given the focus on the new york area, in particular, it would be great to get your thoughts on the competitive environment there.
and i'm assuming that single-family rental is part of this. but some of the unique challenges that new york city faces and, in particular, with regards to some of the demographic trends and population shifts that are happening there.
ivan kaufman -- president and chief executive officer
yes. first off, we don't have a significant concentration in new york. i think, what you're doing in new york, as you're going through a recalculation of rental values, as well as sales values, you're seeing a lot of rentals, you're seeing a lot of sales, in fact, record numbers right now but at a significantly reduced sales price percentage, as well as rental. at these new bases, we're quite bullish.
we like new york city. we think, come september, when the schools open, people go back to work, you'll see the city begin to return to normal. you just have to underwrite appropriately for what the right rentals are. and you have to take into consideration the potential for an increase in real estate taxes.
so our portfolio is performing well there. we're optimistic that the leasing will be done. it will be done with some concessions and will be done with reduced rental rates. so underwriting appropriately, getting the right structure on the bridge loans is critical, and giving the loans the right amount of time to hit those lease-up numbers.
but i think, come september, we'll look back and say, wow, we have begun to return to normal fairly quickly. it will be a new normal.
charlie arestia -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
ok. got it. thanks. and then one more.
i was wondering if you guys have ever disclosed sort of rough breakout of what percentage of your origination volumes are to existing or previous arbor borrowers. it feels like things are certainly improving more broadly. but the sector has really leaned on those pre-existing relationships to drive volumes, and curious to get your thoughts on the mix of previous borrowers versus new relationships.
paul elenio -- chief financial officer
charlie, it's paul. we have not disclosed that in the past. but ivan can certainly give some color. we obviously have tremendous relationships and do a significant amount of business with repeat borrowers.
but he certainly can give you some color on the market and what's happening today in those areas.
ivan kaufman -- president and chief executive officer
yes. our business is built on repeat borrowers. and keep in mind in the multifamily sector, when you have a borrower, he often has a lot of limits of co-borrowers. and you'll see a repeat of not just that particular gp but of the limiteds who buy other properties.
it's not uncommon for us to have 10 to 20 loans with a particular borrower and constantly reengaging with that particular borrower, but that's the nature of our business. and even when we do deal with more big brokers, we do generally -- our new mortgage brokers were very loyal to us and as a repeat level of business from that mortgage broker. that's very consistent.
charlie arestia -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
thanks very much, guys. appreciate all the color.

our next question is from stephen laws with raymond james. please go ahead.
stephen laws -- raymond james -- analyst
good morning, ivan and paul. you both touched on the strong volumes, and certainly, last year, closed with the record volumes of $2.7 billion. can you talk about year-to-date volumes or your expectations here that we should think about as we model out volumes for '21?
paul elenio -- chief financial officer
sure. all right. let me start. stephen, just giving you some color on how january closed out, and then ivan and i will talk a little bit about globally how we view things for the rest of the year.
so in january, we did about $500 million of agency loans. i think if you go back and look at our production in the past year, in the second quarter, we did $1.4 billion and in the third quarter, we did $1.5 billion, and obviously, in the fourth quarter, we put up a monster number of $2.7 billion. so on a run rate right now, we're probably tracking to $1.4 billion, $1.5 billion for the first quarter. and possibly, for the second quarter, ivan will give some color on where he thinks the agency business goes from there.
on the balance sheet side, we've also been very active. we've had a large balance sheet pipeline as well. and i think in january, we did about $400 million to $450 million of volume, and we had about $50 million of runoff. so we've had about $400 million in net growth in january to our book.
don't know what pace that happens. it will all depend on what runoff we see going forward, and that's always a challenge. but our pipeline is very, very strong, and we're very confident we're going to be able to grow this book pretty substantially in 2021 as well.
ivan kaufman -- president and chief executive officer
yes. we're off to a good start. we have a great pipeline. our bridge pipeline, our balance sheet pipeline is extraordinarily strong.
where many people were very negatively impacted there in the pandemic, didn't have the right liability structures, didn't have the right banking relationships, we didn't miss a beat. so we've gained market share. we've gained a lot of momentum. the securitization market, we believe, is going to be extremely attractive going forward.
and i think that will continue similarly along the lines, if not greater, than what we did last year. so we'll see good growth in the balance sheet portfolio, and hopefully, a consistent level of building our pipeline and continuing at the levels that we closed in january if things remain constant.
stephen laws -- raymond james -- analyst
great. thanks. switching to the financing side. paul, can you talk about the recent clo, the market reception plans for future issuance, and how we should think about that this year?
paul elenio -- chief financial officer
sure. so as you know --
ivan kaufman -- president and chief executive officer
paul, let me cover that a little bit because we really can't talk about going forward of what we're doing in impairs we do, but the securitization market has tightened dramatically from where it was 30 days ago, 60 days, and 90 days ago. we think it's as tight levels, almost as tight as it was pre-covid. and we have probably the greatest brand in the clo market. we have a good collateral position on our lines.
and we always maintain a very good percentage and mix of clo total debt. so we think that market is perfect. we got very aggressive to load up our balance sheet, understanding that that market would tighten. and we feel very optimistic about us being able to access that market.
paul, do you want to add some color?
paul elenio -- chief financial officer
no, that's exactly what i was going to say. stephen, it's a big part of our strategy. as you know, we've been a serial issuer of someone who's had a tremendous brand and reputation. and as ivan said, we managed -- and by looking at the market and seeing when we think it's appropriate to access that market.
and it's just part of our normal strategy, and we continue to do that as we move forward. and we'll see when and if we get there and when it happens.
stephen laws -- raymond james -- analyst
great. appreciate it.

our next question is from jade rahmani with kbw. please go ahead.
jade rahmani -- kbw -- analyst
thank you very much for taking the questions. in terms of the structured finance business, the on-balance sheet business, two questions. first, what drove the almost $1 billion of originations? maybe you could give color as to how many deals that encompass, what percentage were repeat customers, and how much were refinancings of existing deals? and then secondly, how are you thinking about the roes in that business, given the spread compression that we're seeing in the stabilized asset types?
ivan kaufman -- president and chief executive officer
so with respect to refinancing of our own portfolio, it's a very small percentage that's not something we customarily do, unless there's an accretive reason to us and to the borrower. but that's not a primary aspect of our business. we'll always proceed with tremendous caution if its bridge-to-bridge, whether it's our own or somebody else's. with respect to the roes, we generally look for around a -- anywhere between 10% and 14%, with an average of a 12%, and it's where we originate to.
we actually think where the securitization market is, i think, we can probably see a bit of a lift in that. relative to the volume that we've done. it's almost as though as like we were one of the last men standing. most people were still looking at their loans.
they were very impaired by covid, by being overleveraged and not being prepared, and therefore, really, we're not in a position to originate new loans. that allowed us to really step in, particularly on the larger loan side. a lot of firms were out there being extraordinarily aggressive. and they were originating a very tight spreads without the right structure.
many of those firms got hurt, kind of left a little bit of a void. so it gave us an opportunity to build some large loan positions with great structure and great pricing. and even though, competition is returning to the market, i think, we've gained real favor on the originations of those products, with a good percentage of our product being repeat customers.
paul elenio -- chief financial officer
yes. just to add to that, ivan, all of that is absolutely correct. and from a number of transactions perspective, we did about $950 million of straight bridge loans. the rest were some of our sfr business.
and on that $950 million, we probably had 30, 35 deals. so we did have some chunkier deals, as ivan mentioned, in there. and as he said, not a lot of that at all is refinanced. some of it was, but not that much.
and our levered returns are right in the area that ivan was talking about.
jade rahmani -- kbw -- analyst
and you said january balance sheet production is $450 million to $500 million?
paul elenio -- chief financial officer
we did about $450 million in january already and had about $50 million of runoff. so we had net growth in january of about $400 million. that's correct. was a really strong month.
ivan kaufman -- president and chief executive officer
and, jade, with respect to our returns, keep in mind that it's really exponential in a way because our goal is to create an agency lending loan out of that, which gives us gain on sale, as well as servicing revenue. so if we build our balance sheet and fees, our agency business, which is part of our model and our franchise, and to the extent that business can grow, will grow the annuity on a long-term basis. so the returns become exponential, and we recapture that in our loan business.
paul elenio -- chief financial officer
that's right.
jade rahmani -- kbw -- analyst
and what's the mix of multifamily in the bridge lending business? because i've always asked the commercial mortgage reits, why they don't have an exit strategy in terms of recapturing the business once it goes out of transition, and none of them have a good answer for that. but it seems like arbor is unique among that in terms of being able to refinance that.
ivan kaufman -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. well, we are extraordinarily disciplined in our approach. and, i mean, just off-the-cuff and paul will correct me, i think 100% of the loans that we originated in the fourth quarter and so far in the first quarter, were all multifamily. i'm pretty sure, yes.
but generally, almost 80% to 90% is multifamily. all multifamily loans that we originate on our balance sheet, our size within an agency takeout, that's our business model.
paul elenio -- chief financial officer
yes. and ivan is right. we had 98% of the fourth-quarter originations from multifamily, 100% of the first-quarter originations, so far, were multifamily. so those percentages are always extremely high for us, and we obviously get the takeout if we can on the agency side as well.
jade rahmani -- kbw -- analyst
in terms of the sustainability of the gse volumes, is there a refinance component that you think is likely to abate in coming quarters if interest rates normalize? i know that their interest rate -- sorry, their lending caps were basically increased, but seemed flat with what they did in 2020. so i'm not expecting their overall volumes to increase. and i'm a little worried about what happens if rates tick up from here. so how do you think about the sustainability of the gse business?
ivan kaufman -- president and chief executive officer
well, i think it's important to note, different than other asset classes, and more importantly, different than the single-family businesses is that most multifamily loans that are originated are done on five-, seven- and 10-year terms and many of them are done, especially the value-add, on one- and three-year terms. so there's a continued flow and pipeline of loans that have to be refinanced just based on historical maturities. it's not as those single-family loans, which have a 30-year maturity, are interest rate-driven or are driven by home purchases. so that is a significant amount of business.
we expect that the agency is at the $70 million and $80 million level, which is similar to where it was last year. they will fill up. we will have our market share, and that will be a strong market. there are certain times when interest rates dip like they did when they were down 75 basis points on the 10-year, that people got extraordinarily aggressive and they move very quickly, and there's a bit of a jump.
and then there are times like now where rates jump up from 75 to 130, and people take a pause, and they have to rethink where they are. but 125 basis points on a 10-year, with low 3% as your interest rate, are still at historical lows. and anything that was originated over the last 10 years, most of that will qualify for an accretive refinance to borrowers. so we're quite optimistic.
i think the real question comes on the purchase side. is there enough inventory out there? are their transactions going to grow? is the purchase market going to be in 2021 where it was in 2019? but it should be a robust big market on the multifamily side, and we should be able to maintain and get our share.
jade rahmani -- kbw -- analyst
thank you. and just last question on the credit side. looking at the agency business, i think you've said forbearances in the fannie mae dus portfolio were 0.5%, and in the freddie mac portfolio of 5.2%. so a tenfold difference between freddie and fannie.
a vast other folks like walker & dunlop too tie-in on the reasons why that is. some have said it relates to the average smaller loan size. in the freddie mac portfolio, possibly, it relates to the risk-sharing nature of dus strategy. so what do you think the reason is for the higher forbearance in freddie mac? and secondarily, are you worried at all about migration of that 5% forbearance into future delinquencies?
ivan kaufman -- president and chief executive officer
so, first, our forbearance, specifically on the small balance, have outperformed the rest of the group. and freddie mac's forbearances are higher than fannie mae's. their policy is a little bit different. with respect to any potential losses that come from these, we're not concerned at all.
we think the properties are well in the money. we think, come september, things will return to normal. and we're fairly comfortable that we're in a good position on all those loans. i think there was a level of dislocation, borrower supply for forbearance.
properties are returning to normal. but keep in mind that there's a lot of cap rate compression right now on the multifamily side. so even if you have a little softening on rents and a little rent decline and even little vacancy, that's really offset by cap rate compression. so we think the value is pretty stable and the demand for investors to buy multifamily is really outrageous, and we're very, very comfortable with our portfolio.
jade rahmani -- kbw -- analyst
thank you.
operator
our next question is from lee cooperman with the omega family office. please go ahead.
lee cooperman -- omega advisors -- analyst
thank you. let me just first congratulate you and your team, ivan, and you guys have done a terrific job for the shareholders. and you stand out in a class by itself. and i think you deserve a shoutout, and i'm going to give you that.
now, let me move on to more relevant stuff. let's talk a little bit about capital adequacy and your cost of equity versus your return on equity. on several times in the call, and you've said this in the past and you've proven to be 100% right, you felt your stock was substantially undervalued. yet, you've been willing to sell stock to financial growth.
so i guess the answer is, you sell something cheap because you think you could reinvest the money at even more attractive terms. so maybe you could spend a little time talking about your return on -- for every dollar you raise, what kind of return can you generate on that dollar incrementally. and any thoughts on that would be very interesting to me.
ivan kaufman -- president and chief executive officer
so, you know, when we're raising capital, it's usually to fund our growth. so in this particular business, we have to evaluate whether we're going to runoff in our balance sheet portfolio, what we can add to it, and whether we can add to it accretively. and if we can increase our balance sheet portfolio and get a return north of 12% and as much as 15% sometimes, we'll evaluate whether it's worth raising capital to fund that growth if there's growth in our balance sheet. and it's really just a mathematical analysis that paul performs.
and he makes a decision where we should price our loans and how accretive it is and whether it's worthwhile bringing in and growing the balance sheet at accretive returns. it's just a mathematical analysis. paul, do you want to comment on that?
paul elenio -- chief financial officer
sure. that's right, lee, and yes, so we have a pretty robust pipeline. the only question is where does runoff go. and if runoff is stronger, then we have those dollars to fund the growth.
if it's not, then we assess whether we want to do loans at those yields and raise capital at these prices or whatever prices we are. and historically, as you know, lee, we've done, as you said, a great job of being real good stewards of capital with high inside ownership. so it's an analysis we do. and if we think we can raise capital at accretive prices to fund loans that generate, let's say, a 13% to a 14% roe or 12% to 15%, as ivan said, and that's an analysis we do.
and we look at it and say if it's accretive, then we go forward. and that's exactly how the analysis works. and we do think that we can raise capital to fund growth, that would be 13% to 15% on an roe.
lee cooperman -- omega advisors -- analyst
so when you sell shares is because you think you can reinvest the money that would be accretive, even though the stock is undervalued in your view.
ivan kaufman -- president and chief executive officer
well, it all depends on whether or not the accretive will help on growth and strengthen our balance sheet and have a longer-term growth that's --
lee cooperman -- omega advisors -- analyst
well, clearly, it explains in your balance sheet. your book value is $10.35. your stock is trading over $16. so the extent you sell stock well in excess of book value, which you've not been able to do in the past, it's accretive.
but on the other hand, you're selling something that you think is worth more than you're selling it, that only makes sense if you can basically invest the money on the return that enhances the overall picture of the company, which you've been able to do. and so you're saying, you can invest at 12% to 15% roe. is that after the leverage you employ?
paul elenio -- chief financial officer
yes. yes, it is.
ivan kaufman -- president and chief executive officer
yes. but also, as i mentioned earlier, lee, keep in mind that that 12% to 15% is really greater than that when we capture the end loan. and it's more like a 30% to 40% return. so if we can recapture 60% to 70% of what we're originating, right, and create long-term annuity growth and it's the best capital raise we can do, then that goes into our analysis as well.
paul elenio -- chief financial officer
yes. that's where i was going next where ivan is on the end loan. we're recapturing a lot of that bridge business, lee, into fannie mae and agency end loans, which not only gives us gain on sale, but it gives us nine, 10 years of servicing that's prepayment-protected and locked out at a higher multiple. so that is all factored into the equation as well.
lee cooperman -- omega advisors -- analyst
again, i want to congratulate you guys on really traversing environment and a very difficult environment extraordinarily well. congratulations.
paul elenio -- chief financial officer
thank you, lee.
ivan kaufman -- president and chief executive officer
thanks a lot, lee, for your support.
operator
we'll go next to matthew howlett with wolfe research. please go ahead.
matthew howlett -- wolfe research -- analyst
all right, guys. thanks for taking my questions. two questions if i may. first, you've got great momentum on the agency business.
i just want to confirm, there's a mission-driven rule now, where 50% of the volume has to be with rentals at 80% of the median income. i just want to double-check on the conformity of your volume versus those new caps. and then i think i read that fannie was increasing their gse fee on the multifamily business. both of them clearly said that they're going to have to start operating on the new -- collaborate as new capital requirement, which was higher than the prior one.
whether that would have an impact on any gain on sale margins? that's the first part.
ivan kaufman -- president and chief executive officer
so with respect to the mission-driven, if we're not the no. 1 mission-driven business, we're in the top tier. we've always been very, very mission-driven. we focus on workforce housing, which has been the space we're in with a lot of emphasis on the small balance loans, which also fits our criteria.
so we're one of their top clients in that space, and that bodes well for us. so we fit that criteria. what was your second question?
matthew howlett -- wolfe research -- analyst
it was on the gse and the dus. so both entities are going to start conforming to their new capital requirements that were unveiled in november. whether or not that would pressure any margins going forward if they do adjust gse yield?
ivan kaufman -- president and chief executive officer
yes. listen, i think what the agencies are going to do is they're going to originate their $70 billion or $80 billion. they're going to adjust their fees up and down depending on what their volumes are. and we're going to get our market share.
and if you've read, we have our own private label program. so to the extent the gses widen a little bit, we'll do more volume on our private label program, which we're well-positioned for. so i think regardless of the environment, we have the tools to be very effective.
matthew howlett -- wolfe research -- analyst
got it. and then second question, just a follow-up on lee's question. looking at your capital structure, and particularly your preferred and some of the unsecured debt you're coming due, it's a lot higher cost than where you could issue today. i'm assuming as you grow, it's going to even improve.
i mean, i'm looking at 8% coupon preferreds, and you probably, at some point, could issue at 6%. and then, the unsecured debt is a little bit higher due to some of the stuff that's new. what can you tell me about what you can do with the balance sheet on that, both sides of the balance sheet? is the preferred callable? and i know you have to make whole premiums on the unsecured stuff. but what could you do to lower the cost of your debt capital and your preferred equity capital and maybe issue in those channels as opposed to shared equity?
paul elenio -- chief financial officer
sure. sure. so let me handle the preferred side. you're 100% right, matt.
it is callable. the preferred, it had a call protection. that call protection has expired. it's only $90 million, but it is callable.
it is trading at a coupon above 8%. i've been looking at the market, it's possible to introduce a new instrument like that, and maybe in the 6s, maybe even better as things starting to tighten. and there's another area as well, right? there's an arm here. right now, our dividend yield is still higher than we want it to be, and we think we're undervalued.
and if we were able to get a premium value at some point, there's also an arm on taking that out with equity if the dividend yield is inside of that. but right now, we're looking at that. it's very small. we'll continue to manage that.
it won't have a massive impact on our cost of funds, but it is something we are watching. the other area is, as you said, the senior unsecured notes are kind of all locked out. and we've got tremendous rates on that piece of -- those pieces of paper. so we're in a good spot right now on that.
and as ivan mentioned, as we continue to march forward, we'll see how successful we are in the future, as we have been in accessing the securitization market, which continues to drive down our cost of funds. those are the things we look at. we continue to work with our banking lines at making sure we continue to get the tightest spreads and the tightest pricing, and we've made significant improvements there as well. and that's just part of our culture, and that's just part of how we run our business.
matthew howlett -- wolfe research -- analyst
that's great. and i really appreciate it. just getting back to the preferred, i know it's a small issue, but do you think you could -- given the growth of the company and the growth of the balance sheet, you could take -- you could improve the -- you could increase to maybe $100 million, $200 million in size and do a 6% deal? it seems it would be accretive to the -- massively accretive to your investment business. just curious on how high you could take it.
paul elenio -- chief financial officer
yes. i'd have to look at it. i've looked at it a while ago, and it was in the high 6s then. i think it's tightened since then, and i'd have to look at how much we can add.
but again, the preferred isn't common, it's preferred, but it's a good instrument. and you're going to add call protection to it when you do it. so you have to balance the new call protection with the rate. and i think you're right.
i think we can be well inside this number, and it's something we're going to look at.

good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the fourth-quarter and full-year arbor realty trust earnings conference call. [operator instructions] please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [operator instructions] i would now like to turn the call over to your speaker today, paul elenio, chief financial officer. please go ahead.
paul elenio -- chief financial officer
ok. thank you, keith, and good morning, everyone and welcome to the quarterly earnings call for arbor realty trust. this morning, we'll discuss the results for the quarter ended december 30, 2020. with me on the call today is ivan kaufman, our president and chief executive officer.
before we begin, i need to inform you that statements made in this earnings call may be deemed forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties, including information about possible or assumed future results of our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations, plans and objectives. these statements are based on our beliefs, assumptions, and expectations of our future performance taking into account the information currently available to us. factors that cause actual results to differ materially from arbor's expectations in these forward-looking statements are detailed in our sec reports. listeners are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of today.
arbor undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise these forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after today or the occurrences of unanticipated events. we also have one housekeeping item we'd like to mention. historically, we have disclosed core earnings as an important non-gaap financial metric to assess the performance of our business. effective in the fourth quarter, we are changing the name from core earnings to distributable earnings as a result of discussions between the mortgage reit industry and the sec over the past several months to adopt terminology that is more descriptive of what this metric represents.
this is nothing more than a name change, and not a change in how we calculate the metric. distributable earnings is calculated the same way we calculated core earnings in the past. i'll now turn the call over to arbor's president and ceo, ivan kaufman. 
ivan kaufman -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, paul, and thanks to everyone for joining us on today's call. we're very excited today to discuss the significant success we had in closing out what was an exceptional 2020, as well as our plans and outlook for 2021, which we believe will be another outstanding year. as you can see from this morning's press release, we had another record quarter, and 2020's results reflect one of the best years as a public company. we are very well-positioned to succeed in the current economic climate, which gives us great confidence in our ability to continue to have tremendous success in 2021.
we have built a viable operating platform, focused on a rate right asset class with very stable liability structures, strong liquidity, an active balance sheet, and gse, agency business, and many diversified income streams that generate strong earnings and dividends every market cycle. our business model also provides many diversified opportunities for growth, which clearly puts us in a class by ourselves, and allowed us to increase our dividend 3 times in 2020 while maintaining the lowest dividend payout ratio in the industry. over the last five years, we have delivered an annualized shareholder return of approximately 22% for the year, significantly outperforming our peers in each and every year, including the distinction of being the only commercial mortgage reit in our space to deliver a positive shareholder return in 2020 despite the significant effects of the pandemic. and the performance, combined with the quality and diversity of our income streams, along with a track record of consistent earnings growth and industry-low dividend payout ratio clearly differentiates us and is why we believe we are extremely undervalued, and we should be trading at a substantial premium per our current price.
as i mentioned earlier, we had another record quarter, with our fourth-quarter results reflecting the continued commitment and successful execution of our business strategy and a diverse platform we have developed. these truly remarkable results have once again allowed us to increase our dividend to $0.33 a share. this is our third consecutive quarterly dividend increase, reflecting a 10% increase in 2020, and represents a payout ratio of around 70% compared to an industry average of 95% to 100%. before i discuss more detail of growth and success we had in all of our business platforms, i want to highlight some of our more significant 2020 accomplishments, which include: generating substantial growth in our earnings, allowing us to increase our dividend 3 times to an annual run rate of $1.32 a share, up from $1.20 per share, resulting in a nine straight years of consistent dividend growth with 19 increases over that time; delivering a total shareholder return of 7.4% in 2020 and 106% cumulatively for the last five years, with an annualized return of approximately 22%; achieving industry-leading roes of 19%, a 30% increase over last year; producing record originations of $9.1 billion, a 20% increase from our 2019 numbers; moving up three positions in our league tables, finishing sixth in fannie mae dus production and no.
1 in fannie mae small balance lending category for the second year in a row; producing record agency originations of $6.3 billion, a 44% increase over last year; increasing our balance sheet portfolio 28% in 2020 to $5.5 billion; growing our servicing portfolio to $25 billion, a 23% increase from 2019 and a 52% increase over the last three years; continuing to be a market leader in the nonrecourse securitization arena, closing our largest clo to date totaling $800 million with improved terms and flexibility; and raising $250 million of accretive growth capital to fund our growing pipeline and increase our earnings run rate. to further highlight this incredible success, i would like to talk about the significant growth we experienced in all areas of our business and how well-positioned we are to continue this success going forward. as paul will discuss in more detail, our distributable earnings for the fourth quarter were $0.49 per share, which is an incredible accomplishment and is a true testament to the value of our franchise and the many diverse income streams we have created. we continued to realize significant benefits from many areas of our diverse platform, including record growth in our gse agency platform that continues to produce strong margins and increased servicing fees; continued growth and significant benefits from the size and scale of our balance sheet business; strong performance of our multifamily focused portfolios with very delinquencies and extremely low forbearances and; substantial income from our residential business.
and these reoccurring benefits, combined with our versatile originations platform, strong pipeline, and credit quality of our portfolio. puts us in a unique position to be able to continue to produce significant distributable earnings going forward, and we are appropriately positioned to excel in this environment. we experienced significant growth in our gse agency platform in 2020. we originated $2.7 billion in gse agency loans in the fourth quarter and $6.3 billion in the full year, both which are at record levels.
equally important, we also have a very robust pipeline, and as a result, we expect to produce strong origination volumes in the first quarter and remain confident in our ability to continue to produce significant agency volumes in 2021. our gse agency platform continues to offer a premium value as it requires limited capital and generate significant long-dated predictable income streams and produces significant annual cash flow. additionally, our $24.6 billion gse agency servicing portfolio, which grew 23% in 2020, is mostly prepayment-protected and generated $112 million a year and growing, and reoccurring cash flow, which is up 27% from $88 million annually last year. this is in an addition to the strong gain on sale margins we continue to generate from our origination platform, which combined with new and increasing servicing revenues, will continue to contribute greatly to our earnings and dividends.
from a liquidity perspective, we are very pleased to have a current cash and liquidity position of approximately $400 million, which provides us with adequate liquidity to navigate the current market conditions and gives us offensive capital to take advantage of accretive lending opportunities. this has allowed us to replace our runoff and meaningfully grow our balance sheet loan book with high-quality multifamily bridge loans that generate attractive level of returns and creates a substantial pipeline of future gse agency origination volumes and long-dated servicing revenues. we are very pleased with the high-quality balance sheet portfolio we have built that is also financed with the appropriate liability structures. we grew our balance sheet loan book 28% in 2020 to $5.5 billion on $2.4 billion in new originations.
this significant growth will continue to increase our run rate of net interest income going forward, and we also have a very robust pipeline, which we believe, will allow us to continue to grow our loan book in 2021 and increase our earnings. it is also very important to highlight that over 90% of our book are senior bridge loans, more importantly, 80% of our portfolio is in multifamily assets, which has been the most resilient asset class in all cycles and continues to significantly outperform all other asset classes in this recession as well. in reflecting on 2020, we had an exceptional year and clearly outperformed our peer group. we are the best-performing reit five years in a row, delivering a 22% annualized return over that time period.
our team was extremely well-positioned for this dislocation that occurred, and as a result, we suffered no dilution with substantial loss in value from issuing dilutive rescue capital or high-yielding debt to navigate through this recession. we also set up for continued success in 2021 to a versatile operating platform that is multifamily centric with a strong pipeline, significant servicing income, sizable balance sheet portfolio, single-family rental platform, and our investment in the residential mortgage business. and as a result, we are optimistic that this year, we will enter a dividend elite club of 10 straight years of dividend growth. i will now turn the call over to paul to take you through the financial results.
paul elenio -- chief financial officer
thank you, ivan. as ivan mentioned, we had another exceptional quarter, producing distributable earnings of $67 million or $0.49 per share for the fourth quarter. we also had a record year with distributable earnings of $1.75 per share in 2020, a 28% increase over our 2019 results. and these results translated into record-high roes of approximately 21% for the fourth quarter and 19% for the full-year 2020, which reflects a 30% increase over our 2019 roes.
we also continued to benefit from several positive aspects of our diverse business model including significant growth in our agency and balance sheet business platforms, libor floors in a large portion of our balance sheet loan book, and substantial income from our residential banking joint venture. and these benefits clearly demonstrate the value of our operating platform and the diversity of our income streams and, more importantly, gives us great confidence in our ability to continue to generate strong earnings and dividends in the future. as we mentioned earlier, we had another phenomenal quarter from our residential banking business. and as a result of continued historical low-interest rate environment, we recorded $20 million of income from this investment in the fourth quarter, which contributed approximately $0.12 a share on a tax-effected basis to our distributable earnings.
the income from this investment further emphasizes the diversity of our income streams, and act as a natural hedge against declining interest rates, specifically earnings on our escrow balances. and while we believe this investment will continue to contribute meaningfully to our distributable earnings going forward, we are expecting to see some normalization in volumes and margins in this business in 2021. our adjusted book value at december 31 was approximately $10.35, adding back roughly $63 million of noncash general cecl reserves on a tax-effective basis. this is up 6.3% from approximately $9.74 last quarter, largely due to the significant earnings we generated, as well as our fourth-quarter capital raise.
and as a reminder, we have very little exposure to the asset classes that have been affected the most by the recession, such as retail and hospitality. our total exposure to these asset classes is approximately $200 million or approximately 4% of our portfolio. we also believe we've adequately reserved for these assets, and do not feel, at this point, that any material further impairment will be necessary, which gives us confidence that our adjusted book value of $10.35 accurately reflects the current impact of the recession. looking at our results from our gse agency business, we originated $2.7 billion in loans and recorded $2.4 billion in loan sales in the fourth quarter.
the margins on our fourth-quarter gse agency loan sales was 1.41% compared to 1.63% for the third quarter mainly due to a change in the mix of our loan products during the quarter and from lower margins on our fannie business due to our higher average loan size. in the fourth quarter, we recorded $69 million of mortgage servicing rights income related to $2.8 billion of committed loans, representing an average msr rate of around 2.45%, which was down from 2.77% rate for the third quarter, again, mainly due to larger loan sizes in the fourth quarter. our servicing portfolio grew 9% this quarter and 23% in 2020 to $24.6 billion at december 31, with a weighted average servicing fee of 45.4 basis points and an estimated remaining life of nine years. this portfolio will continue to generate a predictable annuity of income going forward of around $112 million gross annually, which is up approximately $24 million or 27% on an annual basis from the same time last year.
additionally, prepayment fees related to certain loans that have yield maintenance provisions was $2.7 million for the fourth quarter, compared to around $2 million for the third quarter. we also continue to see very positive trends related to our gse agency business collections, which we believe reflects the strength of our borrowers and the quality of our gse agency portfolio. we only have a handful of delinquent loans outstanding and extremely low forbearance numbers in our portfolio through january. loans and forbearance represent less than 0.5% of our $18.3 billion fannie book and around 5.5% of our $4.9 billion freddie loan book, which is relatively unchanged since october as we have had very few new requests for forbearance in the last several months.
and as a result of these extremely low forbearance numbers, we have no material unrecovered servicing advances outstanding either. in our balance sheet lending operation, we grew our portfolio 28% to $5.5 billion in 2020 on $2.4 billion in originations. our $5.5 billion investment portfolio had an all-in yield of 5.8% at december 31 compared to 5.93% at september 30 mainly due to higher rates on runoff as compared to new originations during the quarter. the average balance in our core investments was up to $5.1 billion this quarter from $5 billion last quarter, mainly due to the full effect of our third-quarter growth.
the average yield on these investments was 6.04% for the fourth quarter compared to 5.98% for the third quarter, mainly due to more acceleration of fees from early runoff in the fourth quarter, which was partially offset by higher interest rates on runoff as compared to originations in the fourth quarter. total debt on our core assets was approximately $4.9 billion at december 31, with an all-in debt cost of approximately 3.03% compared to a debt cost of around 3.09% at september 30. the average balance on our debt facilities was up slightly to approximately $4.64 billion for the fourth quarter from $4.59 billion for the third quarter, mostly due to financing the growth in our portfolio. and the average cost of funds on our debt facilities was relatively flat at 3.05% for the fourth quarter and 3.06% for the third quarter.
overall, net interest spreads on our core assets increased slightly to 2.99% this quarter compared to 2.92% last quarter. and our overall spot net interest spread was down to 2.77% at december 31 compared to 2.84% at september 30. lastly, the average leverage ratio on our core lending assets, including the trust preferreds and perpetual preferred stock as equity was flat at 86% in both the third and fourth quarter, and our overall debt-to-equity ratio on a spot basis was also flat at 3.0 to 1 at both december 31 and september 30, excluding general cecl reserves. that completes our prepared remarks for this morning.
and i'll now turn it back to the operator to take any questions you may have at this time.

operator
[operator instructions] and our first question comes from steve delaney from jmp securities. please go ahead.
steve delaney -- jmp securities -- analyst
good morning, ivan and paul. congrats on a strong report overall and especially the latest dividend hike to $0.34. i looked back at our model this morning and from air records, and i think they're accurate. you've now doubled your dividend since the $0.17 paid in the fourth quarter of 2016.
so just a bit over four years, so quite an accomplishment. as far as q&a, ivan, i could tell the enthusiasm in your sfr and b2r initiative, could you just give us an update on that program in terms of -- i understand it's carried in the structured business currently. but how large are the outstanding loans on the books at march 31, and how do the returns on these compare to your traditional bridge loan product?
ivan kaufman -- president and chief executive officer
so we think the build-to-rent space is a phenomenal space, and i'm intent on dominating that space and personally active in relationship building. what we like about the business is it has three components. the first one is the construction element, which is a little bit more complicated, it requires a balance sheet and real entrepreneurial capability. and that's the initial phase.
we're generally pricing those loans for levered returns of low to mid-teens, but that's just the beginning of the story. the real benefit is transitioning them to a bridge loan and they look very much like a multifamily loan and give us the same kind of returns. and then we exit those through our private label program or sometimes through the agencies. so we get what we call a free bite to the apple with each product, and it creates long-dated revenue streams.
the other aspects are just doing scattered sites, floating-rate loans or fixed-rate loans. that's a little bit more of a competitive market, and we're fairly active in that as well. relative to what's on the balance sheet and what's in the pipeline, paul, i'm going to transition that to you on what we've done year to date.
paul elenio -- chief financial officer
yes. sure. and thanks, steve, for the compliments, i think what we've accomplished has been extraordinary as well. as far as where the numbers land on the balance sheet and kind of the different pieces, as ivan laid out, we've got several pieces of this business.
we have a permanent side of the business, as you know. some of that is fixed-rate loans, which we did have a little bit of a sale this quarter on some inventory we had in our balance sheet. that will go through the agency business because it's being sold kind of into the market as individual sales, and we'll carry that for our agency business. it hasn't been big yet, but that's where that will go.
the rest of the business, the permanent variable rate loans that we're swapping out and pooling for securitization, kind of like a clo or a private label securitization, that will end up on the structured side of the business and has. and then you've got the build-to-rent and the bridge loans. so all that being said, where we're at is we have about $190 million sitting in our balance sheet business, which is comprised of bridge, funded build-to-rent, and permanent execution that's variable rate. keep in mind, though, we've done about $350 million of build-to-rent deals and only about $40 million of that has been funded.
so there's about $300 million that's unfunded that we've committed to and we disclosed in our filings, but as we fund those advances, it will continue to add to the balance sheet portfolio on the structured side.
steve delaney -- jmp securities -- analyst
and the -- we saw an increase in private label, $152 million in the quarter or at least that's what -- in terms of originations. now are some of those single-family rental, fixed-rate loans. they are not?
ivan kaufman -- president and chief executive officer
no. no. those are just pure fixed rate loans. and that's a good lead in because what you'll see, and this is one of the benefits of the way we run our company, is as you're fully aware from some of the other people you cover, there are -- agency originations were quite soft in the first quarter.
we look at it a little bit holistically. it's just a matter of where we're going to originate, whether it be originate, whether it be agency, whether it be private label, whether it be bridge. and depending on the appetite of the agencies, we may do more private label or more bridge. and that's what makes our franchise so unique in the sense, it's just a matter of which pocket the originations go into.
overall, we look at the overall, not the particular segment.
steve delaney -- jmp securities -- analyst
understood.
paul elenio -- chief financial officer
and the overall -- and, steve, just to give some numbers to that, the overall for the quarter between the agency, private label, and balance sheet, we did $2.5 billion of transactions this quarter. if you go back to this time last year, in the first quarter, which was largely pre-pandemic, if you remember, we did about $2 billion. so we're up 28% over last year's numbers which were pre-pandemic. so this growth has been pretty exceptional.
steve delaney -- jmp securities -- analyst
one final thing, ivan. we're looking -- it's early in the year, but we are working with lower caps on the gses on multifamily -- kind of awkward, but i call $70 billion, lower than $80 billion. you know what i'm talking about. but fannie mae totally blew through in the first quarter, it did $21.5 billion versus $17.5 billion, so $4 billion over.
i'm thinking as we get into the second half of the year, these seem pretty firm when they -- when collaborator put these in place, that he wanted them down and he wanted more affordable. is this going to play into -- i know the private label that you did was not necessarily focused on this. but could we see, by the second half of this year, another opportunity for you to aggregate private label multifamily and do a second cmbs transaction?
ivan kaufman -- president and chief executive officer
without a question. i mean, while the first quarter was strong, it was really as a result of a strong january. the agencies backed off and february and march were actually much lighter than anticipated. and that's when we started gaining a lot of momentum on our private label.
so we've gained considerable momentum, and i think it will be an active part of our business for all of 2021. and also, we don't see that backing off. we see the agencies having cap issues. we see a greater level of affordability, which you know we play in very big.
so we think our private label is going to be a great part of our story.
steve delaney -- jmp securities -- analyst
thank you both for the comments.
ivan kaufman -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, steve.
operator
and our next question comes from lee cooperman from omega family office. your line is open.
lee cooperman -- omega family office -- investor
i hesitate to add any complements to supplement the prior questioner. but let me just say that i've been involved with the company. actually since the ipo and very heavily for the last decade, and have to complement you on the movement into multiple product lines, the clos that you managed to issue. i think you've been very masterful in running the company.
what should i worry about? what worries you at night? what keeps you up?
ivan kaufman -- president and chief executive officer
clearly, when you're growing a business, there's always a lot to worry about. but i want to reflect on one thing that we're one of the only companies in our space that didn't suffer any dilution going through the financial dislocation that just occurred.
lee cooperman -- omega family office -- investor
you actually bought your stock back at the lows.
ivan kaufman -- president and chief executive officer
we did. we did. most people were getting rescue capital. so we would keep an eye on our liquidity.
we would keep an eye on our liability structures. those are critical because we always go through a downturn. and as long as you have the right liability structures in place and good credit quality, you'll manage with those dislocations. and we want to have as much liquidity as possible.
i mean looking back on it, lee, i guess, not having had to issue equity, i would have loved to have bought back more stock. so for us, we focus on our liability structures, and we focus on our liquidity. and most significantly, we will focus on our ability to manage our portfolio, which is outstanding. so those are the things that we focus on, so we don't lose too much sleep.
lee cooperman -- omega family office -- investor
well, congratulations on your performance. stay well. i lose sleep because of my prostate not because of arbor realty.
ivan kaufman -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, lee. stay healthy.
operator
and our next question comes from charlie arestia from j.p. morgan. please go ahead.
charlie arestia -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
hey. good morning, ivan and paul. thanks for taking the question today. we've heard a lot recently about there being a lot of capital chasing after multifamily and industrial properties lately, sort of a flight to quality post covid, broader unknowns around office and hospitality and more of the known issues with retail.
obviously, multifamily is most relevant to arbor by a wide margin. but ivan, would love to get your view on what you're seeing out there in terms of competition for your core assets. if you're seeing that competition pick up recently as more of your peers have gotten more comfortable deploying capital than maybe a quarter or two ago.
ivan kaufman -- president and chief executive officer
the competition is fierce. i mean, it's actually greater now than it was pre-pandemic. and even a lot of the people who got hurt are back and being very aggressive. so there's no question there's a lot of compression on our pricing, but trying to make that up on the debt side.
and we do have a franchise. and so we do have a lot of momentum. we did bulk up in the fourth quarter and first quarter to kind of get ahead. so we have good spreads in place.
we'll work on our liability structures and keep an eye on credit. and i think one of the other things we're going to focus on very, very, very precisely is that for the loans we do put on our balance sheet, we're going to try and turn them as much as we can into agency and pick up the back end fees and reduce our risk on some of the loans on our books. but make no mistake about it. it's an extraordinarily aggressive environment right now.
charlie arestia -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
and look, we're sitting here in the first week of may. obviously, agency originations came back down to earth a little bit this quarter. curious, if you can give us a sense of where volumes might shake out for the year, given what the pipeline looks like, and you guys typically have pretty good visibility into that. i think we all realize that 2020 was certainly an unusual year, but wondering how '21 volumes might compare to your pre-covid annual numbers.
ivan kaufman -- president and chief executive officer
so as i mentioned a little earlier, the agencies, while they had a great january, they did back off their price and lost some market share. they're starting to get aggressive again. so i think it's going to be a pretty good year. i'll let paul comment a little bit on the numbers.
we are seeing growth in our private label segment of our business, which when the agencies widen out a little bit, then that segment will pick up. i think from a holistic basis, we'll probably do fairly consistently what we did last year. the mix may be a little different between private label and between the agency side. paul, you want to fill in some of the numbers?
paul elenio -- chief financial officer
yes. sure. so, charlie, good question, and i'll give you some color. and as ivan said, the agencies were a little light in february, march and even into april, but our pipeline has gotten really, really big.
so just some context around that. we did about 300 -- with private label, we did about $365 million of agency and private label in april, but we have over a $2 billion pipeline right now in agency and private label. so it's starting to pick up again. and our balance sheet business has grown dramatically, as you've seen.
and in the month of april, we did another $450 million of balance sheet product. we did have about $350 million of runoff. there was a couple of deals that ran off a little larger. so the growth was about $100 million.
but i guess the way we look at it is exactly the way ivan's laid this out. we've got multiple pockets, multiple different products. and i think we will be higher than we were last year on total volume, but the mix will change, right, because we'll have a little bit less, maybe on the agency, a little bit more private label, and certainly more origination volume on the balance sheet side. so that's the kind of way we look at it.
and again, we have the ability to go in all different areas of our business lines. the unknown is runoff. and as ivan mentioned, we're laser-focused on recapturing as much of the runoff as we can. we've always been a firm that's prided ourselves on portfolio retention.
and on the balance sheet side, we've been doing mostly multifamily bridge loans of late. and in the last two quarters, we've recaptured more than 50% of the runoff on the balance sheet side into agency and apl product. so that's the way we manage the business. i think, as ivan said, we'll probably come in right around we were last year.
the mix will just be a little different, and we're excited about.
charlie arestia -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
got it. thank you both so much for the color.
operator
and our next question comes from stephen laws from raymond james. your line is open.
stephen laws -- raymond james -- analyst
good morning. and as previous people say, congrats on another strong quarter. so like that's -- every quarter, it's a great run. you guys have done a lot of hard work.
to follow-up on the previous comments, ivan, on the private label, as you see that mix shift, do you have enough track record in the private label side to know kind of your margins and gain on sale there? and if you see a decline in the fannie business, which i think has some higher margins than the other, is that going to be offset? or how do we think about that changing on a weighted basis as the mix shifts?
ivan kaufman -- president and chief executive officer
so the first private-label securitization is always the hardest. and what we were really pleased about, it was well-received. and we were a little nervous because with the pandemic hitting and potential credit issues, we didn't want any -- have a misstep. so we're very pleased to say that the portfolio performed perfectly, and the market is really expecting us to come back to market.
and i think that second execution is going to be even better than our first, which did very well. so we think it will do very well. paul can comment more on the margin side of the business, but we feel really comfortable that, that's just another product in line with similar execution to how we have it on the agency side of the business.
paul elenio -- chief financial officer
yes. and, stephen, i think that's right. it will change a little bit depending on market. we'll aggregate, as ivan said, for another securitization.
obviously, we're swapping out what we can to protect our spreads. and i've always guided this business from a low of 101.35 to a high of 101.50 on the margin. and i think that's where we've been coming in consistently. could the private label business do a little better in some of our securitizations? yes.
but i think it will blend all to around there. if it surprises us on the upside, that's great. but i don't think the move in mix from agency to private label will change our margins dramatically overall on a weighted basis.
stephen laws -- raymond james -- analyst
two questions just kind of around the higher rate, the move-in rates we've seen. first, on the servicing side, how sensitive is that? how much duration is that at? if rates moved up, would that extend the life of those cash flows even further? and how much so? or is it less sensitive than what you might see on resi msrs? and secondly, does it give you an opportunity to earn a higher return on your escrow balances? how is that invested? if so, how much incremental return can you generate there?
paul elenio -- chief financial officer
yes. so, ivan, i don't know if you want me to take that?
ivan kaufman -- president and chief executive officer
go ahead, paul. you take it.
paul elenio -- chief financial officer
yes. i think that's right. the msrs that we generate is substantially different, as you know, stephen, to resi, because most of what we're doing is 10 to 12 to 15-year paper that has yield maintenance provisions and lockouts to about six months prior to maturity. so this stuff is very sticky, and that's what we love about this business.
there are times people pay off early. you see we get prepayment fees. they make holes on the yield maintenance. but i think it's less rate-sensitive, as you said, than resi.
that being said, if rates move and it makes sense for somebody to redo a deal, we'll be there to recapture that deal, and we'll also get it on the back end on the maintenance side. the second part of your question was --
stephen laws -- raymond james -- analyst
escrow returns on the spread.
paul elenio -- chief financial officer
yes. so we're sitting with about $1.4 billion in escrow balances right now. and clearly, they're earning far less than they were earning in the past, as you know, because of where rates have gone. and we've had some natural hedges against that with the run-up in our resi business.
but yes, i mean, if rates move up substantially, we're going to see an increase in our escrow balances. that could be offset by the fact that we've got certain loans in our portfolio with libor floors that may not fully kick in. but yes, clearly, on the escrow side, you could see a real run up. i think we're earning about $5 million and annually on our escrow balances right now.
that number was $15 million, $16 million, $17 million when rates were higher a couple of years ago. so there's obviously tremendous room for expansion there if rates were to run.
stephen laws -- raymond james -- analyst
yes. yes. great. well, that's helpful color.
thanks for the comments, paul. appreciate it.
operator
and our next question comes from jade rahmani with kbw.
ryan tomasello -- kbw -- analyst
this is ryan tomasello on for jade. just in terms of the sfr business, clearly, there's a nice opportunity there. i was curious, ivan, if you think that there will be an additional amount of investment required to build out that platform. i know you've already spent some capital in that space, but curious, based on the outlook, if you think you'd like to spend more there.
and as a follow-up to that, are there any interesting m&a opportunities to support the build-out of that sfr lending business?
ivan kaufman -- president and chief executive officer
so on the build-out, it's actually a pretty good question because we were initially building it out at a totally separate and dedicated unit. and we came to the conclusion that we can actually integrate it into our existing structure and have it aligned and part of our existing structure. and when it comes to the build-to-rent unit, most of the operational structure and credit decisions are being made by the same bridge group. so we're able to create enormous efficiencies and the same efficiencies on the origination side.
so it won't cost us as much. we actually adjusted that when we started. so there won't be that much incremental overhead other than on an executive level, which we pretty much have a full complement of executives that we need to create that. in terms of acquisition opportunities, i don't really see that many acquisition opportunities at the moment.
we saw a few. we passed on them. we felt building them up better would be more interesting. i think it's more a commitment of our executive talent to create the relationships and the infrastructure, which we're very, very pleased with our growth.
as paul mentioned earlier, we have a pipeline of almost $1 billion that we think we can close over the next 12 months. and that ramps up because a lot of the build-to-rent takes 24 months to deploy that money. and then even with the $1 billion that we put out, it's going to take probably two years to get that money fully deployed. so we're pretty pleased with all the elements that we have in place at the moment.
ryan tomasello -- kbw -- analyst
and then, ivan, in terms of -- or maybe for paul, rather, in terms of the residential mortgage jvs, just sifting through the puts and takes there with the volume normalization, coupled with the partial sell-down of your stake, what do you think is a meaningful baseline for our models over the next few quarters with that business? just so that we're all on the same page here in terms of the reasonableness of expectations.
paul elenio -- chief financial officer
sure. so this is the hardest thing we talk about every quarter, right, because this business has surprised us on the upside every single quarter. but yes, as i mentioned in my commentary, we did have some excess income during the quarter from the sell-down of a piece of our interest. so if you normalize that, it was probably $10 million, $11 million.
there certainly has been some margin compression and some normalization of volumes as we all expected, and we saw it in the public companies as well that you guys all follow. april was probably one of our lower points at this point. we don't have it fully closed yet, but it's coming in, obviously, pretty light. i think for me, the way i look at this, and hopefully, it will surprise us on the upside, is that they're doing anywhere from a low of $40 million to a high of $70 million a quarter in profit and our 9% represents anywhere from $4 million to $6 million of that.
that's a normalized level for us. so it's $0.02 to $0.03 a share a quarter on a normalized level. i think that probably starts in the second quarter. maybe it will be a little higher, maybe it'll be a little bit a little lower in different quarters.
but it's a good business. we like it a lot. we're obviously very big on the consumer direct and retail side of that business. we're driven by technology greatly in that business, so we can gain market share.
and i think that's a pretty conservative number for us of $4 million to $6 million a quarter for our share, and then hopefully, it grows from there.
ryan tomasello -- kbw -- analyst
and then just one last question, if i can. just to give us an update around the seven npls that were unchanged quarter over quarter. can you discuss the credit outlook there, anything noticeable that has changed over the last few quarters? and maybe just a quick reminder on the major assets that comprised that pool.
paul elenio -- chief financial officer
sure. so we haven't really seen a change at all in our credit. in fact, our credit sell very, very strong. we've seen very few cracks, both on the agency side and on the balance sheet side.
so that number is quite impressive that, that number is held in there. and a couple of the deals that we've talked about in the past that are on that npl list as we've got a couple of student housing deals that we think will work out just fine and don't need reserves for. we've got one healthcare deal. and i think what's on there is also one multifamily deal.
again, we don't have a reserve on it, but we're working through that product right now. so there's nothing really changed. it's a few assets, a couple of student housing, one multifamily, one healthcare deal. we don't have many in the way of reserves against those assets, maybe on that $60 million in net carrying, we have about $6 million of reserves.
but we haven't seen the outlook materially change on those assets, and we're confident that we're adequately reserved. we're going to work out these assets and get some of them to perform and maybe even have a recovery down the road, but that's our view.
operator
and with that, it appears there are no further questions over the line at this time. i'd like to go ahead and turn the program back over to ivan for any closing remarks.
ivan kaufman -- president and chief executive officer
well, thanks, everybody, for your participation. it's been a great first quarter. we're really optimistic about the year and what we've put together in our operating franchise and multiple income streams. look forward to the next quarter and everybody's participation.
everybody, have a great day.

good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the first-quarter 2021 arbor realty trust earnings conference call. [operator instructions] i would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, mr. paul elenio, chief financial officer. please go ahead.
paul elenio -- chief financial officer
ok. thank you, chris. and good morning everyone, and welcome to the quarterly earnings call for arbor realty trust. this morning, we will discuss the results for the quarter ended march 31, 2021.

ivan kaufman -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, paul, and thanks to everyone for joining us on today's call. we're very excited today to discuss our outstanding first-quarter results and the significant success we've had in continuing to build on the tremendous momentum we created in 2020. as we mentioned on our last call, we've been the top-performing reit in this space for almost five years in a row, and we're extremely confident that we would be able to continue that success in 2021. our exceptional first quarter results continue to demonstrate our unique ability to consistently deliver outsized returns in every market cycle through our diverse operating platform.
one of our primary goals for 2021 was to join the dividend elite club of 10 straight years of dividend growth. we are very pleased to have accomplished that goal by increasing our dividend to $0.34 a share this quarter. this is our fourth consecutive quarterly dividend increase and our 20th increase in the last 10 years, all while continuing to maintain the lowest dividend payout ratio in the industry. we built a viable operating platform, focusing on the right asset classes with very stable liability structures, an active balance sheet, gse agency business, private label program, and single-family rental platform, and many diversified income streams that generate strong earnings and dividends in every market cycle.
i can't stress enough the importance of having multiple products with diverse income streams, and that is why we believe we should consistently trade at a substantial premium to our peer group. to further highlight our incredible success, i would like to talk about the significant growth we experienced in the first quarter in all areas of our business and how well-positioned we are to continue this success going forward. as paul will discuss in more detail, our first-quarter financial results were once again very remarkable. we produced distributable earnings of $0.52 per share, which is an incredible accomplishment and well in excess of our current dividend, representing a payout ratio of just around 65%.
our ability to consistently generate exceptional results and increase our dividend is a true testament to the value of our franchise and the many diversified income streams we have created. we continue to realize significant benefits from many areas of our diverse platform, including continued growth in our gse agency platform that produces strong margins and increased servicing fees, strong contributions from our private label program, record growth, and significant benefits from the size and scale of our balance sheet business as well as superior execution in our liability structures. strong performance of our multifamily focused portfolios with very few delinquencies and extremely low forbearances and substantial income from our residential business. and these reoccurring benefits, combined with our versatile originations platform, strong pipeline, and credit quality of our portfolio puts us in a unique position to be able to continue to produce significant distributable earnings going forward as we are extremely well-positioned for future growth and success.
a little over a year ago, we made a commitment to build out a premier single-family rental platform. we believe the single-family rental space is as big as the multifamily lending market and is a phenomenal business with enormous opportunities in the bridge, permanent lending, and build-to-rent products. we made considerable progress in growing out this platform and are committed to being a leader in the space. we are very pleased with the significant growth we are seeing in our pipeline of opportunity by leveraging off of our existing originations capacity and capabilities.
in the first quarter, we closed $162 million of single-family rental product and currently have well over $1 billion of additional deals in our pipeline, making us very optimistic about the growth in this segment of our business. we also believe we are the leader in the single-family build-to-rent space, which provides us with opportunities to originate construction, bridge, and permanent loans on the same transactions. again, we are very excited about the growth in this platform and are confident this business will be a significant driver of yet another income stream, further diversifying our lending platform. we also continue to experience significant growth in our gse agency platform and are seeing increased momentum in our private label product as well.
we originated $1.25 billion in agency loans in the first quarter and $1.4 billion, including our private label business, which is up from $800 million in agency originations and $1.1 billion, including private label for the first quarter of last year. equally as important, we have a very robust pipeline, giving us confidence in our ability to produce significant agency volumes for the balance of the year. our gse agency platform continues to offer a premium value as it requires limited capital and generate significant long-dated, predictable income streams, and produces significant annual cash flow. additionally, our $25.5 billion gse agency servicing portfolio, which has grown 26% in the last year is mostly prepayment-protected and generates $117 million a year and growing in reoccurring cash flow, which is up 33% from $88 million annually last year.
this is in addition to the strong gain on sale margins, we continue to generate from our origination platform, which combined with new and increased servicing revenues, will continue to contribute greatly to our earnings and dividends. we're seeing tremendous growth in our balance sheet business as we -- as our deal flow has greatly exceeded our expectations. we have already grown our balance sheet loan book 14% in the first quarter to $6.3 billion on $1 billion in new originations, and we have a very robust pipeline, which will allow us to meaningfully grow our loan book for the balance of the year. this unprecedented growth will significantly increase our run rate of net interest income going forward.
and very importantly, these balance sheet loans also create a substantial pipeline of future gse agency origination volumes and long-dated servicing revenues, further increasing our future earnings and dividends. additionally, we are very successful in raising $150 million of common equity in the first quarter and issuing $175 million of five year, 5% unsecured debt last week, which will allow us to fund our growing pipeline of loans and investments to be extremely accretive to our future earnings and dividends. in fact, once this capital is fully deployed, we estimate it will be $0.06 to $0.08 accretive to annual earnings rate. and for every $100 million of capital we raise in the future, at these prices, we estimate we will grow our annual earnings and dividend by an additional $0.02 to $0.03 a share.
another area of emphasis and one of key business strategies is the financing of our high-quality balance sheet portfolio with the appropriate liability structures. we have consistently been the leader in the clo securitization market, and we were once again very successful in closing our 14th clo in the first quarter totaling $785 million with very favorable terms, including higher leverage, reduced pricing, enhanced flexibility, and a two and a half year replenishment feature. the continued utilization of these vehicles have contributed greatly to our success by allowing us to appropriately match fund our assets with nonrecourse, non-mark-to-market, long-term dated and generate very attractive levered returns on our capital and provide us with a rock-solid balance sheet. it is also very important to stress that over 90% of our book are senior bridge loans.
and more importantly, 83% of our portfolio is in multifamily assets, which has been the most resilient asset class in all cycles and continues to significantly outperform all other asset classes in this cycle as well. in summary, we had an exceptional quarter, and we are well-positioned to have another outstanding year in 2021. we have a versatile operating platform that is multifamily centric, with a strong pipeline, significant servicing income, sizable balance sheet portfolio, single-family rental platform, and residential mortgage business, providing us with many diverse and growing business lines that position us exceptionally well for continued future success. and as a result, we are confident that we will continue to outperform our peers and preserve our long-term history of being the best-performing company in our space.
i will now turn this call over to paul who'll take you through the financial results.
paul elenio -- chief financial officer
ok. thanks, ivan. as ivan mentioned, we had another exceptional quarter, producing distributable earnings of $75 million or $0.52 per share for the first quarter. these results once again translated into industry high roes of approximately 20% for the first quarter, which was up 50% from the first quarter last year, and have allowed us to increase our dividend run rate to $1.36 a share.
our financial results continue to benefit greatly from many aspects of our diverse business model, including significant growth in our agency and balance sheet business platforms that produce substantial gain on sales margins, long-dated servicing income and strong levered returns on our capital, the substantial income we continue to generate from our residential banking joint venture and the credit quality of our portfolio. as we mentioned earlier, we did another phenomenal quarter from our residential banking business, we recorded approximately $22 million of income from this investment in the first quarter, which contributed approximately $0.13 a share on a tax-effected basis to our distributable earnings. the income from this investment was higher than we expected in the first quarter, mainly due to entering into an agreement with one of our key principals to purchase a portion of our future ownership interest at a premium, which accounted for approximately $11 million of additional income allocated to us in the first quarter. as a result of this transaction, we will receive approximately 9% of all income from this business on a go-forward basis.
the income from this investment continues to emphasize the diversity of our income streams and acts as a natural hedge against declining interest rates, specifically earnings on our escrow balances. while this investment will continue to contribute to our distributable earnings going forward, as expected, we are seeing some normalization in volumes and margins in the business, which started in march, and we believe this trend could continue for the balance of the year. our adjusted book value at march 31 was approximately $10.86 a share, adding back roughly $62 million of noncash general cecl reserves on a tax-affected basis. this is up 5% from approximately $10.35 a share last quarter, largely due to our first quarter capital raise as well as the significant earnings we generated in the first quarter that were well in excess of our dividend.
and as a reminder, we have very little exposure to the asset classes that have been affected the most by the recession, such as retail and hospitality. our total exposure to these asset classes is approximately $200 million or 4% of our portfolio. we also believe we have adequately reserved for these assets and do not feel at this point that a material further impairment will be necessary, which gives us confidence that our adjusted book value accurately reflects the current impact of the recession. looking at the results from our gse agency business, we originated $1.25 billion in loans and recorded $1.8 billion in loan sales in the first quarter.
the margins on our gse agency loan sales was up to approximately 1.47% in the first quarter from 1.41% in the fourth quarter. in the first quarter, we recorded $37 million of mortgage servicing rights income related to $1.5 billion of committed loans, representing an average msr rate of around 2.53%, compared to 2.45% last quarter. and as ivan mentioned, we've also seen an uptick in our private label business, originating $150 million of new product in the first quarter. our servicing portfolio also grew another 3% this quarter to $25.5 billion at march 31, with a weighted average servicing fee of 46 basis points and an estimated remaining life of 9 years.
this portfolio will continue to generate a predictable annuity of income going forward of around $117 million gross annually, which is up approximately $29 million or 33% on an annual basis from the same time last year. additionally, prepayment fees related to certain loans that have yielded maintenance provisions was approximately $2.7 million for both the first quarter and fourth quarters. we also continue to see very positive trends related to our gse agency business collections, which we believe reflects the strength of our borrowers and the quality of our gse agency portfolio. we only have a handful of delinquent loans outstanding and extremely low forbearance numbers in our portfolio through march.
loans in forbearance represent less than 0.4% of our $19.1 billion fannie book and around 5.25% of our $4.8 billion freddie loan book, which is actually down slightly since january as we've had very few new requests for forbearances in the last several months. and as a result of these extremely low forbearance numbers, we also have no material unrecovered servicing advances outstanding. in our balance sheet lending operation, we had substantial growth, growing our portfolio 14% to $6.3 billion in the first quarter on over $1 billion of new originations. our $6.3 billion investment portfolio had an all-in yield of 5.64% at march 31, compared to 5.8% at december 31, mainly due to higher rates on runoff as compared to new originations during the quarter.
the average balance in our core investments was up to $5.9 billion this quarter from $5.1 billion last quarter, mainly due to the significant growth we experienced in both the fourth and first quarters. the average yield in these investments was 5.72% for the first quarter compared to 6.04% for the fourth quarter, mainly due to more acceleration of fees from early runoff in the fourth quarter and higher interest rates on runoff as compared to originations in the first quarter. total debt on our core assets was approximately $5.6 billion at march 31, with an all-in debt cost of approximately 2.9%, compared to a debt cost of around 3.03% at december 31. the average balance on our debt facilities was up to approximately $5.2 billion for the first quarter from $4.6 billion for the fourth quarter, again, mostly due to financing the growth in our portfolio.
and the average cost of funds in our debt facilities decreased to 2.99% for the first quarter from 3.05% for the fourth quarter. overall, net interest spreads in our core assets decreased to 2.73% this quarter, compared to 2.99% last quarter, again, mainly due to yield compression on new originations as compared to runoff and less acceleration of fees from early runoff this quarter. and our overall spot net interest spreads were relatively flat at 2.74% at march 31 and 2.77% at december 31. lastly, the average leverage ratio on our core lending assets, including the trust preferreds and perpetual preferred stock as equity, was down to 83% in the first quarter from 85% in the fourth quarter, and our overall debt-to-equity ratio on a spot basis was flat at 3.0:1 for both march 31 and december 31, excluding general cecl reserves.
that completes our prepared remarks for this morning. and i'll now turn it back to the operator to take any questions you may at this time. chris?

operator
[operator instructions] and we will take our first question from steve delaney with jmp securities. your line is now open.
steve delaney -- jmp securities -- analyst
thanks and good morning ivan and paul. and it's getting redundant, but i have to say, congrats on another excellent quarter. the thing that struck me this quarter, looking over the results is, not only are you doing the basic blocking and tackling, but the level of sophistication, tapping the capital markets for various transactions just continues to improve. so props on all that.
speaking of the capital markets transaction, and i think all of us have been interested in your private label program that you started last summer, or that you had your first transaction. can you comment a little bit, you mentioned better execution, but could you comment a little bit maybe specifically like where you saw aaas go out relative to swaps? and i think the thing that i'd really like to know is, how do you estimate what your pre-loss return might be on the approximate eight and a half percent b-piece that you're holding on to? thanks.
ivan kaufman -- president and chief executive officer
sure. i don't have in front of me exactly where we executed the aaas until we can furnish that to you. but we have very, very good execution. our first private label deal came out during the initial aspects of covid.
it was the first of our brand. this is our second deal. and of course, will be a serial issue based on our pipeline. and the more we issue, the better our execution.
so we're really pleased with where we're trading. and we're really pleased with the reception. and it's both our name and reputation in the multifamily market, the fact that we're a big clo issue, there's a lot of cross-over buyers, and we expect our execution to get better and better each time. and then we're even evaluating whether we want to do a public deal which even improves our execution given the flow that we have.
so we're optimistic about our market participation relative to the expected losses.
steve delaney -- jmp securities -- analyst
or -- pre the return actually, pre-loss return.
ivan kaufman -- president and chief executive officer
yes, we -- i think where we calculate holding the b piece is that anywhere between a 10% and a 12% return factor, the losses and prepayments. and as you know, our loss history on our multifamily portfolio is nominal, next to nothing. but that's all factored in. we carry it at the proper return.
and there are a lot of efficiencies by generating and holding our own b piece with the new dodd-frank rules and stuff, that gives us a competitive advantage in the market as well.
steve delaney -- jmp securities -- analyst
yes. and i guess one of the benefits here, i mean, obviously, you still do your clo business, but these are fixed rate loans with longer duration than you would see in your bridge portfolio, right? i mean, so you're putting a 10% to 12% return, but it's something i think you're probably looking at a much longer life to that investment, i assume then when you when you put a clo together?
ivan kaufman -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, it's an average life of probably nine years on a 10% to 12% coupon, which is very hard to get that kind of return for that kind of term. so we're pretty pleased with that element of it. and once again, the further long-dated income streams that we're getting not only on servicing, but on that portion of the b piece, which we own, control and created. and anything we create is what we consider to be a superior product and better risk-adjusted returns.
steve delaney -- jmp securities -- analyst
right. and it sounds like based on the july originations, i think you mentioned, or paul did $400 million. it would seem likely that you'll be doing at least one more of these before the end of 2021, i assume. what are you...
ivan kaufman -- president and chief executive officer
yes, we're optimistic. yes, we're optimistic based on pipe margin that we can protect the market. yes.
steve delaney -- jmp securities -- analyst
ok. and just one final thing. i'll leave the details to others. but obviously, a change at the top of the fha in the last month or so.
any thoughts on maybe help what policy shifts you might expect over the next year or so from sandra thompson compared to calabria, who i think we all know was a bit of a hawk with respect to gse risk taking or volumes or that type of thing. so just curious with your -- how you -- what your initial reaction was to that change? and whether how it might impact your business one way or the other?
ivan kaufman -- president and chief executive officer
yes, i think it's good for the gse business and for us. and in particular, there's going to be more and more of an effort on the affordable side and putting more money toward the affordable aspect of gse business. and we think it's going to be a more favorable environment for firms like us and i think it will be more lucrative.
steve delaney -- jmp securities -- analyst
thank you, ivan and congrats again, paul.

we will take our next question from stephen laws with raymond james. your line is now open.
stephen laws -- raymond james & associates -- analyst
thank you. good morning and to echo steve's comments, these are very repetitive calls but for good reasons. so congratulations on another continued growth and another strong quarter. and thinking about the sfr opportunities, what is the pipeline there? what's the competition like? it seems like a number of competitors continue to talk about opportunities there.
and kind of as you stand today, when you put a new dollar to work, where do you think those roes can go as you scale that business?
ivan kaufman -- president and chief executive officer
the sfr business is a very attractive business segment right now especially the build-to-rent communities. we got in early, got aggressive early and built up a nice pipeline. spreads have compressed quite a bit. but then again, our borrowing and our liability structure has gotten more competitive.
what we like about the business, specifically on the build to rent, the construction component requires more expertise, not everybody is in it. once you do the construction loan, you end up with a bridge loan on a takeout loan. we have locked up and have great relationships with a lot of the key players in the market. and i think good players in the market.
there's a lot of new entrants, you have to proceed with caution. late entrants into the market is not always the best person to do business with. so i think we're pretty pleased with the pipeline we have and we're pleased with the opportunities that we have and the spreads we have. there will be some compression because it is more competitive and we'll just be selective.
we're just thrilled that we were early in. we're able to develop these great relationships and create some borrower loyalty on our side of the coin.
stephen laws -- raymond james & associates -- analyst
thanks, ivan. paul, to touch on prepayment, i think there's some -- i noted in the q, there is some prepay income, but i think it was a historical comparison. so the portfolio growth, i'm not surprised that's up. but can you talk about the expected repayments and maybe early income from any early repayments as we think about the portfolio maturing in the next six to 12 months?
paul elenio -- chief financial officer
sure. so steve, you're right. prepayments on the servicing side or runoff on the servicing side was almost double what it was last quarter. as you remember from last quarter, i thought last quarter was surprisingly light at around $400 million, came in around $800 million this quarter.
and what was interesting, a little interesting phenomenon occurred, we did, as you mentioned, get a little bit more prepayment fees than i expected, that we modeled and that we were getting over the last few quarters. and when i went and looked at certain of those transactions, it wasn't that people were refiling away from us. again, we're really focus, laser-focused on retaining the business. so if someone's going to refi, we want to make sure we get that opportunity.
but we saw a little bit in the second quarter and i don't know if it's a trend that will continue. it's hard to predict. it's there was a lot more sale volume at really appreciated values and people were fine writing those yield maintenance checks when they were getting significant increases in the value of their properties. so that was a little phenomenon we saw.
like ivan's view on whether we think that continues, it's hard to predict but that's kind of what we saw in the second quarter.
stephen laws -- raymond james & associates -- analyst
great. thanks for your time ivan and paul. appreciate it.
ivan kaufman -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, steve.

and we will take our next question from rick shane with j.p. morgan. your line is now open.
rick shane -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
hey, guys. thanks for taking my question this morning. actually, just one quick detail. you guys have gone through everything thoroughly.
when we look at the capitalization rate on the msr for the quarter, it was down a little bit sequentially. just curious, looking at the fees and duration of the servicing rights, i don't see any change there. so i'm just curious what's driving that? is it a more conservative assumption or are we missing something?
paul elenio -- chief financial officer
hey, rick. it's paul. thanks for the question. good to hear from you again.
no, as i mentioned in my commentary, it was just mix. in the quarter, we had more committed loans because that's how we do our msr capitalization is on committed loans. we had more committed loans on the private label side and on the fha side of the business. so they drove higher margins, but they also drove lower msr rates only because the fha deals and the private label deals have like a 20 basis point servicing fee and fannie is up in the 50s.
so it's just a matter of mix. if that mix changes and it likely will over time, it will be more normalized. it just happened to be a specific quarter where we had more mix in the lower servicing fee earning assets.
rick shane -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
got it. and when we think about the private label, there's nothing from a duration perspective that's materially different than the rest of the portfolio. i know there's a lot of protection on the agency business. i want to make sure i understand the private label business as well in terms of pre-payment protections.
ivan kaufman -- president and chief executive officer
it's the same, if not greater, pre-payment protection. so you have some options on some of the agency business to pay off less penalty toward the end of the term. this is a little bit longer in duration. i would say it's probably 10% to 15% longer in duration.
rick shane -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
terrific. hey, guys. thank you so much for the question. appreciate the time this morning.
ivan kaufman -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, rick.
operator
and we will take our final question from jade rahmani with kbw. your line is now open.
ryan tomasello -- kbw -- analyst
hi, everyone. this is ryan tomasello on for jade. ivan, i was wondering if you can just discuss your general outlook for gses, the gses in the second half of the year in terms of volumes and overall performance?
ivan kaufman -- president and chief executive officer
i think the gse business is going to be stronger in the second half than it was in the first half. out of the gate, specifically in the second quarter, the gses widened their margins. and i also think that we're dealing with some residual collaborator issues. it's my feeling based on lower interest rates and then wanting to meet their volume targets that there will be a little bit more gse originations in the first half, particularly everybody is loading up right now, building up their pipeline.
i think you'll see a little bit more activity. and i think some of the barriers that calabria was bringing to the table, i think, are being stripped away at this point and you have kind of the existing regime, which has been in place under sandra thompson, probably will go back to a little bit of the historical way of operating. so i'm very optimistic that the gse business for the balance of the year will be as strong, if not stronger than it was in the first half of the year.
ryan tomasello -- kbw -- analyst
and can you talk about some of the technology initiatives that you have been investing behind, specifically in the small balance lending space? and i guess just overall, how you're thinking about technology investments generally across the arbor platform going forward?
ivan kaufman -- president and chief executive officer
i think the way we're approaching technology is we have a goal of where we want to be in two or three years in terms of eliminating certain redundancy functions as well as personnel functions. and that's piece by piece. we think there's going to be a lot of advancement on the servicing side, on the origination side and the way we use data. we have a three year plan, and we're doing it piece by piece by piece, making continual improvements.
as technology improves, it facilitates our ability to implement the different processes and smooth out our workflow processes. but i believe we can continue to grow our business and maintain a very small and incremental build to our personnel taking advantage of those different technologies across the spectrum. but it's not an overnight thing. it's progress made in each segment of the business and then running them all in tandem and having that benefit the whole process.
ryan tomasello -- kbw -- analyst
great. and then final one for me regarding the private label business. i was wondering if you see an opportunity, ivan to partner with other nonbank lenders on private label cmbs issuance to scale volumes for that platform?
ivan kaufman -- president and chief executive officer
i think that's something that we will look to do in the future. what we wanted to do is get our brand going, use our own originations. we do work with a lot of brokers who can turn it up. we're always cautious on having too big of a pipeline and being able to execute the market very effectively.
i think once we do our third one and if we end up looking and doing public deals, then maybe we'll consider co-originating with a few others. at the end of the day, we will own and hold our own b pieces. so we're very particular who we partner with, who underwrites the loans and who originates them. so we'll proceed with caution as we build that process and our brand up.
ryan tomasello -- kbw -- analyst
great. thanks for taking the questions.
ivan kaufman -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, ryan.
operator
and i would now like to turn the program over to ivan kaufman for any additional or closing remarks.
ivan kaufman -- president and chief executive officer
yes. well, thanks again for everybody participating and investing with us and following us. and i guess the reoccurring theme from everybody in what we've been able to do is have consistent dividend increases, which is really a unique thing in our space. we're the only company, as i mentioned in my prepared statements that does not only have a stable dividend and why we think we should be trading at a premium.
but more importantly, we have exhibited unprecedented growth on a consistent basis. and thanks again for your confidence and look forward to our next earnings call. thank you very much. have a great day.

operator
good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the second-quarter 2021 arbor realty trust earnings conference call. [operator instructions] i'll now turn the call over to your speaker today, paul elenio, chief financial officer. please begin, sir.
paul elenio -- chief financial officer
ok. thank you, britney, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to the quarterly earnings call for arbor realty trust. this morning, we'll discuss the results for the quarter ended june 30, 2021. with me on the call today is ivan kaufman, our president and chief executive officer.
before we begin, i need to inform you that statements made in this earnings call may be deemed forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties, including information about possible or assumed future results of our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations, plans and objectives. these statements are based on our beliefs, assumptions and expectations of our future performance, taking into account the information currently available to us. factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from arbor's expectations in these forward-looking statements are detailed in our sec reports. listeners are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of today.
arbor undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise these forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after today or the occurrences of unanticipated events. i'll now turn the call over to arbor's president and ceo, ivan kaufman. 
ivan kaufman -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, paul, and thanks to everyone for joining us on today's call. as you can see from this morning's press release, we had another outstanding quarter with many significant accomplishments, including exceptional operating results, which continues to demonstrate our unique ability to consistently generate high quarterly earnings and deliver outsized returns in every market cycle. i can't stress enough the importance of having multiple products with diverse income streams, which allows us to consistently grow our earnings and dividends, while others in our space have experienced little or no growth at all. we have a much higher quality of earnings with consistent dividend growth and a very low dividend payout ratio, which is why we strongly believe we should consistently trade at a substantial premium and much lower dividend yield than our peer group.
we also remain extremely well positioned for continued success, giving us great confidence that we will produce outstanding results for the balance of 2021. our tremendous operating results combined with our strong outlook has allowed us to once again increase our dividend to $0.35 per share. this is our fifth consecutive quarterly dividend increase and our ninth increase in the last 12 quarters, all while continuing to maintain the lowest dividend payout ratio in the industry. we built a premium operating platform, focusing on the right asset classes with very stable liability structures and active balance sheet, gse agency business, private label program and single-family rental platform producing a long track record of exceptional performance with consistent earnings and dividend growth.
as a result, we have been the top-performing reit in our space for each and every one of the last five years. before we dive into the details of our quarterly results and the significant growth we continue to experience in all areas of our business, i want to highlight some of our more notable second-quarter accomplishments. we had a very active and successful quarter in many areas of our business. we produced tremendous transaction volumes originating in excess of $3 billion in new loans and investments this quarter, including over $1.8 billion in balance sheet loan originations, which is a new record.
and just as importantly, our pipeline is currently at all-time highs. as a result, we were very active in the capital markets, successfully raising approximately $400 million of accretive capital in the second quarter to fund this growth. we issued $140 million of common equity, $175 million of five year, 5% unsecured debt and $230 million of new 6.375% perpetual preferred equity, which will allow us to fund our growing pipeline of loans and investments and be extremely accretive to our future earnings and dividends. in fact, this capital was $0.08 to $0.10 accretive in our annual earnings run rate, allowing us to increase our dividend again this quarter.
every time we raise capital is to fund our growing balance sheet loan business, which is not only high accretive to our current earnings and dividends, but also allows us to build a pipeline for two to three years of new gse agency loans, showing the long-term growth of our platform and creating higher quality earnings and dividends in the future. we were also very successful in continuing to access the clo securitization market in the second quarter, closing our 15th largest clo to date, totaling $815 million with very favorable terms and pricing. we have consistently been a leader in the clo securitization market as financing a high-quality balance sheet portfolio with the appropriate liability structures continues to be one of our key business strategies. the utilization of these vehicles has contributed greatly to our success by allowing us to appropriately match-fund our assets with nonrecourse, non-mark-to-market long-term debt and generate very attractive levered returns on our capital and provide us with a rock-solid balance sheet.
and in the second quarter, we are very pleased to have closed our second private label securitization totaling $450 million with very effective execution, which contributed greatly to our second-quarter earnings and continues to demonstrate the strength and diversity of our versatile lending platform. turning now to our second-quarter performance, as paul will discuss in more detail, our quarterly financial results were once again truly remarkable. we produced distributable earnings of $0.45 per share, which is incredible accomplishment and well in excess of our current dividend, representing a payout ratio of around 78%. our ability to consistently generate exceptional results and increase our dividend is a true testament to the value of our franchise and the many diverse income streams we have created.
we continue to realize significant benefits from many areas of our diverse operating platform, continued growth in our gse agency platform which produces strong margins and increased servicing fees, significant contributions from our private label program, record growth and significant benefits from the size and scale of our balance sheet business as well as superior execution on our liability structures, strong performance of our multifamily focused portfolio with very few delinquencies and substantial income from our residential businesses. and these reoccurring benefits, combined with our versatile originations platform, strong pipeline and credit quality of our portfolio puts us in a unique position to be able to continue to produce significant distributable earnings going forward as we're extremely well positioned for future growth and success. and our balance sheet business, we're seeing tremendous growth as deal flows continues to really exceed our expectations. we grew our balance sheet loan book another 18% in the second quarter on record quarterly volume of $1.8 billion and have grown at 35% already this year to $7.4 billion in june -- as of june 30.
our pipeline is also at an all-time high, which will allow us to meaningfully grow our loan book for the balance of the year. this unprecedented growth has significantly increased our run rate of net interest income going forward. and again, very importantly, these balance sheet loans also create substantial pipeline of future gse agency loan origination volumes and long-dated servicing revenues, further increasing our future earnings and dividends. it is also very important to stress that over 90% of our book are senior bridge loans, and more importantly, 87% of our portfolio is in multifamily assets, which has been the most resilient asset class in all cycles and continues to significantly outperform all of asset classes in this cycle as well.
additionally, as we have mentioned in the past, we have very little exposure to the asset classes that have been affected the most by the recession, such as retail and hospitality. and we also have adequate reserves against our positions. during the height of pandemic, we recorded a $7.5 million specific reserve on one of our hotel assets and subsequently used our own capital purchased remaining note at a discount. we worked very hard on the transaction, and i'm extremely pleased to report the successful sale of our position in the second quarter, allowing us to reverse the full $7.5 million reserve, collect approximately $3.5 million of unpaid interest and free up approximately $60 million of our invested capital that we'll redeploy into our balance sheet lending business and generate strong levered returns on this capital.
we have always provided ourselves on investing heavily in our asset management function, and this incredibly successful workout further demonstrates the value of our unique franchise. we continue to experience growth in our gse agency platform, and we are seeing significant increased momentum in our private label program as well. we originated approximately $925 million in agency loans in the second quarter and $1.3 billion, including our private label business. we are also off to a very good start in the third quarter, and we are expecting to close approximately $300 million of agency loans and $400 million of private label business in july.
equally as important, we have a robust pipeline, giving us confidence in our ability to produce significant agency and private label volumes for this balance of the year. our gse agency platform continues to offer a premium value as it requires limited capital and generates significant long-dated, predictable income streams and produces significant annual cash flow. additionally, our $26 billion gse agency servicing portfolio, which has grown 20% in the last year is mostly prepayment-protected and generates approximately $120 million a year and growing reoccurring cash flow, which is up 25% from $95 million annually last year. this is in addition to the strong gain-on-sale margins we continue to generate from our origination platform, which combined with new and increased servicing revenues will continue to contribute greatly to our earnings and dividends.
we're also very pleased with the significant growth we are seeing in our single-family rental platform. in the second quarter, we closed another $110 million of single-family rental product and currently have well over $1 billion of additional deals in our pipeline, making us very optimistic about the growth in this segment of our business. we also believe we are the leader in the single-family build-to-rent space, which provides us with the opportunity to originate construction, bridge and permanent loans on the same transaction. again, we are very excited about the growth in this platform, and are confident this business will be a significant driver of yet another source of income, further diversifying our lending platform.
in summary, we had an exceptional quarter and are well positioned to have another outstanding second quarter -- second half of the year. we have a very versatile operating platform that is multifamily centric with a strong pipeline, significant servicing income, sizable balance sheet portfolio, single-family rental platform and residential mortgage business, providing us many diverse and growing business lines that position us exceptionally well for continued future success. and we are confident that a superior multi-tiered operating platform will allow us to continue to generate high-quality earnings and dividends and preserve our long-term standing as the best-performing company in our space. i will now turn the call over to paul to take you through our financial results.
paul elenio -- chief financial officer
ok. thank you, ivan. as ivan mentioned, we had another exceptional quarter, producing distributable earnings of $69 million or $0.45 per share. these results once again translated into industry high roes of approximately 17% for the quarter and allowed us to increase our dividend to an annual run rate of $1.40 a share.
and this quarterly dividend increase reflects our fifth consecutive quarterly increase and our 21st increase in the last 10 years. our financial results continue to benefit greatly from many aspects of our diverse business model, including significant growth in our agency, private label and balance sheet business platforms that produce substantial gain on sales margins, long-dated servicing income and strong levered returns on our capital, the income we continue to generate from our residential banking joint venture and the credit quality of our portfolio. as we guided to on our last call, we did see some more normalized results from our residential banking business joint venture as volumes and margins return to more normalized levels. we recorded approximately $5 million of income from this investment in the second quarter, which contributed approximately $0.03 a share on a tax-effected basis to our distributable earnings.
and based on the current market conditions, we expect this trend to continue for the balance of the year, resulted in estimated income from this investment of between $4 million to $5 million a quarter going forward. our adjusted book value at june 30 was approximately $11.35, adding back roughly $61 million of noncash general cecl reserves on a tax-effected basis. this is up approximately 5% from $10.86 last quarter, largely due to our second-quarter capital raises, the significant earnings we generated in the second quarter in excess of our dividend, as well as from the successful recovery of a $7.5 million reserve on a hotel asset during the quarter. and as a reminder, we have very little remaining exposure to the asset classes that have been affected the most by the recession, such as retail and hospitality.
our total exposure to these asset classes is approximately $100 million or about 1% of our portfolio, which we believe we have adequately reserved for giving us great confidence that our adjusted book value accurately reflects the impact of the recession. looking at the results from our gse agency business. we originated $925 million of loans and recorded $1 billion of loan sales in the second quarter. the margin on our gse agency loan sales was up significantly to approximately 1.83% in the second quarter from 1.47% in the first quarter, mainly due to a higher percentage of fha loan sales in the second quarter, which carry a much higher profit margin.
additionally, as ivan mentioned, we were very active in our private label program, originating $377 million of new loans in the second quarter as well as completing our second private label securitization totaled $450 million with very effective execution, resulting in an all-in margin for the second quarter of 2.37% on our total loan sales. and in the second quarter, we also recorded $26 million of mortgage servicing rights income related to $1.2 billion of committed loans, representing an average msr rate of around 2.20% compared to 2.53% last quarter, mainly due to a higher mix of fha and private label loans in the second quarter that contain a lower servicing fee. our servicing portfolio did grow another 2% this quarter to $26 billion at june 30, with a weighted average servicing fee of around 46 basis points and an estimated remaining life of nine years. this portfolio will continue to generate a predictable annuity of income going forward around $120 million gross annually, which is up approximately $25 million or 25% on an annual basis from the same time last year.
additionally, prepayment fees related to certain loans that have yield maintenance provisions did increase this quarter to $4.2 million compared to $2.7 million from last quarter. we also continue to see very positive trends related to our gse agency business collections, which we believe reflects the strength of our borrowers and the quality of our portfolio. we only have a handful of delinquent loans outstanding and extremely low forbearance numbers in our portfolio through june 30. loans in forbearance represent less than 0.3% of our $19.2 billion fannie loan book and around 2.5% of our $4.7 billion freddie mac loan book, which is down substantially from march as we have had no new request for forbearances in the last several months, and a significant amount of our loans have completed the program and are now current.
in our balance sheet lending operation, we grew our portfolio 18% to $7.4 billion in the second quarter on record quarterly volume of $1.8 billion. our $7.4 billion investment portfolio had an all-in yield of 5.33% at june 30 compared to 5.65% at march 31, mainly due to higher rates on runoff as compared to new originations during the quarter. the average balance in our core investments was up to $6.6 billion this quarter, from $5.9 billion last quarter, mainly due to a significant growth we experienced in both the first and second quarters. the average yield on these investments was up to 5.85% for the second quarter compared to 5.72% for the first quarter mainly due to receiving $3.5 million in back interest from the successful workout of a hotel asset and for more acceleration of fees from early runoff in the second quarter, which was partially offset by higher interest rates on runoff as compared to originations in the second quarter.
total debt on our core assets was approximately $6.4 billion at june 30, with an all-in debt cost of approximately 2.79%, which was down from a debt cost of around 2.9% at march 31, mainly due to a reduction in cost of funds from our new clo vehicle and reduced rates in our warehouse and repurchase agreements during the second quarter. the average balance on our debt facilities was up to approximately $5.9 billion for the second quarter from $5.2 billion for the first quarter, mostly due to financing the growth in our portfolio and issuing $175 million of new unsecured notes during the second quarter. and the average cost of funds in our debt facilities decreased to 2.89% for the second quarter from 2.99% for the first quarter. overall, net interest spreads in our core assets increased to 2.96% this quarter compared to 2.73% last quarter, again mainly due to interest collected on the sale of our position in a hotel asset and more acceleration of fees from early runoff in the second quarter.
and our overall spot net interest spreads were down to 2.54% at june 30 from 2.75% at march 31 due to yield compression on new originations as compared to runoff. lastly, the average leverage ratio on our core lending assets, including the trust preferred and perpetual preferred stock as equity was up slightly to 84% in the second quarter from 83% in the first quarter. and our overall debt-to-equity ratio on a spot basis was flat at 2.9:1 at both june 30 and march 31, excluding general cecl reserves. that completes our prepared remarks for this morning.
i'll now turn it back to the operator to take any questions you may have at this time. britney?
",2021-Q2,ABR

operator
thank you. [operator instructions] we'll take our first question from steve delaney of jmp securities. 
steve delaney -- jmp securities -- analyst
thanks. good morning, ivan and paul. look, congrats, not just on these results, which you keep putting up every quarter, but finally, for the performance of abr stock this year with a 41% gain. that has really benefited our clients.
we appreciate that. not -- and i did hear your comments, ivan, that you certainly didn't need to go on that, but it is a nice accomplishment this year. want to recognize that. 
ivan kaufman -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, steve. 
steve delaney -- jmp securities -- analyst
sure. when you started the private-label business, we saw it as kind of a more defensive thing post-covid which -- where freddie and fannie going to be, and it obviously has become more than that. and i'm curious, just from the borrower's perspective, what the benefits are. you're obviously able to fund new loans from borrowers who would like a private execution rather than freddie and fannie.
so just sort of help us understand the dynamics there and why they select your -- take your private execution versus agency. thanks. 
ivan kaufman -- president and chief executive officer
that's a great question, and let me give you a little perspective. it's all about the math, right? so right now, you have the two agencies that are going to do about $160 billion between the two with their caps. it's what they did last year. 50% of that is going to be for mission-driven business.
so that's -- only $80 billion that's now available for non-mission business. keep in mind, multifamily values are up around 30% over the last 15 to 18 months, so that $30 billion is only like $50 billion, right, of agency product available. the market is about a $400 billion market. so the private label, while it was a necessary product because the footprint of the agencies might have gotten cut back on the calabria, the math i just laid out to you shows you that they are cut back relative to the size and growth of the market.
so that void has to be filled. and when the agencies get filled, the pricing backs up. and then the private label actually becomes a better execution on a pricing basis for non-mission business. so for me, it's just math.
so it's not as though the agencies are unlimited. they are limited and very limited in context to the size of the market and the growth of the market. so we believe that that will continue to be an outstanding product. we're very unique in the sense that we are one of the few who have the capital base to hold the product.
while it's in form for securitization, securitize it, retain the b-pieces as attractive yields and really manage that part of the market. we are a lender. when it comes to products, we're not a broker. and i think clients will really respect the fact that we are the lender.
we close our own product, and we buy our own pieces, and we service that product. so i believe this is going to be an extremely competitive aspect in the market for us as we go forward. 
steve delaney -- jmp securities -- analyst
that's really helpful. i have to tell you, i've been watching the monthly volumes for freddie and fannie this year, and they're kind of puny. and you see $4 billion -- $3 billion, $4 billion, and you're thinking, ""why -- you've got room. why aren't you lending more?"" but you just told me something i hadn't focused on, and that is they don't have an unlimited amount of normal higher-income-type property they can do because they have to first hit their 50% mission-driven mandate.
and that really does help put it in context going forward. so that's very helpful. so it sounds like it's a business opportunity that should have legs going forward, certainly as long as these caps have that component. and i can't imagine the affordable being reduced anytime soon.
so thank you.
ivan kaufman -- president and chief executive officer
and it will become more dominant. and i think because of the way we're structured, the way we do our business, it gives us a unique competitive advantage, and we're going to really work on that as well. 
steve delaney -- jmp securities -- analyst
and you mentioned you're not a broker, but you're a lender. i think -- i mean i've kind of lost having a handle on how large your production platform has become. just curious if you can share with us how many producers -- as a percentage of your overall headcount, how many producers do you have? and have you found the opportunity or the need to open any regional offices around the country beyond your new york headquarters? 
ivan kaufman -- president and chief executive officer
so we have, i believe, approximately 25 originators. all the staff primarily have been homegrown. we really don't hire outside. and we really can't add anybody right now.
we're at full capacity in terms of production and capability. our biggest restraint right now is people. we have turned away business in our fourth quarter, significant. we're at our peak. we can't produce anymore, and it's just the way it is in the market.
everybody is extraordinarily busy. we're probably busy than most. our balance sheet has been outperforming even our own expectations. but underwriters, analysts, they're in short form.
we've been able to retain a majority of our people, add in a little bit, use some third parties out there, but we're full. so right now, we just want to handle what our originators are bringing in. and i think, hopefully, in the first quarter, we can add to the staff a little bit and manage the demand we have. 
steve delaney -- jmp securities -- analyst
thanks for the comments.
operator
we'll take our next question from rick shane of j.p. morgan. 
rick shane -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
thanks, guys, for taking my questions this morning. look, i'd like to talk a little bit about the agency business and how we should think about the difference between the pipeline on the fannie, freddie paper and the private label. i'm curious if there are differences in terms of accumulation periods for each, what the hold times look like, and more importantly, how we should think about hedging and revenue recognition. is there anything in terms of pipeline hedging with rates moving around we should be aware of? 
ivan kaufman -- president and chief executive officer
so in terms of our pipeline, paul can get more granular than i can. he has all the numbers. but our pipeline is at, i think, all-time highs on all product types. clearly, the fha pipeline, a period of time to close those loans, probably is averaging nine months right now, six to nine months.
they're extremely backed up. the gestation period to go through the system is long. typically, fannie and freddie loans are anywhere between 45 to 90 days from time of application to time of close. things are a little backed up right now with third parties and turnaround times, both at the agencies and here, so those are taking a little bit longer.
our bridge pipeline is as strong as ever, and we're actually quoting right now to close bridge loans, which used to be done within 45 days, we'll call it, in 75 to 90, just the backup in the industry on third parties and our own processing systems. the demand for bridge product is extremely strong. i think what we're seeing in the market are people are buying a lot of product today, and they're seeing that new rents are 5% to 10% above old rents, so they want to bridge the product for 12 months, get full unit terms and then do a permanent takeout. so that philosophy fits in very well with our business model.
this will do the bridge loan, get great risk adjustment returns and then turn it into an agency loan and then once again get additional gain on sale and get long-term bridge loans and have proprietary deal flow. so that has worked extremely well for our business model, and we see that to be very, very strong all the way through the end of the year. and we've already booked -- booking most of our closings for january and february, believe it or not. so that's our overall outlook.
in terms of our floating rate book, we, in the past six to nine months, have been very liberal in terms of people buying caps. as of last week, we've made it mandatory for people to buy caps. i have a little concern that rates may rise. and in fact, we have the rights under our documents to require people to buy caps.
for loans in our portfolio, where i'll go through our portfolio now and having people buy rate caps, i have a little bit of concern that there'll be a little bit of a rise in rates, and we want to protect ourselves against that. so that's our overall philosophy. paul, do you want to add anything to that? 
paul elenio -- chief financial officer
sure. so rick, to some of your other questions, the way we look at the agency business or the gse agency business, and the apl business from an execution perspective is, as you know, the gse agency business, when we rate lock a loan, we're immediately selling it forward in a forward commitment. so that's how we hedge our interest rate risk. we really have no interest rate risk because at the time we rate lock the loan, we're immediately selling it forward with a commitment.
so that's our hedge. and that usually gets taken out within 30 to 60 days, on average 45 days, from the day of closing to the day of sale to the agency. so that's how we handle that execution. as far as the pipeline, we did about $1 billion, $1.1 billion of straight gse agency business in the third quarter.
we've already done in october $450 million, so we're off to a good start. i would say the fourth quarter is probably going to be a little -- hopefully a little elevated from the third, but that's what we're expecting. on the apl business, as you may have seen in the balance sheet, we had about $780 million of apl on our balance sheet at the end of september. we accumulate that product.
it's a little bit of a longer run anywhere from, let's say, three to six months, more closer to three months, probably somewhere 90 to 180 days as we accumulate it. and that $780 million that we had on our balance sheet, we did execute, as we mentioned in our prepared remarks, a $535 million third securitization in october. so we're left with $225 million of that product on our balance sheet after that trade. and as we originate in the fourth quarter, we'll hopefully get enough product and demand to pull for another execution at some point.
as far as the hedging goes and the revenue recognition, it's really quite simple. so on the agency side, we don't have a hedge because, as i mentioned, we have a forward commitment. and on the apl side, because those are fixed-rate loans without a forward commitment as we accumulate them on our balance sheet, we do enter into interest rate swaps. and we enter in those to protect ourselves from the movements, up or down, in interest rates.
what we do for accounting is because they're not effective swaps for accounting, they have to be brought through the p&l as a hit or income, depending if those swaps are in the money or out of the money for accounting for gaap. but we defer those gains or losses for our distributable earnings, and we bring them in when the securitization is complete, really to match it up with the revenue we've created from the securitization. hopefully, that answered your question. i think that's where you were going.

we'll take our next question from stephen laws of raymond james. 
stephen laws -- raymond james -- analyst
hi. good morning. ivan and paul, congratulations, continued fantastic execution on the business. you covered a couple of the segments already.
maybe wanted to touch on the prepayment fees you mentioned were up sequentially. i know your investments are prepayment-protected. paul, can you maybe talk a little bit about how you expect those fees to trend? what -- are you continuing to see elevated prepayments through october? how should we think about that as far as our models here in the coming quarters?
paul elenio -- chief financial officer
sure. steve, it's a great question, and you and i had this conversation, i think, last quarter as well. a little surprising this quarter that i continue to see elevated runoffs and elevated yield maintenance provisions being paid. just to put it in some context, back in the first quarter, we had roughly $400 million of runoff with, i think, $2.5 million of prepayment penalties.
in the second quarter, it jumped to $800 million of runoff with $4.2 million of prepayment protections. and then this quarter, we saw $1 billion of runoff with $11.2 million of prepayment penalties. so what we're seeing -- and it's an interesting trend, and i don't know if it continues, i think it does, but it's hard to tell. i haven't seen the october numbers yet.
we'll get them in the next couple of days. so as ivan mentioned, with the values of real estate climbing pretty much 30% over the last 15 to 18 months, what we're seeing is people writing those yield maintenance checks and paying off loans very early in their life because they're either selling them in the market or refinancing them in the market. obviously, we are laser-focused on making sure we're getting any refinance opportunities. and they're writing those checks because they're getting appreciated value.
so does that trend continue? ivan can probably give you a view. it probably does for a little bit, it's just hard to quantify where this is going to go over the next couple of quarters.
ivan kaufman -- president and chief executive officer
i think that values are up considerably. you have a combination of cap rate compression and growth in rents a little more than people expected. and there are a lot of people taking gains on their assets, so they're selling them, paying yield maintenance, which we get the benefit of. but sales activity is up.
but that also spills into another area. it also spills into an area of higher credit quality, right? so if our values are up and rents are up, that means our existing portfolios are going to do better. and that's one of the reasons why our bridge product is so important, because on the bridge side we have a huge portfolio. and with values up and income streams up, as these rents turn and the values come in, we're going to have a huge stream of bridge loans turning into agency and private-label loans.
and that's our business platform. but i do expect the fourth quarter -- and paul and i have a difference of opinion. paul is more conservative, i'm seeing a lot of sales activity. so i think the prepayment should be pretty -- prepayment fee should be pretty strong for the fourth quarter. 
stephen laws -- raymond james -- analyst
appreciate the color. it's nice having the wind at your back there on the fees. i know steve touched on the private-label and rick at the agency. can you talk maybe about the opportunity in sfr? i know it's a little smaller but continue to drive some increases there.
can you talk about the opportunity at sfr, as well as kind of the competitive landscape there? 
ivan kaufman -- president and chief executive officer
sure. the sfr business and a single-family, build-to-rent business, is a business we like the most. so we're pretty dominant in that space. we do a construction loan, which turns into a bridge loan, which eventually turns into a takeout loan if they don't sell a property.
when you do a construction loan, which we have a significant number of commitments, the funding occurs over a period of 24 months. so the initial commitment is very small, but it builds up over time. that's a big pipeline. we love the business.
we like the risk profile. we got into it early. cap rates have compressed. values are up huge, and we've really made our mark very well.
in terms of providing financing for scattered sites, we're doing a significant amount of that. that business is growing. we like that as well. once again, there's a lot of liquidity.
there's a lot of competition in that market, but we're growing it slowly. paul, do you have some numbers that you can lay out? 
paul elenio -- chief financial officer
yes. do you want -- on the build-to-rent side? 
ivan kaufman -- president and chief executive officer
yes, both. 
paul elenio -- chief financial officer
so yes, so the numbers we laid out is on the build-to-rent side, we've committed to fund on build-to-rent deals, life to date, about $500 million. we have a significant amount more in our pipeline. and during the quarter, we did another -- i think it was another -- between what we funded and what we committed to, another $100 million. so that's a product that's really starting to build momentum.
and as we talked about in our commentary, it also feeds down the road our agency and apl business, which is all part of our annuity-based model. but yes, we've laid out the numbers. we've done about $150 million of total product in the third quarter. through the year to date, we've done about $500 million.
life to date, since the business has begun, we've done about $1 billion with about $500 million of that being build-to-rent. so -- and we've got a pretty big pipeline. 
stephen laws -- raymond james -- analyst
great. appreciate the details there, and thanks for your time this morning. 
paul elenio -- chief financial officer
thanks, steve.
operator
we'll take our next question from jade rahmani of kbw. 
jade rahmani -- kbw -- analyst
thank you very much. i was wondering, ivan, if you could share your view on the competitive spending markets right now. debt funds and mortgage reits clearly have seen a surge in their originations. do you have any concerns about underwriting standards and competitive pressures in the market? 
ivan kaufman -- president and chief executive officer
we've definitely a lot of competitors, and there's a lot of business out there. i do always have concerns when there's a lot of competition. we have a great reputation in the market. we pick our spots.
we know where to put our dollars. we believe that in all competitive markets, there are a lot of mistakes that are always going to be made. and we just have to proceed very prudently. we've put a huge focus on lending on cash flow deals, deals that have positive coverage that need very little heavy lift.
that's very different than what happened four or five years ago when there were a lot of b and c assets being bought with tremendous amount of lift. the lift is very small. it's basically unit terms. our biggest concern right now is the market turned into a syndicator market, where you have a lot of syndicators coming in with very little net worth and liquidity raising money and don't have the liquidity to withstand a -- withstand any bumps in the road.
so we're very careful of who we're dealing with. usually where speed bumps is with multiple assets. and we want to make sure the structure between the gp and the lps are good. i think that's where a lot of mistakes are being made right now.
they're working with thinly capitalized sponsors. they're working with people who they're trying to win a deal for 5 basis points with no structure. we're maintaining our structure on our deals. other people are not.
so i think we have a lot of experience in the way we run our business, and we're able to be a little more selective than most. 
jade rahmani -- kbw -- analyst
thanks. and historically, what percentage of the business is in the affordable housing space? 
ivan kaufman -- president and chief executive officer
i think we're one of the higher mission-driven business people, and a lot of it had to do with our small balance lending in our workforce housing. i think we're one of the top five fannie mae mission-driven business lenders. that's pretty consistent with what we've done. i'd have to check the numbers to see if it's migrated at all, but we've usually been a top deliverer to fannie and freddie on the mission-driven business. 
paul elenio -- chief financial officer
yes. that's right, ivan. i don't have the numbers here either. we'll get them to you, guys, but that's -- i don't think it's changed dramatically. 
jade rahmani -- kbw -- analyst
ok. and do you also know the conversion rate historically of the multifamily bridge loans into the agency product? 
ivan kaufman -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, paul has that.
paul elenio -- chief financial officer
sure. so i think you got to look at it a couple of ways, right? so we've historically targeted anywhere to 40% to 60%, sometimes higher, of recapture rate on our bridge loans. certainly, when there's sales involved, which there have been some lately, you don't always recapture that business because you don't always have that ability. but anything that's not sold that comes up for refinance or takeout, our recapture rate is very, very high, probably in the 70% to 80% range on anything that's not sold.
with stuff being sold, it's probably in the 40% to 50% range overall. but that's our target. and as ivan mentioned, we're putting a lot of bridge loans right now. and with the increase in values and when rents roll, we're really sizing up a lot of these deals to come to agency.
that's our model. so we think that recapture rate will be very high on the business we've been putting on. ivan, would you agree with that? 
ivan kaufman -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. i think you have to look at the product we're putting on. most of the products we're putting on is requiring a turn of rents, very little capex. and the business model for the person buying it is to put on a bridge loan, make those terms and then turn it to an agency.
historically, most of the loans were heavy-lift loans, 20%, 30%, 40% capex, huge repositioning, and usually a two-, three-year gestation period. and what happened with a lot of those loans, the gains were so huge with the market changes that a lot of people chose to sell those assets. so we think the recapture rate is going to be higher because the intended business purpose was specifically for a shorter-term bridge loan with a quick turn into agency or fha. and we do think our fha platform is going to be a huge beneficiary of our bridge loans.
because as they're doing it, they'll file with the fha, which takes nine months to a year, and they'll run that process simultaneously. so we're pretty optimistic and hopeful that that will really feed into our platform. 
jade rahmani -- kbw -- analyst
and lastly, in terms of fannie and freddie and how they're doing right now, it seems like their most recent monthly numbers showed a pretty decent sequential uptick. are you seeing them become a lot more active? or would you say it's kind of a steady-state positioning? 
ivan kaufman -- president and chief executive officer
well, they come and go. i think when they didn't know what their allocation is, they backed off. they were pretty full for the year. i think they'll be pretty active in the first quarter.
they've lowered their pricing, and we think we'll have a good fourth quarter. and then they'll want to gear up in the first quarter, and we'll see what the flow is for them. but we think the numbers are going to be pretty good for the next two quarters. 
jade rahmani -- kbw -- analyst
thanks for taking the questions.
operator
we'll take our next question from lee cooperman of omega family office. 
lee cooperman -- omega advisors -- private investor
thank you. let me first echo steve delaney's comments. you guys have done an outstanding job. you deserve a kudos.
and thanks because i have been here almost the entire run and still there. so one of my questions. i noticed you raised some fixed-rate money at 4.5% to 6.25%. the stock yield, 7.1%.
we're selling it at a significant justified premium to book value. so what are you putting money out at? i can figure out your cost of capital. what are you putting money out at these days? and you said that there's tremendous opportunities. i assume with the tremendous opportunities, your spreads should get wider, right? 
ivan kaufman -- president and chief executive officer
so we're generally putting -- it's still a competitive market. so i think the range, when we put out money on multifamily bridge loans, we're generally getting a 10% to 12% yield, somewhere in that range. and that doesn't take into consideration the significant economics we derive when that converts into an agency loan to gain on sale on the servicing fee. and then the returns become infinite in the sense, because the gain on sales and those long-term servicing fees are really what we're striving for.
so it's a matter of balance of how we raise the different elements of capital to fund for that business, and we're very careful on how we do that. 
lee cooperman -- omega advisors -- private investor
it was like a potential machine you've created here. i guess the logical question is what could derail this? is it the rising rates? i mean we're a beneficiary of these low rates which have exposure to rising rates. 
ivan kaufman -- president and chief executive officer
listen, we -- i believe a little differently than most. i believe that rates are going to rise different than most people. i think that we are underwriting and positioning our business to rise in the 10-year to about 2.50%. that's what i'm thinking in the way i'm running our business.
so we'll make sure that we have appropriate asset management skills, underwrite our loans accordingly and know how they exit, and know how to manage that business. we're also underwriting libor to probably rise to 50 to 75. that's just our outlook. so we can handle that rise in interest rates and manage our business accordingly and make sure we have ample liquidity to manage the growth in our business. 
lee cooperman -- omega advisors -- private investor
well, congratulations-en on a terrific job for all the shareholders, including yourself, which is the world of that capitalism. 
ivan kaufman -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.

good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the third quarter 2021 arbor realty trust earnings conference call. [operator instructions] please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [operator instructions] i would now like to turn the call over to your speaker today, paul elenio, chief financial officer. please go ahead.
paul elenio -- chief financial officer
ok. thank you, leo, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to the quarterly earnings call for arbor realty trust. this morning, we'll discuss the results for the quarter ended september 30, 2021. with me on the call today is ivan kaufman, our president and chief executive officer.

arbor undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise these forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after today or the occurrences of unanticipated events. i'll now turn the call over to arbor's president and ceo, ivan kaufman. 
ivan kaufman -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, paul, and thanks to everyone for joining us on today's call. as you can see from this morning's press release, we had another outstanding quarter with many significant accomplishments, including exceptional operating results. it is very important for us to continue to emphasize the value of having multiple products with diverse income streams which has allowed us to consistently grow our earnings and dividends while maintaining a very low dividend payout ratio. we've strategically built an annuity-based business model of creating multiple income streams from a single investment.
as a result, not only did we generate strong risk-adjusted returns on our capital, which positively affect our current earnings, more importantly, we are also building a much higher-quality future earnings and dividend growth story by ensuring that our assets will provide us with multiple other products in the future. and this is one of the major differentiators of our business platform, which is why we strongly believe we should consistently trade at a substantial premium and much lower dividend yield than anyone else in our peer group. our record results, combined with our very positive outlook on the long-term growth of our platform, has allowed us to once again increase our dividend to $0.36 a share. this is our sixth consecutive quarterly dividend increase and our tenth increase in the last 13 quarters, all while maintaining the lowest dividend payout ratio in the industry.
we've built a premium operating platform, which, as i mentioned in the past, is focused on the right asset classes with very stable liability structures. we have a thriving balance sheet, gse agency, private label, and single-family rental, as well as an industry-leading securitization platform, that has allowed us to produce a long track record of exceptional performance with consistent earnings and dividend growth. and as a result, we've been the top-performing reit in our space for five consecutive years now in all the major performance metrics, including earnings and dividend growth, roe, and total shareholder return. and again, we are very confident in our ability to continue to produce outstanding results in the future.
before we discuss the details of our quarterly results, i want to highlight some of our more notable recent accomplishments. we had a very active and successful quarter in many areas of our business. we produced tremendous transaction volumes, originating in excess of $4 billion in new loans and investments this quarter, including $2.5 billion in balance sheet loan originations, which is another new record. we have now closed $10 billion in loans through the first nine months of the year.
and just as importantly, our pipeline is currently at an all-time high. we are once again in the capital markets, successfully raising approximately $615 million of accretive capital to fund this growth. we issued $270 million of five-year 4.5% unsecured debt and $345 million of new 6.25% perpetual preferred equity, which will be extremely accretive to our future earnings and dividends. every time we raise capital to fund our growing balance sheet loan business, which is not only accretive to our current earnings and dividends but also allows us to build a pipeline for two to three years of new gse agency and private-label loans that produce additional long-term-dated income streams, ensuring the growth of our platform and creating high-quality earnings and dividends for the future.
we are also very successful in continuing to access the clo securitization market in the third quarter, closing our 16th and largest clo to date totaling $1.5 billion with very favorable terms and pricing. we have consistently been a leader in the clo securitization market. it's financing our high-quality balance sheet portfolio with the appropriate liability structures continuing to be one of the key business strategies. the utilization of these vehicles has contributed greatly to our success by allowing us to appropriately match-fund our assets with nonrecourse, non-mark-to-market, long-term debt and generate attractive level returns on our capital and provide us with a rock-solid balance sheet.
and in october, we were very pleased to have closed our third private-label securitization totaling $535 million with a very effective execution which will contribute greatly to our fourth quarter earnings and continues to demonstrate the strength and diversity of our versatile lending platform and tremendous securitization expertise. turning now to our third quarter performance, as paul will discuss in more detail, our quarterly financial results were once again remarkable. we produced distributable earnings of $0.49 per share, which is well in excess of our current dividend, representing a payout ratio of around 75%. in our balance sheet business, we are seeing tremendous growth in efficiencies as we continue to scale our platform at a very rapid pace.
we are a top balance sheet lender in the industry which has allowed us to grow our loan book another 24% in the third quarter on record quarterly volume of $2.5 billion. we have already grown our balance sheet 67% this year to $9.2 billion at september 30. and our pipeline is also at an all-time high, which will allow us to continue to meaningfully grow our loan book going forward. and again, i want to emphasize the significant value of our balance sheet business, which not only generates strong levered returns on our capital, but very importantly, these investments also provide us the future agency and private-label transactions with long-dated income streams.
we continue to experience strong growth in our gse agency platform, and we are seeing significant increased momentum in our private-label program as well. we originated approximately $1.1 billion in agency loans in the third quarter and $1.7 billion, including our private-label business. we also have a robust pipeline, giving us confidence in our ability to produce significant agency and private-label volumes for the balance of our year. our gse and agency platform continues to offer premium value as it requires limited capital and generates significant returns, long-dated, predictable income stream that produces significant annual cash flow.
additionally, our $26 billion gse agency servicing portfolio, which has grown 16% in the last year, is mostly prepayment-protected and generates approximately $120 million a year and growing reoccurring cash flow, which is up 19% from $101 million annually last year. this is in addition to the strong gain-on-sale margins we continue to generate from our origination platform, which, combined with new and increasing servicing revenues, will contribute -- will continue to contribute greatly to our earnings and dividends. we're also pleased with the continued growth we experienced in our single-family rental platform. in the third quarter, we committed to another $150 million of product, and it produced $500 million of volume for the first nine months of the year.
we also have well over $1 billion of additional deals in our pipeline, making us optimistic about the growth opportunities in this segment of our business. we are a leader in the build-to-rent space which provides us with the opportunity to originate construction bridge and permanent loans in the same transaction. and again, similar to our balance sheet business, the platform provides us yet another path to future transactions that will produce additional long-dated income streams. in summary, we had another exceptional quarter and are well-positioned to close out 2021 as another record year.
we have developed a unique, multi-tiered, annuity-based operating platform that provides us with future annuity of high-quality, long-dated income streams, making us confident in our ability to continue to grow our earnings and dividends and significantly outperform our peers. i will now turn the call over to paul to take you through the financial results. 
paul elenio -- chief financial officer
 ok. thank you, ivan. as ivan mentioned, we had another exceptional quarter, producing distributable earnings of $76 million or $0.47 per share and $0.49 per share, excluding a one-time realized loss of $2.8 million on a non-multifamily asset that we had taken a reserve on early last year as a result of the pandemic. these quarterly results once again translated into industry high roes of approximately 17% and have allowed us to increase our dividend to an annual run rate of $1.44 a share, and this dividend increase reflects our sixth consecutive quarterly increase and our 22nd increase in the last 10 years.
our financial results continue to benefit greatly from many aspects of our diverse annuity-based business model, including significant growth in our agency, private label, and balance sheet business platforms that produce substantial gain-on-sale margins, long-dated servicing income, and strong levered returns on our capital. additionally, as we mentioned in the past, the credit quality of our portfolio has been outstanding as we have very little exposure to the asset classes that have been affected the most by the recession, and we also believe we have adequately reserved against those positions. during the height of the pandemic, we recorded approximately $35 million in reserves related to these assets. as we mentioned on our last call, we successfully sold one of our positions in the second quarter, completely recovering a $7.5 million reserve we had against this asset and collecting $3.5 million in back interest.
and in the third quarter, we resolved another one of these loans, receiving a payoff of $2 million on a $4.7 million asset that we had a $3.8 million reserve on, resulting in a charge-off of approximately $2.8 million and a reserve recovery of $1 million. we have also seen positive developments with our nonperforming loans as trends continue to improve. we received a full payoff of $24 million loan, including recovering approximately $3 million of unpaid interest during the quarter, and we continue to make progress on our remaining npls as well. we have always prided ourselves on investing heavily in our asset management function, and the success we're having in working out these assets further demonstrates the value of our unique platform.
looking at the results from our gse agency business, we originated $1.1 billion of loans and recorded $1 billion in loan sales in the third quarter. the margin on our gse agency loan sales was 1.60% in the third quarter, compared to 1.83% in the second quarter, mainly due to higher percentage of fha loan sales in the second quarter which carry a much higher profit margin. additionally, as ivan mentioned, we were very active in our private-label program, originating $625 million of new loans in the third quarter, as well as completing our third private-label securitization, totaling $535 million in october. and in the third quarter, we also recorded $33 million of mortgage servicing rights income related to $1.9 billion of committed loans, representing an average msr rate of around 1.75%, compared to 2.20% last quarter, mainly due to a higher mix of fha and private-label loans in the third quarter that contain lower servicing fees.
our servicing portfolio of $26 billion has a weighted average servicing fee of 46 basis points and an estimated remaining life of nine years. this portfolio will continue to generate a predictable annuity of income going forward of around $120 million gross annually, which is up approximately $19 million or 19% on an annualized basis from the same time last year. additionally, prepayment fees related to certain loans that have yield maintenance provisions increased substantially to $11 million for the third quarter, compared to $4 million for the second quarter, mainly due to significantly more runoff this quarter. and the current tax provision related to our trs operations was down to approximately $4 million this quarter from approximately $11 million last quarter.
this decrease was largely related to less gain-on-sale income on our agency business this quarter due to our second private-label securitization closing last quarter and from a change in the mix of our taxable agency business income as a result of the significant growth we continue to experience in our balance sheet business. this change in mix effectively lowered our overall estimated effective tax rate for the year, resulting in a catch-up reduction to our third quarter current tax provision of around $3 million. in our balance sheet lending operation, we grew our portfolio another 24% to $9.2 billion in the third quarter on record quarterly volume of $2.5 billion. our $9.2 billion investment portfolio had an all-in yield of 4.97% at september 30, compared to 5.33% at june 30, mainly due to higher rates on runoff as compared to new originations during the quarter.
the average balance in our core investments increased substantially to $8.2 billion this quarter from $6.6 billion last quarter, mainly due to significant growth we experienced in both the second and third quarters. the average yield on these investments was 5.55% for the third quarter, compared to 5.85% for the second quarter, again mainly due to higher interest rates on runoff as compared to originations in the second and third quarters. total debt on our core assets was approximately $8.6 billion at september 30 with an all-in debt cost of approximately 2.64%, which was down from a debt cost of around 2.79% at june 30, mainly due to a reduction in the cost of funds from our new clo vehicle and reduced rates in our warehouse and repurchase agreements during the third quarter. the average balance in our debt facilities was up to approximately $7.3 billion for the third quarter from $5.9 billion for the second quarter, mostly due to financing the growth in our portfolio and issuing $270 million of senior unsecured notes during the third quarter.
on the average, cost of funds in our debt facilities increased to -- decreased to 2.76% for the third quarter from 2.89% for the second quarter, again mainly due to the full impact of reduced pricing in our clo vehicles and warehouse facilities. our overall net interest spreads on our core assets decreased to 2.79% this quarter, compared to 2.96% last quarter, and our overall spot net interest spreads were also down to 2.33% at september 30 from 2.54% at june 30 from yield compression on new originations as compared to runoff. that completes our prepared remarks for this morning. i'll now turn it back to the operator to take any questions you may have at this time.

thank you. [operator instructions] we'll take our first question from steve delaney with jmp securities. please go ahead.
steve delaney -- jmp securities -- analyst
thanks. hello, ivan and paul. congratulations on an excellent close to last year. i think the thing that jumped off the page the most to me, it was a lot of good things in the report and in the year.
but the dramatic growth and your structured business in terms of origination volume, you did $9.7 billion by 6.8% or 70% of that came in the second half of the year. so my question is, this the strong demand that you're seeing for multi-family bridge loans in the market, do you expect that to carry over into 2022? and is it possible that 2022 could set a new record for origination volume and a structured business? thank you.
ivan kaufman -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. thanks, steve. clearly, there was a little bit of a shift in the environment, and i'll give you some of the reasons for it, and why we're so well-positioned, so dominant in that space. and if we had more personnel and more ability, we could probably have done more, we limited what we could do, and we're still limiting what we could do.
i think with the huge jump in rates of rental rates and as between 10% to 25% increase in rents from people buying properties and not going for permanent financing, so they're going for more transitional financing before they get to the permanent financing. so it's a very, very big shift through the covid period, rents were fairly flat, and then right after the initial periods of covid, rents really accelerated. so people are buying multifamily properties, taking a year to two years to turn those rents and then getting the benefit of an increase then [inaudible] and go for permanent. so that's been the shift in the market.
we are the best balance sheet lender in the business when it comes to multifamily. we do a great job and that business has grown just dramatically. we've probably turned away a just huge amount of business. in terms of the outlook for 2022, we are running at about $1 billion a month on our books for closing for the first quarter.
we're still turning down a significant amount of business. we have restrictions. human capital is a very, very big restriction today. as we all know, hiring people, retaining people is a big task.
we're doing a good job with retention, but hiring new people is very difficult. so right now, the outlook on the balance sheet is still very strong, and we still are a market leader in that place in the market.
steve delaney -- jmp securities -- analyst
that's very helpful. and thanks for the color on the mindset of these borrowers that it's not buy it, take three or four years renovated completely. they're seeing a near-term opportunity and i can understand how that is boosting your demand for bridge. thank you for that.
and then one follow on question. your sfr business is still relatively small, but strategic for sure. so $57 million and originations in the fourth quarter, and as you're servicing about 190. what i was trying to reconcile because the numbers weren't weren't really adding up.
you're showing that you have $729 million in total commitments. and i'm just trying to understand rationalize like where do we see this? or have we seen the origination volume that would have contributed to the $700 million of total commitments?
ivan kaufman -- president and chief executive officer
so the various segments of that business, one is, providing fixed rate production, which is a part of what we're doing. and i think we're running that side of the business, ramping it up to about $20 million a month, which is our goal where we originate fixed rate product, and we sell them as fixed rate loans. we don't hold them securitization, but we do sell them into the market and we do very well with those. --
steve delaney -- jmp securities -- analyst
ok. -- 
ivan kaufman -- president and chief executive officer
the second element of our business providing floating rate product for people buying scattered site single-family rentals, either from builders or scattered sites developing in that part of our balance sheet is growing. paul could tell you how much is on that balance sheet and how much is in the pipeline. and the third piece of the business, which we love, which we are the market leader in, i believe we are, is in the built around communities where people are building, built around communities. we provide them a construction loan.
it's stabilizes, we provide them a bridge loan and then we do a take-out loan. that's where we put a lot of work, but a lot of energy spent a lot of money, and that's where there's going to be an exponential amount of return on that capital in 2022, 2023, and 2024. paul, you want to give some color on the numbers?
paul elenio -- chief financial officer
yeah. i think, ivan's laid out the different components of the business, steve. it's a little complicated from a financial modeling perspective i get. what we're trying to do for you guys is give you a sense of the breadth of the platform when we disclose the committed volumes that we've committed to during the year.
so you know the transactions we've committed to the size. but as ivan said, this different components and some of those build-to-rent and scattered site commitments aren't funded right upfront, right? they're funded over time. so the commitments could be large and the fundings could be small over a period of time. so the first thing we did was try to disclose to you in the press release what we've committed to, to give you a sense of where that business is going.
when you look at the numbers that hit the balance sheet, you're right. $57 million was what we funded in permanent fixed rate loans that hit the agency side, and we're selling those in the market of pretty, pretty high margin without retaining any risk. and then we've got the build-to-rent fundings, and then we've got the bridge loans funding. so when i look at the quarter, we probably funded $115 million of prior commitments on build-to-rent while commitments.
we funded, maybe even more than that, probably $150 million. and then we had about $60 million of, as you said, permanent loans. but to-date, year-to-date through december 2021, we originated about $170 million, a permanent product, $136 million of that was fixed rate that was selling through the market, and booking a profit on not retaining any risk. the other $35 million is sitting on our balance sheet.
total on our balance sheet right now is about $450 million, and that consists of the balance sheet part of the small amount of fixed rate loans we have on our balance sheet. and then all the fundings we've done on between bridge loans and fundings we've done on commitments for scattered site and build-to-rent around products. so we're just trying to give you it's a little complicated, but we're trying to give you a sense of where the business is going with committed volume. but the funded volumes trail, as i've said, and those are the numbers that are in the balance sheet.
steve delaney -- jmp securities -- analyst
got it. -- and that's very helpful color -- go ahead. i'm sorry.
ivan kaufman -- president and chief executive officer
i do want to reiterate just as i did before, that we are resource constrained. we could be doing significantly more, but we just don't have the bodies to process the business and we're at our capacity, which is the first time that's ever happened in my career, where you can't hire people to manage new business and you're turning away business.
steve delaney -- jmp securities -- analyst
crazy. -- well, high quality problem, i think -- 
paul elenio -- chief financial officer
yeah. last thing, i just want to add to ivan's commentary before about our average run rate, just to give you some numbers. we did originate, i think just about $850 million in january had $150 million around us. as ivan said, we're running in that $800 to a billion per month and we've got some constraints.  but obviously, that businesses we have a large pipeline that is still so very active. 
steve delaney -- jmp securities -- analyst
thank you both for the comments. helpful. 
operator
we'll take our next question from rick shane with jpmorgan. please go ahead, your line is open.
rick shane -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
hey, guys, thanks for taking my questions this morning. can you hear me?
paul elenio -- chief financial officer
yes, rick, how are you?
rick shane -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
i'm doing well. thanks. a couple of things. so i think implicit in the comments about labor markets and growth opportunity, that's a signal to all of us to think about expense structure going forward.
what type of expense growth do you think we should anticipate in 2022? just so we can sort of level set there, given the language around employees? 
ivan kaufman -- president and chief executive officer
before paul gets into into the detail. we deal with retention and things of that nature consistently over the course of different cycles. and we have a lot of flexibility in the way we do compensate people. and even having to payoff for people, we do it on a long-term basis with a lot of retention aspects to it.
so we have the benefit of people been with us for 5,10,15, 20 years who are loyal to the company. we do have to recognize that they do have to be adjusted to where the market currently is, we were able to do that with long-term incentives rather than annual payouts. and, get the benefit of having a long-term retention. but with that, i'll turn it over to you, paul.
paul elenio -- chief financial officer
so it's a very good question, rick, and when i look at our numbers for '21 versus '20, '20 was a covid year, so less travel, less conferences, things of that nature. so it's a hard comparison. but when i look at '21 versus '20, we're up about, i'd say, 20% year-over-year in comp in g&a, that's without commissions, which is a variable based on our margins. and i say when i look at the model, i think of it similarly, 15% to 20% growth in that number is probably reasonable given the cap to the human capital constraints we have and the way we have to retain people.
it's hard to totally protect the number. but i would say consistent with last year's growth is probably similar the way i look at the future model.
rick shane -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
great. and i know no one's got a crystal ball, and i appreciate your both of your willingness to embrace the question and think forward on it, so thank you. the second thing is that, when we think about the structured business, i think of that as potential energy ultimately for the agency business. and when we look at the terms of those loans, that's clearly the business model.
i am curious when you underwrite loans and think about business plans, are you starting to contemplate higher interest rates or exits as you're taking on those loans within the structured product business with the idea that it may be more expensive for managers, owners to get financing?
ivan kaufman -- president and chief executive officer
we're constantly readjusting our models based on different economics, and we always on the right our bridge loans to where the take out is going to be and we use a certain constant. so that's something that's different about the way we do our business. back in november, we actually took a look at where the market is. we took a look at where rents have increased to readjust our forecast on rent growth a little bit while we have exorbitant rent growth.
we readjusted our rent growth because people are starting to think that 10% and 20% rent growth is going to last forever. we think that level of rent growth is going to subside this year as they turn their units in the market adjusts, and then we readjust that our rent growth back to a 3% normalized rate. that's a very big adjustment in terms of increasing the constant that we're using. we're constantly adjusting to where the market is at something that we do traditionally.
we've also reallocated our pricing to be more aggressive on lower loan to value in primary markets starting in november, so we've adjusted our portfolio of lending programs as well on a credit basis. so we're sensitized to all of those different factors in our underwriting.
rick shane -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
and again, i appreciate the specificity of the answer. thank you, guys so much. 
paul elenio -- chief financial officer
thanks, rick.
operator
we'll take our next question from stephen laws with raymond james, please go ahead, your line is open.
stephen laws -- raymond james -- analyst
good morning. ivan and paul, your thoughts around the repayment outlook, obviously, some significant benefits in recent results from the early repayments. how do you see that playing out over the '22 and come the levels, we should expect contribution from that? 
paul elenio -- chief financial officer
sure. so i think we've had this conversation a few times, steve, and it used to blow me away how much prepayment income we've been able to receive. i think on the outlook, i think when i look at the numbers, we do have january's numbers, i think we've got $3 million already in the door in january. and while i do expect it to slow over time, it may be slightly elevated in the first and second quarter.
but certainly, as you know, when rates rise, the yield maintenance protection changes. so we are modeling ourselves to a much more normalized number. we did $38 million of prepayment penalties in '21 comparatively in '20, we had $13 million. we're modeling somewhere in between that, given where we think rates could go and what that will do to the yield maintenance provisions.
however, having said that, intuitively, if rates rise, then we should see less run off. and although you won't get the one-time fees like you did last year, you'll retain the servicing strip, which is more long-dated and you have that annuity. so i guess that's the way we look at, where prepayments could go based on where we think rates to go and what that does to the yield maintenance portion of your portfolio.
stephen laws -- raymond james -- analyst
great. thanks for the detail there, paul. and, gain on sale outlook as we think about that range as we think about moving to the year. i know you mentioned in your prepared remarks, benefited this quarter from a higher mix of fannie.
can you give us some commentary around that as we think about our model for the next couple next year? 
paul elenio -- chief financial officer
yes. so i think what i've said many times on calls as we try to guide to anywhere between 101 and 10150. clearly in 2021, we had some tailwinds and we were able to get a significant margin above that. i think we came in at 101 90.
some of that had to do with high margin business. we did more fha business, which was up substantially, which was great. i do think we still have a strong pipeline of fha business, and i think we'll be able to even beat our number last year, which will help that margin because that's 104 business. the apl business, i think, ivan can comment.
but i think the way we look at that and the [inaudible] agency business, as we look at modeling between a 101, 101.5, if you go back and look at 2020, we came in at 10140. this year we came in at 10190, but uncomfortable even with rates rising, that will be between that 101 and 101.5 keys, and that's how we put our models together going forward.
stephen laws -- raymond james -- analyst
great. that's helpful. thanks, paul.
operator
our next question from jade rahmani with kbw. please go ahead.
mike smith -- kbw -- analyst
hey, guys. this is actually mike smith on for jade. just a couple of round breaks, are you seeing any changes in sentiment, behavior, or underwriting on the part of investors?
ivan kaufman -- president and chief executive officer
i don't think we've seen so much of a change. clearly, loan proceeds going to be cut, with rates going up. there's been a very significant rise in the 10-year from a range of 150 now, a range of 190 to two and a quarter in my book and it's definitely affecting, loan proceeds for people. and it's pretty consistent underwriting guidelines haven't changed that much.
i think just the amount of proceeds people are taking out or the amount of equity that has to go online is going to be changing on a go forward basis. i think you'll see a little bit of a shift maybe to five and seven year products that people get a little more proceeds. so there may be a shift a little bit from a 10-year product down to a 5 and 7. you'll have to see a little bit more equitization in transactions today in order to qualify for long-term fixed rate financing.
mike smith -- kbw -- analyst
that's helpful color. and then just as far, give an idea of what level of rate increases would you start to impact the market, both in terms of investment trends and credit performance? 
ivan kaufman -- president and chief executive officer
so, right now there's been no adjustment in cap rates or multifamily properties, despite the fact that rates are up 50 basis points. my feeling is cap rates should mathematically adjust, but the multifamily asset class is still so attractive, and there is some rent growth left in there. i do believe that there has to be a catch up along the way and that will come. if this continues, and if the tenure year continues to widen out.
but we haven't seen an adjustment yet, but i believe it's a little bit of a lag, but we'll see what happens. people are still looking at the multifamily asset classes that attractive, and they're willing to get a lower return on their money at the current time. so either it's lagging or there's an adjustment in investor sentiment returns.
mike smith -- kbw -- analyst
great, thanks a lot for taking the questions and congrats on a strong quarter.
paul elenio -- chief financial officer

good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the fourth quarter 2021 arbor realty trust earnings conference call. [operator instructions] i would now like to turn the call over to your speaker today, paul elenio, chief financial officer. please go ahead.
paul elenio -- chief financial officer
ok. thank you, ashley, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to the quarterly earnings call for arbor realty trust. this morning, we'll discuss the results for the fourth quarter and year ended december 31, 2021. with me on the call today is ivan kaufman, our president and chief executive officer.
before we begin, i need to inform you that statements made in this earnings call may be deemed forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties, including information about possible or assumed future results of our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations, plans and objectives. these statements are based on our beliefs, assumptions, and expectations of our future performance, taking into account the information currently available to us. factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from arbor's expectations in these forward-looking statements are detailed in our sec reports. listeners are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of today.
arbor undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise these forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after today or the occurrences of unanticipated events. i'll now turn the call over to arbor's president and ceo, ivan kaufman. 
ivan kaufman -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, paul. and thanks to everyone for joining us on today's call. we're very excited today to discuss the significant success we had in closing out what was an exceptional 2021, as well as our plans and outlook for 2022, which we are confident will be another outstanding year. as you can see from this morning's press release, we had another record quarter and 2021's results reflect one of our best years as a public company.
it is very important to continue to emphasize the value of having multiple products with diverse income streams, which has allowed us to consistently grow our earnings and dividends in all cycles while maintaining a very low dividend payout ratio. we strategically built an annuity based business model, creating multiple income streams from a single investment as a result not only do we generate strong risk adjusted returns on our capital, which positively affect our current earnings. more importantly, we are also building a much higher quality future earnings and dividend growth story by ensuring that our assets could provide us with multiple other products in the future. and this is one of the major differentiators of our business platform, which is why we strongly believe we consistently trade at a substantial premium and much lower dividend yield than anyone in our peer group.
in fact, with the recent pullback in the market, we are now trading at a dividend yield of approximately 8.8%, which is actually higher than the yield of our peer group for the first time in several years. this is despite the significant advantages of our business model and a long track record of consistent dividend increases compared to our peers, most of which have been unable to grow their dividends. we feel strongly that our current stock price in no way reflects the true value of our franchise, presenting investors with an unparalleled buying opportunity. as described in this morning's press release, our record fourth quarter results, combined with a very positive outlook on the long-term growth of our platform, has allowed us to once again increase our dividend to $0.37 a share.
this is our seventh consecutive quarterly dividend increase and a 10th consecutive year with consistent dividend growth, putting us in a very elite class of companies, all while continuing to maintain the lowest dividend payout ratio in the industry. we've built a premium operating platform that is focused on the right asset classes in a very stable liability structures. we have a thriving balance sheet, gse agency, private label, single family rental, as well as industry leader securitization platform that allowed us to produce a long track record of exceptional performance with consistent earnings and dividend growth. as a result, we've been the top performing rate in our space for five consecutive years now, and all the major performance metrics, including earnings and dividend growth, roe, and total shareholder return.
and again, we are very well-positioned to succeed in every market cycle, which gives us great confidence in our ability to continue to have tremendous success going forward. before we discuss the details of our quarterly results, i want to highlight some of our more notable 2021 accomplishments, which include generating substantial growth in our earnings, allowing us to increase our dividend 4 times or 12%, to an annual run rate of $1. 48 a share, delivering total shareholder return of 39% in 2021 and 221% cumulatively for the last five years. with an annualized return of 26% achieving industry, leading roes of 90% for each of the last two years, producing record originations of $16 billion, a 76% increase over last year.
originating $10 billion of new balance sheet business, increasing our portfolio 122% in 2021 to $12.2 billion producing private label originations of $1.4 billion, a 276% increase over the last year. growing our service portfolio to $27 billion, a 10% increase from 2020 and a 34% increase over the last three years. closing for non-recourse clo securitizations totaling $5.2 billion and to private label securitizations for $1 billion for industry leading securitization platform and raising $1.7 billion of accretive capital to fund our balance sheet growth, and increase our market cap to over $3 billion. turning now to our fourth quarter performance, as paul will discuss in more detail.
our quarterly financial results for once again remarkable. we produced distributable earnings of $0.62 per share, which is well in excess of our current dividend, representing a payout ratio of around 60% for the fourth quarter, and 70% for the full year 2021. and our balance sheet lending business, we have another outstanding quarter producing record volumes of $4.3 billion, we are top balance sheet lender in the industry, and is seeing tremendous growth in efficiencies as we continue to scale our platform. as a result, we grow our balance sheet book 122% in 2021 to $12.2 billion on record originations of $9.7 billion, and we have a very large pipeline, which gives us great confidence in our ability to continue to meaningfully grow our loan book in 2022.
and again, these balance sheet loans create significant value for our platform are they're not only accretive [inaudible] earnings and dividends, but also allow us to build a pipeline for two to three years of new gse agency and private label loans that produce additional long dated income streams, ensuring the long-term growth of our platform and creating high quality earnings and dividends for the future. we have consistently been a leader in the clo securitization market as finance for a high quality balance sheet portfolio with the appropriate liability structures continues to be one of our key business strategies. we are very successful in continuing to access the clo securitization market in 2021, including closing our largest clo today totaling $2.1 billion in the fourth quarter, as well as closing another $2 billion clo just last week. the utilization of these vehicles contributed greatly to our success by allowing us to appropriately match fund our assets with non-recourse, non mark to market long dated debt, and generate attractive levered returns on our capital.
we continue to experience strong growth in our gse agency and private label business programs as well. we originate approximately $1.6 billion in agency loans in the fourth quarter, and $1.9 billion, including our private label business. equally important, we have a robust pipeline giving us confidence in our ability to continue to produce consistent agency volume in 2022. our gse agency platform continues to offer a premium value as it requires limited capital, and generate significant long-dated predictable income streams and produces significant annual cash flow.
additionally, our $27 billion gse agency service and portfolio, which has grown 10% in the last year, is mostly prepayment protected and generates approximately $121 million a year and growing in reoccurring cash flow, which is up 8% from $112 million annually last year. this is in addition to the strong gain on sale margins we continue to generate from our origination platform, which combined with new and increasing servicing revenues, will continue to contribute greatly to our earnings and dividends. and earlier this week, we were pleased to have close our fourth private label securitization totaling $490 million, which continues to demonstrate the strength and diversity of our versatile lending platform and tremendous securitization expertise. we also had a great year in a single family rental platform.
we produced approximately $900 million of volume in 2021, including approximately $400 million in the fourth quarter. additionally, we currently have over $1 billion of additional deals in our pipeline, making us optimistic about the growth opportunities in this segment of our business going forward. we are a leader in the build-to-rent space, which provides us with the opportunity to originate construction, bridge, and permanent loans on the same transactions. and again, similar to our balance sheet business, this platform provides us yet with a path to future transactions that will produce additional long data of income streams.
and reflecting on 2021, we had an exceptional year and clearly outperformed our peer group. we are the best performing rate five years in a row, delivering a 26% annualized return over the same time period. we're also well-positioned for continued success in 2022 our unique, multi-tiered annuity based operating platform that provides us with a future annuity of high quality, long dated income streams, making us confident in our ability to continue to grow our earnings and dividends and significantly outperform our peers. i will now turn the call over to paul, to take you through the financial results.
paul elenio -- chief financial officer
ok. thank you, ivan. as ivan mentioned, we had another exceptional quarter producing distributable earnings of $94 million, or $0.57 per share and $0.62 per share, excluding a one-time realized loss of $8 million in a non multi-family asset that we were taking a reserve on during the height of the pandemic. we also had a record year with distributable earnings of $2.01 per share in 2021, a 15% increase over our 2020 results.
and these results translated into industry high roes again, of approximately 19% in 2021, allowing us to increase our dividend to an annual run rate of a $1.48 a share, reflecting 4 increases in 2021 and 7 consecutive quarterly increases, representing a 23% increase over that time span. our financial results continue to benefit greatly from many aspects of our diverse annuity based business model, including significant growth in our agency, private label, and balance sheet business platforms that produce substantial gain on sale margins, long-dated servicing income, and strong levered returns on our capital. additionally, as we've mentioned in the past, the credit quality of our portfolio has been outstanding. we have very few specific reserves left and a handful of non-multifamily assets that we took in the beginning of the pandemic, and we also made significant progress over the last few quarters and our non-performing loans as trends continue to improve.
we received another $32 million in payoffs and pay downs in the fourth quarter related to 3 loans. leaving us would effectively only one remaining non-performing loan for $20 million. we have always prided ourselves on investing heavily in our asset management function, and the success we're having in working out these assets further demonstrates the value of our unique franchise. looking at the results from our gse agency business, we originated $1.6 billion and gse loans, and recorded $1.5 billion in gse loan sales in the fourth quarter.
we also continue to produce consistently strong margins in our gse loan sales, generating a margin of 1.52% in the fourth quarter, compared to 1.60% in the third quarter. additionally, as ivan mentioned, we remain very active in our private label program, originating $282 million of new loans in the fourth quarter, as well as completing our third private label securitization totaling $535 million in october, and our fourth securitization totaled $490 million earlier this week. and in the fourth quarter, we also recorded $35 million of mortgage servicing rights income related to $1.8 billion of committed loans, representing an average msr rate of around 1.88%, compared to 1.75% last quarter, mainly due to a greater mix of fannie mae loans in the fourth quarter that contain higher servicing fees. our servicing portfolio also grew 9.5%  in 2021 to $27 billion, with a weighted average servicing fee of 45 basis points and an estimated remaining life of 9 years.
this portfolio will continue to generate a predictable annuity of income going forward of around $121 million gross annually, which is up approximately $9 million or 8% on an annual basis from the same time last year. additionally, prepayment fees related to certain loans that have your maintenance protection increased again substantially in the fourth quarter to $20 million, compared to $11 million in the third quarter, mainly due to significantly more run off this quarter as a result of the continued increase in real estate values. and our balance sheet lending operation, we grew our portfolio another 33% this quarter to $12.2 billion on record quarterly volume of $4.3 billion or $12.2 billion investment portfolio had an all-in-yield of 4.62% percent at december 31st, compared to 4.97% at september 30th, mainly due to higher rates on runoff as compared to new originations during the quarter. the average balance in our foreign investments increased substantially to $10.5 billion this quarter from $8.2 billion last quarter, mainly due to the significant growth we experienced in both the third and fourth quarters.
the average yield in these investments was 5.03% for the fourth quarter, compared to 5.55% for the third quarter, mainly due to higher interest rates on runoff as compared to originations in the third and fourth quarters, combined with $3 million in back interest collected in the third quarter from the payoff of a non-performing loans. total debt on our core assets was approximately $11.2 billion at december 31st, with an all-in-debt cost of approximately 2.61%, which was down slightly from a debt cost of around 2.64% at september 30th, mainly due to a reduction in the cost of funds from our new clo vehicles, and reduced rates and warehouse, and repurchase agreements during the fourth quarter. the average balance in our debt facilities was up to approximately $9.4 billion for the fourth quarter, from $7.3 billion for the third quarter, mostly due to financing the growth in our portfolio and issuing $180 million of new unsecured notes during the fourth quarter. and the average cost of funds in our debt facilities also decreased to 2.65% for the fourth quarter, from 2.76% for the third quarter.
again, mainly due to reduced pricing in our clo vehicles and warehouse facilities. our overall net interest spreads in our core assets decreased to 2.38% this quarter, compared to 2.79% last quarter. and our overall spot net interest spreads were also down to 2.01% at december 31st from 2.33% at september 30th due to yield compression on new originations as compared to run off. that completes our prepared remarks this morning, and i'll now turn it back to the operator.

steve delaney -- jmp securities -- analyst
good morning, ivan and paul. thank you for taking my question. it strikes me a lot of lot of positive things in your report, but it strikes me as if i had to pick one highlight in the quarter, it would be the structured business volume, $2.8 billion, took the portfolio up 16%. that wouldn't happen -- that business wouldn't happen without your access to clos.
i think you would agree. and could you talk a little bit about the latest clo, i guess that clo 18, the $2 billion? and maybe talk a little bit about that execution compared to, say, the clo 17 that you did late last year? thank you.

sure. so clearly, the last clo we did of $2 billion was very sizable, and it was important for us given the volume. i think if you look in the, i think, commercial observer or one of the rags, we actually -- there was a clo that was just price. we really can't speak about it, but it's in there.
we're an active issuer of clos. the pricing of clos have changed with the market. and the good news about the way we run our business, we're always on track as to where the market is and adjusting the pricing of our originations to match the clo execution. so our clos continue to change.
our pricing to our customers continue to change. we always like to have somewhere between 50% to 75% of clo debt to total outstandings. we're currently sitting around 65%, which is a very comfortable rate relative to where we want to be specifically in this cycle. so we're well prepared with our clos and with our liability structure is pretty much intact, i'm very comfortable with our position.
steve delaney -- jmp securities -- analyst
ok. the average -- the spread there was libor plus 181, and that was flat to the clo 17. do you expect that, that is where the market is today and will kind of remain in that near 180 basis point range on a weighted average?
ivan kaufman -- president and chief executive officer
no, not at all. the markets widened up considerably. in fact, we've raised our pricing to our consumers, i think, five times since december. so we've increased our pricing five times to match where the market is.
and basically, each price is an eigth increase, and we've also adjusted our credit guidelines considerably over the last nine months as well. so if you take those five increases, we've increased our price in five-eight to almost three-quarters across the board. we've done it gradually to match how the markets have moved. so that's how our business runs.
usually, there's a lag of a couple of weeks, but not that much of a lag. so we're consistently taking new loan originations, pricing them accordingly too with the clo market. so we're pretty aggressive about it. some of the people in the market lag a lot more than we do.
we're pretty much spot on, given our level of volume and where we are in the market and more specifically, a real clear knowledge of where the clo market is executing to.
steve delaney -- jmp securities -- analyst
that's helpful.
paul elenio -- chief financial officer
steve, it's paul. i just wanted to correct you. so yes, we had a 181 pricing on our last clo. as you mentioned, the one before, it was 68.
so things have widened a little bit, as ivan said and continue to. but as ivan mentioned, we're totally in tune to what our levered return is. and because we're so active in the clo market, we're able to adjust our pricing according to get to that targeted levered return, which is something that i think is unique to our platform as we're so in tune to what that market is, and we're a market leader.
steve delaney -- jmp securities -- analyst
great. and your sfr product and your bfr product, do i understand that you are putting those loans into the same clo program that you do with your traditional bridge loans?
ivan kaufman -- president and chief executive officer
on the exit but not on the aggregation aspects. when it comes to the construction, what we'll do is that's done on a separate line. some of the loans on the bridge side, once they're stabilized, they'll be going to our clos once they fit multifamily characteristics.
steve delaney -- jmp securities -- analyst
got it. but during the interim, because of the complexity of construction draws and everything, that's your take -- your clos, your takeout once you're past your development construction period.
ivan kaufman -- president and chief executive officer
once they were to stabilize -- once they were stable -- once the units are up and running and get leased up, yes.
steve delaney -- jmp securities -- analyst
yeah. thank you both for your comments.
paul elenio -- chief financial officer
thank you, steve.
operator
[operator instructions] we'll move next to stephen laws of raymond james.
stephen laws -- raymond james -- analyst
hi, good morning. ivan and paul, you guys have both touched on this a number of quarters in a row and would love to get updated thoughts. and i think, paul, you touched a little bit on your prepared remarks, but kind of early repayments been running pretty high the last few quarters. kind of curious what you're seeing there, maybe in april.
or is the volatility and maybe changing macro outlook made some people more reluctant to pay those penalties to refi early?
paul elenio -- chief financial officer
sure. so let me give you some numbers, steve, and then i'll turn it to ivan to the market color. you did mention, i should address some of that in my prepared remarks. it still continues to surprise me that -- the level of prepayments we're seeing.
there's still a lot of sale activity in the market. prices are still elevated. we'll see where that goes with the changing environment. but we did have another $1.250 billion of agency runoff in the quarter that generated $16 million of prepayment fees.
as i've said last quarter, we do think that slows down as interest rates rise. obviously, naturally, yield maintenance burns off when interest rates rise, although we did say we thought it would be elevated in the first and maybe the second quarter. and we were right, it was elevated in the first quarter. in the second quarter in april, we had $350 million of agency runoff in april, and we generated just over 4 million in prepayment fees from that.
so we do think it slows over time. when that happens exactly, it's hard to determine. but obviously, with rising interest rates, those numbers will be more challenging to have higher prepayment fees. but ivan could give his view on where he thinks runoff goes, given the state of the market and how people view those prepayment fees challenges.
ivan kaufman -- president and chief executive officer
yes. i think we'll have another robust quarter next quarter because there's still a lot of assets in the market for sale. however, the prepayment fees could come down a little bit as the yield maintenance is a little less because rates are a little bit higher. multifamily values seem -- still seem to be maintaining themselves.
so the substantial gains that a lot of people have in their multifamily assets and a lot of people are monetizing those gains even if they have to pay prepayments because their gains way outweigh the prepayment factor relative to their total gain perspective. so i do think they'll slow a little bit in the third and fourth quarter as the market kind of takes to readjust a little bit, but we certainly kind of expect a reasonable quarter next quarter.
stephen laws -- raymond james -- analyst
great. appreciate the comments this morning, ival and paul.
thanks, steve.
operator
we'll take our next question from crispin love of piper sandler.
crispin love -- piper sandler -- analyst
thanks. good morning, everyone. my first one is on the originations trajectory in the structured business. i think last quarter, you were talking about $1 billion per month or a little bit less than that.
so just curious if you could provide an update on what you're seeing currently and then also how that could impact originations in the second quarter and throughout the year.
ivan kaufman -- president and chief executive officer
sure. well, clearly, we're the market leader on providing bridge debt in the multifamily sector. and even as we continue to raise our pricing, i think we had two price increases over the last 14 days. we're still seeing originations at that similar level of about $1 billion a quarter, which is where we're kind of managing to.
so for the moment, we're in pretty reasonable shape with our pipeline. i think that through june, august, july, we're at that level, and we haven't seen a slowdown as of this point. i think with the volatility of the 10-year fixed rate markets, i think people are still very interested in heading toward floating rate deals until they see the market settle out. in addition, i think you still have at least another six months of [inaudible] properties and still bringing lagging rents to market and there's like a 10% gap between rents a year ago and today.
so i think until you see that full turn of rents, the bridge product will be an attractive financing alternative, especially in this market volatility.
paul elenio -- chief financial officer
and crispin, it's paul. welcome, by the way, and thank you for your participation. to ivan's point, i'll just give you a couple of numbers for april because we have them. obviously, we're in may.
so we did close $800 million of bridge product in the month of april. we did have $500 million of runoff in april. but as ivan said, our clip in our pace is probably between that $800 million and $1 billion a month going forward. now of the $500 million runoff we did see in our balance sheet book, we were able to recapture 35% of that in our agency product, which is great, and that's our model.
as you know, that's what we strive for. and so of the $475 million of agency product we did in april, about 35% of that $500 million that ran off in the balance sheet book went right into the agency product. so that's our model. that's great execution for us.
that's what we strive for, but those are some of the numbers around april.
crispin love -- piper sandler -- analyst
great. thanks, ivan and paul. that's helpful. and then just one on gain on sale revenue.
it seemed like it was significantly lower in the quarter sequentially. can you speak to what drove that? or if there are any noncore items there that's driving that or if there's just something that i'm missing there?
paul elenio -- chief financial officer
sure. so let me take you through that. so first of all, you got to look at it as two line items, crispin, on the p&l that you've got to combine a little bit, and we do it in distributable earnings to help you guys on a rec. so the gain on sale, fee-based services and gain on sale item did look really low, but then you got to look at the gain on -- the gain from derivatives line.
and we had our apl securitization of $489 million in the first quarter. and obviously, with where interest rates went, the assets were worth less the fixed rate assets. but the swaps were worth more, so the swaps were usually in the money, and the assets were less in the money. so you've got to take about $17.1 million of that $17.3 million on that line item and add it up to the gain on sale number.
that puts you at about $19 million on a gain on sale, which is about a margin of 101.18, and that's because the apl product gapped out a little bit, and we had a little less margin on that than we have in the past. but on the agency business, if you strip out the apl and that $1.1 billion of agency, we did about a 101.39 margin, and that was compared to a101.52 margin in the past. what i've said in my commentary is given the change in interest rates, we do expect margins to be a little tighter. but some of it also has to do with mix.
we had less fha loan sales in the first quarter than we did in the fourth quarter, and that's just timing of when stuff originates and when we sell it. and obviously, the fha business, as we've commented in the past, is like a 104 business. so that certainly can skew the margins. and then we also have the single-family rental business.
we also have a permanent loan product, where we originate fixed rate loans and then we sell them into the market with no risk. and we had -- we really didn't have any of those sales in the first quarter. again, it's timing, and we had a few of those sales in the fourth quarter, and those were like a 102, 103 margin. so a lot of it is mix on the general straight down the middle, fannie, freddie.
the margins haven't really changed. it just has to deal with the mix, and that's why we guide to a 101.30 to 101.50 margin going forward.
operator
[operator instructions] we'll move next to jade rahmani of kbw.
jade rahmani -- keefe, bruyette and woods -- analyst
thank you very much. volumes continue to remain extremely strong in the market. and at this point, do you think that's a function of investors rushing in to capture current interest rates before there's future increases or something else that's driving that?
ivan kaufman -- president and chief executive officer
i think the multifamily sector seems to be one of the most resilient sectors, and i think there's just a lot of investor demand in this sector. we're seeing that also in the build-to-rent sector as well. those are just two sectors that continue to drive a lot of equity, and the sales from what i hear in the first quarter and to date are still extremely strong. i do believe there'll be a little bit of a reset as rates change and people take a step back and reevaluate, but we're pretty optimistic in terms of overall multifamily sales opportunities going forward for the balance of the year.
maybe they'll cool off slightly. but even if they do cool off, they'll readjust, and maybe you'll have a gap for about 60 days as a market reset to how they're going to view interest rates and the potential for a recession.
jade rahmani -- keefe, bruyette and woods -- analyst
and in that gap, widening, do you expect there's going to be multifamily cap rate widening? could you put some parameters perhaps around the magnitude that you're thinking about?
ivan kaufman -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. contrary to everybody else, we've been very much anticipating inflation and a potential recession, and we've underwritten cap rate expansion to about 50 basis points from where it is today, heavily criticized for, but that's our position. we believe that as rates widened and rent growth slows, you'll see a bit of a widening on the cap rate side. even if you have strong investor demand, you still need to have the kind of returns to their equity and that's our perspective.
jade rahmani -- keefe, bruyette and woods -- analyst
thank you. on the $500 million of runoff you saw in april, 35% of those went into agency. so those refinanced from a bridge product into a fixed rate product with longer-term duration. what does the other 65% do in your insight?
paul elenio -- chief financial officer
yes. most of it -- so you're right, 35%, and most of that 35% was a large deal that we had on the bridge side that we were able to take out in the agency side, which is great. the rest of that, for the most part, were sales that walked away. and so we didn't recapture the rest of that because it was mostly as a result of the sales of properties, which we don't always control the take out of the sale.
jade rahmani -- keefe, bruyette and woods -- analyst
just a strategic question. the platform, the company overall has grown tremendously over the last multiple years. there's a cohort of mortgage reits that you could argue are subscale in the market trading at discounts to net asset value or book value. would acquisitions, m&a ever be something of interest? or do you believe arbor's just got this unique multifamily focused platform that works well between the structured and the gse business that not really interested in branching out?
paul elenio -- chief financial officer
ivan, are you there?
ivan kaufman -- president and chief executive officer
can you repeat the question? i fell off the call. i'm sorry, we're back on.
jade rahmani -- keefe, bruyette and woods -- analyst
yes. it's an m&a question, mergers and acquisitions, arbor has grown tremendously over the last five years and has a strong niche within the multifamily small balance as well as bridge lending market. would the company be interested in m&a in the mortgage reit space to expand its overall footprint into other products? or is that not really a focus?
ivan kaufman -- president and chief executive officer
i think we've always had a history of m&a. we haven't done that much over the last couple of years only because we think the pricing in the market has really been a little bit inappropriate for -- to be accretive to the company. i think now as we go into a different cycle, there may be some opportunities to expand our product lines and different ways we do business. so i think given the strength of our balance sheet and our performance and our earnings and our position in the marketplace, there could be some opportunities if there's a bit of a downturn.
jade rahmani -- keefe, bruyette and woods -- analyst
thanks very much for taking the question.

good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the first quarter 2022 arbor realty trust earnings conference call. [operator instructions] i would now like to turn the call over to your speaker today, paul elenio, chief financial officer. please go ahead.
paul elenio -- chief financial officer
ok. thank you, leo. good morning, everyone, and welcome to the quarterly earnings call for arbor realty trust. this morning, we'll discuss the results for the quarter ended march 31, 2022.
with me on the call today is ivan kaufman, our president and chief executive officer. before we begin, i need to inform you that statements made in this earnings call may be deemed forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties, including information about possible assumed future results of our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations, plans and objectives. these statements are based on beliefs, assumptions and expectations of our future performance, taking into account the information currently available to us. factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from arbor's expectations in these forward-looking statements are detailed in our sec reports.
listeners are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of today. arbor undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise these forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after today with the occurrences of unanticipated events. i'll now turn the call over to arbor's president and ceo, ivan kaufman. 
ivan kaufman -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, paul, and thanks to everyone for joining us on today's call. as you can see from this morning's press release, we had another tremendous quarter, which continues to demonstrate our unique ability to consistently deliver outsized returns through our diverse operating platform. as a result, we're able to once again increase our dividend to $0.38 a share. and this is our eighth consecutive quarterly dividend increase, representing 27% growth over that same time period.
we believe it's now more important than ever to continue to stress the many advantages of our unique business model, especially in light of the changing landscape of higher interest rates, continued inflation and the potential for another recessionary cycle on the horizon. we built a premium operating platform that is focused on the right asset classes with a very stable liability structures. we have a thriving balance sheet, gse, agency private label and single-family rental business as well as an industry-leading securitization platform as it allowed us to produce a long track record of exceptional performance of consistent earnings and dividend growth. and we can't emphasize enough the value of having an annuity-based business model with multiple products that produce many diverse income streams.
this has allowed us to consistently grow our earnings and dividends in all cycles while maintaining the lowest dividend ratio payout in the industry, creating a substantial cushion between our core earnings and dividends. there are significant differentiating factors from the rest of our peer group, most of which have a monoline business, have struggled to maintain their dividends and have very little upside for future dividend growth, especially considering an anticipated recessionary environment. and this is why we strongly believe that we're in a class by ourselves, and we should trade at a substantial premium at a much lower dividend yield than anyone else in our peer group. turning now to our first quarter performance.
as paul will discuss in more detail, our quarterly financial results were once again remarkable. we produced distributable earnings of $0.55 per share, which is well in excess of our current dividend, representing a payout ratio of around 70%. in our balance sheet business, we had another outstanding quarter. as one of the top multifamily balance sheet lenders in the industry, we continue to see opportunities for significant growth.
as a result, we grew our balance sheet loan book another 17% in the first quarter to $14.2 billion on $2.8 billion of new originations. we also have a very robust pipeline, which gives us great confidence in our ability to continue to meaningfully grow our loan book for the balance of the year. and again, these balance sheet loans create significant value for our platform as they are not only accretive to our current earnings and dividends, but also allow us to build a pipeline for two to three years of new gse/agency and private label loans that produce additional long-term dated income streams, ensuring the long-term growth of our platform and creating high-quality earnings and dividends for the future. we have consistently been a leader in the clo securitization market as our financing and high-quality balance sheet portfolio with the appropriate liability structures continues to be one of the key business strategies.
we were very successful in continuing to access the clo securitization market in the first quarter, closing another $2 billion clo. the utilization of these vehicles has contributed greatly to our success by allowing us to appropriately match-fund our assets with nonrecourse, non-mark-to-market, long-term debt and generate attractive levered on our capital. and again, we are very focused on the right side of our balance sheet with approximately 65% [inaudible] in our first quarter from the sharp increase in interest rates. however, more importantly, we are seeing a significant uptick in our pipeline as the market is adjusting to the changing rate environment, and we expect to be able to close the gap substantially by the end of the year and produce relatively similar agency volumes as compared to the prior year.
in fact, april's origination volume was much stronger with $475 million of loan closings. our gse/agency platform continues to offer premium value as it requires limited capital and generates significant, long-dated, predictable income streams and produces significant annual cash flow. additionally, our $27 billion gse/agency servicing portfolio, which has grown 6% in the last year, is mostly prepayment-protected and generates approximately $120 million a year in reoccurring cash flow. this is in addition to the strong gain on sale margins we continue to generate from our originations platform, which will continue to contribute greatly to our earnings and dividends.
and as we mentioned on our last call, we also closed our fourth private label securitization totaling $490 million in the first quarter, which continues to demonstrate the strength and diversity of our versatile lending platform and tremendous securitization expertise. we've also built a growing single-family rental platform with a comm pipeline well in excess of $1 billion, which makes us optimistic about our ability to continue to scale this business going forward. we're a leader in the build-to-rent space, which provides us with the opportunity to originate construction bridge and permanent loans in the same transaction. and again, like our balance sheet business, this platform provides us yet another path to future transactions that will produce additional long-dated income streams.
in summary, we had another tremendous quarter, allowing us to once again increase our dividend. we strategically built our platform with multiple products that produce many diverse income streams, which provides us with the future annuity of high-quality, long-dated reoccurring earnings. we're also the premier multifamily originator in this space, and we are invested in the right asset classes with very stable liability structures, which positions us extremely well to succeed in every market cycle and gives us great confidence in our ability to continue to significantly outperform our peers. i will now turn the call over to paul to take you through the financial results.
paul elenio -- chief financial officer
ok. thank you, ivan. as ivan mentioned, we had another exceptional quarter, producing distributable earnings of $93 million or $0.55 per share. these results translated into industry higher roes of approximately 18%, allowing us to once again increase our dividend for the eighth consecutive quarter to an annual run rate of $1.52 a share.
our financial results continue to benefit greatly from many aspects of our diverse annuity-based business model that allows us to produce multiple income streams from a single investment, giving us confidence in our ability to continue to generate high-quality, long-dated recurring earnings in the future. in our gse/agency business, we originated $761 million in gse loans and recorded $1.1 billion in gse loan sales in the first quarter. we generated margins on those gse loan sales of 1.39% in the first quarter compared to 1.52% in the fourth quarter. as we mentioned on our last call, with the change in the interest rate environment, we do expect margins to be more normalized in 2022 in the range we previously guided to of 1.30% to 1.50%, depending on the mix of our product.
we also recorded $15 million of mortgage servicing rights income related to $975 million of committed loans in the first quarter, representing an average msr rate of around 1.57% compared to 1.88% last quarter, mainly due to having a greater mix of fannie mae loans in the fourth quarter versus the first quarter, and those loans contain higher servicing fees. our servicing portfolio was approximately $27 billion on march 31, with a weighted average servicing fee of 44 basis points and has an estimated remaining life of nine years. this portfolio will continue to generate a predictable annuity of income going forward of around $120 million gross annually, which is relatively unchanged from last quarter due to the continued increased runoff in our portfolio. as a result of this runoff, prepayment fees related to certain loans that have prepayment protection provisions continue to be elevated with $16 million in prepayment fees received in the first quarter compared to $20 million in the fourth quarter.
in our balance sheet lending operation, we grew our portfolio another 17% to $14.2 billion in the first quarter on volume of $2.8 billion. our $14.2 billion investment portfolio had an all-in yield of 4.74% at march 31 compared to 4.62% at december 31, mainly due to increases in libor and sofr rates, largely offset by higher rates on runoff as compared to new originations during the quarter. the average balance in our core investments increased substantially to $13 billion this quarter from $10.5 billion last quarter, mainly due to significant growth we experienced in both the first and fourth quarters. the average yield on these investments was 4.86% for the first quarter compared to 5.03% for the fourth quarter, mainly due to higher interest rates on runoff as compared to originations in the first and fourth quarters, partially offset by the effect of higher sofr and libor rates in the first quarter, net of the impact of libor floors on our portfolio.
total debt on our core assets was approximately $12.9 billion at march 31, with an all-in debt cost of approximately 2.81%, which was up from debt cost of around 2.61% at december 31, mainly due to increased libor and sofr rates. the average balance in our debt facility was up to approximately $12 billion for the first quarter from $9.4 billion in the fourth quarter, mostly due to financing the growth in our portfolio. and the average cost of funds on our debt facility was flat at 2.65% for both the first and fourth quarters from slightly higher average interest rates, offset by reduced pricing from our clo vehicles and warehouse facilities. our overall net interest spreads in our core assets decreased to 2.21% this quarter compared to 2.38% last quarter, and our overall spot net interest spreads were also down to 1.93% at march 31 from 2.01% at december 31 due to yield compression on new originations as compared to runoff and from debt cost increasing more than asset yields as a result of rising interest rates and libor floors that are still in effect on certain loans in our portfolio.
however, it's important to note, as the current libor and sofr curves are predicted to continue to increase, any further increases in these rates will produce a net positive increase to our net interest income spreads on our balance sheet book due to rates being above the average libor floors in our portfolio. in fact, all things remaining equal, a 1% increase in rates would produce approximately $0.05 a share annually in additional earnings. additionally, as rates rise, we will begin to earn more income from the significant amount of escrow balances we have from our agency business and large balance sheet loan book, which will also increase our earnings going forward and is unique to our business model. that completes our prepared remarks for this morning, and i'll now turn it back to the operator to take any questions you may have at this time.

operator
thank you, sir. [operator instruction] and we'll take our first question from steve delaney with jmp securities. your line is open.
steve delaney -- jmp securities -- analyst
good morning, ivan and paul. good to be with you. now there's another excellent quarter. i did note the cautionary actions that you've taken in some of the remarks about not needing to push the envelope here, given the strength of the existing portfolio.
referring to ivan, your comment about no new clos at this point in time since they're so expanded in terms of spread. and then we, of course, noted the $300 million bridge loan sale, which is somewhat you i haven't noticed you guys selling structured loans that you've originated in previous times. so i guess first i'd like to know, am i correct in reading that those were not necessary steps that you're taking, but just things you're doing because you've already got a strong portfolio and it's no sense to to reach it at this point in time. can you comment on that?
paul elenio -- chief financial officer
yeah. let me address them separately. hello market requires a tremendous amount of expertise, which we have. and in running the type of business that we have, and i've said it on many calls, we manage our clo debt relative to outstanding debt in certain percentages.
and in our lowest 50 our high 75 in terms of percentage is a lot of debt to total debt. we're at 70% or roughly right now. if you're watching the market, you have many of our competitors trying to access the clo debt that are out of balance relative to their bank loans to the sale of debt and are executing to horrendous levels on profitable levels. my comment is basically that we don't need to access a lot of debt.
we the right proportions. we have these embedded low cost structures in place that give us a huge competitive advantage. so we're sitting back and saying, we're the last one. to get the best execution in the market on $1 billion sale of that.
we're not in a position where we're forced to reassess that. so we're in one of the best positions in the market. so that's kind of where that comment or narrative was was based toward.
steve delaney -- jmp securities -- analyst
yeah, that's helpful.
paul elenio -- chief financial officer
yeah. if you follow the people who have had to execute, they've had to lock in returns that are just unacceptable. but that's the way it is. so we're in a great position and we're very proud of that.
steve delaney -- jmp securities -- analyst
to your point there, your may clo, you were able to execute it 236 over sofr. and we just noticed earlier this week a june clo multifamily clo that was priced it to 280 to 450 basis points above. so obviously that is the case and i can understand why you are pushing up toward 300 over it's not economic to consider that at this time.
paul elenio -- chief financial officer
it's not only not economic, but you're lacking in other liability structures and it's stuck with them for a while. you don't have to do it. don't do it.
steve delaney -- jmp securities -- analyst
how you go up your of your 8 billion in clo debt currently how much of that on a percentage basis is still in the reinvestment period?
paul elenio -- chief financial officer
all of it is. all of it has an open reinvest. [inaudible] run off all over the next year to run down.
steve delaney -- jmp securities -- analyst
i think our first one tips off  in november. which will be fully allocated with loans. and you got the benefit of that and they tip off over a period of time. so we're managing them, maximizing them.
and keep in mind, i think the average liability costs in that or what, paul, in the160's?
paul elenio -- chief financial officer
for that particular clo or in total?
steve delaney -- jmp securities -- analyst
in total.
paul elenio -- chief financial officer
in total, yeah. as i said in my commentary, were 163 over blended and that's even with the 230 clo, we just did [inaudible] so we've got really low cost liabilities locked in. as ivan said, every one of them has replenishment ability. still one of them that's a small clo burns off in november.
and the rest are, you know, late 23, 24. so we've got a lot of runway here to utilize that low cost to those low cost locked in vehicles to really enhance or meaningfully enhance our returns.
steve delaney -- jmp securities -- analyst
yeah. that makes perfect sense. yeah, go ahead. i'm sorry.
paul elenio -- chief financial officer
jumping to the next comment about selling some of our loans. we always like to test the market and see what the different flexibility levels are and have the right levers to generate liquidity when we want to generate it. and doing this loan sale was a great opportunity for us because we tested the market on selling our collateral. we retain service and retain a majority of our fees.
we're able to recycle close to $100 million, i think it was $90 million a capital, and they'll know that that's another way to generate liquidity we want to and still maintain a significant part of our economics. most importantly, for a firm like us, retaining the servicing, getting a servicing fee, and staying facing with our client, and then potentially creating an agency loan on the back end. so fit our model very very well. now, we've been preparing for this recession.
for the last year, we've done many many things, including this, to make sure that we're adequately positioned, given where we are today and even if there's going to be another shoe to drop, whether it does or not, to make sure that the firm has adequate liquidity to be offensive, not defensive. and these are all the moves that we've taken and put in place to get ourselves in the position we are.
steve delaney -- jmp securities -- analyst
fantastic. i guess that could have also been structured as a senior participation, couldn't it, depending on who the buyer is.
paul elenio -- chief financial officer
yeah, but there are so many different ways to do it. so yes, testing the waters, we've got on our balance sheet so well, we've done a great job, we've used a lot of capital. and it was just another way for us to figure out if we want more capital at any point in time. [inaudible]
steve delaney -- jmp securities -- analyst
thank you both for the comments.
operator
thank you. our next question will come from richard shane with j.p. morgan. your line is open.
richard shane -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
hey, guys. thanks for taking my question this morning. i'm just curious, in the current environment, with the movement in collateral values, with potential delays related to supply chain and labor shortages in terms of timelines on construction. and finally, any sort of vacancy absorption.
is it realistic that we will see paper or loans stay on the balance sheet longer before they are migrated for agency sale?
ivan kaufman -- president and chief executive officer
so, there's two ways to look at that. we actually think on our balance sheet there could be a facilitation agency execution. because of the way the yield curve is. if people were borrowing 350 over 400 over.
[inaudible] has risen to a level of with a bar cluster of 6%. you can execute on to agency, as, you know, maybe 150 to 175 over the ten year you have kind of an inverted yield curve. so we're seeing a lot of people we're talking for them to convert from off the balance sheet from a 6%, 5.5% to 6% pay rate would potentially move up and sofr and more risks and cap costs into a ten year fixed rate of one quarter four and a half. so for those products that were put on a year ago, year and a half ago, i think we're going to see some real movement which is going to help maintain our agency volumes.
that's on that side of the point. and to our surprise, you have a ten year 275. that's a pretty low. so i think we'll see that happen maybe a little quicker than we thought.
on the new construction side. we've been talking to our clients over the last 12 months, because their costs were up 30%. so even though rents have risen well above historical levels, you know, historically, 3% to 5%, now you're seeing 10 to 20%. so some of those cost increases were offset by rent increases.
we've actually advised a lot of our clients to slow their construction, hold off. and they've done that. and now they're saying costs come back into line. i think there'll be a little bit of a delay with people on their construction timelines because they were waiting for costs to come into line.
but that's on a new construction site. so i think people's construction is going to be 6 to 9 months behind schedule. their interest costs are going to be up a little bit, but their costs are going to be back in line. so that'll be a little slower.
richard shane -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
that's great. it's actually very helpful. both parts of that answer are and i apologize, i think we've asked this before, but given the floating rate nature of the loans, do you require borrowers to take any interest rate protection in the form of caps.
ivan kaufman -- president and chief executive officer
yes. our loans require caps. some of them have spring caps. most of the loans have a lot of caps.
and, of course, rates for moving up all these caps for, f they weren't in place, they were being put in place and that was the whole process. so a majority of our loans, a significant supermajority of volumes, have those caps.
richard shane -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
ok. thank you so much, guys.
operator
thank you. our next question will come from stephen laws with raymond james. your line is open.
stephen laws -- raymond james -- analyst
hi. good morning. well, to follow up on steve delaney's question from clo, but as older loans pay off and you're able to replenish those vehicles with with new production, how much incremental spread pickup is there on the new loans you're putting into those facilities?
ivan kaufman -- president and chief executive officer
so let me give a little bit of an outlook, and i think this will be helpful. we have had, i think, eight price increases in the last nine months on our bridge pricing. that is it then over a period of time. so we think that our bridge pricing, which was a one point time, $300 to $350 overs range, is now $450, almost a full point.
so as loans pay off in those vehicles, we replace them with higher coupons. and paul, you can really talk more about the math at this point.
paul elenio -- chief financial officer
yeah. so i think that's excellent color. and see, what we're seeing is that we've been targeting over the last year as things were quite competitive somewhere 10%, 11%, 11% returns, maybe -12$0. in the second quarter $2 billion we originate we actually got a 12% return on i think we got just under 11% in the first quarter.
and what i either and i was talking about the other day was the math is simple. when we got this 163 over spread clo, and we're now price in deals at 4 to 450 over, one loans are paying off there with 3 350 over. and when we originate new loans at 4 50 over and putting them in those low cost vehicles, those returns can meaningfully move. you could you can end up from an 11% to 12% to 14% to a 15%.
and we're starting to see that migration now in the new product. and that's why in ivan's commentary, we talked about being very selective in our loans going forward and really having more normalized volumes going forward in our balance sheet business. for instance, we think we originated we're about to close out july. we did about 230 million of new production in july.
bridge wise, we have about 120 million a lower, but more meaningfully than the size of the number is that 230 is going to be higher credit quality and wider spreads and we're going to replace that into vehicles and really drive up the returns pretty meaningfully.
ivan kaufman -- president and chief executive officer
and i think with that in mind, our outlook for the balance of the year is to try and manage our production to match our run off. and, you know, we're going to try and take advantage of these low cost vehicles and not have to access the loan market in a dislocated environment and try and maintain our balance sheet at a level that is high at this point in time.
stephen laws -- raymond james -- analyst
appreciate the color, the math there's certainly powerful things turned over. paul, i wanted to follow up on the repayment fees. i think you said 15 million this quarter. that was roughly flat from 16 million.
what are your expectations around that going forward? just kind of given the moves and everything we saw in the second quarter, kind of how should we think. about what that will be on, go forward basis.
paul elenio -- chief financial officer
yeah, so a couple of things and we've talked about this for several quarters, sephen, and it's been surprising, ivan, and i have to say that you have two factors, right? we saw about a billion to run off in our servicing book in the second quarter. that was up from about a $1 billion in the first quarter. fees were was somewhat flat, $16 to $15 million. but we've been talking internally, sales will certainly start to slow.
right, if the market is changing. in fact, that july i can give you some color. we collected $1.5 million fees in july on $250 million. so if that's any indication of what's to come, the numbers will be significantly down and they'll be significantly down for two reasons.
one, sales volume is going to slow and already has started to in july and to as rates rise with so forth. sitting at 230 in labor, sitting at 237 year maintenance is a product of rates, right? so as rates rise, your maintenance turns to go down and sometimes even go away. but the good news is we'll be able to retain that in our portfolio and clip that servicing coupon, which is a long term annuity that we love. so i do expect sales to decline significantly and i do expect prepayment fees to come down significantly.
having said that, because of the size of our book, we're still going to have some of those fees. and again, 1.5 in july. if you annualize that, maybe it's 4.5, or i don't know what the number is, but it's not $15 million going forward. 
stephen laws -- raymond james -- analyst
that's helpful. paul, thanks for the color in quantifying that course. appreciate your time this morning. no problem.
operator
our next question will come from jade rahmani with kbw. your line is open.
jade rahmani -- keefe, bruyette and woods -- analyst
thank you very much. considering the growth in the balance sheet portfolio, you all achieved the bridge loan portfolio over the last several quarters and the current change in valuations in real estate. how are you feeling about the credit quality of the existing portfolio and the outlook there?
ivan kaufman -- president and chief executive officer
i think, what i mentioned earlier, jade, that we had eight price increases over the last nine months commensurate with that. we also adjusted our underwriting standards step by step by step. we've adjusted them by having lower ltv. i think our ltv from nine months ago till now on a originations basis probably seven percentage points less.
we've adjusted our exit tests because as we've talked on this call, when we do a bridge loan, every bridge loan is underwritten to agency execution and final take out. so we kept adjusting those underwriting standards. so we feel very comfortable with the books that we've put on over the last nine months. in addition, a lot of our loans have, you know, a lot of different, you know, rebalance and test that have good structural enhancements.
so we're real comfortable with what we have in place, and the way we manage our book, and the features on them, and our asset management capability. so, we've begun to go through our portfolio. we've begun to work with our borrowers, and making sure that they have, you know, adequate interest reserves and replenishments to take into consideration the rise in interest rates and, you know, where we're comfortable with the way we're running our book.
jade rahmani -- keefe, bruyette and woods -- analyst
thanks very much. thanks very much for that. and on the multifamily rent growth side, it seems that rents are continuing to be very robust in the market across the servicing portfolio and the bridge loan portfolio in your surveillance, are you seeing continued strong rent growth and are you seeing the transitional loans, those projects hit their business plans?
ivan kaufman -- president and chief executive officer
i think that the growth so far exceeded all of our underwriting and our expectations. i mean, you're seeing 10% to 20% rent growth. you're seeing people not having to use their renovation dollars to turn their units and still get their rent growth. so the rent growth story is still strong.
i would put a caution on that, a little different than the rest of the marketplace, having been through a lot of cycles. i think if you're looking at a recession  we're going to a lower rent growth going forward, we're also going to a little bit higher an economic vacancy. so we're still optimistic about what's in the portfolio in the right roles, but we are proceeding with some level of caution for 2023 with, you know, probably flat 3% rent growth and, you know, 1 to 2 points higher in economic vacancy. that's how we're looking at our 2023.
jade rahmani -- keefe, bruyette and woods -- analyst
and under that scenario, what kind of delinquency rates or default rates does that imply? anything, you know, material nominal.
ivan kaufman -- president and chief executive officer
not anything, not significant, not anything that we can't handle and not anything that's not within our capital projections.
jade rahmani -- keefe, bruyette and woods -- analyst
and so far, the color that we've gotten from other mortgage rates as well as diversified rates recover is a decline in values somewhere in the 5% to 10% range and increase in cap rates somewhere in perhaps the 30 to 60 basis point range. do you concur with that or think that's maybe overly optimistic?
ivan kaufman -- president and chief executive officer
i think that's overly optimistic. i think that values are all focused on the marketplace in a lot of areas on the market and the types of collateral. and i think cap rates are up 50 basis points is probably the right level and low mark is probably 75. so we are aware a lot of more conservative and you know, we've been a lot more conservative, a lot more dissipation of the slowdown in the market began 9 to 12 months ago.
so recently we've seen the other stuff that.
jade rahmani -- keefe, bruyette and woods -- analyst
thanks very much. lastly, when you look at the bond market, the treasury market is behaving,binterestingly, and i think people are surprised by how low, yields are, particularly just, say, the ten year treasury. are there rates that you look at that are more indicative, maybe a proxy versus the high yield bond market or where cmbs is trading for clos what do you think we should be focused on to gauge the health of the commercial real estate finance markets?
ivan kaufman -- president and chief executive officer
well, you know, right now. if you're looking at the liquidity in the cmbs market and the sale on market, it's taken a significant, change. and as we said, we wouldn't want to execute clo market today. i'm not sure whether it gets worse before it gets better.
we're not thinking the clo on market is something we would execute until at least for another 6 to 9 months. we'd have to see triple a on this clo market get down to below two for us to feel attractive, and that would be kind of a return to some normalcy. so the cmbs market, as you know, is not something that one would want to execute into in the near term. so we'll see over the next 3 to 6 months if they return to a normalized level.
these are not normalized levels.
jade rahmani -- keefe, bruyette and woods -- analyst
and do you think acquiring securities is interesting, acquiring triple a's or other pieces of the capital stack and some of these still deals?
ivan kaufman -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. listen, we'd love to be in a position on something we'll explore as to whether we can put together some funds to start to acquire subordinate classes. and this fellow market where the ability to understand the underlying assets better than most. as well as the structures.
so we think somebody somewhere in their classes are trading, you know, they went off at 400 over 350 over. you can probably buy them at, you know, 800. and we think that's that's a good trade. it's something that we'd love to do as a firm.
jade rahmani -- keefe, bruyette and woods -- analyst
thanks very much. well, certainly in the past, arbor has been creative at putting together opportunistic strategy. so look forward to seeing that. thanks a lot.
operator
thank you. our next question will come from crispin love with piper sandler. your line is open.
crispin love -- piper sandler -- analyst
thank you. good morning. congrats on a great quarter here. first one on just core expenses.
core expenses looks to be very well contained during the quarter. so i'm curious if there's anything that you did proactively here to keep them under control, especially on the compensation side or if there's any other areas to call out.
paul elenio -- chief financial officer
so let me just do it at a high level. and then maybe if i want to chime in, you can. so you have to look at the numbers comparatively, crispin. so yeah, last quarter i think we put up about $57 million in comp in g&a combined this quarter to $57.
but there's some some variable items in there that you've got to strip out and kind of compare. so commissions were, you know, about $6.5 million last quarter. they were about %5 million this quarter sat a million and a half change. and that's variable based on where volumes are.
obviously, we had more sale volume last quarter on the agency side because of an apl trade that we were able to get off. and then stock stock comp was $6 million last quarter and is only $3 million this quarter because there are a lot of onetime grants that we give to our employees in march of the year as part of their complex. and when you strip all that out comp and g&a came in about $44 million this quarter, and it came in about $46 million last quarter without those variable items. so it is down $2 million.
most of that is because of the [inaudible] the first quarter is always a little bit elevated because you have the [inaudible] cap that you've got to hit on the bonuses for the executives. and then that comes down. but having said all that, i think we've done a really good job of maintaining our staff, maintaining our cost. we've been preparing for the cycle for some time.
and although i guided to probably have in cartagena up 15% on last quarter's call year over year, i think it's more like 10% now and maybe we'll even do better than that. but yeah, we've done a good job of making sure that we're only growing our staff in the areas that we think are meaningful, the asset management side, the servicing side, and that's the reason the numbers are where they are.
crispin love -- piper sandler -- analyst
ok. great. thanks.
ivan kaufman -- president and chief executive officer
just to comment on that, we're in a very different environment than we were a year or two years ago, where this industry was inundated with massive volumes and. everybody have to do what they can to retain their staff as well as attract staff. and costs were getting out of control. so clearly there were outsized things that were not in the normal course of business, but, volumes were big enough to offset that.
i think we're going into a more normalized environment. i think you'll see us being in a very good position. do a better job at, managing our costs, and our productivity. so.
we look forward to getting back to normal in that sense.
crispin love -- piper sandler -- analyst
great. thank you, ivan. that all helpful. and then i appreciate your commentary earlier on originations in the structured business.
i'm just curious and get a little bit of a finer point on it. so if i kind of start with the second quarter, that $2.05 billion kind of divided by 3 is about 680 per month, which was a little bit below your 800 that you talked about last quarter. so first, i'm just curious on how originations trended through the quarter. and then in that $230 million that you talked about for july kind of a third kind of jumping off point for for the next few quarters.
ivan kaufman -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. i want to give a little color and maybe this will help on the credit conversation as well. some of the comments were geared toward us. we had a very, very large pipeline, you know, going in to the last, you know, 3 to 4 months.
um, and we were scheduled to probably cause, you know, $750 to $1 billion a month. a pipeline was probably one of the larger points. and we took a extraordinarily active approach with arbors, letting them know that their loans had to be resized. because,, rates had gone up.
guys had adjusted. you know, where we're a lender, we're not a broker, and we own the risk on our loans. we worked very hard with the bars to either go back and get a price reduction or recapitalize our loans with, you know, anywhere between five and 10% more. as a result of that, we had, a massive fallout in the pipeline because they understood what our guidance and values were different than what they went to contract under.
so we were able to really shrink the number of loans that we needed to close to a very, very considerable pace, 50% even more. my comment in terms of my outlook going forward is that we're expecting anywhere between on the low side, $100 million a run off per month of $400 million on the high side. what kind of portfolio. so, you know, more normalized 2 to 300 million of runoff a month.
that's probably the level in which we will look to originate for the balance of the year. we think it's a healthy level and we think. that's a level that's appropriate for our capital and still maintain a leading position as a balance sheet originator and. so that's how i would look at the outlook at the present time, given the environment.
that, of course, could change, but that's on to the current scenario. paul, you want to give any color on that?
paul elenio -- chief financial officer
that's exactly \what we're doing, because we're not where we came in to 34 july 120 million, a runoff with a little light runoff in july. but ivan's right, where we're estimating anywhere $2 to $300 million a month in british production, but we're going to be managing that against our runoff to keep our portfolio kind of constant, to maybe growing a little bit. and things can change. but that's that's our run rate right now.
crispin love -- piper sandler -- analyst
great. thank you. that's all really helpful. kind of the idea is you're looking more.
maintaining the portfolio here, just given the environment rather than increasing it like you have.
ivan kaufman -- president and chief executive officer
it and recycle it into higher rate loans as well. that's very important. so while while the portfolio may not grow substantially for the balance of the year, the levered returns will grow because we're putting our capital out at higher returns and financing them in these well, of course, vehicles we have that really drive up that returns.
operator
thank you. i'd now like to hand the call back over to mr. ivan kaufman for any closing or additional remarks by.

ok. thank you, chelsea, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to the quarterly earnings call for arbor realty trust. this morning we'll discuss the results of the quarter ended june 30th, 2022. with me on the call today is ivan kaufman, our president, and chief executive officer.

although undertakes no obligation to publicly update, or revise these forward-looking statements to reflect events, or circumstances after today or the occurrence of unanticipated events. i will now turn the call over to our president and ceo, ivan kaufman. 
ivan kaufman -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, paul. and thanks to everyone for joining us on today's call. as you can see from this morning's press release, we had another tremendous quarter, including producing earnings that were once again well in excess of our dividend. as a result, we're able to increase our dividend to $0.39 a share.
and this is our 9th consecutive quarterly dividend increase representing 3% growth over that time period, all wait while maintaining a lowest dividend payout ratio in the industry. as we have mentioned many times, a diverse business model offers several strategic advantages, which is something that needs to be emphasized, especially given the recessionary environment. we have built a premium operating platform that is focused on the right asset classes with very stable liability structures, including over $8 billion in non-recourse, non-mark to market [inaudible], which requires approximately 70% of our outstanding secured indebtedness with pricing that is well below the current market. we also have a thriving balance sheet, gsa agency, and single family rental business that produces many diverse income streams, which has allowed us to consistently grow our earnings and dividends in all cycles.
we remain continually keenly focused on maintaining a strong liquidity position with currently around $500 million in cash and liquidity on hand, in addition to roughly $450 million of deployable cash and [inaudible] all vehicles. this liquidity will provide us with the unique ability to maintain, remain offensive and take advantage of the many opportunities that will exist during this economic downturn to generate superior returns on our capital. additionally, we have successfully operated our business through multiple cycles, and have a very seasoned experienced as a management team that positions us exceptionally well to succeed in this cycle as well. these are significant differentiating factors from the rest of our peer group, most of which have [inaudible] businesses that struggle to maintain their dividend, and lack the experience and expertise to manage through this downturn.
and this is why we believe we're superbly in positioned in a class by ourselves, and should trade a substantial premium at a much lower dividend yield than anyone in our peer group. turning now to our second quarter, as paul will discuss in more detail. our quarterly financial results were once again remarkable. we produced distributable earnings of $0.52 per share, which is well in excess of our current dividend representing a payout ratio of around 75%.
our financial results will also benefit greatly from rising interest rates, which will significantly increase the net interest income on our floating rate loan book, as well as earnings on our fiscal balances. and clearly, with this extremely low payout ratio and a strong earnings outlook, we are uniquely positioned as one of the only companies in our phase that can potentially continue to raise our dividend. in a balance sheet lending business, we had another strong quarter. as one of the top multifamily lenders in the industry, we we're able to grow our balance sheet loan book another 6% in the second quarter to $15 billion on $2.05 billion of loan originations.
we also continue to maintain a strong pipeline. i will be very selective with our originations for the second half of the year given the anticipated market slowdown. this will result in us producing more normalized volumes for the balance of the year, with superior quieter quality and higher spreads. in fact, as i mentioned earlier, we are heavily focused on maintaining a strong liquidity position to be able to take advantage of the many accretive opportunities we think will exist to garner premium yields on our capital.
as result, we recently decided to sell 300 million of multifamily bridge loans, which generated $90 million of fresh capital. we also retained a portion of the upfront origination fees, and all of the potential exit fees, as well as a 12.5 basis point servicing fee, and control all the take out of each loan, which is vital to our business strategy, as these balance sheet loans provide us with a pipeline for 2 to 3 years of new gse agency loans, and produce additional long dated income streams. we've consistently been a leader in the sale of securitization market. the utilization of these vehicles has contributed greatly to our success by allowing us to appropriate match fund our assets with non-recourse, non-mark to market long-term debt, and generate attractive levered returns on our capital.
in the second quarter we closed another 1 billion clo, with superior execution in a very challenging market, which clearly demonstrates our strong track record, brand recognition, portfolio quality, and securitization expertise. and with approximately 70% of our total debt outstanding clos, we're extremely well positioned and have no need to further access the clo market in this dislocated environment. we also have replenishment features and pricing that are well below the car market in these vehicles that will allow us to recycle capital from our run off into higher yielding assets in today's environment and meaningfully increase 11 returns. and gse agency and private label programs we originated $1.2 billion of loans in the second quarter.
we also have a robust pipeline which will give us confidence in our ability to produce consistent volumes for the rest of the year. our gse agency platform continues to offer a premium value as it requires limited capital and generates significant, long dated, predictable income streams, and produces significant annual cash flow. additionally, our 27 billion gse agencies service and portfolio is mostly prepayment protected, and generates approximately $117 million a year in reoccurring cash flow. this is in addition to the strong gain on sale margins we generate from our origination platform, and a significant increase in earnings on our [inaudible] balances that we're experiencing as interest rates continue to rise, which is unique to our platform, and will continue to greatly enhance our earnings and dividends.
in summary, we had another tremendous quarter. allow us to once again increase our dividend. we strategically built our platform to operate successfully in all cycles with multiple products that produced many diverse income streams, providing us with a future annuity of high quality, long dated reoccurring earnings. we are also the premium multifamily originator in this phase, and are invested in the right asset classes with very stable liability structures and a well capitalized, which positions us extremely well to succeed in this environment, and continue to significantly outperform our peers.
i will now turn the call over to paul to take you to our financial results.
paul elenio -- chief financial officer
ok. thank you. and as i mentioned, we have another exceptional quarter producing distributable items of $94 million or $0.52 per share. these results translated into industry high release again of approximately 17%, allowing us to once again increase our dividend for the 9th consecutive quarter to an annual run rate of $1.50 a share.
as i mentioned earlier, we made a strategic decision to sell some of our loans in order to bolster our liquidity and lending capacity. in the second quarter, we liquidated $110 million position we had in the construction project, generating $65 million of fresh capital, and recorded a gaap loss of approximately $9.2 million. we did retain the ability to recover up $2.8 million loss in the future based on certain performance metrics. this loss was largely offset by two loans that paid off in full in the second quarter, which we previously had $2.7 million, a long loss reserves on that we ended up recovering.
and from the disposition of an asset in the second quarter related to one of our unconsolidated equity investments that resulted in a $6 million income pickup to us. additionally, we closed on the sale of approximately 300 million of multifamily loans yesterday at park, generating an additional $90 million a cash. recorded small gaap loss in the second quarter on the sale of approximately $2 million as a portion of the origination fees we collected that were passed along to the buyer, have been accreted into income in the past, and needed to be reversed. as part of the sale, we did retain a 12.5 basis point annual servicing fee, which will increase our servicing annuity going forward by roughly $400 thousand a year.
in addition to any exit fee income, we may receive when these loans pay off. in our gse agency business, we originated $1.2 billion of gse loans, and recorded $1 billion in gse loan sales in the second quarter. we generated margins on our gse loan sales of 1.59% in the second quarter, which was up from 1.39% in the first quarter, mainly due to a greater percentage of fha loan sales, which had a much higher margin. we also recorded $17.6 million of mortgage servicing rights income, related to $1.2 billion of committed loans in the second quarter, representing an average msr rate of around 1.48% compared to 1.57% last quarter, mostly due to a greater mix of larger loans in the second quarter that contained lower servicing fees.
our servicing portfolio was approximately $27 billion on june 30th, with a weighted average servicing fee of 44 basis points and as an estimated remaining life of nine years. this portfolio will continue to generate a predictable annuity of income going forward of around $117 million gross annually, which is down slightly from last quarter due to increased runoff on our portfolio from extensive sale activity as a result of the current market conditions. as a result of this runoff, prepayments for fees related to certain loans, our prepayment protection provisions continue to be elevated with $15 million of prepayment fees received in the second quarter, compared to $16 million in the first quarter. in our balance sheet lending operation, we grew up portfolio another 6% to $15 billion in the second quarter on $2 billion of new originations, our $15 billion investment portfolio had an all in yield of 5.2% at june 30th, compared to 4.74% at march 31st, mainly due to significant increases in labor and soft rates, which is partially offset by higher rates on runoff as compared to new originations during the quarter.
the average balance in our core investments increased to $14.6 billion this quarter from $13 billion last quarter, mainly due to the significant growth we experienced in both the first and second quarters. the average yield on these investments was 5.26% for the second quarter, compared to 4.86% for the first quarter due to increases in sofr and libor rate, which is partially offset by higher interest rates on runoff as compared to originations in the first and second quarters. total debt on our core assets was approximately $13.8 billion at june 30th, with an all in debt costs of approximately 4%, which was up from a debt cost of around 2.81% at march 31st, again mainly due to increased libor and sofr rates. the average balance on our debt facilities is up to approximately $13.4 billion for the second quarter, from $12 billion for the first quarter, mostly due to financing the growth in our portfolio.
and the average cost of funds in our debt facilities was 3.10% for the second quarter, compared to 2.65% for the first quarter, primarily due to increases in the benchmark index rates in the second quarter. our overall net issue spreads on our core assets decreased slightly to 2.16% this quarter, compared to 2.21% last quarter. and our overall spot net interest spreads were down slightly as well to 1.82% at june 30th from 1.93% at march 31st, mostly due to yield compression on newer originations as compared to last. net interest income.
on the other hand, on a balance sheet loan book increased $10.8 million this quarter from portfolio growth and significant increases in libor and sofr rates during the quarter. and as the current line in sofr curves are predicted to continue to increase, it's very important to note that any further increases in these rates will continue to increase the net interest income spreads on a floating rate loan book. in fact, all things remaining equal, a 1% increase in rates would produce approximately $0.10 a share annually in additional earnings. additionally, as we mentioned earlier, we have $8 billion of clo debt outstanding in average pricing of 163 older, which is well below the current market and will allow us to meaningfully increase the level of returns on our balance sheet loan originations.
and lastly, as rates rise, we will also continue to earn significantly more income from the large amount of [inaudible] balances we have, from our agency build business and balance sheet loan book. these earnings will grow substantially as we have approximately $2 billion [inaudible] balances that are now earning in excess of 1% or around $25 million annually, effective mid-july, which is up significantly from a run rate of approximately 10 million annually at 331 2022. and as i mentioned earlier, these features are unique to our business model, giving us confidence in our ability to continue to generate high quality, long dated, recurring earnings in the future. that completes our prepared remarks for this morning.
and i'll now turn it back to the operator to take any questions you may have this time. chelsea.
