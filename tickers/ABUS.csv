[operator instructions] and your first question ed arce with h. c. wainwright.
ed arce -- h.c. wainwright -- analyst
great. good morning, and thanks for taking my questions. congrats on a productive year. a couple questions from me.
you mentioned with 729, two trials that you're intending to start, i think you said in the second half of the year, sort of combination trials. i'm wondering if you could give us a little more detail on the intended design with those. in particular, have you chosen one or more doses, perhaps the 60- or 90-milligram? at least, in one of those committed to a dosing interval, i know that you're very interested in going with once every 12 weeks. and any other sort of details around the trial designs there would be helpful.
thank you.
bill collier -- president and chief executive officer
thank you for the question, ed. just a couple of comments, and then i'll let gaston answer with any additional detail. i mean, i think what we're trying to communicate today is our confidence in 729 going forward, where, in total, we will kick off three phase 2 studies this year. the first one, obviously, being the assembly study, which has initiated.
we did that press release last week. and then today, we're talking about an additional two phase 2 combination studies. we've not released too much detail about those at this stage. but i think you can see that by kicking off three phase 2 studies, we clearly feel very confident about 729 moving forward.
and with that, let me hand it over to gaston.
gaston picchio -- chief development officer
yes. thanks, bill, and thanks, ed, for the question. so as bill explained, we haven't released the details at this point of what those two additional phase 2 studies may look like. but obviously, we are exploring potential combinations with both investigational and other approved agents and, obviously, try to exceed the number of drugs there by two.
so we're looking at three or more drugs in those studies. in terms of the dosing schedule, as you may already know, we are confident enough, based on the data that we presented toward the end of last year to use the every-eight-weeks in the phase 2 in collaboration with assembly. so i'll just reiterate what was included, ed, in the press release, announced recently by assembly on the start of the screening of the study that the dosing of ab-729 would include 60-milligram dose every eight weeks. so we're waiting, obviously, for the results of the other cohorts, especially the every-12-weeks, to decide whether it may be also worth exploring a dosing frequency of every 12, but that data is pending.
ed arce -- h.c. wainwright -- analyst
great. that's helpful. and then just one other question from me. just to remind us, for this year, are you expecting to release any new data of results from any ongoing studies?
bill collier -- president and chief executive officer
yes. so this is bill. and i will refer everyone to the last slide in our corporate deck, which was refreshed and updated, is on our website, went up this morning. there we list out what we expect to deliver this year.
so we're talking about additional data from the 60-milligram multi-dose cohorts every four and every eight weeks in the first half, additional data from the 90-milligram multi-dose eight-week cohort in the first half, the 90-milligram 12-week data in the second half. we also expect to have some 90-milligram multi-dose eight-week dosing interval in hbv dna positive subjects in the first half. i've already mentioned the two phase 2 clinical studies we hope to kick off in the second half. and then as we already mentioned on this call, we expect to kick off the 836 phase 1a/1b clinical study in the first half of the year.
ed arce -- h.c. wainwright -- analyst
great. thank you, bill. sounds like you have your hands full this year with a lot of clinical activity.
bill collier -- president and chief executive officer
we do.
ed arce -- h.c. wainwright -- analyst
thanks. thank you, guys, for the questions.
bill collier -- president and chief executive officer
right. operator, do we have additional questions?
operator
your next question comes from brian skorney with baird.
brian skorney -- baird -- analyst
hey, good morning, everyone. thank you for taking my questions. i guess more of a big-picture, long-term question on 729. i mean, we have a pretty good idea in terms of early data, the impact that rnai interference targeting can have on some of the biomarkers.
but as you kind of think about long-term development plan, what sort of data would you be looking to achieve on a biomarker basis to challenge patients to complete antiviral therapy withdrawal? and i mean, what sort of stopping criteria do you think are reasonable to use?
bill collier -- president and chief executive officer
good question. thank you very much. maybe mike and gaston, gaston first, perhaps, to answer that one. i mean, we're talking hypothetically here because we have no plans at the moment to get into this.
but gaston?
gaston picchio -- chief development officer
yes. thank you, brian. in terms of -- let me just go to the -- summarize what we've seen with rnai so far. so i think rnai have been shown to, obviously, lower s-antigen also, hbv rna core-related antigen, e-antigen.
and i think we probably have one of the most robust data showing that 729 can also reduce hbv dna in a very robust and rapid way. so the big question, i mean, obviously, is going to be should we continue treating and wait until s-antigen becomes undetectable, or can we before stop -- consider stopping patients, or could we stop patients earlier and see whether the immune system has sufficiently reawakened to continue the job and clear all s-antigens and obviously infect hepatocytes and so forth? and that's a question obviously that i don't think anyone has answered so far. what is clear, based on the assembly study, is that stopping patients with undetectable hbv rna and hbv dna, even with a more sensitive assay, was not sufficient to achieve functional cure, defined as loss of s-antigen six months after end of therapy. so they saw relapse very quickly.
so in that sense, obviously, that study did not include an rnai agent. and lowering s-antigen may favorably impact the immune system in such a way that upon stopping therapy, things may look a little bit different. but really, this is all speculation because nobody has stopped all therapies in rnai subjects and see after a long dosing period of at least a year, in combination with other agents and see what happens. so we may be in a position to do that later this year in some of our cohorts and see what the turnout is.
but i can't give you a definitive answer what's going to happen. but certainly, that's one of the most important questions in the field right now.
brian skorney -- baird -- analyst
right. thank you.
bill collier -- president and chief executive officer
and, gaston, do you want to just briefly mention because on our corporate deck on our slides, we do show how many subjects get below either 100 or 10 international units per ml for surface antigen. do you just want to comment on those numbers?
gaston picchio -- chief development officer
yes. so, yes, that's a great point. as you know, in some countries in asia, especially, there's a tendency for subjects who have been on nuc therapy for a number of years, either s-antigen drops below 100 to actually stop the nuc and follow them very closely. and in some occasions, the subjects who achieve less than 100, which is a threshold that's used, i would say, clinically, most frequently, they tend to seroconvert, so lose s-antigen and some of them even develop anti-s-antibodies, which is the definition of functional cure.
so in our studies, we have pretty much, so far, the vast majority, like six out of seven have reached less than 100 in cohort e and even a couple of them have reached less than 10. so the big question is: in the setting of one year of duration of therapy, is that going to be sufficient? so these are questions that obviously, we're trying to decide whether achieving s-antigen below those thresholds, which have shown in other instances to be clinically relevant, would they be equally relevant toward functional cure when using rnai agents, in this case, ab-729. so this is still evolving. we're evolving our thinking and trying to decide what would be the best approach to stopping therapy in patients who have received at least one year of ab-729 combination with nuc.
but those are some encouraging pieces of information that a large proportion of these have already crossed that 100 iu per ml threshold.
brian skorney -- baird -- analyst
great. thank you.
operator
your next question comes from mayank mamtani with b. riley.
mayank mamtani -- b. riley fbr -- analyst
thanks, team, for taking my question, and congrats on the progress. so maybe on the same line of thinking on the triple therapy, just two things stood out to me that you are doing an open-label study, and also the number of subjects 60, just looking at other trials, look different. so i'm just curious how you think about data disclosures here. and again, the off-treatment cure rate that's specifically your program, but also, like as we look externally, there are different approaches, core/capsid inhibitor approach, there's the immunomodulator approach.
can you comment like, just at a high level, what's your perspective on one versus the other, your confidence level, and just given like the challenging off-treatment cure rates we've seen so far?
bill collier -- president and chief executive officer
yes. thank you for the question. i think you started just by making reference to the clinical collaboration with assembly. and you correctly pointed out that that's a phase 2 study with 60 virologically suppressed subjects with hpv.
and essentially, it's comparing the triple, 729 plus vebicorvir plus a nuc versus 729 plus a nuc versus vebicorvir plus a nuc. the only thing that we have communicated with our partners, assembly, on that is that the study has started. that was the press release last week. we've not indicated when we will have data available from that study.
although it is an open-label study. so we will be able to track progress as we go. as to the second part of your question, perhaps, gaston, i can throw that to you.
gaston picchio -- chief development officer
yes. and so hi, mayank. it's difficult to say because, to be absolutely honest, we're not sure what the details of other studies are. i mean, i can just reiterate what our study, in collaboration with assembly, is going to be looking at.
so basically, we're looking at e-antigen negative subjects who are being suppressed for at least six months with nuc therapy, and they're going to be enrolling into -- sorry, randomized into three different arms. so obviously, there are two arms would function as controls, and there's a third arm, which is the exciting arm, which is the combination of the three agents. so as to exactly the differences with other studies that may be looking at similar but not identical approaches, i can't really comment because i don't know the details behind their models and what you can find in clinical trials or goals. so i think it's always important, i mean, at least based on my experience, that despite the fact that there is a reiteration of mechanisms of action.
i think at least i've learned over the years that it's always important to see what different assets within a class can provide. so i wouldn't discount the fact that we're testing three drugs that other companies may be testing as less exciting because i think we've seen some interesting data coming out of 729. and also, vebicorvir has been well established in further suppressing hbv dna and pgrna. so the combination of those three in the population that we selected may play out differently than in other regimens.
so i think we have to wait for the results, in short.
mayank mamtani -- b. riley fbr -- analyst
understood. and then just two more quick follow-ups. pd-l1 oral inhibitor, any color you could provide on time to ind? and just a high level, why to scale out the use in cancer, for example, maybe by a partner if you don't want to do oncology?
bill collier -- president and chief executive officer
mike, do you want to take that one?
mike sofia -- chief scientific officer
yes. yes. hi, mayank. so look, we've made great progress in that program, and i'm very excited and optimistic about achieving a clinical candidate nomination in the foreseeable future.
and as i said, from discovery, it's hard to give a specific timeline. we want to make sure we bring forward the very best compounds. so we're clearly doing all the relevant studies that need to be done. and those need to be done before, i think, we're comfortable saying we have the candidate that's going to go into the clinic and give any guidance there.
on the cancer issue, look, we're fully aware of the potential for an agent like a pd-l1 inhibitor in other therapeutic areas, specifically cancer. and i think we will look at all options on how to exploit these other areas in the future. but right now, we're really focused on hepatitis b applications for these pd-l1 inhibitors.
mayank mamtani -- b. riley fbr -- analyst
great. thank you for that color. and lastly, on the genevant-moderna litigation, can you just remind us what's the next step there on the appeal to ptab decision that was in july last year? what should we watch out for next?
bill collier -- president and chief executive officer
yes. let me tackle that one. and then, dave, you can chime in with any additional color as well. but you're referring back to the patent case that was announced last year where there was a challenge against one of arbutus patents and was found in our favor.
and i think as we described at the time and subsequently in our various listings, that patent is one of those that has been licensed out to genevant, which dave described in his comments this morning. so, unfortunately, it's really not possible for us at arbutus to comment on what genevant may or may not be doing. suffice to say that as part of that license-out arrangement, we've got some very clear terms for any sublicensing that genevant may do, which is what dave summarized in his comments. so i think that's about all that we can say.
dave, unless there's any other additional comments you can think of.
dave hastings -- chief financial officer
no, i think you covered it, bill. thanks.
bill collier -- president and chief executive officer
ok. great.
mayank mamtani -- b. riley fbr -- analyst
thank you.

your next question comes from kelechi chikere with jefferies.
bill collier -- president and chief executive officer
good morning.
kelechi chikere -- jefferies -- analyst
good morning and thank you for taking my question. i guess in the set of two phase 2 combo studies slated to start later this year, can i actually speculate on what are some of the investigational or approved agents you're thinking you could potentially cure with 729? i think we're all aware interferon maybe something. what are some of the other agents you're thinking of? any color there would be great. thank you.
bill collier -- president and chief executive officer
yes. good question. i mean, i can say that we want these three studies to be somewhat different so that we're exploring different combinations going forward. i mean, clearly, we have not said today what those compounds are going to be or could be, we've just said either marketed or investigational.
and i think the best way to answer that is with reference to our overall hypothesis that we want to be able to suppress dna, we want to be able to suppress surface antigen and we want to be able to boost the immune system. that's our model and our strategy here at arbutus for the way we can try and construct a combination therapy to achieve this functional cure for hepatitis b. i think that's about all we can say at the moment. so, gaston, anything you want to add?
gaston picchio -- chief development officer
no. thank you. i mean, i think as you pointed out, that's how much we can say. but again, just reiterate our thinking, which is the importance of, first, lowering s-antigen to give the immune system, using different approaches, as bill outlined, to reawaken and continue the job of clearing the effect of hepatocytes.
but we really believe that that lowering of s-antigen is critical to achieve that goal of functional cure and then intervene with other modalities after that is achieved. so keeping that in mind, i think you can imagine the different modalities that we're considering.
kelechi chikere -- jefferies -- analyst
got it. that's helpful. thank you.
operator
your next question comes from roy buchanan with jmp securities.
roy buchanan -- jmp securities -- analyst
hi. thanks for taking the question. just a quick one. sorry if i missed this.
any additional details on the rna destabilizing you can provide? i mean, are you targeting the hbv rna itself? are you targeting a host protein? any additional details? thanks.
bill collier -- president and chief executive officer
mike?
mike sofia -- chief scientific officer
hi. mike sofia. hi, roy. so we've actually described pretty extensively some of the mechanistic features of how the molecules that we are working with work.
look, they do specifically target hbv rna, and they target it via a mechanism that engages a host protein that's critical for stabilizing the hbv rna poly (a) tail. and so by inhibiting that host protein interaction with a complex associated with hbv rna, the pre region of hbv rna, we're able to destabilize hbv rna and lead to the degradation of poly (a) tail or truncating of the poly (a) tail that ultimately leads to degradation of hbv rna. so it is an hbv rna-targeting modality, but it goes via a host protein that's critical for maintaining the stability of hbv rna.
roy buchanan -- jmp securities -- analyst
ok, great. thank you.
operator
our next question comes from keay nakae with chardan.
keay nakae -- chardan -- analyst
yes, thanks. so with the upcoming data, from the 60-milligram multi-dose at eight-week intervals and the 90 at eight- and 12-week interval, can you just tee up for us how many doses you expect to report on in each of those cohorts?
bill collier -- president and chief executive officer
yes. gaston, maybe you can take that one. i don't want to be vague in the sense that we haven't released that in our guidance. but some of those cohorts have been ongoing for quite some time.
i think we just need to make sure that we have an effective and a realistic time frame to comment on. and by that, all i mean is that if you give something monthly, then within six months, you've got six doses. but if you could give something every 12 weeks within that same time frame, you've got many fewer doses. so we just want to make sure that we've got an appropriate number of doses to comment on.
keay nakae -- chardan -- analyst
ok.
bill collier -- president and chief executive officer
but, gaston, anything else you want to add?
gaston picchio -- chief development officer
well, i mean, let me just, i mean, articulate the question again. i mean, how many doses we're planning to report for both the 60-milligram every four and 60-milligram every eight weeks. as we pointed out in our guidance, so i mean, without counting the doses, i mean, the goal will be to be able to report end of therapy for both. so 48 weeks of treatment.
keay nakae -- chardan -- analyst
ok. yes, that's helpful because, at some point, you're making the decision of when the math is enough and you're reporting it. so that's simply what we're looking for. it's really how far out do you want to go before you report.
gaston picchio -- chief development officer
that would be the goal: to report end of therapy. and then obviously, pending decision around, as we were discussing earlier, and decisions around who can and who cannot stop later on, report on basically what happens off therapy in those that may qualify to stop. and that will be the structure, let's say, of every cohort that we're doing right now in the phase 1a/1b study. so just to reiterate that.
the study was originally meant to have six months of duration in terms of dosing, with different doses and dose frequencies. the study was amended in such a way that patients on reaching the end of the six months can reconsent if they decide and the investigator decides, toward continuation for an additional six months, so that makes it basically a total of 48 weeks. and then after that, a decision will have to be made regarding stopping, either stopping completely all therapy or stopping just 729 and remaining on the nuc. so as all of these cohorts mature and they progress, specifically to your question, for cohorts e and f being the 60 every four and 60 every eight, the next goal will be to be able to report end of therapy.
keay nakae -- chardan -- analyst
ok.
gaston picchio -- chief development officer
is that helpful?
keay nakae -- chardan -- analyst
yes, because you had pushed out the expected reporting of the 90 at 12 weeks. so just trying to understand what's behind that thinking.
bill collier -- president and chief executive officer
yes. ok. there's not so much. so i think we pushed that out.
that was one of the later cohorts to start. so it's just taken longer to go through, ok?
keay nakae -- chardan -- analyst
ok. thanks.
operator
i'm showing no further questions at this time. i would now like to turn the conference back to bill collier.
bill collier -- president and chief executive officer
thank you very much, and thank you all for your questions. just to close out, i'll quickly review, once again, the key objectives for the company for 2021. so as you've heard on this call, we've already initiated the phase 2 combination clinical trial to evaluate 729 in combination with the assembly biosciences core or capsid inhibitor, vebicorvir, and a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor. secondly, we also expect to provide additional data from ongoing cohorts of the phase 1a/1b clinical trial of 729 in the first half of 2021.
and as we also just mentioned, the 90-milligram every-12-week cohort will actually be expected in the second half of this year. we're also excited and expect to initiate two phase 2 combination clinical trials in hbv subjects, including 729 with one or more approved or investigational agents. again, that's slated for the second half of 2021. and we also expect to initiate a phase 1a/1b clinical trial of 836, our next-generation capsid inhibitor, in the first half of 2021.
so i'd like to close out by thanking all of the staff at arbutus. but importantly, this morning, all of you for joining us today, and we look forward to sharing our progress throughout the coming year. so thank you very much, and operator, that concludes our call.

ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the arbutus biopharma corporation fourth-quarter and year-end 2020 financial results and corporate update conference call. [operator instructions] please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [operator instructions] i would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, pam murphy. thank you.
please go ahead, ma'am.
pam murphy -- investor relations consultant
good morning, and thank you for joining the arbutus biopharma fourth-quarter 2020 conference call and webcast. on the call today are bill collier, president and chief executive officer; dr. gaston picchio, chief development officer; dr. michael sofia, chief scientific officer; and dave hastings, chief financial officer.
bill will begin with a summary of recent accomplishments and upcoming events and a review of arbutus' 2021 corporate objective, followed by gaston, mike sofia, and dave hastings, who will provide clinical drug discovery and financial updates, respectively. please note gaston will be using a few clinical slides, which can be viewed on the webcast. after the speakers, we'll then open up the call for q&a. before we begin, we'd like to remind you that some of the statements made during the call today are forward-looking statements, including statements regarding expectations, timelines, and clinical results for arbutus' proprietary hbv pipeline and covid-19 preclinical research efforts, the company's 2021 objective and expected cash use and cash runway.
these forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results to differ, including those described in our most recent annual report on 10-k, quarterly report on form 10-q, and other periodic reports filed with the sec. i would now like to turn the call over to bill. bill? 
bill collier -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, pam, and good morning, everybody. thank you for joining us today. as i approach my two-year anniversary with arbutus, i'd like to use the next few minutes to summarize the progress that we have made and why i believe that arbutus is well-positioned to execute on our mission to develop a cure for people with chronic hepatitis b, as well as advance new proprietary therapies to treat coronaviruses. first of all, and gaston picchio will describe in more detail, our lead product, ab-729, a subcutaneously delivered rnai agent, has demonstrated the potential to be a cornerstone drug in future hbv combination regimens.
we've reported in 2020 a significant body of compelling safety and efficacy data from an ongoing phase 1a/1b clinical trial. and this data strongly supports our plans to initiate two phase 2 trials for 729 in combination with one or more approved or investigational agents in the second half of 2021. in addition, arbutus and assembly have initiated screening of our proof-of-concept phase 2 clinical trial combining 729 with assembly biosciences capsid inhibitor, vebicorvir, and a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor. secondly, we've completed the ind-, cta-enabling studies for ab-836, our next-generation oral capsid inhibitor.
836 is from a novel chemical series, which we believe is differentiated from competitor compounds and offers the potential for increased efficacy and an enhanced resistance profile. we expect to begin the phase 1a/1b clinical trial for 836 in the first half of 2021. thirdly, as mike sofia will describe, we have a number of active drug discovery efforts in the hbv field, as well as discovery efforts for potential oral therapies to treat coronaviruses. given our experienced chemistry and biology teams, and the investments we're making in the oral pd-l1 inhibitor and rna destabilizer programs, we believe these programs have the potential to lead to future proprietary combination regimens to treat hbv.
furthermore, we're confident that the proven expertise in virology that resides within our discovery team could lead to new oral therapies to treat coronaviruses. and finally, as dave hastings will describe in a moment, we have a solid financial position with a cash runway that now extends through the third quarter of 2022 and a demonstrated track record of efficiently raising capital. so with that, let me now turn the call over to gaston picchio, our chief development officer. gaston?
gaston picchio -- chief development officer
thanks, bill, and good morning, everyone. today, i will focus my time on describing our current perspectives on ab-729 and our 2021 plans and objectives at as it relates to our lead clinical asset. as part of my discussion today, i will refer to a few slides that are available as part of our webcast and can also be found in our current corporate presentation located on the arbutus website. first, let me reiterate bill's confidence in the growing clinical data that has already emerged from our ongoing phase 1a/1b clinical trial for ab-729.
now, you can see in the first slide, the design of our phase 1a/1b single- and multiple-dose clinical trial and the current status of the cohorts that have been completed and reported on, and these are in dark red and dark blue. notably, this represents a significant data set and allow us to begin to put in perspective the potential of this drug, which i will address momentarily. we expect to report additional data from the ongoing cohorts from this trial in the first half of 2021, except for the 90-milligram every-12-week cohort, which is expected in the second half of 2021. in the next slide, no.
6, you can see that a single dose of ab-729 provided impressive and comparable mean s-antigen declines across all three doses, namely 60, 90, and 180 milligrams. moving to slide no. 7. importantly, as demonstrated, repeat 60-milligram dosing of ab-729 every four weeks resulted in continuous mean s-antigen declines beyond week 12.
now, as the next slide shows, repeat dosing using 60 milligrams every eight weeks resulted in comparable mean s-antigen declines relative to the 60-milligram dose every four weeks at week 16, or with minus 1.87 log10 versus minus 1.44 log10. moving to the next slide, no. 9, you can see that in hbv dna-positive chronic hepatitis subjects, a single 90-milligram ab-729 dose resulted in a robust mean s-antigen decline of minus 1.02 log10, similar to what has been seen in hbv dna undetectable subjects. notably, hbv dna also declined at week 12 with a mean decline of minus 1.53 log10, as well as hbv rna and core-related antigens, which are not shown here, supporting complete target engagement by ab-729.
finally, slide no. 10. ab-729 continues to be safe and well-tolerated. we have not seen any treatment-emerging grade 3 or 4 adverse events or discontinuations in any cohort to date.
in cohort f, two subjects had symptomatic alt elevations; one subject with a history of grade 1 alt elevation prior to trial entry had a transient grade 2 elevation, which evolved back to grade 1; while another subject had a transient grade 1 elevation. further, in cohort e, the two subjects previously reported with grade 2 and two subjects with grade 1 alt elevations have improved to grade 1 and grade 0, respectively, after week 24. all seven subjects in the cohort have consented to continue dosing with ab-729 for an additional six months. so stepping back with the totality of data we have seen thus far, we believe ab-729 can serve a vital role in our future proprietary combination regimens, both in lowering hbv replication and s-antigen concentrations.
not only does ab-729 provide an efficacy and safety profile competitive with other programs, but it also potentially represents a competitive advantage in frequency of dosing. this gives me great confidence in our plans to aggressively advance ab-729 into several phase 2 trials this year. we plan on initiating two phase 2 combination trials with one or more approved or investigational agents in the second half of this year. in addition, we have initiated screening in our phase 2 clinical trial combining ab-729 with assembly biosciences' lead core inhibitor, also known as capsid inhibitor, vebicorvir.
this proof-of-concept trial is a randomized, multicenter, open-label phase 2 clinical trial that will explore the safety, pharmacokinetics, and antiviral activity of the triple combination of ab-729, vebicorvir, and an nrti compared to the double combinations of vebicorvir with an nrti and ab-729 and an nrti.this trial is expected to enroll approximately 60 virologically suppressed patients with chronic hbv infection. so with that, i turn the call over to mike. mike?
mike sofia -- chief scientific officer
thanks, gaston, and good morning, everybody. i want to briefly review our drug discovery objectives and strategies as we progress on the hbv and coronavirus research fronts. as you know, we are focused on developing proprietary combination regimens that have the power to functionally cure people with hbv. we have progressed compounds into development that target two critical pieces of our strategy: stopping viral replication and reduce s-antigen levels.
the other pillar of our strategy envisions addressing the immune component of the disease. to that end, we believe our oral pd-l1 program has the potential to reawaken the immune system in hbv patients. highly functional hbv-specific t cells within our immune system are believed to be required for long-term hbv viral resolution. however, hbv-specific t cells become functionally defective and greatly reduced in their frequency during chronic hbv infection.
one approach to boost hbv-specific t cells is to target the pd-l1/pd-1 axis to release the brakes on the immune system and lead to removal of infected hepatocytes. we are in lead optimization with oral compounds, which are potentially capable of reawakening patients' hbv-specific immune response by inhibiting pd-l1 interactions. in addition, we believe that an all-oral proprietary combination of agents remains an objective for us. we continue to optimize hbv rna destabilizers that are small-molecule, orally available agents that cause the destabilization and ultimate degradation of hbv rnas.
currently, we are advancing several promising next-generation oral hbv rna destabilizers through lead optimization and candidate selection. finally, we believe it is important to leverage our virology expertise in the battle against coronaviruses. our effort is focused on the discovery and development of new molecular entities that address specific viral targets, including the nsp12 viral polymerase and the nsp5 viral protease. these targets are essential viral proteins, which have the potential for delivering pan coronavirus therapies, which arbutus has experience in targeting.
as all of you know, predicting hard and fast timelines in drug discovery is not possible. therefore, we are not yet giving specific guidance regarding when we will nominate lead candidates in these three areas. that said, we have a capable and experienced drug discovery team, and i look forward to updating you on our progress throughout the year. with that, i'll turn the call over to dave.
dave?
dave hastings -- chief financial officer
thanks, mike. good morning, everybody. our ending cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments was approximately $123 million as of december 31, 2020, compared to approximately $91 million as of december 31, 2019. our cash used from operations for the year ended december 31, 2020, was approximately $51 million.
we made a $2.5 million equity investment in genevant in july. these cash outflows were offset by approximately $86 million of net proceeds from the issuance of common shares under the arbutus atm program. additionally, thus far, during the first quarter of 2021, we have received $24 million of net proceeds from our atm program. we expect a net cash burn of between $70 million and $75 million in 2021.
and therefore, we believe our cash runway now extends through the third quarter of 2022. finally, as a reminder, arbutus owns approximately 16% of the common equity of genevant sciences, a company arbutus launched with roivant sciences and to which arbutus licensed exclusive rights to its lnp delivery technologies for rna-based applications outside of hbv. we are entitled to receive tiered, low single-digit royalties on future sales of genevant products covered by the licensed patents. if genevant sublicenses the intellectual property, licensed by us to genevant, we are entitled to receive upon the commercialization of a product developed by such sublicensee the lesser of 20% of the revenue received by genevant for sublicensing and tiered, low single-digit royalties on product sales by the sublicensee.
so with that, bill, i'll turn the call back to you.
bill collier -- president and chief executive officer
all right. thank you, dave, and to gaston and mike. and i think at this point, operator, can you please open up the lines for ",2020-Q4,ABUS

operator
[operator instructions] our first question coming from the line ed arce with h.c. wainwright.
ed arce -- h.c. wainwright -- analyst
just a couple for me. as most investors are eager to find out additional data on your next cohorts in the ongoing phase ia/ib study of 729, wondering if you can tell us for the multi-dose data on the 60 and 90 that you're expecting, how many doses or number of weeks we can expect, given the cohorts both include patients that would be on every eight-week dosing. i was hoping to see at least 24 weeks out, if not more. just wondering what we can expect later this quarter.
bill collier -- president and chief executive officer
yes. good morning ed, its bill. thank you very much for that great question. yes.
i think as we've outlined in the past, we've been operating these cohorts very diligently during the covid situation and really trying to make sure that we can work in areas where we can select patients and move them forward with full follow-up. so we're pleased with the progress that we've made. and i think we've also been cognizant that when we're looking at dose intervals of either four or eight or 12 weeks, we really do need to have a reasonable timeframe in terms of weeks and months to actually make sense of all the data. so we're closing in on that right now with some of the cohorts where we expect data later on this quarter.
but just with those comments, gaston, if there's anything else that you would like to add?
gaston picchio -- chief development officer -- analyst
yes. hi ed. good morning. as bill stated, we'll be hopefully sharing data on three cohorts.
and to your question, the range of weeks that we will be showing is probably depending what the remarks of bill that we don't know until the last minute, but it's somewhere between 24 weeks to 48 weeks.
ed arce -- h.c. wainwright -- analyst
excellent. ok. and then, i guess, the follow-up to this. and i know, gaston, you mentioned this numerous times in the past, the importance of having sufficient data to fund or at least to predict a level of plateauing on the different doses.
is this something that you're hoping to determine with this next data set?
gaston picchio -- chief development officer -- analyst
well, i mean, i will be able to tell you that once we see the final data. but, yes, we were hoping that with at least 48 weeks of dosing, we will be able to get a better sense of how s-antigen and other hpv antigens are progressing over time.
bill collier -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, ed. thank you so much.
operator
our next question coming from the line of kelechi chikere with jefferies. your line is open.
kelechi chikere -- jefferies -- analyst
yes. good morning. thank you for taking my questions. just a couple on my end.
i was hoping, can you speak to the preliminary data you'll have for 836 in the second half? what will that be? and i guess, in the big picture, on what metrics are you hoping to see differentiation compared to the other capsid and core inhibitors in development? and i have a follow-up question after that.
bill collier -- president and chief executive officer
ok. good morning kelly. yes, i think in our corporate update, we've got the structure of the 836 phase ia/ib study, so it's, i think, a fairly usual clinical structure with healthy volunteers and then single doses in hbv patients and then multiple doses. we are unlikely to get all of that data by the end of the year, but we do expect to have enough to give us confidence to move forward with 836.
so, again, i'll let gaston add if you've got any further comments to make.
gaston picchio -- chief development officer -- analyst
yes. so as it can be seen in the corporate deck, i believe its slide 23 in the corporate deck, you can see the structure, the design of the 836-001 study that has three parts: single ascending, multiple sending and chronic hepatitis b subjects. the study has initiated, as we've stated before. and in the second half, i think, we'll have sufficient data already in chronic hepatitis b subjects provided everything continues as planned, to be able to move 836 forward in combinations.
i cannot give you any more specifics, because it's an ongoing study. still, as you know, were impacted by the effects of covid around the world. and, therefore, there's always a certain degree of uncertainty as to whether we can complete everything that we planned. but the study is ongoing and is on track.
kelechi chikere -- jefferies -- analyst
thank you. that's very helpful, and that's a great segue to my next question. just wondering if you can speak to enrollment in your various trials, the 836 study as well as the combo study with 729 and assembly's core inhibitor. i guess, how is enrollment been going in? what steps have you implemented to ensure you're able to enroll patients in those studies, given everything that's going on?
bill collier -- president and chief executive officer
yes. gaston, do you want to handle that one?
gaston picchio -- chief development officer -- analyst
yes. sorry, can you repeat the first part? were you talking about specifically about the 836 study? or you were talking about ab-729 by itself or the combo study? i missed that part.
kelechi chikere -- jefferies -- analyst
yes, both studies. so 729 combo study that was recently initiated with assembly, as well as the 836 study that was just initiated. how is enrollment going there?
gaston picchio -- chief development officer -- analyst
well, we haven't commented. and, obviously, we can't comment on that without our partners at this point in time. but i mean, our partner, assembly in the combo study has done everything possible to really to speed up enrollment and ensure the timelines are met. so, so far, i mean, we haven't provided any additional guidance on enrollment other than i can reassure that every step has been taken to accelerate enrollment.
and as i said before, the 836 study it's on track and the 729-001 study actually it's fully enrolled, we're following the subjects now.
bill collier -- president and chief executive officer
ok. thank you very much kelechi.
operator
and our next question coming from the line of brian skorney with baird.
brian skorney -- baird -- analyst
good morning everyone. thank you for taking the question. on 729, you've seen some really good reductions in s-antigen levels below thresholds that, at least in some asian countries, it wouldn't be unusual to stop nuc therapy. and we sort of discussed the potential for evaluating what it would look like to take patients off all nuc therapy here.
could you just speak to your current thinking there? is that still something on the potential near or medium term horizon? and do you sort of have stopping criteria in mind to look at a value of eight patients off therapy?
bill collier -- president and chief executive officer
yes, brian, thank you very much. good question. i think our belief is that we need to get multiple drugs onboard before we start reaching criteria where we can start peeling some of those drugs away, so really understand the basis for the question. gaston, do you want to comment further on?
gaston picchio -- chief development officer -- analyst
yes, sure. thank you. thanks for the question. so we continue to consider the multiple options that there are in terms of stopping criteria.
also, those need to be aligned with the recommendations from regulatory agencies around the world, including, obviously, the fda. so at this point in time, we haven't stopped anyone, and that it's always a possibility. but we haven't done that. certainly, we continue to consider the 100 iu per ml threshold for service antigen.
the question, i think, that remains is how long that sustained decrease in s-antigen needs to persist before you consider whether stopping the investigational drugs or stopping all therapies, so that would be the nuc. so i mean, we continue to consider multiple options. i think there's no single way of stopping patients right now. everyone has a different opinion on how it should be done in a safe way.
and, obviously, safety is we're driving force there, just make sure that we don't do anything that results unsafe for the patients.
operator
thank you. [operator instructions] our next question coming from the line of roy buchanan with jmp securities. your line is open.
roy buchanan -- jmp securities -- analyst
great. thanks for taking the question. so the first one i wanted to ask about the collaboration, you guys recently announced for sars-cov-2 with x-chem and proteros. it seems like the dna-encoded library is kind of a burgeoning space.
i just wondered if you could speak a little bit more in detail about what makes x-chem's approach industry-leading, how it's differentiated from other libraries? and then i had a financial question for dave.
bill collier -- president and chief executive officer
yes. ok. so on the x-chem, proteros deal, maybe mike sofia, so you take that one?
mike sofia -- chief scientific officer
sure. so as we sort of scour the landscape for sort of del screening technology, dna-encoded library technology companies to evaluate who we wanted to partner with. and really x-chem stood out among all of them, not only because we felt that their expertise was industry leading, they clearly have demonstrated through many, many collaborations they've had with other pharma partners the ability to deliver using their libraries. they probably also have the largest library set out there in the dna-encoded library arena, including multiple different kinds of libraries that would include both reversible, as well as covalent attachment libraries that we were interested in.
so, overall, we thought that from their level of expertise, their track record that they were the ideal partner to move forward with here. they also had this strategic relationship with proteros and because mpro is a nonstructural protein. its structure is known. it provided a real ideal target to use structured biology, biophysical methods to guide subsequent structure-activity relationship studies and lead optimization studies that we were going to do.
so when you look at the whole package together, it brings together the three companies with really industry-leading expertise and capability to tackle this target and buying new chemical matter that we hope will ultimately lead to clinical candidates that will benefit patients.
roy buchanan -- jmp securities -- analyst
ok. great. that's helpful. i mean, just any idea on timing from that partnership for when we could see the first results?
bill collier -- president and chief executive officer
well, obviously, we all agree that the coronavirus issue is front and center on everyone's mind globally. we are driving this as aggressively as we possibly can. and our partners know that. they're fully committed.
this is really a collaboration. it's not a typical cro relationship. so we hope to have something sooner rather than later, but it's a little early to comment on that right now.
roy buchanan -- jmp securities -- analyst
yes. great. ok. thank you.
and then just a quick one for dave, has there been any atm use since the end of the first quarter? thanks.
dave hastings -- chief financial officer
yes, hi roy. so our typical policy is to disclose atm sales through sort of the end of the prior quarter. so we'll update everybody on next call for the atm activity this quarter, roy.
roy buchanan -- jmp securities -- analyst
thank you.
operator
our next question coming from line of mayank mamtani with b. riley securities. your line is open.
mayank mamtani -- b. riley securities -- analyst
good morning dave. thanks for taking my questions. yes. so on the assembly trial, if i could clarify, i believe you're starting with the 60 mg dose.
so could you maybe talk about the 90 mg data that you continue to generate? and what, if any, implications you could have to the protocol as you think about balancing s-antigen reduction and maybe safety?
bill collier -- president and chief executive officer
hey, thank you very much for the question. good morning to you. the assembly collaboration trial, we've set that dosage for 729 at 60 milligrams every eight weeks. but as you know, we're continuing to look at 90 milligram, eight and 12 weeks, which would potentially allow us to look at that dosage, dependent upon the data in our other phase ii studies.
but, again, gaston thoughts?
gaston picchio -- chief development officer -- analyst
yes. hi. good morning, mayank. we felt comfortable with the 60 milligram every eight-week dosing schedule to initiate the collaboration with assembly, and that's how that study is moving forward.
we don't anticipate having to make any changes to the ongoing study, but that doesn't preclude us from opening other cohorts within this collaboration at different doses or different dosing schedules. but just to be clear that the ongoing study its 60 milligrams every eight weeks.
mayank mamtani -- b. riley securities -- analyst
got it. and sorry, if i missed this on 836. as you're thinking about just longer-term developing this agent and maybe sort of differentiating on the enhanced resistance profile that you have good preclinical data. how, if at all, this program could be developed maybe differently than how current programs are going, combination based rna plus core capsid? any insights there beyond 2021?
bill collier -- president and chief executive officer
yes. mike sofia, do you want to just talk briefly about what we've shared on the resistance front.
mike sofia -- chief scientific officer
sure, bill. so yes, i think when you look at 836, it has a number of different differentiating characteristics, right? one is the resistance profile that addresses a number of the emerging resistance issues in the capsid field. the other issue is related to the sort of second mechanism, right. that being able to engage the second mechanism in a clinically relevant dose, which we believe 836 is going to be able to do.
now with that characteristic, we have the potential of seeing some differentiating profile when we put it in combination with 729. but, i think, everyone should understand that our objective in this combination strategy is ultimately to do the three things that we've said from day one, which is shut down viral replication, which capsid plus nuc will achieve; start the dna pool with hopefully the capsid will also achieve in association with, i think, our rnai. and then with the rnai agent, knocking down the s-antigen to help to reinvigorate the immune system. the other piece of the puzzle here really is the immune modulation piece, which, as bill had mentioned, we're very excited about our pd-l1 program, which is really maturing very nicely.
and we hope to see great things out of it. and bringing that together does round out the whole picture and strategy that we've been sort of discussing for a number of years now. and so, when you look at our capsid asset, it does have differentiating profile from other competitor compounds, but is a central part of the overall strategy that we set out several years ago.
mayank mamtani -- b. riley securities -- analyst
great. thanks. thank you for the comprehensive answer and maybe just if i can squeeze one in for dave on the ip situation with moderna. at least from public filings from moderna it seems like they are taking a relatively different approach from before.
anything you guys can comment from your end or from genevant's perspective that gives any color on the lawsuit or the possibility of settlement?
dave hastings -- chief financial officer
well no. we can't comment. we would not lead that effort, genevant would. but i would say, look, we take our ip very seriously but in terms of sort of the play-by-play with the interactions of the companies, we can't comment on that.
mayank mamtani -- b. riley securities -- analyst
understood. thanks for taking our questions.
bill collier -- president and chief executive officer
thanks so much mayank.

i'm showing no further questions at this time. i would like to turn the call back over to mr. bill collier for any closing remarks.

well, thank you very much for all of your questions and for joining us this morning. we really do appreciate your interest in the company. we look forward to a productive and value building 2021. and i think as you've just heard, we're confident that with further data from our 729 clinical trial, progression of the 729 compound into two phase ii proof-of-concept clinical trials, data from our 836 phase ia/ib clinical trial and continued progress in our hbv discovery programs, that we really have established a strong foundation on our mission to achieve a functional cure for people with chronic hbv.
and also, obviously, looking forward to leveraging our antiviral discovery and research efforts in progressing our pan-coronavirus discovery program. so again, thank you for your interest. and operator, that concludes our call. thank you.

ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the arbutus biopharma corporation 2021 first-quarter financial results and corporate update conference call. [operator instructions] please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [operator instructions]. i would now like to hand the conference to your speaker host today, pam murphy.
please go ahead.
pam murphy -- investor relations consultant
thank you, and good morning. on the call from arbutus executive team are bill collier, president and chief executive officer; dave hastings, chief financial officer; dr. gaston picchio, chief development officer; and dr. mike sofia, chief scientific officer.
bill will begin with the review of the first quarter's accomplishment, clinical development, and remaining 2021 corporate objectives; followed by dave hastings, who will provide a the review of the company's first quarter financial results. we'll then open up the call for q&a. mike and gaston will be available to address any research and clinical development related questions. before we begin, we'd like to remind you that some of the statements made during the call today are forward-looking statements, including statements regarding expectations for arbutus' proprietary hbv pipeline and pan-coronavirus discovery program, including potential clinical results and timelines for ab-729 and ab-836, and any future compound; our expected cash used and cash runway and the potential for our drug candidates to improve upon standard of care and contribute to a curative combination regimen for hbv.
these forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results to differ materially, including those described in our most recent annual report on 10-k, quarterly report on form 10-q and other periodic reports filed with the sec. bill? 
bill collier -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, pam, and good morning, everybody. thank you for joining us today. we really do appreciate your interest in arbutus biopharma. i am pleased to report on our progress thus far this year, and to outline our objectives for the rest of 2021.
as we've stated in the past, our goal at arbutus is to focus on developing a portfolio of products with different mechanisms of action, that when used in combination could result in a functional cure for people living with chronic hbv. during the first quarter, we took another significant step toward that goal when ab-836, our proprietary oral capsid inhibitor began a phase ia/ib clinical trial. 836 is from a novel chemical series, differentiated from competitive compounds with potential for increased efficacy and an enhanced resistance profile. and we look forward to having initial data readouts from this trial in the second half of this year.
in addition, ab-729, our proprietary subcutaneously delivered rnai agent, continues to demonstrate robust and continuous declines in hepatitis b surface antigen in subjects with chronic hbv, with a favorable safety profile in our ongoing phase ia/ib clinical trial. we expect to provide additional data from ongoing cohorts from this phase ia trial in the second quarter of this year, including 60-milligram multidose data with dosing every four and eight weeks and 90-milligram multidose data with dosing interval every eight weeks. separately, data from the 90-milligram every 12 weeks in hbv negative subjects and the 90-milligram every eight weeks in hbv dna positive subjects is expected in the second half of 2021. now, we're very encouraged by the clinical results we've seen thus far with 729, as it demonstrates the inhibition of viral replication and reduction of all hbv antigens, including hepatitis b surface antigen.
as you know, reducing surface antigen is thought to be a key prerequisite to enable reawakening of a patient's immune system to respond to the virus. therefore, our objective is to advance 729 into two additional proof-of-concept phase ii combination clinical trials with one or more approved or investigational agents in the second half of 2021 with dosing of 729 as infrequently as every eight or 12 weeks. consistent with our belief that multi-drug combinations will be needed to achieve a functional cure for people with hepatitis b, i am pleased that arbutus and assembly biosciences initiated in the first quarter, a phase ii proof-of-concept clinical trial to evaluate 729 in combination with assembly lead capsid or core inhibitor candidate, vebicorvir and an nrti. approximately 60 virologically suppressed subjects with hbv e-antigen, chronic hbv will be dosed for 48 weeks with 300 milligrams of vebicorvir orally once-a-day and 60 milligrams of 729 subcutaneously every eight weeks, with a 48-week follow-up period.
now, i'd like to turn to our hbv discovery programs, where we're making good progress in our research efforts for a next-generation oral hbv-specific rna destabilizer, as well as a lead oral compound that inhibits pd-l1. so first, our oral rna destabilizers have shown compelling antiviral effects in multiple hbv preclinical models. and we remain committed to this area of research. arbutus is now focused on advancing a next-generation oral hbv-specific rna destabilizer with distinct chemical scaffolds through lead optimization.
arbutus also has compounds in lead optimization that are potentially capable of reawakening patients' hbv-specific immune response by inhibiting pd-l1. and we look forward to keeping you up-to-date on how these important research programs are progressing. finally, to advance our efforts to identify a proprietary oral treatment for covid and potential future coronavirus outbreaks, we recently announced an important pan-coronavirus discovery research and license agreement with x-chem and proteros biostructures. now, this collaboration brings together our own expertise in the discovery and development of antiviral agents with x-chem's industry-leading dna-encoded library technology and proteros' protein sciences, biophysics and structural biology capabilities.
this collaboration will allow for the rapid screening of one of the largest small module libraries against mpro, an essential protein for the coronavirus to replicate itself, and also use state-of-the-art structure guided methods to rapidly optimize mpro inhibitors. so we look forward to keeping you updated on our pan-coronavirus discovery program as we progress throughout the year. and with that said, i'll now turn the call over to dave hastings for a brief financial update, and then we'll open up the call for our q&a. as pam mentioned, both gaston and mike sofia are both on the call and can take any additional clinical and discovery questions.
so, over to you, dave.
dave hastings -- chief financial officer
thanks, bill, and good morning, everybody. as i've mentioned in the past, our key financial metric is cash and financial runway. our ending cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments was $132 million as of march 31, 2021, as compared to approximately $123 million as of december 31, 2020. our cash used from operations for the first quarter of 2021 was approximately $18 million, which was offset by approximately $26 million of net proceeds from the issuance of common shares under arbutus's atm program.
for 2021, we expect our cash use to range from $70 million to $75 million. and therefore, we expect our current cash runway is sufficient to fund operations through the third quarter of 2022. so with that, operator, would you please open the call for q&a.

[operator instructions] your first question comes from the line of ed arce with h.c. wainwright.
thomas yip -- h.c. wainwright & co. -- analyst
hi. good morning everyone. this is thomas yip asking a couple of questions for ed. first, about the new phase 2a study with 729, specifically regarding the dosing choice.
in the press release, you indicated that you've already selected 60-milligram every eighth week as the dose to go forward. just wondering, will the study include only one dose? or is there -- possible to include additional doses with the 90-milligram dose data that are expected in the second half this year?
bill collier -- president and chief executive officer
yes. good question. thank you very much. good morning.
gaston, would you like to take that one?
gaston picchio -- chief development officer
sure. hi. good morning, thomas. for now, the decision has been made to include a season dose.
but since we are in the early stages of preparation of the file. and our 90-milligram data will come later this year, there's always an opportunity to reconsider that decision; that includes the doses. but right now, we're going with one dose.
thomas yip -- h.c. wainwright & co. -- analyst
ok. sounds good. and then, perhaps for 836, for also the phase 1a/b study that's ongoing. you mentioned that data from both have the volunteers and hbv patients will be included in at least second half of this year.
just wondering, will this be a single data readout? and what should we expect from this readout beyond safety data?
bill collier -- president and chief executive officer
yes. gaston, you want that, too?
gaston picchio -- chief development officer
sure. so we expect, obviously, safety data and tolerability, as well as some hbv dna data coming from the current hepatitis b cohorts. we may be able to also deliver some hbv rna data as well. sorry, let me just add one thing.
we will, as usual, measure as antigen, pending whether, as you know, 836, potentially it's much more effective, but targeting the second mechanism. so we will be measuring as antigen as well and see what happens in that front.
thomas yip -- h.c. wainwright & co. -- analyst
all right. so perhaps somewhat comparable to 729 earlier data releases?
gaston picchio -- chief development officer
yes, correct.
thomas yip -- h.c. wainwright & co. -- analyst
great. ok. and then one final question from us. just wondering, you mentioned the progress for 729 combination studies.
i wonder if -- have you report enrollment progress for the 729 combo study with assembly, i recall here? and if not, what should we expect from the study mix.
bill collier -- president and chief executive officer
yes. gaston, want to -- again?
gaston picchio -- chief development officer
so i mean, it's a little bit premature yet, the study is recruiting, and pending the progress in terms of enrolling this study, we will make a later announcement regarding what data can we share before the end of the year. but the study is enrolling as planned as we speak.
thomas yip -- h.c. wainwright & co. -- analyst
ok. so we should expect a new update by the end of the year?
gaston picchio -- chief development officer
again, i think it's going to be dependent on how successful the enrollment process moves forward. there's challenges around the world right now in terms of covid. so, so far, so good. the study is enrolling.
the sites are opening, but it's very difficult to predict the pace of enrollment anywhere around the world.
bill collier -- president and chief executive officer
yes. so we haven't guided to having results by the end of the year in that assembly collaboration. what we have said, in conjunction with our partners at assembly, is that the study has initiated and is recruiting.
thomas yip -- h.c. wainwright & co. -- analyst
ok. understood. and completely understandable given what's going on around the world. thank you so much for taking the questions, and we look forward to the multiple payer releases in the second half this year.
bill collier -- president and chief executive officer
thank you very much.
operator
your next question comes from the line of brian skorney with baird.
luke herrmann -- baird -- analyst
hi. this is luke on for brian. so regarding the peginterferon alpha combo study, beyond safety, could you maybe talk about what you're hoping to see regarding biomarkers? i know it's still kind of early here, but also, when do you think we could see initial data?
bill collier -- president and chief executive officer
well, on that study, we said that we will initiate in the second half of this year as to the study design. i'll let gaston answer that.
gaston picchio -- chief development officer
yes. thanks for the question. so basically, as you know, we presented data at easl, showing that there is reawakening of hbv-specific immunity after around 20 weeks of dosing with the 729. so we think this provides a great opportunity to add on another agent such as the immunomodulatory agents such as interferon.
so we expect basically to see at the time of the addition of interferon, we expect to see a probably a faster and deeper decline in s-antigen. we also plan to measure t cell responses. and we obviously potentially expect to see that decent responses in the presence of interferon are stronger and potentially broader. then obviously, we have other biomarker, biomarkers such as hbv rna, but that will depend on whether the initial baseline hbv rna level is susceptible, as you know, not in all patients is susceptible.
so really, it's going to be around that. and hopefully, we may see also an increase in antibodies. that's another possibility in the presence of interferon, which we haven't seen so far in the ongoing studies.
luke herrmann -- baird -- analyst
great. thanks.
bill collier -- president and chief executive officer

your next question comes from the line of roy buchanan with jmp securities.
roy buchanan -- jmp securities -- analyst
hi. great. thanks for taking the questions. the first one, i want to ask about the vaccitech approach? and just what made that approach still appealing for use as a therapeutic vaccine? for example, why not use that approved potent vaccine like heplisav-b or something as a possible option?
bill collier -- president and chief executive officer
yes. thanks for the question. we've always had a strategy that a combination of drugs is likely to be the -- like the -- there's actually a slide that we've had in our corporate deck for, it seems like many, many years now, which has got all the different potential combinations in kind of up arrows and down arrows. so i think we've also always recognized that vaccines play a part in that.
and so we were intrigued and interested in the vaccitech collaboration. i'll let gaston expand further.
gaston picchio -- chief development officer
yes. thanks for the question. so it's a little bit along the lines of what we just discussed on the previous questions. so now we have evidence, i think for the first time, i would believe we've been the first ones in showing that, that with an sirna, you're able to, reawaken hbv specific immune responses.
so i think this provides an excellent opportunity to ask the question of enhancing the hbv-specific immune response in different ways. one could be with a broad immunomodulator such as interferon, the other would be with hbv-specific lectins. now specifically, so i think the data that we have gathered in the 729 programs, especially the immunology data, it really provides a very good foundation and justification to do this study with vaccitech. so vaccitech's platform, we believe, provides a much stronger hbv-specific immune response than existing prophylactic hbv backings.
so i mean, i think you should discuss with them directly their data. but based on what we learned, we believe their therapeutic vaccine with the adeno platform, as well as nda provides a much better opportunity at enhancing hbv-specific responses compared to prophylactic hbv vaccines that may be in the market.
roy buchanan -- jmp securities -- analyst
ok, great. and i had a question on antios' ati-2173. how does that -- so clinically, how does that differ in targeting versus the background with, which is tenofovir in this case? and is the goal to replace the background news with a more potent nuke? or what's the goal of the combination?
bill collier -- president and chief executive officer
yes. good question. it's set up in the study with a nuclear sign. maybe, mike sofia, do you want to chime in on that?
mike sofia -- chief scientific officer
sure. so, i mean, if you look at clonidine as a nucleotide, nucleoside, it shows very interesting profile in, in vivo studies, even if some of the earlier historic clinical trials, which you saw was this longer duration of effect compared to a typical nucleoside, whether tenofovir or entecavir. it also has a slightly different mechanism of action, although it does target the polymerase, it does bind to the active site, it's not what they call a chain terminator. so it doesn't function as a tenofovir or entecavir does.
so that differentiates it in some way. so that combination of interesting observations made it an interesting experiment to do, to combine it with an agent like 729, which reduces s-antigen, can we then bring in something like the antios molecule with another nucleoside and see very deep suppression of viral replication that is more sustained over time than with a single nucleoside. so that was sort of the rationale for an interest level in bringing in the antios molecule into the mix.
roy buchanan -- jmp securities -- analyst
ok. great. that's helpful. thanks.
and then last couple of questions on the interferon program. vir has presented some preliminary results for their combo with the rnai plus interferon, just anything that you've learned from that program that can be applied to 729, anything that you're doing differently with 729 that might differentiate it from the other candidates, or maybe you don't need to differentiate? and then, what do you guys expect to be the baseline, functional cure rate for the interferon, plus a move? if have the number for interferon, can look in the slide deck. but i'm not clear if interferon numbers, the combos, just interferon itself. thanks.
bill collier -- president and chief executive officer
gaston, do you want to take that one?
gaston picchio -- chief development officer
sure. so let me start from the last question. so the expectation in terms of functional cure, i don't think we are in a position to provide a number of, what's our expectation of functional cure. so we just let the data speak for itself.
when it comes to what did we learn? well, the approach that vir took actually was -- in the part of the study that they showed data on, at easl was having interferon at the beginning. so from the get-go, they would add their rnai plus interferon. so that resulted, i believe, if i remember correctly, with 12 in an increase in the decay of s-antigen. so we have a little -- a different approach.
again, in line with the finance that we have. there were some immunology studies that we presented at easl. we believe that it's better to first drop s-antigen and allow that immune response to come back and then add the interferon. so i believe -- again, i mean, don't take my word for it, but i believe that based on the data, i believe i have seen that vir will be testing that as well.
they will be adding interferon later. but we are only exploring adding the interferon later. so as you may see, you can see the design of the starting clinical trials are comped right now. we're going to be adding interferon after 24 weeks of 729 treatment.
so we believe that s-antigen already would have gone down by probably somewhere around 1.8 to two locks, on average, across the entire population. so what we expect, as i said before, is that after having interferon, obviously, the s-antigen will continue to decay. we may see some sort of conversion. we may see also, because we're going to measure that, better hbv-specific immune reawakening compared to subjects that did not receive interferon.
roy buchanan -- jmp securities -- analyst
ok. great. thank you.

your next question comes from the line of keay nakae with chardan.
keay nakae -- chardan capital markets -- analyst
hi. keay nakae from chardan. just back on that same topic with the time to the interferon in your study. is there a threshold drop in s-antigen before you'll advance the patient to the interferon? or is it just simply the 24-week duration standpoint?
gaston picchio -- chief development officer
there is no threshold. we are very confident that by week 24, all subjects have achieved at least a lot. and for the vast majority more than a log and a half of s-antigen drug. so in response to your question, there's no minimum threshold that they need to meet, but very confident that everyone is going to be in excess of one log decay of -- in s-antigen.
keay nakae -- chardan capital markets -- analyst
ok. and then how long is the course of interferon?
gaston picchio -- chief development officer
yes. great question. we're testing two courses: 24 weeks, as well as 12 weeks. 
keay nakae -- chardan capital markets -- analyst
ok. 
bill collier -- president and chief executive officer
again, may i remind everyone, yes, the details are in clinical trials. i'll go for it right now.
keay nakae -- chardan capital markets -- analyst
ok. all right. great. that's all i have.
bill collier -- president and chief executive officer
thank you. yes.

there are no additional questions at this time. i'd like to turn it back over to management -- i'm sorry, there is a question. there is from kelechi chikere with jefferies.
bill collier -- president and chief executive officer
kelechi.
kelechi chikere -- jefferies -- analyst
yes. hey, how is it going? thanks for fitting me in here. just a couple of questions on my end. i guess, on a high level, are there any competitor data sets over the coming quarters that you'll specifically be looking at for a read-through or to inform the design or to provide with any information for your own clinical studies?
bill collier -- president and chief executive officer
hey, good question. i mean, we've just had, obviously, the easl conference. and as always, we had our highest field for interesting data from, actually any source. and then as you think about the second half of the year, the typical event is aasld, which is in november.
i don't know that i would single out any particular data set. i'm just racking my brain here. gaston or mike, can you think of anything that, other than obviously staying, like you guys, the rest of what all the major companies are doing in the area. so, gaston?
kelechi chikere -- jefferies -- analyst
got it.
gaston picchio -- chief development officer
i think the one -- so it's interesting because, at easl, we pretty much showed one year of dosing with ab-729. and we were expecting to see one year of dosing coming in from janssen that was presented from their [inaudible] study. so i would say it will be interesting to see if that data gets presented at asmd later this year, as well as in that study, i believe they also have a triple combination. so that would be also interesting to see.
kelechi chikere -- jefferies -- analyst
yes. great. great. thank you.
that's great color there. and i guess, lastly, i guess in respect to your earlier-stage programs, is there any additional color you can provide around when you might be able to enter the clinic with those, so your destabilizer, as well as the pd-l1?
bill collier -- president and chief executive officer
yes. mike, you want to take that one?
mike sofia -- chief scientific officer
yes. so we're very close. we're kind of in the latter stages of our candidate selection process. so i think we'll be able to update and -- when we expect to be in the clinic.
bill collier -- president and chief executive officer
perfect. and thank you.
operator
there are no additional questions at this time.
bill collier -- president and chief executive officer
all right. well, thank you very much, everyone, for joining us this morning. we appreciate your interest and your questions, actually. so we look forward to a productive remainder of 2021, and we continue to be confident with further data from the 729 phase 1a/1b trial.
our progression of 729 into two additional phase 2a proof-of-concept studies, and data from our 836 clinical trial, as well as continued progress in our hbv discovery programs, that we'll be building on a strong foundation to achieve a functional cure for people with chronic hbv. and of course, we're also looking forward to leveraging our antiviral discovery and research efforts in progressing our pan-coronavirus discovery program. so with that being said, thank you again for your time. and, operator, that concludes our call this morning.

good day, and thank you for standing by. welcome to the arbutus biopharma corporation 2021 second-quarter financial results and corporate update conference call. at this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. after the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session.
[operator instructions] please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [operator instructions] i would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, ms. pam murphy. please go ahead.
pam murphy -- investor relations
good morning, everyone. on the call from the arbutus executive team are bill collier, president and chief executive officer; dave hastings, chief financial officer; dr. gaston picchio, chief development officer; and dr. mike sofia, chief scientific officer.
bill will begin with a review of the second quarter and first-half accomplishments, clinical development, and remaining 2021 corporate objectives, followed by dave hastings who will provide a review of the company's second-quarter financial results. we'll then open up the call for q&a, and mike and gaston will be available to address research and clinical development-related questions. before we begin, we'd like to remind you that some of the statements made during the call today are forward-looking statements, including statements regarding expectations for arbutus' proprietary hbv pipeline, and hbv and pan-coronavirus discovery programs, including potential clinical results and timelines for ab-729, ab-836, and future compounds. our expected cash runway and the potential for our drug candidates to improve upon the standard of care and contribute to a curative combination regimen for hbv.
these forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results to differ materially, including those described in the most recent annual report on 10-k, quarterly report on form 10-q, and other specific reports filed with the sec from time to time. bill? 
bill collier -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, pam, and good morning, everybody. thank you for joining us today. we appreciate your interest in arbutus biopharma. i'm very pleased to report on our significant progress so far this year and to outline our objectives for the rest of 2021.
we continue to drive toward our goal at arbutus, which is to focus primarily on developing a portfolio of products with different mechanisms of action, that when used in combination results in a functional cure for patients living with chronic hbv. during the first half of this year, we established a strong foundation toward achieving that goal by accomplishing the following: we continue to report compelling data on ab-729, with four abstracts at easl, including a late-breaker oral presentation that showed substantial declines in hepatitis b surface antigen in subjects with chronic hbv. importantly, 729 continues to have a favorable safety and tolerability profile, and all four of these abstracts were selected for best of easl conference. notably, in addition to reporting significant drops in surface antigen, we saw that in three out of five evaluable subjects, and increased hbv-specific immune response, providing support for combination therapy, including immunomodulatory agents.
this compelling 729 data derived from up to one year of dosing supports our view that 60 milligrams every eight weeks is an appropriate dose in our phase 2a clinical trials. and i'll discuss these trials in just a moment. looking forward, we expect to provide additional data in the second half of 2021, including initial data for a 90-milligram every 12-week cohort in hbv dna negative subjects and initial data on a 90-milligram every eight-week cohort in hbv dna positive subjects. as we've discussed in the past, we believe that 729 has the potential to be a cornerstone therapeutic in future hbv combination regimens.
therefore, our strategy has been to enter several clinical collaborations to evaluate 729 in combination with other agents with potential complementary mechanisms of action. and so i'm pleased to report significant progress toward this goal with our previously announced collaborations with assembly biosciences, antios therapeutics, and vaccitech, and also the authorization from the fda to proceed with our ind application for 729 in a clinical trial in combination with a nucleoside analog and short courses of peginterferon. now the antios collaboration will evaluate a triple combination of 729, the antios proprietary active site polymerase inhibitor nucleoside, which is called ati-2173, and viread, for the treatment of subjects with chronic hbv. the vaccitech collaboration will evaluate a triple combination of 729 with vaccitech's proprietary immunotherapeutic vtp-300 and standard-of-care nucleoside analog therapy for the treatment of subjects with chronic hbv.
the clinical trials evaluating 729 with interferon and antios' ati-2173 are expected to initiate in the second half of 2021. we expect to file the cta for the clinical trial with vaccitech's vtp-300 in the second half of 2021 and expect to initiate the clinical trial in early 2022. in addition to the substantial progress that we've made with ab-729, i'm also gratified with the initiation of a phase 1a/1b clinical trial with ab-836, our next-generation oral capsid inhibitor. this is an important program as it will allow us to potentially have our own proprietary combination therapy to treat patients with chronic hbv.
at the recent easl conference, arbutus presented preclinical 836 data suggesting the potential for increased efficacy and an enhanced resistance profile, relative to previous generation capsid inhibitors. initial data from healthy volunteers and hbv subjects is expected in the second half of this year. we continue to make progress in all of our discovery programs. we're focused on generating lead nomination candidates for our oral pd-l1 inhibitor and rna destabilizer programs.
in addition, our internal research program to identify new small-molecule antiviral medicines to treat covid-19 and future coronavirus outbreaks continues to progress. and so with that summary, i'll now turn the call over to dave hastings for a brief financial update.
dave hastings -- chief financial officer
thanks, bill, and good morning, everybody. as i've mentioned in the past, our key financial metric is cash and financial runway. our cash, cash equivalents, and investments was $121.3 million as of june 30, 2021, as compared to $123.3 million as of december 31, 2020. our cash use from operations for the first half of 2021 was $31.9 million, which was offset by $30.7 million of net proceeds on an issuance of common shares under arbutus' atm program.
for all of 2021, we expect our cash use to range from $70 million to $75 million, and therefore we expect our current cash runway is sufficient to fund operations through the third quarter of 2022. so with that, bill, i'll turn the call back to you.
bill collier -- president and chief executive officer
thanks very much, dave. so, operator, let's now open up the lines for q&a, please.

[operator instructions] your first question comes from the line of roy buchanan with jmp securities. please proceed with your question.
roy buchanan -- jmp securities -- analyst
hi. great thanks for taking the questions. i want to start on ab-836. bill, you mentioned the phase one results.
i think coming at the end of this year, you think can support the start of the combo phase two. just wondered if you could give a little more detail maybe what that phase two would look like. would you start with an initial 836 plus a nuc only to do dose finding? or would you go straight to a triple combination with your proprietary compounds? just kind of what would that look like?
bill collier -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. thank you very much, roy. great question. i think we've actually been saying for quite some time that it's always been our aim to have our own internal combinations.
so kind of logically in our mind, it makes sense to look at a 836/729 and a nuc combination trial. and we'll clearly share more details on that as next year evolves. i think the important point today is to to let everyone know that we're on track to deliver those 836 results by the end of the year.
roy buchanan -- jmp securities -- analyst
ok. great. and then, another 836 question, i'm not sure, probably you're not going to tell me what the chemistry is, but on the slide, it says it's a unique chemistry. maybe you can confirm it's not an hap or sba, and i can try to say their names, if you want.
but i think i think you guys know what those are. so is that possible you could confirm that?
bill collier -- president and chief executive officer
mike, do you want to take that one?
mike sofia -- chief scientific officer
yeah. this is mike to say. yes, i can confirm that it's neither of those.
roy buchanan -- jmp securities -- analyst
ok. great. and then, i had a question, it's kind of early, it's really early, but i wanted to get your guys thinking about potential pricing for a functional cure. i mean, is there any reason as a functional cure has found that it wouldn't be priced, let's say, similarly to the hepatitis c cures that were developed.
just give us maybe your thoughts around that.
bill collier -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, roy, thank you. i think, as you said in your question, maybe a tad early to get into pricing specifics. but i mean, there's obviously benchmarks of existing therapy. you've got benchmarks across other viral diseases.
and i think beyond that, it's very difficult for us to say. i will add, though, that one of our strategies, as i've mentioned, to have all the components of the functional cure within our own proprietary umbrella, is kind of relevant here because it allows you to set whatever the price is ultimately going to be without too much worry about economies to a third party or partner or royalties and so on and so forth. so one of the underpinnings of our strategy to find our own internal combo is not unrelated to your question.
roy buchanan -- jmp securities -- analyst
ok. great. i'll hop back in queue. thanks.
bill collier -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
your next question comes from the line of brian skorney with baird. please proceed with your question.
luke herrmann -- baird -- analyst
hi. this is luke herman on for brian. we were just hoping you could maybe talk a little bit about the upcoming reform data that j&j is presenting at aasld next week in terms of the implications it has for the field. and given the kinetics of response, what do you think of the stopping criteria at 48 weeks, do you think that's a sufficient time frame?
bill collier -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. so thank you, luke, for that question. let me make a couple of comments and then maybe gaston can be available for any additional comments. i think we've seen the abstract as have many other people.
i think may still be a little early for us to come in on competitor data until we see the full presentation and hear what janssen have to say. i would maybe just add a couple of additional points. our development strategy is around this three-pronged approach that we've talked about, which would include an rna therapeutic, a capsid inhibitor and immunotherapy. the data you just referred to, the rif data, includes an rnai therapeutic, a capsid inhibitor and a nuc.
and so, it may be that this further supports our strategy that an immunotherapy is needed in the treatment regimen to show continued improvement. i think a second point to make at this early stage is that it appears that the contribution of the capsid inhibitor in the j&j study may have been insufficient. and we clearly need to understand that more. but our capsid inhibitor, as you've heard on previous calls, 836 unique, and it's differentiated from other capsid inhibitors.
and in preclinical data, we've shown that therapeutically relevant doses 836 has increased potency and engages the second mechanism of action. so i think there is some differences when you look from capsid to capsid. and i think beyond that, we really just have to wait for the presentation next week and hear what the company say, and hopefully, that will help answer not just your question, but some of the questions that we have as well. so with that, gaston, any additional comments you want to make?
gaston picchio -- chief development officer
yeah. thanks, bill. i think you covered very well. in regard to the stopping rule, i think it was referenced in the question.
i think it's just one approach to stopping rules, a composite endpoint that they use, which appears reasonable. i think there may be different ones that are going to be used in the field. so we look forward to see what happens to patients when they're still based on that criteria after the presentation.
luke herrmann -- baird -- analyst
great. thank you.
operator
we do have a follow-up question from the line of roy buchanan with jmp securities. please proceed with your question.
roy buchanan -- jmp securities -- analyst
great. thanks. so i'll start with the easy one, one for dave. i guess any atm since -- i think the update was the october 8 prospectus was the last one.
have you guys used it since then?
dave hastings -- chief financial officer
yeah. i mean, we'll update everybody during our fourth quarter update in early march on that, roy. so we'll comment on that at that point.
roy buchanan -- jmp securities -- analyst
great. ok. and then, a couple -- maybe more complicated ones, and early again. but bill, your response to the pricing question, what are you guys thinking in terms of partnering.
i mean, it sounds like you want to retain as much ownership as possible. but if you -- presumably you go to regions like europe and china, are you also thinking you're going to retain ownership there? or will you likely partner?
bill collier -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. thanks for the follow-up question, roy. i mean, i think what i was trying to articulate is, if we have all of the individual components of a combination underneath in arbutus umbrella, it gives us more flexibility on pricing. i think the question that you referred to now, which is around how we access different markets around the world.
again, at this early stage, what i would say is that we are -- we remain open to different strategic approaches. and our head of bd is in regular contact with lots of different people. and my general approach is if we feel that a partnership is going to be the right way to access the market or enable us to meet the need of patients then that's clearly going to be good for the medicine and good for shareholders as well. so it may be that the individual components of the cure remain within the arbutus umbrella.
and potentially, we partner for different geographies, but we have -- we've clearly not talked about that, and i'm giving you a hypothetical answer to your question.
roy buchanan -- jmp securities -- analyst
yeah, still early. got it. that's helpful. and then, another early one, but the regulatory path, what do you guys envision the phase three and initial approvals looking like, is potentially 729 going to be approved as monotherapy with the nuc? or are you going to go for approvals of the combinations? how do you envision that playing out, i guess?
bill collier -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. so right now, what we're really focused on are these four different phase 2a proof-of-concept studies. and so, i think it's really important to underline this, that when it comes to our strategy of reduced suppress and boost, you can do that with different combinations of agents. and we're clearly testing out that hypothesis in these four phase 2a studies.
so i think, again, great question, roy. but i would like to see how 729 as a cornerstone agent performs in all of these studies and then to move into phase 2b, phase three accordingly. but i think you can determine that as we've set out these different proof-of-concept combinations, we are really looking for the combination to move forward, to get to a functional cure. gaston, do you want to add?
gaston picchio -- chief development officer
no, no. thank you. i think you covered it well.
bill collier -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.
roy buchanan -- jmp securities -- analyst
ok, great. thank you, guys. thanks for taking my question.

your next question comes from the line of ed arce with h.c. wainwright & company. please proceed with your question.
ed arce -- h.c. wainwright and company -- analyst
great. hi, everyone. thanks for taking my question. just one for me on 836.
obviously, data coming up here at the end of the year on your phase one study, and this would, as you mentioned, allow for a phase two presumably next year to really put together your initial combination studies wondering if you could talk a little bit about the data, what you're expecting in particular, given that a36, as you mentioned, is a unique capsid inhibitor and utilizes a novel binding site within the core protein dimer-dimer interface. i wondered if there's anything that you're looking from that data that could help support the differential profile that you expect?
bill collier -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. thank you, ed. so maybe mike sofia first and then gaston as it relates to the clinical data. mike?
mike sofia -- chief scientific officer
yeah. thanks for the question. so you're right. 836 is what we call our next-generation agent, right? and it differentiates itself significantly from earlier generation agents because of the high intrinsic potency it had, but also, as we have commented on many times, the the ability to engage this second mechanism, right? so the inhibition of the replenishment of the pool of cccdna, we believe will be a therapeutically relevant dose.
and i think one of the problems with the first-generation agents is that they -- the activity at the second mechanism was sufficiently less than the first mechanism activity puts that at relevant doses that they could give in the clinic, they just couldn't engage that. so when you do engage that second mechanism, clearly, we believe we're going to have a fairly robust response against reduction on rna, as well as dna, which is the primary mechanism. so i think we're looking forward to looking at that data. and looking at other biomarkers, hpv-related biomarkers to see back that second mechanism is playing an important role in the capsid space.
so we have a molecule that we're very excited about, has high liver exposure. so i think overall, we're anxious to see the data to see how this translates. gaston?
gaston picchio -- chief development officer
yeah, i think that's basically it we're going to be looking at that speed of both hbv dna and rna expression. and then, there is a little bit of a wildcard that we may be able to interrogate, which is the activity of the compound against resistant variants. we are not selectively enrolling patients with resistance, but we know that there are resistant variants out there. and if we, by chance, enroll some of those, we may be able to also an early read out as the activity of this new generation [inaudible] variance.
but that's a little bit something that we cannot control, really.
ed arce -- h.c. wainwright and company -- analyst
right. fantastic. great. thank you.
bill collier -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, ed.
operator
your next question comes from the line of keay nakae with chardan. please proceed with your question.
keay nakae -- chardan capital markets -- analyst
yeah. keay nakae, chardan. some questions for mike on the pd-1. first, mike, can you point us to any preclin data that you've published on your oral checkpoint inhibitor?
mike sofia -- chief scientific officer
well, we haven't published any specific preclinical data on the molecule that we nominated, right? i can point you to a major communication paper that we published looking at the very unique mechanism of how the small molecule works relative to, let's say, an antibody, right? so that, i can point that to you. we recently published that. i think it was the -- toward the middle end of last year came out. and also, in that paper, we showed the small molecule that we used, which was an earlier generation agent who does have that sort of antitumor effect.
so we were using an antitumor model because that was the most readily available model at the time we've now subsequently developed an hbv model that we're looking at molecules in animal model. so you can see in that work that we -- these small molecules do have very unique characteristics, both mechanistically and function very competitively with antibodies.
keay nakae -- chardan capital markets -- analyst
ok. i'll circle back with you to get that. and so, then, just kind of moving on then to both, i guess, the safety profile again, relative to an antibody, you should have some advantages there. but how do we then think about it, the safety as you move into combo therapies? and what would you be on high alert to look for there in terms of safety?
mike sofia -- chief scientific officer
well, as you know, in sort of the oncology setting, antibody-based checkpoint blockade does have some adverse events associated with that, right? and one of the things we wanted to do was circumvent that. and the concept that we used was really the small molecule concept. and the reason why we believe that this is going to be a solution to the potential adverse events is with an antibody, you have a very long action occurring, right? so you give one dose and it's sort of onboard for weeks and weeks. with a small molecule, we can take advantage of pk/pd relationships and essentially just dose enough of what we need to get to get the response.
plus, you can -- if there's any issue, we can actually remove drug because the pk wash-out of that. so that's one thing. the other thing is we have -- as we always do, is look at liver targeting, and so we have drugs that have high liver-centric characters. so these molecules have much reduced systemic exposure that, therefore, allows us to target hbv versus having sort of that systemic immune activation that we see with a typical antibody.
so i think those characteristics of these molecules, we believe will support a better safety profile. now, we're at to see that in the clinic, but i think we're pretty excited about the overall profile of these molecules and the potential.
keay nakae -- chardan capital markets -- analyst
yeah. i guess, where i'm going with that, mike, is with the -- certainly the destabilizer, there were some tox issues, oral compound. so again, when we get to a point where you're combining these in your eventual all oral solution. how should we think about any synergistic toxic issues, we might be concerned about?
mike sofia -- chief scientific officer
sure. so obviously, each of these molecules work by a different mechanism of action. there are different chemical entities in and of themselves, so they'll have different characteristics. we clearly, in all our preclinical and nonclinical studies are very careful in ensuring that we don't have any drug-drug interaction issues associated with that.
now, we can't predict exactly what's going to happen clinically, but we do combination studies in preclinical models to assess the compatibility of these molecules from agonist or antagonistic standpoint. we get some sense of safety read or on the combination when we do combination studies in vivo. so i think we're doing all the things that one needs to do to have a sense of confidence that these molecules will perform in the clinic and perform safely, but really the clinical setting is going to be the tell of the theory.
keay nakae -- chardan capital markets -- analyst
ok. well, thanks for that.
operator
your next question comes from the line of kelechi chikere with jefferies. please proceed with your question.
kelechi chikere -- jefferies -- analyst
yeah. thank you and good morning. i guess, a single question for me here. i guess, on this going debate as to what the appropriate stopping criteria should be for many of these combination therapies.
how was -- for the new component, can you opine and discuss a little bit more about that and what you think stopping criteria should be? and i guess related to that, with the 729, you've demonstrated the ability to increase hb-specific immune responses, could that potentially be added on as a component of what could be a stopping criteria for your combination studies?
bill collier -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. thank you, kelechi. i'm going to hand that one over to gaston.
gaston picchio -- chief development officer
so yeah, great question. i mean, look, i think as i was just trying to say, i think different groups will come up with different stopping criteria. there is no single as far as i know, unified stopping criteria. and usually, stopping criteria are composite end points.
it doesn't just factor, for example, a concentration of s-antigen can do -- include s-antigen plus, for example, hbv dna and alt criteria. i think we will know whether which is the most appropriate stocking criteria once we see what happens to the patients after they stop, old therapy. and for example, if one chose 100, and then we see that there is a high relapse. but if one chooses 10 as part of the composite endpoint, and there is less relapse then one can conclude, obviously, that 10 is better than 100.
but we're not there yet. we don't have that data. so i think we'll be -- i mean, for lack of a better term, i think we'll be try on there. i think we'll have to try different things.
there is no even straight consensus on how to stop standard of care today with no therapy. so people use different things. but as we repeated the number of occasions, for example, 100 iu per ml in patients who have been for many years on nuc therapy is a criteria that's used in, especially in asia. now, you're right about what we've observed in three out of five patients that we were able to measure in cohort e of our ongoing 729-001 study.
the challenge there is immune constitution would be a criteria. it's something that cannot be measured really quickly to make that decision. as you know, these t cell assays are very labor-intensive requiring the collection of preferred blood mononuclear cells, and they cannot be just run like a viral load in an automated way and sandalized way. so i think it's a very good idea.
i hope that we can find maybe some surrogate indicators of t-cell reconstitution perhaps something in line with the measurement of soluble cytokines interferon gamma comes to mind that can be more readily and rapidly run in the clinical lab in a standardized way. but that will be the challenge ambition of including t cell constitution -- t cell immune reconditions to hbv as part of the criteria.
kelechi chikere -- jefferies -- analyst
got it. thank you. that's very helpful. thank you.

ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the arbutus pharmaceutical biopharma corporation 2021 third quarter financial results conference call. [operator instructions] please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [operator instructions] i would now like to hand the conference over to lisa caperelli, vice president of investor relations. please go ahead.
lisa caperelli -- vice president, investor relations
thank you, angie. good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining arbutus' third quarter financial and business update call. joining me today from the arbutus executive team are bill collier, president and chief executive officer; david hastings, chief financial officer. dr.
gaston pgo, chief development officer; and dr. mike sofia, chief scientific officer. bill will begin with a review of recent accomplishments and clinical developments, followed by mike sofia, who will provide an update on our research efforts with an oral pd-l1 inhibitor. dave hastings will then provide a review of the company's third quarter financial results.
after our opening remarks, we will open the call up for q&a. gaston picchio will be available to address clinical development-related questions at that time. before we begin, we'd like to remind you that some of the statements made during the call today are forward-looking statements, which are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results to differ materially, including those described in our most recent annual report on 10-k, quarterly report on form 10-q and our other periodic reports filed with the sec from time to time. i'll now turn the call over to bill.
bill? 
bill collier -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, lisa, and thank you, everybody, for joining us today. we really appreciate your interest in arbutus biopharma. now, this morning, we issued our third quarter financial and business update press release, which highlights the significant progress we've achieved this year toward our goal, which is to develop a proprietary portfolio of products with different mechanisms of action, but when used in combination result in a functional cure for patients living with chronic hepatitis b. we're taking a three-pronged approach that's intended to: one, reduce hbv surface antigen; two, suppress hbv dna; and three, boost the host immune system and intend to accomplish this with our rnai therapeutic 729, our oral capsid inhibitor-836, and our oral pd-l1 program, where we recently commenced ind-enabling studies.
so i'd like to start by walking through the clinical advancements we've made with this approach, starting with reducing surface antigen with our lead compound 729, the rnai therapeutic. as you know, 729 is specifically designed to reduce all hepatitis b viral antigens, including hepatitis b surface antigen. and we're seeing this activity in our ongoing phase 1a/1b clinical trial. in fact, data to date has shown that ab-729 consistently provides a mean 1.8 log reduction in hep b surface antigen which is sustained over time in patients with chronic hbv.
in addition, 729 continues to show a favorable safety and tolerability profile. also, to -- in addition to reporting significant drops in s antigen, some 729 patients have shown increased hbv-specific immune responses, which further supports our rationale for combination therapy to include an immunomodulatory agent. now, next week, at aasld, we will report additional data from additional cohorts of patients in this clinical trial in a poster presentation. and in that presentation, among other things, we will show that 729 repeat dosing remains generally safe and well tolerated.
we'll show that robust mean declines in surface antigen were sustained with repeat dosing of 729 with no meaningful differences observed to date between 60-milligram or 90-milligram doses or dosing intervals, which included every four, eight or 12 weeks. and we'll also show that s-antigen suppression to levels below 100 international units per ml, which is a clinically relevant threshold, which could inform when stop therapies is maintained in some subjects up to 20 weeks following the last dose of 729. as we continue to unveil more data with 729, we continue to believe that the drug has the potential to be a cornerstone agent in future hbv combination regimens. our strategy is to evaluate 729 in combination with our own novel agents and with other approved or investigational agents with complementary mechanisms of action to set foundation for future trials.
now, we've made great progress in advancing 729 in clinical trial development. this quarter, we initiated and dosed the first patient in our own phase 2a randomized, open-label proof-of-concept clinical trial to evaluate 729 in combination with ongoing standard of care in new therapy and short courses of peg interferon in 40 patients with chronic hbv infection. based on clinical data from our phase oneprogram, we selected 60 milligrams every eight weeks as the dose and dosing schedule for this trial and other trials. we're currently in the process of opening sites, screening patients, and we will provide further updates on this trial when appropriate.
and then, from a collaboration standpoint, 729 is being evaluated in an ongoing phase 2a triple combination trial with assembly biosciences lead hbv core inhibitor and a nucleoside analog. assembly is conducting this trial and expecting to see data in 2022. also, activities to initiate separate phase 2a clinical trials with antios and vaccitech are ongoing. we expect that the arm that will include 729 in the antios clinical trial will commence this quarter and that the vaccitech clinical trial will initiate in early 2022.
both trials are designed to evaluate a triple combination of 729, a nucleoside analog and either the antios or vaccitech's proprietary agent. i'd now like to move on to the second arm of our approach that's to suppress hbv dna with our next-generation oral capsid inhibitor 836. now, 836 is specifically designed to completely block viral replication in infected cells by preventing the assembly of functional viral capsids. preclinical data suggests that 836 may have the potential for increased efficacy and an enhanced resistance profile compared to previous capsid inhibitors.
preliminary data from healthy volunteers and hbv patients in our phase 1a/1b clinical trial is on track to report out by the end of this year. and these data may support the initiation of a phase two combination clinical trial with our own proprietary compounds. the third arm of our approach is to boost the immune system, which we hope to do with our oral pd-l1 program, for which we recently commenced ind-enabling studies. and after my prepared remarks, i'll turn the call over to mike sofia to provide more details about this exciting compound.
now, ultimately, we strive to have a convenient, all oral combination treatment for hepatitis b patients. and to achieve that, we are progressing our research efforts with an oral rna destabilizer program and look forward to providing updates on our lead optimization efforts in 2022. in addition to our efforts in hbv, our internal research program to identify new antiviral small molecules to treat covid-19 and future coronavirus outbreaks continues to make progress. so as you can see, despite the challenging impact of the pandemic, the team at arbutus has been relentless in their efforts to continue the advancement of our clinical and research programs to meet our corporate goals to address the needs of patients and to increase shareholder value.
i really am very grateful for the team's commitment and dedication to finding a cure for hepatitis b and for the treatment of coronaviruses. so with that, i'll turn the call over to mike sofia for an update on our pd-l1 program. mike?
mike sofia -- chief scientific officer
thanks, bill, and good morning, everybody. as bill mentioned, we are focused on a three-pronged approach to developing a cure for chronic hepatitis b and key to that is to boost or reawaken the immune system. given this, we have nominated for ind-enabling studies, an oral pd-l1 inhibitor that could potentially be an important part of a combination therapy for the treatment of hbv. let me start with an overview of why we believe the pd-1/pd-l1 will an immune checkpoint access is a viable target for effecting immune reawakening in the context of hbv.
it is well established that the immune system in hbv chronically infected individuals is tolerized to the recognition of the virus or infected cells. it is also believed that highly functional hbv-specific t cells are required for long-term hbv viral control in the setting of functional cure. however, hbv-specific t cells become functionally defective and greatly reduced in their frequency during chronic hbv infection, immune checkpoints such as pd-1/pd-l1 play an important role in the induction and maintenance of a new tolerance and in t cell activation. it is well established that the pd-1/pd-l1 signaling pathway in immune cells plays a critical role in the human immune response to farm pathogens.
after the initial immune response to a pathogen an increased expression of pd-1 and its binding to pd-l1 leads to down regulation of the immune response. in cancer biology, the upregulation of the pd-1/pd-l1 axis has been linked to immune tolerance resulting in the development of several important immune therapies. similarly, the pd-1/pd-l1 axis has been implicated as having a role in hbv-specific immune polymers. it has been shown that hbv-specific t cells in the blood and liver from chronically infected hbv patients express pd-1 levels.
and this level correlates with s-antigen load. pdl-1 has been shown to be upregulated dombiohepatitis, and pd-1 has been shown to be upregulated on hbv-specific t cells, and s-antigen specific b cells. ex-vivo studies using hbv patient blood and liver samples, has demonstrated that hbv-specific t and b cell responses are improved with checkpoint blockade. it has been our long-standing strategy to combine agents that reduce the hbv-specific immune tolerizing antigen s antigen with agents that to further reawaken the immune system.
therefore, we hypothesized that one approach to reawaken hbv-specific t cells is to block the pd-1/pd-l1 protein protein interaction and hopefully break hbv-specific immune tolerance. support for this approach was observed in preclinical animal model studies where checkpoint blockade in combination with other direct acting no virus led to both dna clearance and sustained viral suppression. our resource efforts have identified a class of small molecule oral checkpoint inhibitors that we believe will allow for controlled checkpoint blockade enable oral dosing and mitigate systemic safety issues seen with checkpoint antibody therapies. from this class of small molecule pd-l1 inhibitors, we nominated a lead candidate based on in vitro potency, immune restoration, in vivo efficacy, selectivity and safety.
let me provide a little more detail in each of these research parameters. starting with in vitro potency. the pd-l1 bioassay ec50 was less than 20 nanomolar, which is competitive with external compounds. with respect to new restoration, this lead agent displayed primary human t cell activation in a preclinical model and restoration of t cell activity for chronic hepatitis b patient samples in vitro.
the in vivo efficacy showed favorable pharmacokinetic and antitumor efficacy in a preclinical tumor model. from a selectivity standpoint, the agent binds to pd-l1 with minimal binding to off-target in vitro, the agent has an acceptable safety profile based on progressible in vitro safety pharmacology and in vivo mouse tolerability studies. the small molecule pd-l1 inhibitor possesses in vitro intrinsic activity and functional activity both in wholesale systems in animal models that are equivalent to known pd-l1 antibodies. based on this preclinical work, this compound is now in ind-enabling studies.
i'm excited by the advancements that we've made to identify this lead compound, which we believe as an acceptable safety profile and functional activity play a key role in our combination approach to finding a cure for hbv. i'll now turn to dave hastings for a brief financial update. dave?
dave hastings -- chief financial officer
thanks, mike, and good morning, everybody. as i've mentioned in the past, our key financial metric is cash and financial runway. our cash, cash equivalents and investments was $151.9 million as of september 30, 2021 that compares to $123.3 million as of december 31, 2020. our cash use from operations for the nine months ended september 30, 2021, was $47.9 million, which was offset by $75.4 million of net proceeds from the issuance of common shares under our atm program.
for all of 2021, we expect our aggregate cash used to range from $70 million to $75 million. and therefore, we expect our current cash runway to be sufficient to fund operations into the second quarter of 2023. with that, i will now turn the call back to bill. bill?
bill collier -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. thanks so much, dave, and to you, mike, as well. so operator, maybe now is the time to open up the lines for the q&a session.

operator
thank you [operator instructions] our first question comes from roy buchanan with jmp securities. your line is open.
roy buchanan -- jmp securities -- analyst
hey. great. thanks for taking the questions. appreciate the details on the litigation stuff.
first question on 836. anything you can say about what to expect from the data later this half. you've shown good reductions in viral dna at 100 milligrams already. any early thoughts about how the program might take shape in the second half? and then looking at the slide, just to verify cohorts, i&j have not started, correct?
bill collier -- president and chief executive officer
gaston is on the call this morning. gaston, do you want to take that question?
gaston picchio -- chief development officer
sure. hi, roy. so let me start with the last part of your question. i&j have not started yet.
right now, we have -- we're conducting the three first cohorts, the 50, the 100, and the 200-milligram cohorts and the data will be reported in the first half of this year. once we have the data, i think we'll decide on the next steps. we have already some plans in mind, but we need to see the final data before making those final.
roy buchanan -- jmp securities -- analyst
ok. great. and then you guys had a case of rash and an alt elevation earlier. i'm not sure if you can say, but any additional observations of either of those events?
gaston picchio -- chief development officer
we cannot comment on that. i think the data will be reported at the time when it's reported in the first half of the year.
roy buchanan -- jmp securities -- analyst
ok. great. just thought i'd try. and then what's gating for starting the phase 2a with vtp-300? and then you mentioned in the slides starting a phase 2b, assuming positive results.
do you think that would be a larger triple combo trial? or do you think you might be able to work in an additional core inhibitor or some other agent have a quadruple combination?
bill collier -- president and chief executive officer
so the vtp-300, it's already approved in some of the countries where we are going to be executing the study. so it's just a question of activation of clinical sites and so forth. so it will -- hopefully, we'll be starting very soon. i think we indicated in the first half, but already has been filed in a number of countries, and we just got some approvals.
secondly, in terms of the phase 2b study, yes. so we obviously, from 836 to make those final decisions as to whether 836 will be part of the mix for a larger phase 2b study. we also want to see some of our preliminary data in combination with interferon as well. and also, we want to see other data that's emerging in the field, for example, checkpoint inhibition.
so there's a number of pieces of data that we are looking forward to see in the course of this year that will help us shape our final phase 2b strategy. we cannot really define what that will be at this point in time.
roy buchanan -- jmp securities -- analyst
ok. great. and one, just check the box for dave, and then i'll jump back into the queue. the net cash burn, $90 million to $95 million this year.
i just want to double-check. does that include both components of the qilu payments in january? thanks.
dave hastings -- chief financial officer
well, yes. no. so the cash burn is a net cash burn. the only thing that really reduces that is the onpattro [inaudible] royalties, roy.
and in terms of revenue recognition for the qilu agreement, that $40 million was received in january. so the accounting really starts in q1. we would expect to defer that revenue recognition over a period of time as we transfer the technology to manufacture ab-729 to qilu? and that might take a couple of years.
roy buchanan -- jmp securities -- analyst
ok. thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from dennis ding with jefferies. your line is open.
dennis ding -- jefferies -- analyst
hi. good morning and thanks for taking the question. two for me, if i may. first question is on our hepatitis b.
can you just talk about what you'd like to see from the various triple combo studies reading out in the second half? and what do you want to see to give you confidence that there will be a higher probability of success for functional care, which i would think is coming 2023, 2024? and then my second question is around your protease inhibitor. i don't really think people are really appreciating that you guys have this asset. so can you just comment on when that will go into the clinic? and can you just talk about your ideal drug profile there? specifically, how has preclinical studies panned out in terms of potency and your projected human pk? thank you very much.
bill collier -- president and chief executive officer
gaston, do you want to take the first one, and then we'll have mike sofia talk about the protease.
gaston picchio -- chief development officer
yes. sure. can you repeat because you're breaking up a little bit when you were asking the hbv part of the question, please repeat the question?
dennis ding -- jefferies -- analyst
yeah. yeah. sure. can you just talk about the data that's coming in the second half for your triple combo studies? and what you'd like to see to give you more confidence that there will be a higher probability of success for functional cure?
gaston picchio -- chief development officer
sure. so when it comes to the -- specifically when it comes to, for example, the interferon study, what we would like to see, hopefully, is a deeper s-antigen decline and hopefully some of the participants in the study getting to undetectable levels on treatment. something that, as we've reported, we have not seen with 729 and nuc pretty much nobody has been with an sirna and nuc. so the addition of interferon, we believe it's going to contribute to a deeper, maybe faster s-antigen suppression.
obviously, then that's when it comes to that particular study with additional interferon then. we have another interesting piece of data that's coming out, which is what happens after stopping nuc therapy in patients who have been on 729 plus nuc for 48 weeks, then they stop 729 for an additional 6 months, and now they are eventually stopping the nuc. there, i think we would like to see two things. one is whether the s-antigen either is sustainable, reduced at the lower levels that we are requiring to be able to stop the nuc, which is below 100 iu per ml.
and secondly, we would like to see what happens to hbv dna, whether hbv dna comes back, or we see a relapse like pretty much everyone sees after something nuc or is hbv-dna hold back as a result of the additional maybe 729, which also could lead to a different concept, not necessarily functional cure, which is completely of s-antigen but could lead to a sustained biological response, which is hbv does not come back after stopping all therapies, which potentially could be beneficial for the patients as well.
mike sofia -- chief scientific officer
yep. hi, dennis. this is mike sofia. so the answer to couple of your comments.
look, as far as a profile for the molecule, we are certainly clearly aware of the developments in the field. and so our molecule, we're definitely trying to target to have a profile that differentiates it from what else is out there. for example, i could say that we want a molecule that we don't need [inaudible] boosting like [inaudible] requires. we believe that's a disadvantage for general patient population.
we clearly want an oral once-a-day dosing regimen to be competitive in the space. and clearly, a molecule with very competitive, if not exceptional potency overall. so i think those are the general characteristics that we're looking for. now as far as where we are, we have -- we're in sort of lead-optimization here.
we expect -- fully expect to nominate the compound in the second quarter of this year, sort of the latter part of the second quarter of this year, and then obviously rapidly move into ind-enabling studies and move as quickly as possible to get that molecule into the clinic. so that's sort of the general overall profile and plan that we have, realizing that there is a sense of urgency for us and our program, but also for patients and trying to identify ways to accelerate the ind-enabling study aspects of this program.
dennis ding -- jefferies -- analyst
thank you. that's helpful.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from ed arce with h.c. wainwright. your line is open.
ed arce -- h.c. wainwright and company -- analyst
hi, everyone. thanks for taking my questions. congrats on a very productive year. first question is on ab-836.
as i'm looking across the many data readouts that you plan to have this coming -- or this year, it would appear this is the only one in the first half. part 3, i think you mentioned earlier cohorts i&j have not started yet. so just wondering the additional data, could you give us a little more detail on what you expect any more either additional data from previously enrolled cohorts or the initial take from cohorts i&j.
gaston picchio -- chief development officer
so i mean, as we said, i mean, the data will be reported in the first half. so really, i can't comment on any additional results from those that we reported back in december of 2021 on the 100-milligram -- on the 100-milligram cohort, which looks very promising, the 3.1 log drop in hbv dna. i think places 836 as among the most competitive of inhibitors with a point with a very good safety profile. so i think we have to wait until we report the totality of the data for the 50, 100, and 200.
if -- as i mentioned, we have started i&j, but if we have any preliminary data on i&j by the time we are ready to report, we will report that as well. but that depends on recruitment speed. i think given what we've seen so far with [technical difficulty] i think it's fair to say that we are very confident that 836 is going to emerge as a very strong capsid inhibitor. and again, i mean, just to reiterate what i said before.
we need to see that data and analyze it critically to decide whether 836 should move forward in combination with 729 and other agents. given what we've seen so far, i think i would lean to say yes. but i think we have to see the totality of the data for making the final decision. but given what we've seen so far, based on the 3.1 log decay in hbv dna, it looks like a very strong contender and that can contribute significantly to a combination of regimen.
ed arce -- h.c. wainwright and company -- analyst
right. great. ok. and then turning to 729.
as you mentioned, three readouts. it looks like all in the second half with peginterferon, vebicorvir, and the aspin compound all combination trials. maybe you could give us a little more clarity on sort of the order of these, if it's possible, perhaps which at first, it would appear, perhaps that aspin, the aspin trial, combo that's completed perhaps that one is first? and then i have a follow-up.
bill collier -- president and chief executive officer
yes. so let me just comment on that, and then i'll hand over to gaston as well. so as we mentioned this morning, the study with antios, that's the one study in our lineup where the majority of the patients were recruited in ukraine. and although that was a study that i think was close to completion, we're just really not sure right now how we can follow up those patients in an efficient or typical manner.
so that's why we have tweaked our guidance today and just indicated that for that study, we may be able to report some limited data on a fewer number of patients. but that's one study where clearly, the ukraine situation has had an impact. now our other studies, i should point out, we've got a fairly well-distributed set of sites in different countries and that's why we're maintaining our guidance on the interferon study and the assembly applicable study. i just wanted to kind of cover that off and then hand over to gaston.
gaston picchio -- chief development officer
so i think as we indicated, the three studies in collaboration, i think will be reported in the second half. when it comes to the 729 data [technical difficulty] the first half or the second half as everyone knows, i mean, obviously, there is an important lever meeting that has been shifted, but still is within the first half. so that's always a good opportunity to present our data in a scientific forum. and then in the second half, obviously, there is meeting where the data could be presented.
we prefer to share the data with the scientific community to get it scrutinized in a more scientific way. so those are the two options that we have. the 729 data is going to be more distributed along the year than the second.
ed arce -- h.c. wainwright and company -- analyst
ok. that's helpful. it was -- your audio was cutting in and out a little bit, but i think i got the gist of what you were saying. a couple more quick follow-ups, if i may.
just on the data readouts. i wanted to get your take, if possible, and this is either for michael or gaston. on the efficacy readouts from these combo trials, obviously, looking at hp s-antigen declines. and looking at certain things like the proportion that is below lower limit of quantification or the hbv dna or rna that is not detectable.
just wondering, as you collect that data and analyze it from these trials later this year, are there, in your mind, any sort of minimum proportion of patients or any sort of specific thresholds that you're looking for, just to be helpful.
gaston picchio -- chief development officer
no. no. i'll start. and we don't have a predefined prescale or portion of patients that need a certain-criteria like at least, just say this as an example, because 50% of the patients have undetectable hbv r.
so we will just look at the data in [technical difficulty] we'll determine what those proposals are, but we don't have any predefine. when it comes to s-antigen, obviously, aspirationally, we will have to see as many patients as possible, losing s-antigen either [technical difficulty] or after treatment is continued. but we don't have [technical difficulty] proportion of patients.
ed arce -- h.c. wainwright and company -- analyst
ok. fair enough. and one, just one quick last question. around the use of the atm, is this something that the company intends to continue as it did pretty extensively last year?
bill collier -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. i mean, i think we obviously the life science company and have to use all the tools in the toolbox to ensure that the companies appropriately capitalized. and while we don't pay out specific plans, that's certainly one element of our ability to fund the company. so i'll just leave it at that.
ed arce -- h.c. wainwright and company -- analyst
great. thanks so much for answering my questions.
gaston picchio -- chief development officer
thanks ed.
bill collier -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, ed.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from brian skorney with baird. your line is open.
brian skorney -- robert w. baird and company -- analyst
hey. good morning, everyone. thanks for taking my question. mike, i was hoping you could give us a little bit of a background on the discovery process of ab-101.
i know developing small molecules to disrupt protein-protein interactions has been tough, but when successful, it's been pretty successful. so can you kind of walk us through how 101 interacts with pd-l1? is it a pd-1 non-medic? and maybe you could give us details on what the molecular weight is? and have you shown any data on oral bioavailability from the preclinical work so far? thanks.
mike sofia -- chief scientific officer
yes. sure. sure. we did present a little bit of data at hepdart 2021.
so look, the molecules are in the slightly larger molecular weight range, ok? i would say, around 700 or so. however, we had good oral bioavailability for these agents. now the process that we have gone through, there have been some historical data published on some small molecules that bind to pd-l1 that we sort of jumped off on and sort of introduced some very novel aspects to it ourselves and then began to investigate how these molecules work. and the way these molecules work is not like a typical antibody, which basically binds and blocks.
what they do, is they bind to a specific site on pd-l1. they cause dimerization of pd-l1 is on the surface of the cell. this results in an internalization of the protein and ultimate degradation of that protein. so this happens actually really quite quickly.
and so you then sort of have the significant depletion of pd-l1 on the cell surface. this then translates clearly into a very similar phenotype that you would see in an antibody. in fact, we showed that these pd-l1 small molecules do result in immune reactivation in hbv-specific t cells by looking at interferon -- interferon increases. we see, in fact, an in vivo animal model given an oral once-a-day dose of this agent and this is in an mc38 tumor model that we see reductions in tumor size that are comparable to the use of antibodies.
so that will be using atezolizumab as the comparator. so these molecules do work by different mechanism, but ultimately provide the same biological outcome that one sees we're using in antibody. so the process that we've gone through is clearly to identify molecules that bind to the receptor that have this functional effect of internalization and then obviously doing typical pk assessments to optimize the pk profile that we're interested in and then evaluate from an in vivo model to see if that translates to in vivo efficacy and obviously move forward from there. so i hope that answers your question.
brian skorney -- robert w. baird and company -- analyst
yes. it did. thank you very much, mike.
operator
thank you. and we have a follow-up from roy buchanan with jmp securities.
roy buchanan -- jmp securities -- analyst
hey. thanks for taking the follow-up. just really quick on the 729 phase 1. you mentioned that patients coming off of 729 and the nuc.
just wondering if you could give us a sense of the data that we'll see how long they'll be off the nuc maybe. thanks.
bill collier -- president and chief executive officer
gaston?
gaston picchio -- chief development officer
yeah. it's difficult to say. let me just point out the following. in that study that we've amended to give that option to investigator and participants.
they obviously stopped 729, and they're being off 729 for six months. and after that point, after being off 729, they have the option to discontinue the nuc. and again, this is not, let's say, mandated by the protocol. it was an option that investigators and the patients have based on certain criteria that we have not disclosed.
the moment that they choose to do that, they're being follow-up, obviously, very carefully to -- for safety reasons and also to monitor whether s-antigen continues and so the client goes back up or hbv-dna and other biomarkers as hbv rna and so forth. the duration after that follow-up is going to be very variable because some patients have chosen to stop a while ago, others are doing that as we speak. so it's going to be a wide range of follow-ups. i cannot really pinpoint what the exact follow-up time will be by the time we do the data cut to present that data.
roy buchanan -- jmp securities -- analyst
ok. thank you.
operator
thank you. and i'm showing no further questions in the queue. i'd like to turn the call back to management for any closing remarks.

good day, and thank you for standing by. welcome to the arbutus biopharma corporation fourth quarter and year-end 2021 financial results and corporate update conference call. [operator instructions] i would now like to hand the conference to your speaker today, lisa caperelli, vice president of investor relations. please go ahead.
lisa caperelli -- vice president, investor relations
thank you, katherine. good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining arbutus' fourth quarter and year-end financial and business update call. joining me today from the arbutus executive team are bill collier, president and chief executive officer; david hastings, chief financial officer; dr. gaston picchio, chief development officer; and dr.
mike sofia, chief scientific officer. bill will begin with a review of recent accomplishments and clinical developments, followed by dave hastings who will provide a review of the company's fourth quarter and year-end financial results. after opening remarks, we will open the call up for q&a. gaston picchio and mike sofia will be available to address clinical and scientific-related questions.
before we begin, we'd like to remind you that some of the statements made during the call today are forward-looking statements, which are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results to differ materially, including those described in our annual report on 10-k being filed later today. with that, i'll turn the call over to bill. bill? 
bill collier -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, lisa. good morning, everyone. thank you for joining us. we appreciate your interest and your support of arbutus biopharma.
this morning, we issued our fourth quarter and year-end financial and business update press release, which provides updates on our clinical and preclinical programs directed at finding a functional cure for patients with hepatitis b and the treatment for coronavirus infections, including sars-cov-2. if i had to sum up the past year in one word, it would be transformative, and i'll explain why. in 2021, the arbutus team did a fantastic job of advancing our proprietary early research compounds into ind-enabling studies. specifically, our oral rna destabilizer that we now refer to as ab-161 and also our oral pd-l1 inhibitor, which we're calling ab-101.
the potential addition of the pd-l1 inhibitor, ab-101 in a proprietary combination with our rnai therapeutics 729 and our capsid inhibitor 836, would allow us to explore our three-pronged strategy to provide a functional cure for chronic hbv infection. as you know, this three-pronged approach consists of suppressing surface antigen, reducing hbv dna and boosting the immune system. now the potential role for the rna destabilizer 161 in our approach is the opportunity to provide a proprietary oral treatment regimen for hbv. we're excited about this progress and look forward to completing the ind-enabling studies for both of these compounds in the second half of this year.
now, in addition, we secured both strategic and clinical partnerships that in line with our strategic initiatives, allowed us, first of all, to initiate multiple combination clinical trials to evaluate 729 as a cornerstone therapy with other compounds in patients with hbv. secondly, we expanded the geographic reach of 729 to china to address the largest hbv patient population. and thirdly, we've been able to broaden our pipeline to include development programs against coronavirus infections. and i'd like to elaborate on the strategic accomplishments, starting with our combination trials with our lead hbv compound 729.
with the compelling safety and efficacy data from our phase 1a/1b clinical trial, in 2021, we moved 729 into three phase 2a clinical trials to evaluate 729 as a cornerstone therapy in combination with one or more approved investigational compounds. as enrollment continues or is near completion in these trials, data is expected in the second half of this year from our clinical trial evaluating 729, a nucleotide analog and interferon as well as data from our partnered trial evaluating 729 with assembly's core inhibitor. now with respect to our partnered program with antios' liver-targeted nuc, as we mentioned in our press release today, enrollment is complete in this cohort. however, the majority of patients were enrolled in ukraine, which obviously is currently in a state of war and these patients may be lost a follow-up before completing the study.
therefore, arbutus and antios may report limited data on a reduced number of patients from this clinical trial. also, as a reminder, we do have a fourth phase 2a combination trial that we expect to initiate in the first half of this year to evaluate 729 combined with vtp-300, that's the vaccitech therapeutic vaccine and a nuc. our goal is to utilize the learnings from all of these trials to provide insights with the potential to de-risk the use of our proprietary compounds in combination with 729 to develop a functional cure for hbv as well as to support our go-forward clinical and regulatory strategy for phase 2b development. now let's move on to expanding the geographic reach of ab-729.
at the end of last year, we executed an important strategic partnership with qilu pharmaceutical, one of the leading pharmaceutical companies in china. for us to reach the largest hbv patient population in need of a functional cure for chronic hbv infection, it was essential to find a strategic partner with significant experience in developing, manufacturing, and commercializing products in mainland china, hong kong, macau, and taiwan. as part of our discussions, qilu conducted extensive diligence before completion of the agreement. based on their belief and the potential of 729 to be a safe and effective treatment option for hbv, qilu paid us $40 million upfront and made a $15 million equity investment in arbutus along with potential additional payments of up to $245 million, consisting of certain development, regulatory and sales milestones.
finally, as part of this transaction, we're also entitled to receive double-digit tiered royalties up to the low 20s percent on annual net sales of 729 in their territories. this is one of the largest early clinical deals conducted with a chinese company. as important, this partnership also allows us and qilu to maximize the potential clinical value that 729 can bring to the millions of underserved patients in china. as we collaborate with qilu on a clinical development strategy for 729 in china, we plan to provide updates on our progress.
now finding a functional cure for patients with hbv remains a key initiative for arbutus but we also recognize the urgent need to identify new antiviral small molecules to treat covid-19 and future coronavirus outbreaks. we've expanded our pipeline to include preclinical programs targeting coronaviruses. we're focusing our research efforts on two essential targets critical for replication across all coronaviruses, those being the nsp5 protease and the nsp12 polymerase. in december, through our partnership with x-chem and proteros biostructures, we identified unique and differentiated pan-coronavirus assets that inhibit the sars cov-2 nsp5 main protease or mpro, which is a validated target for the treatment of covid-19 and potential future coronavirus outbreaks.
we recognize the importance of rapidly developing oral small molecules in addition to vaccines to address this pandemic as it transitions to an endemic phase. to that end, we intend to advance an mpro clinical candidate into ind-enabling studies this year. we are also continuing to lead optimization activities for an nsp12 viral pylorimrase candidate. now aside from our progress in our research efforts and partnerships to achieve our strategic initiatives.
in 2021, we continued to build convincing safety and efficacy data with ab-729 and ab-836. both of these compounds are undergoing rigorous evaluation at various dose levels and dosing intervals in cohorts of patients with various baseline characteristics. this comprehensive body of evidence that we're building gives us the confidence that the dose and dosing interval we intend to advance into later-stage clinical trials will be best suited to be safe and effective. this year, we anticipate reporting key data for ab-729 that will include new on-treatment data on multiple cohorts of patients included in the phase 1a/1b clinical trial as well as long-term follow-up data for patients who completed treatment and have discontinued ab-729 and nuc therapy.
we also expect to report additional ab-836 data from part 3 of the phase 1a/1b clinical trial that will inform potential future clinical trial development. i'm proud of the enormous progress the arbutus team has made this last year to position the company for multiple key clinical milestones and significant growth in 2022. and i look forward to keeping all of our shareholders informed of our progress and planned continued success. now lastly, as you saw in our press release on monday, along with genevant sciences, we filed a lawsuit in the united states district court for the district of delaware against moderna and an affiliate of moderna, seeking damages for infringement of certain us patents in the manufacture and sale of mrna-1273, that's moderna's vaccine for covid-19.
the patents relate to nucleic acid lipid particles and lipid verticals as well as compositions and methods for their use. as you may recall, in december 2021, the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit rejected moderna's appeal of a prior decision of the us patent trial and appeals board holding all claims of the asserted 069 patent to be patentable and dismissed moderna's appeal challenging a similar finding of patentability with respect to certain claims of the asserted 435 pattern. moderna had initiated interparties review ipr challenges against these patents in 2018 and 2019. now arbutus and our licensee genevant do not seek an injunction or otherwise seek to impede the sale, manufacture, or distribution of mrna-1273.
however, we do see fair compensation for moderna's use of our patented technology that was developed with great effort and a great expense, without which moderna's covid-19 vaccine would not have been successful. now i do recognize that this litigation is a great interest to our shareholders and that many of you will have questions. we believe that the lawsuit we have filed is the appropriate way to resolve our claims. i ask that you'd be patient with us as we will not be able to provide any additional commentary on our allegations or our litigation strategy aside from what is in the publicly filed complaint other than to say we intend to pursue all appropriate avenues to defend our intellectual property rights.
with that, i'll now turn the call over to dave hastings for a brief financial update.
dave hastings -- chief financial officer
thanks, bill, and good morning, everybody. as i've mentioned in the past, our key financial metric is cash and financial runway. our cash, cash equivalents, and investments was approximately $191 million as of december 31st, 2021, as compared to approximately $123 million as of december 31st, 2020. the ending cash, cash equivalents, and investments balance as of december 31st, 2021, does not include the $40 million upfront payment and a $15 million equity investment received in january 2022 from qilu pharmaceutical as part of the exclusive licensing agreement and strategic partnership to develop and commercialize ab-729 in china.
our cash used from operations for the year ended december 31st, 2021, was $67.5 million, which was offset by approximately $135 million and of net proceeds from the issuance of common shares under arbutus's atm program. for 2022, we expect our aggregate cash use to range from $90 million to $95 million, and therefore, we expect our current cash runway to be sufficient to fund operations into the second quarter of 2024. i would like to now discuss the relationship with genevant, especially as it relates to the moderna patent infringement lawsuit that was filed on monday. now back in 2018, along with roivant sciences, we launched genevant as a company that focus on rna-based therapeutics.
we licensed genevant rights to our lnp technology for rna-based applications outside of hbv, and we currently have a 16% equity interest in genevant. now under this licensing agreement, if genevant receives proceeds from an action for infringement by any third parties of our arbutus' intellectual property license of genevant. we would be entitled to receive after deduction of litigation costs, either 20% of the proceeds received by genevant or if less tiered low single-digit royalties on net sales of the infringing product, inclusive of the proceeds from litigation or settlement, which, in that case, would be treated as net sales. so with that, and in closing, we have established a strong financial foundation to advance the company's mission to develop a functional cure for hbv and a treatment for covid-19 and potential future coronavirus outbreaks.

thanks very much, dave. and operator, why don't we open up the lines now for q&a.
",2021-Q4,ABUS
,0.7615,,,":
operator
[operator instructions] our first question comes from the line of roy buchanan of jmp securities. your line is now open.
roy buchanan -- jmp securities -- analyst
great. thanks for taking the questions. i guess i'm going to start on the coronavirus program. you guys are targeting a pan-coronavirus approach for both the protease and polymerase, i believe.
can you just tell me if the polymerase shows the same level of conservation across the coronaviruses as the protease? and then maybe just looking forward too far a bit, but you kind of view the larger opportunity as something more broad possibly used in primary care, possibly against the common cold coronaviruses? or do you think the larger opportunities potentially hospital use government stocking?
bill collier -- president and chief executive officer
mike, would you like to take the first one?
mike sofia -- chief scientific officer
yes. right. i'll answer the first part. so yes, when we chose these two targets, we chose them because both are highly conserved across all known coronaviruses.
so the idea of both a pan-coronavirus nsp5 main protease and one paying coronavirus for nsp12 viral polymerase are all still in play for us. so yes, we are looking at a general pan-coronavirus strategy.
gaston picchio -- chief development officer
and the approach would be to look at treatment first, but it wouldn't be impossible to think about prophylaxis prevention strategies of coronavirus as well.
mike sofia -- chief scientific officer
i think just to add to question on that. i mean if you look at paxlovid, certainly, the pfizer compound did reduce hospitalizations, but has now been shown not to have any effect on pre-exposure prophylaxis, which is an area that we would like to enter into.
roy buchanan -- jmp securities -- analyst
yes. i'm assuming you're not going to need ritonavir and maybe you'll have better lung accessibility, etc. so -- looking forward to the next generation of compounds. the question on 161, i guess it sounds like -- i'm not sure if you guys have discussed this previously, but it sounds like the conclusion is that the neuropathy is an on-target effect.
is that correct?
mike sofia -- chief scientific officer
well, i mean, we haven't definitively proven that. but certainly, the data that we have accumulated today seems to point to that. and that's why our strategy was developed as we described it. if we can get a liver-centric agent that minimizes peripheral exposure, we believe we can overcome the peripheral neuropathy concerns.
roy buchanan -- jmp securities -- analyst
ok. great. and have you guys disclosed the amount for the ratio of the liver levels to the serum?
mike sofia -- chief scientific officer
no. we have not yet disclosed that.
roy buchanan -- jmp securities -- analyst
ok. great. i'll hop back in queue. thanks.
operator
our second question comes from the line of dennis ding of jefferies. your line is now open.
dennis ding -- jefferies -- analyst
hi. good morning. thanks for taking the question. two questions for me, one on hep b.
can you just please comment on the two phase ii triple combo data that's coming at the end of the year in terms of number of patients and duration of treatment? and what are the next steps you need to take to get the functional cure data? i guess, specifically, have you guys decided when will patients be taken off the drug? and then my second question is around the protease inhibitor. can you talk about the preclinical work you guys have done so far? have you run biochemical assays yet to measure potency? and how confident are you in the potency profile of this drug versus paxlovid?
bill collier -- president and chief executive officer
ok. thanks for your questions, dennis. gaston, do you want to take the first, and then we'll have mike sofia follow up on the protease.
gaston picchio -- chief development officer
sure. thank you. good morning. so in terms of the two phase iia studies, one the triple ones, one is in collaboration with assembly.
that study now is fully enrolled. it has 60 patients. and by the end of the year, we presumably will have on treatment data. we will not have the data at the end of therapy.
that's going to take a bit longer, but we will have -- but we believe it's meaningful data on treatment. in terms of what we expect, i mean, it's a little bit premature to say, but we obviously hope that the addition of the -- or the combination of the three directs will result in deeper and hopefully, on treatment loss of s-antigen. and obviously, we will see whether that happens or not. in terms of the triple with interferon, that's a relatively smaller study.
that study is enrolling, and we hope to have some preliminary on-treatment data as well by the end of the year. and i think in response to your question about, i mean, when we will stop patients, both studies call for stopping patients, but more importantly, our phase ia/ib study, it's already stopping patients based on the criteria that we defined. as i mentioned before, the criteria is multifactorial, but one of the important elements is the threshold of s-antigen, and we're using less than 100 to decide the patient is ready to stop nuc therapy. and obviously, we're following those patients after nuc therapy -- after stopping nuc therapy and trying to assess functional cure.
now one thing i want to point out that what we're doing in the phase i study is not happening uniformly across all patients. the study was amended to offer the opportunity for patients and investigators to decide whether they want to stop nuc therapy. and obviously, not everyone is opting to stop nuc therapy, although they may meet the criteria. so i cannot define exactly how many patients we will be presenting in the future.
bill collier -- president and chief executive officer
all right. and then, mike, on the protease?
mike sofia -- chief scientific officer
yes. so to answer your question about the protease, so we have a whole battery of studies that we do. so we do do biochemical intrinsic activity studies against sars-cov-2, but also protein mpro, but also the mpros from the other or, let's say, a representative set of other coronaviruses that we do. so we get this sort of sense of pan-coronavirus activity.
then we have sort of in vitro whole cell infectivity assays that we study the compounds again. again, it's not only sars-cov-2, but against other coronaviruses. we do a lot of, let's say, biophysical studies to ensure that we understand how these molecules are binding. we have done co-crystal x-ray structures.
so we know where they bind and it helps guide us doing some of the sort of lead optimization work that we continue to do with the compound. and as far as other coronaviruses are concerned, were our targets, so certainly, our main target is sars-cov-2 with the pan-coronavirus, but obviously, looking into the future, how one could potentially apply these agents to other coronavirus infections that are not sars-cov-2 sort of certainly a possibility, but we're focused on sars-cov-2 at this current time.
operator
our next question comes from the line of ed arce of h.c. wainwright. your line is now open.
thomas yip -- h.c. wainwright and company -- analyst
hi. good morning, everyone. this is thomas yip asking a couple of questions for ed. so first question regarding the 729-202 combination study with vtp-300 that was discussed earlier.
can you go over some more details of the study? how many patients should we expect to be in the study? and also any specific geographical focus there?
bill collier -- president and chief executive officer
yes. gaston?
gaston picchio -- chief development officer
sure. so that's a phase iia study where we start dosing with ab-729 and then patients get randomized into receiving vtp-300 or placebo. the vtp-300 is just a combination of two different vectors. one is [inaudible] causing hbv sequences and then mva causing also hbv sequences.
so the study is being done in collaboration with vaccitech. the study has already achieved some regulatory approvals in the different countries. but unfortunately, one of the countries that we selected to start the study was the ukraine. and as everyone knows, obviously, given the war, we will not be able to initiate screening and randomization in that country.
so we are now shifting our focus into other jurisdictions. we have other countries that were already planned that are going to be screening and randomizing patients very soon. but given the loss and the uncertainty with ukraine, we are also trying to identify other countries where we can move in as fast as possible.
thomas yip -- h.c. wainwright and company -- analyst
got it. understood. thank you for the details of the study. and then i believe there was one of the questions earlier regarding the two combination studies with 729 that we expect initial data in second half.
at which point we begin to expect a decision regarding which combination is more superior over than the others, and therefore, would be the one to move ahead in future clinical studies?
bill collier -- president and chief executive officer
yes. that's the intent. so i don't know if, gaston, you want to add any additional color. i think you can tell that we're working hard to try and assess the role that 729 can play in a variety of different combinations.
so once the data comes through, we'll be in a much better position to decide the go-forward combo. gaston?
gaston picchio -- chief development officer
yes. i think it's a little bit of a challenging question. it depends on the data, really. i mean the data, the interim data, for example, would be spectacular, then one could eventually make a decision at risk.
if one the size of the data is not clear cut, then you have to wait longer to decide whether it's worth pursuing one path or the other. so really, it is a very difficult question to answer at this point. and it's -- i mean, the only thing i can say is going to be data driven.
thomas yip -- h.c. wainwright and company -- analyst
we certainly look forward to the data in the second half of this year.
understood. thank you for taking our questions. we look forward to the data in the second half this year. thank you.
operator
our next question comes from the line of brian skorney of baird. your line is now open.
luke herrmann -- robert w. baird and company -- analyst
hey. this is luke herrmann on for brian. thanks for taking our questions. for the on-treatment data in the combos here, are there any other data points beyond us that you think might be indicative of a durable off-treatment effect? or is that really going to be the most informative data point for future plans? and then on 161, is there a chance we could see any of the existing preclinical data prior to the result of the ind-enabling studies? or will that be reassessed once the ind-enabling studies are done? thanks.
bill collier -- president and chief executive officer
ok. so gaston for the first one, then mike.
gaston picchio -- chief development officer
yes. great question. i mean it's very interesting the question because i think if you look at the recent final guidance on hbv drug development issued by the fda on april 6, s-antigen continues to be the main endpoint. so s will certainly play a very important role -- central role in making decisions.
having said that, as everyone knows, everyone is interested in other markers. and we are running those markers such as, but not limited to, hbv rna and core-related antigen. however, i mean, if you read some of the recent publications, there is a little bit of a mix. there are a little bit of a mixed bag regarding the value that these markers on treatment may provide in terms of predicting durable s-antigen loss response or functional cure, if you wish.
so we are trying to include as many as possible, whether their value is going to be proven. i can't really tell it at this point in time. but certainly, we're including things, biomarkers beyond s-antigen.
mike sofia -- chief scientific officer
yes. and on the 161 question. yes, it is possible that we would present at a scientific meeting in the not-too-distant future, some of the preclinical data on 161 to demonstrate superiority to 452. so that is a possibility.
there are a couple of opportunities clearly later this year that could provide that disclosure.
luke herrmann -- robert w. baird and company -- analyst
that's it. thanks. all right. thank you.
operator
and next, we have roy buchanan of jmp securities. your line is now open.
roy buchanan -- jmp securities -- analyst
i just wonder if you could give us any color on the potential -- on the presentation at easl, i think you said seven abstracts quite a bit. i assume there's going to be 729 data there. is it possible to see the cohort k data there? anything for 161? thanks.
bill collier -- president and chief executive officer
yes. good question. i'm going to throw that one to gaston. i think what we said in the press release is that we've had seven submissions approved for presentation.
but i think gaston, you can get some additional color based on what easl have produced.
gaston picchio -- chief development officer
yes. sure. so roy, i mean, if you go to -- obviously, we need to be very careful about we don't reach the embargo on disclosing what is it that we're going to be presenting, etc., etc. so i'm sure you appreciate that from our end.
so -- but if you or anyone goes to the easl website today, you can see that there is an orange link and it will list all of the abstracts that were approved in the first round of acceptances that easl did back in december. so -- and there, you will see that out of the seven that we announced, five are included in that list. and those range from an abstract on our pd-l1 checkpoint inhibitor. and there are some -- there's one on ab-836, our capsid inhibitor.
and then there's three on aspects of 729, immunology of 729 and cytokines, etc. and there is one on preclinical activity or durability of response of sirnas. so you can read the titles and if anyone can read the titles and see what the titles are all about. so that's how much i can say.
i cannot really say what we're going to be disclosing or including in the recently accepted two other presentations, which actually deal with 729.
roy buchanan -- jmp securities -- analyst
ok. very good. that's helpful. thank you.
operator
our next question comes from the line of keay nakae of chardan. your line is now open.
keay nakae -- chardan capital markets -- analyst
yes. gaston, can you update us on the status of enrollment part 3 for 836?
gaston picchio -- chief development officer
we haven't disclosed the status of enrollment of our part 3 studies. but i mean, as you will see, we are looking forward to presenting 836 data and as we indicated, including at least three cohorts.
keay nakae -- chardan capital markets -- analyst
ok. so the next data presentation for 836, it will be for three different patient cohorts in part 3?
gaston picchio -- chief development officer
part 3, yes. thanks. i mean -- sorry, part 3, it will include everything because we made a disclosure back in december on parts 1 and 2, but everything will be included.
keay nakae -- chardan capital markets -- analyst
right. three different dose levels from part 3 in the next data release?
gaston picchio -- chief development officer
yes. this is what was included in the -- basically, this is what was included in the design that we presented back in december. so part 1, part 2, and part 3 will be included in the presentation.
operator

good day, and thank you for standing by. welcome to the arbutus biopharma 2022 first quarter financial results and corporate update conference call. [operator instructions] please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [operator instructions] i would now like to hand the conference over to your first speaker today, lisa caperelli, vice president of investor relations.
thank you. and please go ahead.
lisa caperelli -- vice president, investor relations
thank you, operator. good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining arbutus' first quarter 2022 financial results and corporate update call. joining me today from the arbutus executive team are bill collier, president and chief executive officer; david hastings, chief financial officer; dr. gaston picchio, chief development officer; and dr.
mike sofia, chief scientific officer. bill will begin with a corporate update, followed by dr. sofia, who will provide an update on our preclinical programs. dave hastings will then provide a review of the company's first quarter 2022 financial results.
after opening remarks, we will open the call up for q&a. gaston picchio will be available to address clinical-related questions. before we begin, we'd like to remind you that some of the statements made during the call today are forward-looking statements, which are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results to differ materially, including those described in our most recent annual report on 10-k, quarterly report on form 10-q to be filed later today and from time to time in other documents filed with the sec. i will now turn the call over to bill.
bill? 
bill collier -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, lisa, and good morning, everybody. thank you for joining us. we appreciate your continued interest and support in arbutus biopharma. as you saw in this morning's press release with our first quarter 2022 financial and corporate update, we are on track to deliver on multiple key milestones across our chronic hepatitis b and coronavirus programs.
in fact, we anticipate reporting data from four clinical trials that are evaluating either 729 or 836 during this year. and importantly, as dave will discuss later in this call, we are well positioned financially with a projected cash runway into the second quarter of 2024. now before i turn the call over to mike sofia to run through the progress the team has made in advancing our proprietary early research compounds, i'd like to highlight some of the progress we've achieved toward our three-pronged hbv strategy to provide a functional cure for chronic hbv infection. as you know, that three-pronged approach consists of suppressing s-antigen, reducing hbv dna and boosting the immune system.
starting with our lead hbv compound 729, our proprietary rnai therapeutic. in clinical trials to date, 729 has shown a sustained reduction in s-antigen and in some patients, an increased hbv-specific immune response. to further assess this activity, 729, together with standard of care, nucleoside analog is currently being evaluated in combination with other approved or investigational compounds in two phase iia clinical trials with a third trial expected to begin enrollment shortly. the first trial, ab-729-201 is assessing the safety and tolerability of 729 plus interferon in patients with nuc-suppressed chronic hbv.
this trial initiated last year is continuing to enroll patients and is on track to report initial data in the second half of 2022. the second trial is being conducted by assembly bio and is evaluating 729 with assembly's core inhibitor, vebicorvir. late in the first quarter, assembly reported that this trial was fully enrolled with data expected in the second half of 2022. the third trial, ab-729-202 will evaluate the safety, antiviral activity and immunogenicity of vaccitech's therapeutic vaccine or placebo after administration of 729, again in nuc-suppressed chronic hbv patients.
sites are being activated for this trial with plans to dose patients in the first half of 2022. as we explore 729 in these phase iia clinical trials, the goal is to utilize these learnings to identify the best combination of compounds that we can then explore in phase iib as we focus on developing a functional cure for hbv. one last point i'd like to make about 729. we anticipate reporting additional key data from the phase ia/ib clinical trial, ab-729-001 at a medical conference this year.
that data will include new on-treatment data for patients enrolled in cohort k, which are hbv dna negative and e-antigen positive patients that received 90 milligrams of 729 every eight weeks. it will also include additional data for patients in cohorts e, f, g, i, and j. these cohorts assessed 60 milligram or 90 milligram every four, eight or 12 weeks as well as long-term follow-up data for patients who completed treatment and have discontinued 729 and discontinued new therapy. we're looking forward to seeing the treatment discontinuation data as this will be our first glimpse into potential functional cure data, albeit with a small subset of patients.
now in addition, our next-generation oral capsid inhibitor, ab-836, in combination with nuc therapy is designed to eliminate viral replication and reduce hbv dna. preliminary data that we reported last year from our clinical trial ab-836-001 has shown that 836 is generally safe and well tolerated and provides robust antiviral activity. we're on track to report data from this trial in the first half of 2022. now moving on to our coronavirus efforts.
we're focusing on identifying and developing new antiviral small molecules to treat covid-19 and future coronavirus outbreaks. our research efforts are focused on two essential targets critical for replication across all coronaviruses. nsp5 protease and nsp12 polymerase. we're continuing to advance our efforts to nominate an nsp5 protease or mpro clinical candidate that we can move into ind-enabling studies this year.
we're also continuing the lead optimization activities for an nsp12 viral polymerase candidate. finally, we continue to assess the potential opportunity in oncology with our oral pd-l1 program. i'm really proud of the progress that the arbutus team continues to make in advancing these compounds and look forward to sharing data throughout the year. i'll now turn the call over to dr.
mike sofia for an update on our hbv preclinical assets. over to you, mike.
mike sofia -- chief scientific officer
thanks, bill. in the hcv space, we have two important preclinical assets, ab-161 and ab-101, both of which are currently undergoing ind-enabling studies with the goal of completing those studies in the second half of this year. starting with our oral rna destabilizer, ab-161, i'd like to walk you through our rna destabilizer history and how we selected ab-161 as our next-generation compound. so in our quest to develop acute functional cure for chronic hepatitis b, we always believe that a small molecule rna destabilizer could provide a key piece necessary for providing a proprietary oral treatment regimen.
mechanistically, rna destabilizers target the host proteins, papd5 and 7, which are involved in regulating the stability of hbv rna transcripts. in doing so, rna destabilizers lead to the degradation of hbv rnas and, thus, reduce s-antigen levels and inhibit viral replication. this activity of rna destabilizers is supported by several preclinical proof-of-concept studies in multiple animal models. our first-generation rna destabilizer, ab-452, inhibited [inaudible] production in vitro and in vivo using an aav-hbv mouse model.
we discontinued development of this compound based on peripheral neuropathy findings observed in a 90-day preclinical safety study conducted in two species. despite this setback, we still believe that the hbv rna destabilizer mechanism of action is compelling and has the potential to lead to an all oral therapy for patients with hepatitis b. our vigorous research efforts led us to the development of our next-generation oral rna destabilizer or ab-161. the strategy for this compound was to focus on a liver-centric chemotype to reduce systemic exposure of free compound and mitigate the peripheral neuropathy seen with the earlier compound ab-452.
this was important that this new compound had differentiated chemistry compared to not only ab-452, but also any competitor rna destabilizer. in addition, we wanted to maintain the robust antiviral potency seen with the first-generation destabilizers. ab-161 was selected as the compound to advance based on antiviral activity seen in vitro. specifically, ab-161 showed potent antiviral activity in multiple hbv cell models.
it was active across all hbv genotypes, maintain activity against nuc-resistant variants. it was selective against hbv versus many other viruses that inhibit the production of multiple viral protein products and more specifically, reduced serum s-antigen in aav-hbv mouse models. to examine whether this liver-centric approach could avoid the peripheral neuropathy issues observed in our earlier compound ab-452, multiple adme, toxicology and pk studies were conducted. these show that ab-161 achieved a high liver to plasma ratio when administered orally in three species.
our studies concluded that ab-161 achieved a desirable adme and pk profile. in in vivo non-glp safety studies, we undertook an extensive assessment of several development compounds with particular focus on agents that demonstrated the cleanest profile as it related to the proper neuropathy concerns. to that end, we believe that ab-161 meets the high bar we set and showed an improved safety profile compared to ab-452. we are continuing to conduct ind-enabling studies with ab-161, including 90-day glp studies in two species to further confirm our belief in our strategy to address the safety issues seen with ab-452.
all of these studies are intended to give us confidence that we have a safe compound to move into clinical trials. now moving on to ab-101, our pd-l1 oral small molecule inhibitor. it has been our long-standing strategy to combine agents that reduce the hbv-specific immune tolerizing agent s-antigen with agents that can further reawaken the immune system. we believe we can do this with ab-101.
the immune system of hbv [inaudible] infected patients is tolerized to recognize the virus or infected cells. to achieve a functional cure and long-term hbv viral control, we believe that highly functional hbv-specific t cells are required. however, hpv-specific t cells become functionally defective and greatly reduced in number during chronic hbv infection. immune checkpoints such as pd-1, pd-l1, play an important role in the induction and maintenance of immune tolerance and in t cell activation.
therefore, we hypothesize that one approach to reawaken hbv-specific t cells is to block the pd-1, pd-l1 protein interaction and hopefully break hbv-specific immune tolerance. support for this approach was observed in preclinical animal model studies where checkpoint blockade in combination with other direct antivirals had both dna clearance with sustained viral suppression. through our research efforts and preclinical work, we selected ab-101 as a lead candidate based on in vitro potency, immune restoration, in vivo efficacy, selectivity and safety. ind-enabling studies are currently underway.
we look forward to sharing more data on both of these compounds as it becomes available throughout the year. i will now turn the call over to dave hastings for a brief financial update. dave?
dave hastings -- chief financial officer
thanks, mike, and good morning, everybody. as i've mentioned in the past, our key financial metric is cash and financial runway. our cash, cash equivalents, and investments was approximately $221.8 million as of march 31, 2022 as compared to approximately $191 million as of december 31, 2021. now during the three months ended march 31, 2022, we received a $40 million upfront payment from qilu pharmaceutical for the exclusive commercialization license agreement for ab-729 in greater china, $15 million of gross proceeds from qilu's equity investment and approximately $300,000 of proceeds from our atm.
these cash inflows were partially offset by $23.4 million of cash used in operations. we expect a net cash burn between $90 million to $95 million in 2022, not including the $55 million of proceeds received from qilu and believe our cash runway will be sufficient to fund operations into the second quarter of 2024. now in terms of our qilu transaction, we are accounting for the upfront and premium on the equity investment as deferred license revenue that will be recognized over time, currently estimated at two years, based on labor hours expended by our employees to perform our manufacturing obligations under the technology transfer and license agreement, including tech transfer assistance and clinical drug supply. so based on hours incurred, we recorded $9.6 million of revenue in the first quarter of 2022.
in closing, we are well positioned financially to advance our mission to develop a functional cure for hbv and a treatment for covid-19 and potential future coronavirus outbreaks. and with that, i will turn the call back to bill. bill?
bill collier -- president and chief executive officer
thank you very much, dave, and thanks to mike sofia as well. operator, i think we can now open up the lines for a question-and-answer session.
",2022-Q1,ABUS
,1.0,,,":
operator
[operator instructions] your first question comes from the line of roy buchanan from jmp securities. your line is open.
bill collier -- president and chief executive officer
good morning, roy.
roy buchanan -- jmp securities -- analyst
so the phase i in healthy volunteers that you're planning to study, do you need to or will you talk to the fda in advance of starting that trial? did you inform the agency of the recent results on the chp patients? and did they have any feedback?
bill collier -- president and chief executive officer
good questions. gaston is on the line with us this morning. so gaston, perhaps you'd like to answer that question.
gaston picchio -- chief development officer
sure. no, we haven't talked to the fda about this study. i'll remind everyone that 836 does not have an ind with the fda, so it was not necessary. actually, this is going to be done through an amendment to the existing study, phase ia/ib study that we're conducting.
roy buchanan -- jmp securities -- analyst
ok. great. that makes sense. and then for 729, the triple combo phase ii interferon and vebicorvir later this year, can you just help us understand the key data points we should be looking for, and which results from those trials are you going to view as a success?
bill collier -- president and chief executive officer
yes. what we've said is it's going to be initial data from those two studies. so i think that's important just to set expectations. gaston, is there anything else you'd like to add?
gaston picchio -- chief development officer
no. i think that really summarizes it.
roy buchanan -- jmp securities -- analyst
ok. i'll jump back in queue. thanks.
bill collier -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, roy.
operator
your next question comes from the line of dennis ding from jefferies. your line is open.
dennis ding -- jefferies -- analyst
hi. good morning. thanks so much for taking the question. two for me.
can you please remind us again your licensing agreement with alnylam around patisiran? i think consensus is modeling about usd1 billion in peak sales for alnylam's onpattro. and based on some of your commentary, it seems like you'd be getting a 2% to 3% net royalty. so this could potentially be a usd20 million to usd30 million annual royalty at peak. so can you confirm if that math is roughly in line with how you guys are thinking about it? and then, my second question is around hepatitis b.
assembly discontinued the vebicorvir because there wasn't really meaningful efficacy delta versus the doublet. so can you go into a little bit more detail there and your decision to keep the trial going? and perhaps how should this read through to your peginterferon study?
bill collier -- president and chief executive officer
yes. dennis, great questions. i'll let dave comment in a moment on the mechanics of the license agreement. what we are trying to do is make clear the specific percentages in our licensing agreements, and also, as i summarized this morning, the details of the sale of that royalty stream, the first royalty stream to omers and when it reverts back to us.
we're not making any projections about what alnylam sales might be or could be. i think that is something that we would refer you back to alnylam for in terms of what those sales expectations are. but we are being very clear this morning in what our percentages are and how those royalty streams work. so, dave, anything else you want to add before i turn to the other hep b question?
dave hastings -- chief financial officer
no, no, dennis's math is correct. once the royalty reverts back to us after omers receives usd30 million.
bill collier -- president and chief executive officer
and just remember, there are the two royalty streams, the one that we sold to omers and then there's the second one which is a slightly lower rate. your question around the phase iia studies. i'm not going to comment on anything that assembly has or hasn't said about vebicorvir. our view at arbutus is it's important once you've started a clinical trial to finish the clinical trial.
when you get to the end of the study, that's the best opportunity to make an assessment of the actual results. so that's what we included in our press release back then that the study continues with the collaboration [inaudible] in exactly the same way in which it was originally set up. and we look forward to presenting those results when it comes through. so i don't know that we can project anything either about the study or what it means for our own interferon study.
but i'll hand it over to gaston to see if there's any additional comments you want to make, gaston.
gaston picchio -- chief development officer
yes. no, i'll just make one comment, which is i think there's basically three types of data in clinical studies related to hbv these days, one is on-treatment response, the other one is end of therapy, and the other one is the follow-up. so as bill was explaining, we think it's important that we get to the end of the study. and once at the end of the study, we'll refer to even the follow-up period.
and i think we can make a good case for that based on our own 729-001 phase ia/ib study where i think we're starting to appreciate really the value of 729 after we discontinued patients. and if you look at the on-treatment data in that study, as many people have pointed out, the s antigen declines are very comparable across some of the other molecules in the field. however, when it comes to the discontinuation data, we're seeing really 729 performing very well, albeit the data is still limited, and the follow-up hasn't been extensive. but i'll just remind everyone that we don't stop patients as they have been stopping other studies such as in the janssen one where they stopped the two drugs at the same time.
we stopped first 729, then we waited six months and then we stopped the nuc. so when we say, for example, in our follow-up 24 weeks after discontinuing the nuc, it's really 48 weeks, almost a year after discontinuing 729 and still the dna and s antigen is holding. so going back to your question, what i'm trying to say here is that i think there's ways of evaluating the efficacy in a study. one aspect is on treatment, the other one is what happens at the very end of therapy, the week 48, and the other one is the follow-up.
so i think we need to wait for the end of the study.
dennis ding -- jefferies -- analyst
got it. thank you, guys.
operator
your next question comes from brian skorney from baird. your line is open.
brian skorney -- baird -- analyst
hey. good morning, guys. thanks for taking my questions. i guess to start, i have a question on conceptually the oral pd-l1 program.
i know there are a range of commercial pd-1 and pd-l1 inhibitors available that are therapeutic antibodies. just wondering your thoughts on exploring proof-of-concept studies with any of those to evaluate 729 plus pd-l1 as a mechanism before progressing on oral pd-l1 inhibitors to get a feel of what the combination could yield? and then, also on the onpattro questions. i was just wondering if you could review with us what the duration of the ip around the lnps and the deal with alnylam is. do the royalties last as long as onpattro is exclusive? or is there a specific ip expiration date when that royalty payment stops?
bill collier -- president and chief executive officer
so i'll get mike sofia and gaston just to comment on pd-l1 and whether or not we can do it for like a precursor study with a commercially available pd-l1. but i think the point i'd make before we get into that is what we're aiming for here [inaudible] pd-l1, which is hbv specific, which is oral, and therefore, which might potentially be efficacious without some of the systemic side effects that you get from some of the others. so with that, maybe mike sofia first and then gaston.
mike sofia -- chief scientific officer
yes. so for the pd-1, pd-l1 access, i think there's clearly mounting evidence supporting the role of checkpoint access in hbv, right? i think you had that early gilead study that was tantalizing about the role of the checkpoint access pd-1 and pd-l1 and showing, one, functional cure in a number of s antigen reductions in patients, and then more recently, you see the ascletis study where they took a checkpoint blockade agent and again showed some very interesting and tantalizing data there. so i think there's clearly mounting evidence to support that this access is going to be important in immune -- or is important in immune control for hepatitis b. as far as why we're doing small molecules, clearly, as bill mentioned, is severalfold, right? we have a belief that we're going to be able to target the liver and therefore reduce potential systemic activation of that checkpoint access because of the concerns of the on-target safety issues that one always sees in the oncology space.
and so, we believe that we're going to be able to circumvent those concerns and those issues with the approach that we're taking in a small molecule. and preclinically, we've also reported on and have more studies that we will report on in the future that clearly support the combination of an rnai plus a checkpoint blockade at immune activation and reduction in antigen load. so there's substantial evidence to support, i think, the approach that we're taking. as far as a proof-of-concept study, we've been discussing that potential internally, haven't really decided on whether a strategy of -- that would include an existing checkpoint blockade agent with 729 would provide the -- and the timing of it would provide substantial data to help us further develop our current agent going forward.
bill collier -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, mike. gaston, anything you want to add?
gaston picchio -- chief development officer
nothing from my end.
bill collier -- president and chief executive officer
ok. now, on your second question around the duration of the patent on onpattro and whether or not the royalties extend beyond expiry dates, i don't immediately have an answer to that question, unless dave does. i think we may have to get back to you on that one, brian. dave?
dave hastings -- chief financial officer
no, i don't have any clarification, but it's a typical agreement that would run through the patent life. but we'll confirm that with you, brian.
brian skorney -- baird -- analyst
ok. thanks.
operator
your next question comes from keay nakae from chardan. your line is open.
keay nakae -- chardan -- analyst
yes. thank you. a question about 729, when you provide us the next data update, can you tell us how many patients that you're following who've stopped ab-729 and stop nucs that you might report on in the next data update?
bill collier -- president and chief executive officer
right. so we have five so far, which is what we've spoken about, and there are more that have consented. i don't know that we have revealed the exact number. gaston, you can add?
gaston picchio -- chief development officer
yes. i can add a little bit more color there. if you look at the poster from easl, the discontinuation poster this year, you may see -- and we actually purposely included those subjects there. so we reported on the five for which we had follow-up after discontinuing the nuc, at minimum eight weeks as much as 24 weeks.
but we also included four additional subjects who had discontinued, but we didn't have meaningful follow-up what we consider meaningful follow-up, which will be more than eight weeks. so, for sure, those additional four subjects will be included in the next update. so at the minimum, there will be a follow-up on nine subjects.
keay nakae -- chardan -- analyst
ok. and there are some others beyond that who haven't -- aren't that far along?
gaston picchio -- chief development officer
yes. i can't comment about others, at this point in time. but for sure, we will have nine.
keay nakae -- chardan -- analyst
ok. and then, just back to the combo study with interferon, i know you're saying initial data, but what might that consist of?
gaston picchio -- chief development officer
so that will consist on-treatment data, basically. that's all we can say. it will be on-treatment data, preliminary on-treatment data.
keay nakae -- chardan -- analyst
ok. that's all i have. thanks.
bill collier -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, keay.
operator
your next question is from ed arce from h.c. wainwright. your line is open.
thomas yip -- h.c. wainwright -- analyst
hi. good morning, everyone. it's thomas yip asking a couple questions for ed. thank you for taking our questions.
so first, echoing 729 here. we've seen a substantial amount of data at easl and expecting a few more off-nuc treatment here and then with the combination study data in the second half. at which point should we expect the next company sponsored trial to begin and what that'd look like?
bill collier -- president and chief executive officer
sorry, thomas, you broke up there a little bit just at the end. i didn't catch the full question, sorry.
thomas yip -- h.c. wainwright -- analyst
so the last part of my question is what would the next major company-sponsored study look like, considering the phase iia looks like is near completion and data has been positive so far.
bill collier -- president and chief executive officer
i got you. all right. well, look, we've made no secret of the fact that it's our ambition to combine 729 with other agents. we would like that to be our own proprietary agents, whether it's our capsid inhibitor, potentially our destabilizer or our pd-l1, with the overall strategy being to suppress hbv dna, reduce surface antigen, and boost the immune system.
but i think we've also shown with our creative 2a combination strategies that were open to appropriate combination programs with other companies' assets as we move forward. it is still our belief, and i'll let mike and gaston comment on this in a moment, that we will need combination therapies for hbv with the continued goal of suppressing hbv dna, surface antigen, and then ultimately boosting the immune system. so the exact combination study, i don't know that we can specify it right now, but we do see 729 being a cornerstone agent in that particular therapy going forward. so mike or gaston, anything you'd like to add? maybe mike first.
mike sofia -- chief scientific officer
not for me, bill.
bill collier -- president and chief executive officer
ok. gaston?
gaston picchio -- chief development officer
nothing from me. thanks. i think you summarized it well. i think we need to wait to see a little bit what -- how the phase iia studies evolve.
bill collier -- president and chief executive officer
all right. do you have any other questions?
thomas yip -- h.c. wainwright -- analyst
yes. just one more from us, and as you pointed out, a combination, obviously, 836 core inhibitor is another key component there. and so, as we anticipate the phase i healthy volunteers study [inaudible], other than alt, can you highlight some other design elements, what else will you be looking at?
bill collier -- president and chief executive officer
ok. so, gaston, do you want to take that one? so in healthy volunteers, remember, so there's no hbv parameters to look at. gaston?
gaston picchio -- chief development officer
yes, i couldn't really -- there's a little echo there. but -- so was the question whether we will be evaluating other biomarkers? as bill pointed out, this is in healthy volunteer, so it's primarily safety that we're going to be evaluating in the healthy volunteer subjects. there will be no hbv biomarkers. was that the question?
thomas yip -- h.c. wainwright -- analyst
yes. that's pretty much, other than alt what else you'll be able to [inaudible] to point out safety. ok. we're looking forward to the data readouts in the second half.
bill collier -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
there are no further questions at this time. i would like to turn the call back over to the presenters.

operator
good morning. my name is abby, and i will be your conference operator today. at this time, i would like to welcome everyone to the arbutus biopharma 2022 second quarter financial results and corporate update. [operator instructions] thank you, ms.
lisa caperelli, vice president of investor relations. you may begin your conference.
lisa caperelli -- vice president, investor relations
thank you, abby. good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our second quarter 2022 financial results and corporate update call. joining me today from the arbutus executive team are bill collier, president and chief executive officer; david hastings, chief financial officer; dr. gaston picchio, chief development officer; and dr.
mike sofia, chief scientific officer. bill will begin with a corporate update, followed by dave hastings who will provide a review of the company's second quarter 2022 financial results. after opening remarks, we will open the call up for q&a. gaston picchio and mike sofia will be available to address clinical and development-related questions.
before we begin, i'd like to remind you that some of the statements made during the call today are forward-looking statements, which are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results to differ materially, including those described in our most recent annual report on 10-k, quarterly report on form 10-q to be filed later today, and from time to time in our other documents filed with the sec. with that, i'll turn the call over to bill collier. bill? 
bill collier -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, lisa, and good morning, everyone. thank you for joining us today. we appreciate your continued interest and support for arbutus biopharma. now, with the first half of this year behind us, we've made significant progress in advancing our preclinical and clinical programs in support of our mission to develop a functional cure for hepatitis b virus and to treat covid-19 and future coronavirus outbreaks.
furthermore, we are on track to deliver on multiple key milestones across these programs in the remainder of this year. and equally important in this volatile capital markets environment, we're well positioned financially to fund our current programs and provide runway into the second quarter of 2024. now, dave will discuss the financial aspects during the financial position summary shortly. now, we are making excellent progress with our two key hbv preclinical programs, that's ab-101, our oral pd-l1 inhibitor, and ab-161, our oral rna destabilizer.
now, rather than elaborate on these programs here, i'll refer you to today's press release for those updates and use the time on this call to briefly highlight the rather impressive data on our lead hbv clinical asset, ab-729, that's our rnai therapeutic. this data was reported last month at the easl international liver congress. now, as you know, patients with chronic hbv infection receive nuc therapy as standard of care. and while that therapy is generally safe and effective at reducing viral load, less than 5% of patients are functionally cured and usually only after many, many years of therapy.
in our clinical trial, ab-729-001, we wanted to see how treatment with various doses and dosing schedules of our rnai therapeutic in addition to nuc therapy was handled by patients with chronic hbv who had different baseline characteristics. if patients met certain predefined criteria and consented, we discontinued first their treatment with ab-729 and later their lifelong standard-of-care nuc therapy to see if their undetectable hbv dna status was maintained and if their s antigen reduction was sustained, which could be a sign of virologic control and potential subsequent functional cure. now, three major findings were disclosed from this clinical trial at the easl conference. first of all, we saw a robust reduction in surface antigen between 1.8 to 2.1 log reduction, and that was with 48 weeks of treatment, and the reduction occurred regardless of dose, dosing schedule, or baseline characteristics.
second, in addition to the meaningful and consistent surface antigen decline, we saw an increase in hbv-specific t-cells and a decrease in exhausted t-cells in patients treated with 729. and third, and what we believe to be of significant importance, when we stopped treatment with ab-729 and stopped nuc therapy in the first five eligible patients that consented, their surface antigen and their hbv dna responses were sustained at low levels while they were off treatment for at least eight to 24 weeks. now, in addition, none of these patients showed evidence of virologic nor clinical relapse, and so they did not need to restart their nuc therapy. we believe this data is most impressive as it shows that we were able to take patients off of their lifelong treatment of standard-of-care nuc therapies and still maintain reduced surface antigen and reduced hbv dna, a potential early indicator of functional cure.
we are continuing to follow these patients, as well as other patients that have consented to stop all therapy, and we anticipate reporting more data in the second half of this year. now, 729 is one of the most advanced rnai therapeutics for hbv. and based on the availability of public data, it's differentiated from other rnais based on its more convenient dosing schedule and immune activation capacity. we're also encouraged by the safety that we see in this and other ongoing trials.
and it's for these reasons that we continue to view ab-729 as a cornerstone agent in a potential curative combination treatment for chronic hbv, either with our own proprietary compounds, or with those in development by other companies, or with therapies that are already approved for the treatment of hbv. now, also at easl, we, along with many of our peer companies, reported data on the use of capsid inhibitors alone or in combination in the hbv treatment regimen. and while much of this data is early and inconclusive, our strategy is as follows. first of all, based on data from our ongoing phase ia/ib trial, some of which was presented at easl, we're planning to conduct a longer duration phase i study in healthy volunteers with our oral capsid inhibitor, ab-836.
as you will recall, we reported that 836 showed robust antiviral activity with greater than 3.5 log reduction in hbv dna. along with this impressive efficacy, however, we saw an increase in alts in some patients on the last day of treatment. and so, the goal of the longer-duration healthy volunteer study is to further characterize the safety of 836 by determining whether the alt flares we saw were beneficial or not before resuming dosing in hbv patients. second part of our strategy is that we are continuing, in collaboration with assembly, the phase iia proof-of-concept clinical trial evaluating the triple combination of 729 and assembly's core inhibitor, vebicorvir and nuc therapy, even though assembly has announced its plans to discontinue the development of vebicorvir.
at arbutus, we believe it's important to continue the conduct of this trial in order to fully and accurately assess the results. by continuing this phase ii triple combination trial and also evaluating ab-836 in healthy volunteers in our phase i study, we believe we will obtain data that will inform our use of capsids in a go-forward combination strategy in the development of chronic hbv treatments, as well as help to address open questions in the field. now, finally, we were gratified to see positive top line results announced by alnylam for the phase iii study of onpattro in patients with attr amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy. as you may recall, we're entitled to tiered royalty payments on global net sales of onpattro, ranging from 1% to 2.33% after offsets, with the highest tier applicable to annual net sales above usd500 million.
now, this royalty interest was sold to omers effective as of january 1, 2019, for usd20 million in gross proceeds before advisory fees. and omers will retain this entitlement until they have received usd30 million in royalties, at which point, 100% of the royalty interest on future global net sales of onpattro, which could include additional sales for the expanded indication if it's approved, will revert back to arbutus. now, to date, omers has received approximately usd14 million. in addition, we retained a second lower royalty interest ranging from 0.75% to 1.125% on global net sales of onpattro with the 0.75% applying to sales greater than usd500 million, and that royalty stream was not part of the omers transaction.
so as i wrap up my opening remarks this morning, i'd like to remind you of the key milestones we anticipate in the second half of this year. there are four: first, ab-729 follow-up data, which could include long-term on- and off-treatment data from our phase ia/ib clinical trial; second, initial data from both the phase iia combination trial of 729, interferon, and nuc therapy, and the triple combination trial with assembly's vebicorvir; third, we expect to complete the ind-enabling studies for both ab-101, our oral pd-l1 inhibitor, and ab-161, our oral rna destabilizer; and fourthly, we expect to advance into ind-enabling studies, a clinical candidate that inhibits the sars-cov-2 nsp5 main protease. i'll now turn the call over to dave hastings for a brief financial update. over to you, dave.
dave hastings -- chief financial officer
well, thanks, bill, and good morning, everybody. as i've mentioned in the past, our key financial metrics are cash and financial runway. our cash, cash equivalents and investments were approximately usd201 million as of june 30, 2022, as compared to approximately usd191 million as of december 31, 2021. now, during the six months ended june 30, 2022, the company received a usd40 million upfront payment from qilu pharmaceutical company related to a technology transfer and license agreement for ab-729 in greater china; usd15 million of gross proceeds from qilu's equity investment in the company; and usd300,000 of net proceeds from the issuance of common shares under arbutus's at-the-market offering program.
these cash inflows were partially offset by approximately usd44 million of cash used in operations. now, we still expect a net cash burn of between usd90 million to usd95 million in 2022, not including the usd55 million of proceeds received from qilu. and we believe our cash runway will be sufficient to fund operations into the second quarter of 2024. so, in closing, we are well positioned financially to advance our mission to develop a functional cure for hbv and a treatment for covid-19 and potential future coronavirus outbreaks.
with that, i will turn the call back to bill.
bill collier -- president and chief executive officer
thanks very much, dave. and our operator, abby, perhaps you could help us now open up the lines for our question-and-answer session.
