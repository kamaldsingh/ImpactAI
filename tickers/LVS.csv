rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you, daniel. good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. the last two weeks have been the most difficult in our company's history as we mourn the loss of our founder, sheldon adelson. sheldon, as you know, was a visionary.
he led the transformation of not one but three integrated resort markets, that being las vegas, macao, and singapore. he offered the mice-based integrated resort model in las vegas. he pioneered the development of the cotai strip in macao and reimagined the skyline of singapore to the iconic marina bay sands. his audacity to challenge the status quo transformed the entire market.
in las vegas, sheldon originated the convention-based integrated resort model when no one, and i mean no one, who believe in its viability or sustainability. today, las vegas conventions are synonymous. in the macao community, sheldon's vision for cotai defied the consensus thinking at that time. every element of macao is questioned by the skeptics, and i mean every omen.
a 3,000 room all-suite hotel, when the overnight tours market almost didn't exist, existing hotel inventory was very limited. the grand canal shoppes with over 300 retail stores in a market that had virtually no retail. a 13,000-seat arena and 1.2 million square foot convention center. he dreamt big but he also delivered, who developed a critical mass of world-class integrated resorts at a record speed.
before others could even dare to dream, he completed the venetian macao in 2007 and was the fifth year of our company's 20-year concession. his determination pushing forward diversification and investment in non-gaming in macao, was unwavering and breathtaking to be part of. our total investment account today exceeds usd 15 billion. we know that sheldon was a big believer of a strong, healthy, and cordial u.s.-china relationship.
he believed it was to the benefit of both countries to maintain a bilateral relationship based on mutual respect. the company, the board, and the family are absolutely committed to continuing sheldon's efforts in this regard. sheldon is irreplaceable as the visionary founder of our company, of the unmatched portfolio of integrated resort assets, and the management team he assembled to operate and expand the business in the future remain here in place, ready to work. the dna of the company that sheldon founded will remain ever-present.
the company with the full and wholehearted support of the board and the family will continue to honor sheldon's vision to protect and enhance his legacy. we look forward to the future and do so with a lot of confidence and optimism. while the pandemic continues to impact our business adversely, we have achieved positive ebitda in both macao and singapore in the fourth quarter, and there's no doubt, in my mind, our business was down to pre-covid levels in the future. in macao, the grand suite four seasons is now open, and the first phase of londoner macao will officially open in february.
we are very excited about the progressive unveiling of the londoner macao throughout the course of '21. sands china is well-positioned to capture a rebound in tourism when the pandemic finally does subside. we've always believed there's no better market for our company to invest in than macao. we will continue to invest in our resort product, nurture our local talent and, of course, support the local community, which we are grateful to.
in singapore, we remained very committed to long-term investment in marina bay sands, including both the upgrading of our existing facilities and the expansion of that property. on a principal note, i spent more than two decades with sheldon. and had both fun and the pleasure of working for and with sheldon. he was a great mentor, he was a great friend.
and i guess what speaks volumes about his generosity and decency is reflected in the decision to continue to pay our team members, even after the dramatically impacted our business. he was adamant that team members continue to receive pay and health benefits, even while we're closing our buildings and it was abundantly clear that our business will be hampered for quite some time. in the days since he has passed, we received condolences from around the world from global leaders, elected officials, business partners, investors, customers, and many of you joining us on the call today. we are touched by the outpouring of support, and we really appreciate that.
i am honored to have been invited by the board of las vegas sands and sands china to become the chairman and ceo of both companies. with the full support of the board and the family, i will work hard on upskilling team members, the management team to fulfill sheldon's extraordinary vision. i am confident, as sheldon in 1995, that this company will go from strength to strength in the future. for one final thought before we turn to questions, i look forward to the day, we can say, yield dividends.
thanks, we are ready for questions.

operator
[operator instructions] first question, sir, we have joe greff from j.p. morgan. line is open.
joe greff -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
good afternoon, everybody. before asking questions, i just i want to offer my condolences to all of you as well as the pair, man. rob and patrick, you were obviously particularly close. so it's a big loss, and he truly was one of the kind so my condolences.
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks, joe. we appreciate that. thank you.
joe greff -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
so my question and my follow-up, focus on macao and when we kind of look back at what's transpired with tourist investments from mainland china into macao, it's obviously been more slow -- the progress has been more slow than maybe what all of us anticipated, though it has shown some progress. other than the government having this intentional gradual easing of visas to obviously dealing with this little kind of thing called the global pandemic. are there any other policy issues or things that are maybe weighing in on visitation other than just simplistically visas are kind of being granted in conjunction with infection rates and vaccination rates and the like? and when you talk to folks in china, what specifically are folks looking at or metrics and improving metrics to sort of see a further easing of tourist visas?
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
we're fortunate to have both wilfred and grant on the call. i'm going to ask them to address that question, joe. gentlemen?
wilfred wong -- president, sands china
yes. grant, you want to talk first?
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes. why don't you guys take it? yes, grant and wilfred.
grant chum -- chief operating officer
yes. yes. i mean, joe, i think following the resumption of the visa issuance from late september, the business volumes clearly did rebound during the fourth quarter. and the recovery was led primarily by premium mass and luxury retail.
i think both segments actually did show good momentum throughout the quarter. so in december, we had a very encouraging month, especially the holiday season. we reached over 50% hotel occupancy during the month. and there were -- the peak days, we were achieving 8,500, 9,000 room nights, which obviously we haven't done anywhere close to that since january.
and if you look at the pace of recovery in retail, the luxury retail sales really took off during the quarter. and by december, four seasons' retail mall was up 16% over the prior year. actually, we had the best ever month that we ever had in four seasons mall tenant sales. so that's pre and post-pandemic, a record month.
so at issue here is what you referenced. there is just not sufficient visitation to power all segments of the business and to replace the volumes that we lost. so the base mass remains very subdued. macao only had 20% of the prior year's visitations during the fourth quarter.
so really, there's not a lot you can do about that. it's not a policy issue in the sense of they can do something now that they would not otherwise be doing in light of having to prioritize the control of the pandemic. and obviously, the authorities have done an excellent job in that regard. so what you have to remember is that during the fourth quarter, they had a number of many outbreaks, local cases in different provinces and cities in china.
and in october, november, they were relatively muted, and even for the first half of[audio gap]so the number of zones or districts that were classified as medium to high risk from a covid perspective was relatively few. but from about, let's say, the third week of december, the domestic cases started to rise in northern china. and what we saw was that a lot more districts, a lot more zones, and sometimes the whole cities were classified as medium to high risk, which immediately, obviously, puts a break on visitation from those affected zones or cities, but also the overall narrative and travel advisories related to covid becomes, obviously, a lot more cautious, and that impacts forward bookings. so from about mid of december, where up to that point, we were getting very positive momentum in terms of forward bookings in january and obviously, into chinese new year.
obviously, things have started to moderate from a forward booking and the pace of new bookings and obviously, the increase in cancellations. so that is directly related to the trending of the pandemic and some of these isolated outbreaks that we've seen, particularly in the northern provinces. so with that in mind, it's not easy to see a relaxation of the current guidelines in terms of travel. that sets the tone.
joe greff -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
that's helpful. and then i have a follow-up, just, i guess, more on -- so it may continue, this idea of macao policy, and maybe this is a question for wilfred or anybody on the call can answer. but do you think either macao or the central government in beijing want mainland chinese companies getting involved? with macao casinos, either by existing states or having board representation, is this something that's a priority for the government? so important? have there been discussions? i kind of remember hearing something along these lines maybe a couple of years ago as this potentially happening on the ground in macao a couple of years ago, but we're getting more questions and commentary on that of late. so anything you can shed on that would be interesting.
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
wilfred, grant, or patrick, you want to jump on that?
wilfred wong -- president, sands china
yes. i think the -- obviously, we have not been told of anything at this stage. consideration is now being given to what the conditions should be for the new concession. we have not picked up any nor have we been consulted on whether there should be the participation of chinese companies.
but we have to bear in mind that chinese companies are likely -- i mean, real chinese companies are likely to take part in gambling, which in china is considered not legal. so there were, in the past, some suggestions of people saying, state-owned enterprises might come in. i don't think this really in line for their policy consideration. whether private chinese companies would be allowed to participate in macao, and under what circumstances, these are things that have not been brought to us at all.
so the only thing i can say at this stage is that we will continue to do our best in macao and show that we are a locally rooted company because we are listed on the stock exchange in hong kong so we are just the same as any hong kong company and that we do everything, even better than other competitors.
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
joe, can i just jump on wilfred's very, very thoughtful comments. we've been going to beijing for around 20 years in macao, and having endless meetings. i know there's an outsized belief by some people who write these things, and they constantly opine their thoughts on how equity should be sold to chinese companies, and they're jumping up and down. i've never ever had a conversation with one person who mattered whoever said that to me or even made that comment, in fact, if anything, they kind of chuckle because to wilfred's comment, there's not a big appetite to invest in gambling.
so i think those -- i know it's very prevalent in the market. i hear quite a bit. i know that somebody wrote to me recently about how we could guarantee our licensure if we sell x percent. it all sounded very good, but one thing no one's ever said that, the government to us.
never heard that from anybody actually understands how macao and beijing operate. in fact, i think what we do here, it is a complete affirmation of what sheldon has always done, which is invest heavily, invest heavily in non-gaming activities, believe in macao, support your employees, and think they can grow. that's been the exact direction for it for at least the last five years. and before that, we heard more from his officials.
we've never heard them say, hey, you got to sell stake the chinese people or we've heard please support your employees, sheldon do that to achieve. we paid everybody through the pandemic. it costs a lot of money. we did it.
invest in the cap. i think sheldon, we've covered that already, $15 billion, invest in non-gaming. that's always been a direction. but not onetime, from no one i've ever heard, oh, you're a cyclone.
i want to hear that from these people who write these columns or have a belief that they understand the thinking over there. i did once knew a very, very good person, a very important guy in the chinese world, a businessman. and i suggest, so he started laughing, he said no one is going to buy into a chinese gambling company whether it's macao or las vegas because that's not what we're going to do. we found it kind of humorous actually.
so i know that's a common prevailing thought. but we don't hear it.
joe greff -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
thank you, guys.
operator
next question, we have carlo santarelli from deutsche bank. your line is open.
carlo santarelli -- deutsche bank -- analyst
hey, guys. thank you for taking my question, and i echo joe's sentiments about the recent loss.
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you for your kind words to us. we appreciate what you said. it was very kind and thoughtful. really appreciate it.
carlo santarelli -- deutsche bank -- analyst
thank you. if i could, just very simplistically. to the best of your understanding, how should we expect the concession renewal process to actually get moving? what do you guys foresee at the time line to when -- potentially, we could start to see some announcements as to the process and the time line for the process and et cetera? just in its simplest form.
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
i'm going to turn back to the fellows in macao. i think they're best suited to answer your query. wilfred, grant, help us.
wilfred wong -- president, sands china
yes. we are as eagerly waiting for the government's direction. because, as you all know, we only have about 17 months left before the concession expires. and we only know that the government is adopting a process, which includes public consultation on the performance of the concession is and that the targets of achieving diversification, that amendments to the legislation have to be introduced into the legislative council, and then the bidding process begins.
so it's a very tight timetable that we are running against. we also know that there is a legislative council election scheduled for september this year. so all these are coming into play, and we are coming up against a very tight timetable. we don't know whether this will begin very soon because right now, the government is all involved in the fight against the pandemic.
as we all know, macao cannot afford a single case because it was a public announcement by the government that if there is even one case, macao would be locked down again. so the government is putting all their energy into the fight against the pandemic to ensure that visitors can continue to come. so we don't know. the short answer is we don't know.
and when asked about this publicly, the chief executive said that anything is possible. i think he was asked whether there could be an extension or how soon can this be done. and his response was, anything is possible.
carlo santarelli -- deutsche bank -- analyst
great. that's very helpful. and then just as a follow-up. obviously, last quarter, you guys talked a little bit about the las vegas asset, potentially being open to entertain offers to that asset.
rob or patrick, does that influence potentially the timing of the return of the dividend? or do you think more about the dividend from the lens of when macao is back and marina bay sands is back, doing what they do, you'll be able to kind of reinstitute that?
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
patrick?
patrick dumont -- president and chief operating officer
it's patrick. so a couple of things. we have a very positive view in las vegas. i think long term, it's irreplaceable in terms of a tourist destination.
a huge amount of investment going into las vegas. we think there's a huge amount of potential pent-up demand just looking at other markets when there's been a return. and really, the restriction in las vegas now are based on the capacity constraints set by the government. on weekends, we're actually doing quite well.
there are days where we're actually almost at 2019 slot levels. it's really an interesting thing to see, and i think we're very positive on vegas outlook just generally. that being said, if there is a completion of the sale process, it's independent of the dividend. i think the key thing for us is that we need to see a return to operations.
we've had this discussion before on prior calls. we need to understand what the cash flow trajectory of the business is, the growth in that cash flow trajectory. you've heard grant mention the completion of some of the londoner milestones. that's a phenomenal product, and we believe it will be very cash flow generative in the quarters and years to come as it addresses our most profitable and powerful segment in macao.
so the way we'll look at the dividend is to evaluate our cash flow trajectory and the profile of the business and then make an assessment about how to restart it and sort of what the trajectory of that dividend would look like. but we're very focused on the return of capital. we think it's been fundamental to our shareholder return story. we think we have a growth component in our key markets.
we have a growth component and new growth opportunities and new developments. and i think as part of that, we look very heavily toward the dividend as our cornerstone and, of course, the share repurchases as well. so we're very focused, getting on the other side of the pandemic. hopefully, we'll see some positive in the upcoming quarters.
we have some green shoots in macao. we have some positive results in singapore and some positive results in las vegas here. and so i think over time, we'll have better visibility into the trajectory of the business. and then we'll make an assessment of the timing and the size of the dividend.
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
carlos, i just want to follow-up with patrick. there's one other issue with that. and that is the return of las vegas. there's been recent commentary, it's been fun to read about how las vegas will never return to pre-pandemic levels.
the best days are behind it. i've heard all of this before over the last 20, 30 years, about this town is right now on the back foot. there's no question about it struggling. but you can't help but think, there's this thing that is the vaccine or whatever it's going to take to fix this problem someday.
again, i want to reensure that we believe las vegas has plenty of gas in the tank. our demand for '22 through '27 convention is unbelievable. our customers want to come, and we remain very bullish on the return of las vegas. it may take longer than we want it to.
it may take till the end of this year, as we see a visitation spike. but please don't be among those people who have these ideas that this pandemic would put a hole in las vegas. and just the opposite, the demand will be there. this is a unique town.
we're going to have all the digital products out there you want. people want the visitation, and this town has a lot to offer. so we remain very bullish on the return post-pandemic.
carlo santarelli -- deutsche bank -- analyst
yeah. for sure, robin. thank you for that. and i understand that a lot of us on the call are looking forward to making our next trip out there.
i know i am. so thank you guys very much.
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
you're going to, i believe. looking forward to having you.
operator
next question, we have thomas allen from morgan stanley. your line is open.
thomas allen -- morgan stanley -- analyst
hey, and let me also send my condolence to you and the entire lvs and adelson family. mr. adelson was a true visionary and his successes will never be forgotten. so --
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you. thank you for your comments. thanks.
thomas allen -- morgan stanley -- analyst
so there have been a number of reports in the media over the past few weeks and months about you looking to supporting saying online gaming opportunities. can you just discuss your strategy there in a bit more detail?
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
sure. we're looking at a few opportunities, a multitude of opportunities in both regional and the u.s. and yes, we've looked at digital. and it's interesting, you can't deny the -- what's happened in digital is quite a space.
and we are exploring opportunities, looking at what might be out there. but with a caveat had, there's nothing to report today. there's nothing concrete. we're simply looking, learning, observing, and just -- there's been some commentary that it's my suggestion.
i want to assure you that sheldon -- this is another [inaudible] sheldon, who he was ethically, he understood digital, maybe too well before i did. and he believed in it. he just simply had this outsized ethical concern about people who couldn't afford it or people that were too young to use it. and he wasn't a believer in the technology could stop that.
he never questioned the viability of it. he questioned the ability to police it properly. and so the same way he paid people, hundreds of millions of dollars last year because he wanted to. it's an ethical consideration to sheldon.
so we've had this discussion prior to his passing, and we are going to explore it. and again, the cab is we are in the making-money business. so there's a way to make money, it's intelligent and prudent. and again, sheldon would be in the room saying, i'm laser-focused on returns and growth.
as you know, there's no numbers due for growth. even if [inaudible] whether it be in the u.s. or who to build more things. and we're not leaving the u.s.
where we want to build it. we've been all over the paper looking at different markets. so yes, digital is in a multitude of considerations. we are learning and observing and talking to people.
we are nowhere near a decision on that, and we will keep you apprised if something changes.
thomas allen -- morgan stanley -- analyst
and then just talking about u.s. developments on the brick-and-mortar front. there's been some chatter about new york and texas. what do you think the chances are in those states? and then how would you expect to -- how would you like to be positioned in those markets?
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
well, we've been looking at new york for, i think, about 100 years, it seems like. i don't think it's any secret that we're big believers in new york. we think it's extraordinary, the density population, ethnicity like it's a very good opportunity for anybody. and you can see -- i think it's almost -- it's close to $2 billion right now just on the facilities are there, without table games or decent rooms.
and we have a very good product, a good product there would be extraordinary. so we're definitely on the hunt. we've been pushing it for again for four, five years. we're excited by what came out of the new york group last week in terms of what they are considering.
there's an rfi out there. so we deepen on and looking seriously in new york on a whole bunch of levels. and it's still a long way to go before we ever see where they want to build and what they want to build, but we are going to be there. if it's real, and it's done properly, we think the returns could be sheldon-like, ok? so that's interesting.
texas, obviously, extraordinary market. we're kicking the tires down there, too, and another extraordinary market. you can't deny the power of texas, the size and scale. and i was there last week, and it was a fascinating couple of days.
and again, we're having conversations. we're looking, kicking the tires and we'll advise you when something emerges from texas. it would be a great casino market for a land-based store, whatever. it could be a huge opportunity.
so these are opportunities that with our balance sheet, our strength, we would jump in with both feet if it was the right structure.
operator
thank you. next question, we have robin farley from ubs. your line is open.
robin farley -- ubs -- analyst
great. thanks very much. and just echoing everyone else's thoughts about how sad it is to have this call without sheldon.
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you, robin.
robin farley -- ubs -- analyst
just a follow-up question. related to the sale of the lvs assets, the vegas assets, i mean, not specifically to the dividend. but just as, how much of a priority it is? were you just kind of answering an incoming call? or is it something where you see that there may be some strategic reason why you would sell those assets, i guess?
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
patrick?
patrick dumont -- president and chief operating officer
so i think from our standpoint, we are very returns focused. so as rob just mentioned, we're always looking at new opportunities and always looking at our portfolio to see how we maximize shareholder returns. and so as an entrepreneurial company, we're always active. so i think we should just look at this as if there's a way to maximize shareholder returns, we're going to do it.
and we constantly look at the assets that we have in our portfolio. we look at new growth opportunities, as rob just mentioned, and we talk about them. this is something that our team is very focused on. so that's really how we think about it.
robin farley -- ubs -- analyst
i guess if i could press a little more. i mean i guess what kind of appetite did you sense -- you sort of publicly confirmed it, which maybe would invite some interest, what kind of appetite, and you mentioned being returns focused. but almost anything that you would be interested in, new york or texas or other places, would be kind of project-specific financing, right? so it wouldn't necessarily -- you don't need the capital to free up to sort of put it to use in any other market. so i guess just trying to think about what kind of -- in this environment, what kind of appetite you think there may be for the assets?
patrick dumont -- president and chief operating officer
so i think there's a couple of different questions there. so first off, i think the way we think about our portfolio is we sort of evaluate projects on a case-by-case basis. so las vegas is a stand-alone entity. we've operated it for a long time.
we think it's a great asset. we think it has a great future. so obviously, we're focused on operating at this point. i think in terms of if we have additional capital to deploy, as you know, we have an expansion opportunity in singapore that we're very focused on.
and we think singapore is just a very special market. it's privileged, the fact that we're there. we love singapore and think the future for singapore is very strong, both as a leisure and business tourism market, and we're happy to have helped the government there, support its goals and continue to invest there. so we have capital that we can deploy there in the near term.
i think in terms of other opportunities, you hear some of the things that rob is talking about. we also have the return of capital consideration. so for us, capital allocation is front and center. we have these discussions with the management team and the board all the time.
so it's something where we'll look at our opportunities, look for a way to maximize shareholder returns. if we have assets where we think our returns are increased by transacting, we'll transact. and otherwise, we'll look to the sort of historical actions that we've taken in order to enhance returns. in the near term, it's also helpful to have additional liquidity.
right? so i think from our standpoint, as the pandemic recovers, it's nice to have additional liquidity on the balance sheet, which is the reason why we're running the amount of liquidity that we have today. right? we want to make sure that we have the opportunity to do whatever we need to do during this sort of unprecedented time. so i think from that standpoint, that's kind of how we think about things. i hope this answers your question.
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
robin, just to piggyback on the patrick. one thought and that is, obviously, we have a very strong balance sheet, whether we sell in las vegas or not. but we also have, i believe, in the next couple of years, as you know, 2019, we did about 5.5 billion of ebitda. i know these miserable years of '20 and perhaps even '21 make that seem like a distant memory.
but we think it comes back and it comes back strong. but also, i believe, when macao makes its decision, there's going to be a requirement to invest more in macao. it's, as you know, sheldon felt, well, i can't wait to invest $5 billion, $10 billion. that's a very, in my opinion when the macanese government makes its decision, i think it will be contingent upon a rather substantial capital investment, which we know exactly what sheldon will do and he bet with both hands.
and that may be something else to be thinking about. there's just no place like macao. i think grant and he also gave you a sense of londoner and four seasons. i hope we can all be there this year to see what that team has achieved.
but we're not done in macao. we intend to be there for many more years. and when all this gets away, it goes away, probably later this year, next, i don't know. i'm not going to predict because i've been wrong before.
i won't be wrong again because i won't make a bet. but i bet the one thing that will happen is the macao government is going to necessitate that licensees make investments in macao, and we want to be there and be ready. patrick referenced singapore and these are not small investors, they're in the billions of dollars. so i think we have to be prepared for outsized investments in our markets, which are macao and singapore for crazy growth.
and then there's the other possibilities in the u.s. we referenced. so as strong as we are, if we can get stronger, we will.
robin farley -- ubs -- analyst
great. thank you very much.
operator
thanks. next question we have stephen grambling from goldman sachs. your line is open.
stephen grambling -- goldman sachs -- analyst
thanks for the question, and condolences to everyone on the line.
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks, steve. appreciate it.
stephen grambling -- goldman sachs -- analyst
a question -- absolutely. my first question is on singapore, which continues to be remarkably resilient. what are you learning from the recent results about serving a domestic crowd that might inform your renovation plans? and does this make you more confident with potential roi on these investments? or will that ultimately require a full recovery in china consumers?
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
well, firstly is that we found that singapore is remarkably resilient. you're right. and the slot business there is actually not quite at pre-pandemic levels, but it's getting close so we've learned that there's a local market, but more important than the local market, frankly, are the outsized contributions of foreigners who are residing either during the pandemic or full-time in singapore. we have a lot of strong play inside the country from wealthy people that want to gamble.
and that's a very positive sign. you saw the numbers. if we can run -- even though it's not the $1.7 billion, it used to be nothing more than two, three, or four we like to be at. it's still a run rate of $0.5 billion-plus in the most dramatic times.
all it does for me is reinforce just how damn powerful singapore, our wonderful asset. and frankly, how wonderful the government is to work with there in terms of their -- they're still willing to talk and work with us, and we're hoping to get actually over there in march to continue our discussions on how to get phase two going. but it reinforces the enormous size and scale of that market and to think about having no foreign visitation yet make that kind of money and perhaps even more, it's very encouraging. on the flip side, it also makes you wonder how important the airlift is as an island.
it's hampered by the fact, unlike macao, which could open the doors up if the government -- so chosen to relax the visitation requirements. in singapore, the government is eager to open the doors, but it necessitates airlift, which means counterparty trading with other governments and other airlines. so we don't see it coming back in the short term, i think it stays in this $150 million a quarter or so level. and so there's no real growth opportunity, i think, to see until this airlift issue is resolved.
but it certainly makes us very much want to invest in singapore. it's a great place to do business. it's a great market. obviously, we need a return of all consumers, foreign consumers to enhance it.
but do we want to invest money in singapore, we sure do. we should get our product better. we have a lot of work to do in the building right now. we're actually embarking on an ambitious reinvestment program in the current asset to bring it up to a better standard.
and then we want to build our second phase and similarly resolve everything. so we're -- just like macao, we're lucky to be there. and the idea we did -- we can do $5-plus billion post-pandemic is pretty encouraging. it can be more.
we think it can be a lot more. yes.
stephen grambling -- goldman sachs -- analyst
and maybe a follow-up on digital and i-gaming. and i realize it's still early, and you said you've been studying the industry, but are there any initial thoughts on what you think the company can bring to the table different than the existing players?
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
i have very strong thoughts about it, but i don't want to talk about them at this time. i want to keep working toward our goals, which is understand it fully, complete the conversation, and frankly, we're undertaking to really understand how to get there. it's a very interesting business, as you know. it doesn't make a lot of money, but it sure has great valuations.
the question is, can we bring something to the table to make a lot of money. and we're working through it, and we're exploring. it's best i can tell you. we have something of concrete to say to you at a certain point.
but right now, simply exploratory in the same way we explore a lot of things all the time. you saw in thailand, i think someone came out about the possibility of an opportunity to either in thailand, we're exploring that as well. so everything is up for grabs. i think when we look at our company, the balance sheet enables us to have a very curious appetite to grow.
and again, we're going to adhere to the founders, gary growth adelson, and he believed in it, and we're certainly going to adhere to that. and i think you'll hear some things from us, hopefully, in the next 12 months that will make you believe in that idea.
stephen grambling -- goldman sachs -- analyst
sounds great. thanks so much.
operator
thank you. next question we are from shaun kelley of bank of america. line is open.
shaun kelley -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
hi. good afternoon, everyone. i also want to offer my condolences to you, rob, patrick, to the whole adelson and las vegas sands families.
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you. appreciate, shaun. thank you very much.
shaun kelley -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
so i guess i'd like to maybe turn back to macao for a quick minute if we could. i think grant's comments start off as a little sobering about sort of expectations of when we can start thinking about a recovery relative to kind of what's going on with the pandemic in china. and if we step back for a second, maybe it's a little harder for us over here, sometimes to monitor exactly the nuances of some of the vaccine developments. but one thing that's increasingly separating the u.s.
recovery narrative from overseas is probably that to some degree. so i'm wondering if we could get a little bit of thought around maybe some of the vaccination programs and what the expectations are around that for maybe within macao, broader thoughts on the local area there, possibly hong kong, and then how that could branch out to china in terms of -- is that what we may need to really see a more concrete reopening for this entire market at this stage?
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
is the sobering mr. chum still awake?
grant chum -- chief operating officer
yes. ok. yes. i think, shaun, firstly, we have to stand back and look at the domestic chinese economy during the course of especially the second half of 2020.
so it is different from the western economies, largely the domestic economy was recovering very strongly. so this is without, obviously, vaccination being applied to the whole population. and that's obviously attributable to the fantastic control of the pandemic. so as you look into the fourth quarter, you're getting the 6.5% gdp growth in domestic china without the vaccination.
so that's a very, very strong outcome. and obviously, the consumer is getting stronger across the board. so i think we have to look at china in a slightly different way. the strategy is to continue to control to basically 0 local cases.
and whether that is achieved through vaccination, whether that is achieved through what they've already been doing. clearly, there is a path either way to clearing the locations and localities from the virus. and that will enable travel to resume more normally between mainland china and macao. so i think that's the first and most important point.
in terms of the vaccine strategy, locally, you've seen comments from the local governments of both sars, both hong kong and macao, both have a strategy to procure a number of different vaccines, actually three from three different providers. and both cities are looking to procure the first batch during the first quarter as we understand. so the local populations in the sars will also be looking at a vaccination program in the months ahead. but really, the most important thing is still controlling the pandemic in terms of the local cases inside china itself.
and if macao then can be part of the domestic travel bubble, in a bigger way, in an easier way in a more fluid way than has been the case up to now, then obviously, the tourism and the consumption spend will come back very strongly. and there has been progress. i think obviously, it's from a low base, but there has been progress. there has been a gradual easing up of the logistics and getting used to some of the guidelines throughout the course of the fourth quarter.
but again, the central point is as the worldwide pandemic got worse in the winter months, there are more imported cases that lead to more isolated outbreaks in some of the provinces in china. then obviously, that puts pressure on restrictions again and the travel advisories that are issued by various different local governments and entities, especially prior to chinese new year, which is, as you know, a period of huge migration of the population and travel. so that obviously rightly gives some consideration from the perspective of authorities that we need to be very careful at this stage, which is very delicate. so again, another important point is as the pandemic -- obviously, if it subsides in the rest of the world as well, than that imported risk reduces, and that obviously relieves the pressure inside china as well, which hopefully is another factor that would lead to a normalization of the travel between macao and mainland china.
shaun kelley -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
that's helpful, grant. and then maybe just as a further follow-up, this is probably maybe more for wilfred, if he is still on. but last quarter, there was a little bit of commentary about the overseas gambling law. and i think we're approaching a little bit more or a closer kind of the point of probably both where we know more things about that law and also its implementation, which i believe is set from march 1st.
so just wondering, do we know anything more about that today than we knew before? any changes or additions to that, that we should be aware of?
wilfred wong -- president, sands china
yes. actually, the amendment to article 303 of the criminal law has been enacted. it was enacted about two weeks ago. and as you appreciate, this law, this amendment deals with people organizing, gambling, running casinos, and particularly organizing citizens of china to go outside of the country to participate in gambling.
now there were -- the inactive version made two changes of the previous draft. first, the definition of the criminal actor, which they tried to come up with a definition, was removed. so they just use a catch-all phrase of whoever organizes. so this is to avoid people arguing who falls into the net.
the second change appears to be a bit positive, but it's still ambiguous for macao is that in the legislation, they specifically say outside of the country, which, as you all appreciate, hong kong, macao, and taiwan is generally considered within the country. but then they leave ambiguity equity thereby putting the word offshore inside the bracket after outside the country. now this introduces the ambiguity, and i was discussing this with both our lawyers in beijing and the local npc, national people's congress, people attending the session. and they said that while the central people's government recognizes the special status of macao, they do not want macao to be exploited as a base for organizing such activities to take people outside of the country, such as the southeast asian countries.
and as we all know, the ministry of tourism has compiled and is compiling a blacklist of countries to which they are known to be accommodating gambling from chinese citizens. so to us, there is certain ambiguity, which will ultimately be decided by the authorities and the courts going forward. but at this stage, it is for sure that any person or a junket trying to use macao as a base to organize gambling to other countries would be condemned.
operator
for the last question, we have david katz from jefferies. your line is open.
david katz -- jefferies -- analyst
hi. my condolences as well. and the best part of this job is always the truly extraordinary people we get to meet, and that he was certainly a treasure and fun for sure.
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
that's so true. people -- one thing i miss with sheldon is the humor. everyone talks about everything else but he was -- he loved a laugh in a good time. and he just would sing and this guy's humor.
so what's your question, david? thank you for your comments.
david katz -- jefferies -- analyst
look, i think one of the slides in your deck, it suggests or implies that some of the rolling volumes that's gone away has been recaptured within the mass is premium mass. among all of the unknowables that you've done your best to address, are you able to look into what you have in the premium mass and measure how much of that is a recapture of potential vip dollars? and what is your best guess about -- if you were sitting down to model one to four years out, how you would think about modeling vip, just given where we sit today? and that's it.
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
grant?
grant chum -- chief operating officer
yes. yes. thanks for the question, david. i think structurally -- and this is not to do with the pandemic.
structurally, we've seen, obviously, the power and the growth of the premium mass over the last several years, and that trend is going to continue, whether it's pre-pandemic, during, and after. and the reality of that is because the players, the customers, they want to deal directly with the owners or operators of these great assets. and obviously, the great lifestyle destination that would provide the multitude of amenities and the services that we're able to offer is very, very appealing. so i think that will continue.
so your reference to is there a transfer from one segment to another? i think structurally, there has been over the last several years anyway. and that's one of the brilliant things about sheldon's integrated resort model is that we can offer everything from entertainment to the retail, to the food and beverage, the spas, all of these non-gaming lifestyle amenities. so that trend is structural, and that's why we strategically invested in products that serve this segment. in terms of specifically what's happening now, the situation is -- you referenced, it's more related to issues specific to the system in the junket segment, and that has stabilized at low levels of volumes.
and obviously, as a result of some of those issues, you may see that as new demand resurfaces resumes in the coming years, that new demand is captured directly by the operators rather than through intermediaries. that also is true. but i think the overarching trend was there before anyway and would have continued in that manner. it's just that what's happened in the last 12 months may somewhat accelerate that trend.
but it was going to be a big structural trend and driver for years to come anyway.
david katz -- jefferies -- analyst
perfect. thank you very much.

rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you, daniel. good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. the last two weeks have been the most difficult in our company's history as we mourn the loss of our founder, sheldon adelson. sheldon, as you know, was a visionary.
he led the transformation of not one but three integrated resort markets, that being las vegas, macao, and singapore. he offered the mice-based integrated resort model in las vegas. he pioneered the development of the cotai strip in macao and reimagined the skyline of singapore to the iconic marina bay sands. his audacity to challenge the status quo transformed the entire market.
in las vegas, sheldon originated the convention-based integrated resort model when no one, and i mean no one, who believe in its viability or sustainability. today, las vegas conventions are synonymous. in the macao community, sheldon's vision for cotai defied the consensus thinking at that time. every element of macao is questioned by the skeptics, and i mean every omen.
a 3,000 room all-suite hotel, when the overnight tours market almost didn't exist, existing hotel inventory was very limited. the grand canal shoppes with over 300 retail stores in a market that had virtually no retail. a 13,000-seat arena and 1.2 million square foot convention center. he dreamt big but he also delivered, who developed a critical mass of world-class integrated resorts at a record speed.
before others could even dare to dream, he completed the venetian macao in 2007 and was the fifth year of our company's 20-year concession. his determination pushing forward diversification and investment in non-gaming in macao, was unwavering and breathtaking to be part of. our total investment account today exceeds usd 15 billion. we know that sheldon was a big believer of a strong, healthy, and cordial u.s.-china relationship.
he believed it was to the benefit of both countries to maintain a bilateral relationship based on mutual respect. the company, the board, and the family are absolutely committed to continuing sheldon's efforts in this regard. sheldon is irreplaceable as the visionary founder of our company, of the unmatched portfolio of integrated resort assets, and the management team he assembled to operate and expand the business in the future remain here in place, ready to work. the dna of the company that sheldon founded will remain ever-present.
the company with the full and wholehearted support of the board and the family will continue to honor sheldon's vision to protect and enhance his legacy. we look forward to the future and do so with a lot of confidence and optimism. while the pandemic continues to impact our business adversely, we have achieved positive ebitda in both macao and singapore in the fourth quarter, and there's no doubt, in my mind, our business was down to pre-covid levels in the future. in macao, the grand suite four seasons is now open, and the first phase of londoner macao will officially open in february.
we are very excited about the progressive unveiling of the londoner macao throughout the course of '21. sands china is well-positioned to capture a rebound in tourism when the pandemic finally does subside. we've always believed there's no better market for our company to invest in than macao. we will continue to invest in our resort product, nurture our local talent and, of course, support the local community, which we are grateful to.
in singapore, we remained very committed to long-term investment in marina bay sands, including both the upgrading of our existing facilities and the expansion of that property. on a principal note, i spent more than two decades with sheldon. and had both fun and the pleasure of working for and with sheldon. he was a great mentor, he was a great friend.
and i guess what speaks volumes about his generosity and decency is reflected in the decision to continue to pay our team members, even after the dramatically impacted our business. he was adamant that team members continue to receive pay and health benefits, even while we're closing our buildings and it was abundantly clear that our business will be hampered for quite some time. in the days since he has passed, we received condolences from around the world from global leaders, elected officials, business partners, investors, customers, and many of you joining us on the call today. we are touched by the outpouring of support, and we really appreciate that.
i am honored to have been invited by the board of las vegas sands and sands china to become the chairman and ceo of both companies. with the full support of the board and the family, i will work hard on upskilling team members, the management team to fulfill sheldon's extraordinary vision. i am confident, as sheldon in 1995, that this company will go from strength to strength in the future. for one final thought before we turn to questions, i look forward to the day, we can say, yield dividends.
thanks, we are ready for questions.

operator
[operator instructions] first question, sir, we have joe greff from j.p. morgan. line is open.
joe greff -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
good afternoon, everybody. before asking questions, i just i want to offer my condolences to all of you as well as the pair, man. rob and patrick, you were obviously particularly close. so it's a big loss, and he truly was one of the kind so my condolences.
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks, joe. we appreciate that. thank you.
joe greff -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
so my question and my follow-up, focus on macao and when we kind of look back at what's transpired with tourist investments from mainland china into macao, it's obviously been more slow -- the progress has been more slow than maybe what all of us anticipated, though it has shown some progress. other than the government having this intentional gradual easing of visas to obviously dealing with this little kind of thing called the global pandemic. are there any other policy issues or things that are maybe weighing in on visitation other than just simplistically visas are kind of being granted in conjunction with infection rates and vaccination rates and the like? and when you talk to folks in china, what specifically are folks looking at or metrics and improving metrics to sort of see a further easing of tourist visas?
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
we're fortunate to have both wilfred and grant on the call. i'm going to ask them to address that question, joe. gentlemen?
wilfred wong -- president, sands china
yes. grant, you want to talk first?
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes. why don't you guys take it? yes, grant and wilfred.
grant chum -- chief operating officer
yes. yes. i mean, joe, i think following the resumption of the visa issuance from late september, the business volumes clearly did rebound during the fourth quarter. and the recovery was led primarily by premium mass and luxury retail.
i think both segments actually did show good momentum throughout the quarter. so in december, we had a very encouraging month, especially the holiday season. we reached over 50% hotel occupancy during the month. and there were -- the peak days, we were achieving 8,500, 9,000 room nights, which obviously we haven't done anywhere close to that since january.
and if you look at the pace of recovery in retail, the luxury retail sales really took off during the quarter. and by december, four seasons' retail mall was up 16% over the prior year. actually, we had the best ever month that we ever had in four seasons mall tenant sales. so that's pre and post-pandemic, a record month.
so at issue here is what you referenced. there is just not sufficient visitation to power all segments of the business and to replace the volumes that we lost. so the base mass remains very subdued. macao only had 20% of the prior year's visitations during the fourth quarter.
so really, there's not a lot you can do about that. it's not a policy issue in the sense of they can do something now that they would not otherwise be doing in light of having to prioritize the control of the pandemic. and obviously, the authorities have done an excellent job in that regard. so what you have to remember is that during the fourth quarter, they had a number of many outbreaks, local cases in different provinces and cities in china.
and in october, november, they were relatively muted, and even for the first half of[audio gap]so the number of zones or districts that were classified as medium to high risk from a covid perspective was relatively few. but from about, let's say, the third week of december, the domestic cases started to rise in northern china. and what we saw was that a lot more districts, a lot more zones, and sometimes the whole cities were classified as medium to high risk, which immediately, obviously, puts a break on visitation from those affected zones or cities, but also the overall narrative and travel advisories related to covid becomes, obviously, a lot more cautious, and that impacts forward bookings. so from about mid of december, where up to that point, we were getting very positive momentum in terms of forward bookings in january and obviously, into chinese new year.
obviously, things have started to moderate from a forward booking and the pace of new bookings and obviously, the increase in cancellations. so that is directly related to the trending of the pandemic and some of these isolated outbreaks that we've seen, particularly in the northern provinces. so with that in mind, it's not easy to see a relaxation of the current guidelines in terms of travel. that sets the tone.
joe greff -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
that's helpful. and then i have a follow-up, just, i guess, more on -- so it may continue, this idea of macao policy, and maybe this is a question for wilfred or anybody on the call can answer. but do you think either macao or the central government in beijing want mainland chinese companies getting involved? with macao casinos, either by existing states or having board representation, is this something that's a priority for the government? so important? have there been discussions? i kind of remember hearing something along these lines maybe a couple of years ago as this potentially happening on the ground in macao a couple of years ago, but we're getting more questions and commentary on that of late. so anything you can shed on that would be interesting.
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
wilfred, grant, or patrick, you want to jump on that?
wilfred wong -- president, sands china
yes. i think the -- obviously, we have not been told of anything at this stage. consideration is now being given to what the conditions should be for the new concession. we have not picked up any nor have we been consulted on whether there should be the participation of chinese companies.
but we have to bear in mind that chinese companies are likely -- i mean, real chinese companies are likely to take part in gambling, which in china is considered not legal. so there were, in the past, some suggestions of people saying, state-owned enterprises might come in. i don't think this really in line for their policy consideration. whether private chinese companies would be allowed to participate in macao, and under what circumstances, these are things that have not been brought to us at all.
so the only thing i can say at this stage is that we will continue to do our best in macao and show that we are a locally rooted company because we are listed on the stock exchange in hong kong so we are just the same as any hong kong company and that we do everything, even better than other competitors.
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
joe, can i just jump on wilfred's very, very thoughtful comments. we've been going to beijing for around 20 years in macao, and having endless meetings. i know there's an outsized belief by some people who write these things, and they constantly opine their thoughts on how equity should be sold to chinese companies, and they're jumping up and down. i've never ever had a conversation with one person who mattered whoever said that to me or even made that comment, in fact, if anything, they kind of chuckle because to wilfred's comment, there's not a big appetite to invest in gambling.
so i think those -- i know it's very prevalent in the market. i hear quite a bit. i know that somebody wrote to me recently about how we could guarantee our licensure if we sell x percent. it all sounded very good, but one thing no one's ever said that, the government to us.
never heard that from anybody actually understands how macao and beijing operate. in fact, i think what we do here, it is a complete affirmation of what sheldon has always done, which is invest heavily, invest heavily in non-gaming activities, believe in macao, support your employees, and think they can grow. that's been the exact direction for it for at least the last five years. and before that, we heard more from his officials.
we've never heard them say, hey, you got to sell stake the chinese people or we've heard please support your employees, sheldon do that to achieve. we paid everybody through the pandemic. it costs a lot of money. we did it.
invest in the cap. i think sheldon, we've covered that already, $15 billion, invest in non-gaming. that's always been a direction. but not onetime, from no one i've ever heard, oh, you're a cyclone.
i want to hear that from these people who write these columns or have a belief that they understand the thinking over there. i did once knew a very, very good person, a very important guy in the chinese world, a businessman. and i suggest, so he started laughing, he said no one is going to buy into a chinese gambling company whether it's macao or las vegas because that's not what we're going to do. we found it kind of humorous actually.
so i know that's a common prevailing thought. but we don't hear it.
joe greff -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
thank you, guys.
operator
next question, we have carlo santarelli from deutsche bank. your line is open.
carlo santarelli -- deutsche bank -- analyst
hey, guys. thank you for taking my question, and i echo joe's sentiments about the recent loss.
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you for your kind words to us. we appreciate what you said. it was very kind and thoughtful. really appreciate it.
carlo santarelli -- deutsche bank -- analyst
thank you. if i could, just very simplistically. to the best of your understanding, how should we expect the concession renewal process to actually get moving? what do you guys foresee at the time line to when -- potentially, we could start to see some announcements as to the process and the time line for the process and et cetera? just in its simplest form.
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
i'm going to turn back to the fellows in macao. i think they're best suited to answer your query. wilfred, grant, help us.
wilfred wong -- president, sands china
yes. we are as eagerly waiting for the government's direction. because, as you all know, we only have about 17 months left before the concession expires. and we only know that the government is adopting a process, which includes public consultation on the performance of the concession is and that the targets of achieving diversification, that amendments to the legislation have to be introduced into the legislative council, and then the bidding process begins.
so it's a very tight timetable that we are running against. we also know that there is a legislative council election scheduled for september this year. so all these are coming into play, and we are coming up against a very tight timetable. we don't know whether this will begin very soon because right now, the government is all involved in the fight against the pandemic.
as we all know, macao cannot afford a single case because it was a public announcement by the government that if there is even one case, macao would be locked down again. so the government is putting all their energy into the fight against the pandemic to ensure that visitors can continue to come. so we don't know. the short answer is we don't know.
and when asked about this publicly, the chief executive said that anything is possible. i think he was asked whether there could be an extension or how soon can this be done. and his response was, anything is possible.
carlo santarelli -- deutsche bank -- analyst
great. that's very helpful. and then just as a follow-up. obviously, last quarter, you guys talked a little bit about the las vegas asset, potentially being open to entertain offers to that asset.
rob or patrick, does that influence potentially the timing of the return of the dividend? or do you think more about the dividend from the lens of when macao is back and marina bay sands is back, doing what they do, you'll be able to kind of reinstitute that?
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
patrick?
patrick dumont -- president and chief operating officer
it's patrick. so a couple of things. we have a very positive view in las vegas. i think long term, it's irreplaceable in terms of a tourist destination.
a huge amount of investment going into las vegas. we think there's a huge amount of potential pent-up demand just looking at other markets when there's been a return. and really, the restriction in las vegas now are based on the capacity constraints set by the government. on weekends, we're actually doing quite well.
there are days where we're actually almost at 2019 slot levels. it's really an interesting thing to see, and i think we're very positive on vegas outlook just generally. that being said, if there is a completion of the sale process, it's independent of the dividend. i think the key thing for us is that we need to see a return to operations.
we've had this discussion before on prior calls. we need to understand what the cash flow trajectory of the business is, the growth in that cash flow trajectory. you've heard grant mention the completion of some of the londoner milestones. that's a phenomenal product, and we believe it will be very cash flow generative in the quarters and years to come as it addresses our most profitable and powerful segment in macao.
so the way we'll look at the dividend is to evaluate our cash flow trajectory and the profile of the business and then make an assessment about how to restart it and sort of what the trajectory of that dividend would look like. but we're very focused on the return of capital. we think it's been fundamental to our shareholder return story. we think we have a growth component in our key markets.
we have a growth component and new growth opportunities and new developments. and i think as part of that, we look very heavily toward the dividend as our cornerstone and, of course, the share repurchases as well. so we're very focused, getting on the other side of the pandemic. hopefully, we'll see some positive in the upcoming quarters.
we have some green shoots in macao. we have some positive results in singapore and some positive results in las vegas here. and so i think over time, we'll have better visibility into the trajectory of the business. and then we'll make an assessment of the timing and the size of the dividend.
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
carlos, i just want to follow-up with patrick. there's one other issue with that. and that is the return of las vegas. there's been recent commentary, it's been fun to read about how las vegas will never return to pre-pandemic levels.
the best days are behind it. i've heard all of this before over the last 20, 30 years, about this town is right now on the back foot. there's no question about it struggling. but you can't help but think, there's this thing that is the vaccine or whatever it's going to take to fix this problem someday.
again, i want to reensure that we believe las vegas has plenty of gas in the tank. our demand for '22 through '27 convention is unbelievable. our customers want to come, and we remain very bullish on the return of las vegas. it may take longer than we want it to.
it may take till the end of this year, as we see a visitation spike. but please don't be among those people who have these ideas that this pandemic would put a hole in las vegas. and just the opposite, the demand will be there. this is a unique town.
we're going to have all the digital products out there you want. people want the visitation, and this town has a lot to offer. so we remain very bullish on the return post-pandemic.
carlo santarelli -- deutsche bank -- analyst
yeah. for sure, robin. thank you for that. and i understand that a lot of us on the call are looking forward to making our next trip out there.
i know i am. so thank you guys very much.
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
you're going to, i believe. looking forward to having you.
operator
next question, we have thomas allen from morgan stanley. your line is open.
thomas allen -- morgan stanley -- analyst
hey, and let me also send my condolence to you and the entire lvs and adelson family. mr. adelson was a true visionary and his successes will never be forgotten. so --
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you. thank you for your comments. thanks.
thomas allen -- morgan stanley -- analyst
so there have been a number of reports in the media over the past few weeks and months about you looking to supporting saying online gaming opportunities. can you just discuss your strategy there in a bit more detail?
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
sure. we're looking at a few opportunities, a multitude of opportunities in both regional and the u.s. and yes, we've looked at digital. and it's interesting, you can't deny the -- what's happened in digital is quite a space.
and we are exploring opportunities, looking at what might be out there. but with a caveat had, there's nothing to report today. there's nothing concrete. we're simply looking, learning, observing, and just -- there's been some commentary that it's my suggestion.
i want to assure you that sheldon -- this is another [inaudible] sheldon, who he was ethically, he understood digital, maybe too well before i did. and he believed in it. he just simply had this outsized ethical concern about people who couldn't afford it or people that were too young to use it. and he wasn't a believer in the technology could stop that.
he never questioned the viability of it. he questioned the ability to police it properly. and so the same way he paid people, hundreds of millions of dollars last year because he wanted to. it's an ethical consideration to sheldon.
so we've had this discussion prior to his passing, and we are going to explore it. and again, the cab is we are in the making-money business. so there's a way to make money, it's intelligent and prudent. and again, sheldon would be in the room saying, i'm laser-focused on returns and growth.
as you know, there's no numbers due for growth. even if [inaudible] whether it be in the u.s. or who to build more things. and we're not leaving the u.s.
where we want to build it. we've been all over the paper looking at different markets. so yes, digital is in a multitude of considerations. we are learning and observing and talking to people.
we are nowhere near a decision on that, and we will keep you apprised if something changes.
thomas allen -- morgan stanley -- analyst
and then just talking about u.s. developments on the brick-and-mortar front. there's been some chatter about new york and texas. what do you think the chances are in those states? and then how would you expect to -- how would you like to be positioned in those markets?
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
well, we've been looking at new york for, i think, about 100 years, it seems like. i don't think it's any secret that we're big believers in new york. we think it's extraordinary, the density population, ethnicity like it's a very good opportunity for anybody. and you can see -- i think it's almost -- it's close to $2 billion right now just on the facilities are there, without table games or decent rooms.
and we have a very good product, a good product there would be extraordinary. so we're definitely on the hunt. we've been pushing it for again for four, five years. we're excited by what came out of the new york group last week in terms of what they are considering.
there's an rfi out there. so we deepen on and looking seriously in new york on a whole bunch of levels. and it's still a long way to go before we ever see where they want to build and what they want to build, but we are going to be there. if it's real, and it's done properly, we think the returns could be sheldon-like, ok? so that's interesting.
texas, obviously, extraordinary market. we're kicking the tires down there, too, and another extraordinary market. you can't deny the power of texas, the size and scale. and i was there last week, and it was a fascinating couple of days.
and again, we're having conversations. we're looking, kicking the tires and we'll advise you when something emerges from texas. it would be a great casino market for a land-based store, whatever. it could be a huge opportunity.
so these are opportunities that with our balance sheet, our strength, we would jump in with both feet if it was the right structure.
operator
thank you. next question, we have robin farley from ubs. your line is open.
robin farley -- ubs -- analyst
great. thanks very much. and just echoing everyone else's thoughts about how sad it is to have this call without sheldon.
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you, robin.
robin farley -- ubs -- analyst
just a follow-up question. related to the sale of the lvs assets, the vegas assets, i mean, not specifically to the dividend. but just as, how much of a priority it is? were you just kind of answering an incoming call? or is it something where you see that there may be some strategic reason why you would sell those assets, i guess?
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
patrick?
patrick dumont -- president and chief operating officer
so i think from our standpoint, we are very returns focused. so as rob just mentioned, we're always looking at new opportunities and always looking at our portfolio to see how we maximize shareholder returns. and so as an entrepreneurial company, we're always active. so i think we should just look at this as if there's a way to maximize shareholder returns, we're going to do it.
and we constantly look at the assets that we have in our portfolio. we look at new growth opportunities, as rob just mentioned, and we talk about them. this is something that our team is very focused on. so that's really how we think about it.
robin farley -- ubs -- analyst
i guess if i could press a little more. i mean i guess what kind of appetite did you sense -- you sort of publicly confirmed it, which maybe would invite some interest, what kind of appetite, and you mentioned being returns focused. but almost anything that you would be interested in, new york or texas or other places, would be kind of project-specific financing, right? so it wouldn't necessarily -- you don't need the capital to free up to sort of put it to use in any other market. so i guess just trying to think about what kind of -- in this environment, what kind of appetite you think there may be for the assets?
patrick dumont -- president and chief operating officer
so i think there's a couple of different questions there. so first off, i think the way we think about our portfolio is we sort of evaluate projects on a case-by-case basis. so las vegas is a stand-alone entity. we've operated it for a long time.
we think it's a great asset. we think it has a great future. so obviously, we're focused on operating at this point. i think in terms of if we have additional capital to deploy, as you know, we have an expansion opportunity in singapore that we're very focused on.
and we think singapore is just a very special market. it's privileged, the fact that we're there. we love singapore and think the future for singapore is very strong, both as a leisure and business tourism market, and we're happy to have helped the government there, support its goals and continue to invest there. so we have capital that we can deploy there in the near term.
i think in terms of other opportunities, you hear some of the things that rob is talking about. we also have the return of capital consideration. so for us, capital allocation is front and center. we have these discussions with the management team and the board all the time.
so it's something where we'll look at our opportunities, look for a way to maximize shareholder returns. if we have assets where we think our returns are increased by transacting, we'll transact. and otherwise, we'll look to the sort of historical actions that we've taken in order to enhance returns. in the near term, it's also helpful to have additional liquidity.
right? so i think from our standpoint, as the pandemic recovers, it's nice to have additional liquidity on the balance sheet, which is the reason why we're running the amount of liquidity that we have today. right? we want to make sure that we have the opportunity to do whatever we need to do during this sort of unprecedented time. so i think from that standpoint, that's kind of how we think about things. i hope this answers your question.
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
robin, just to piggyback on the patrick. one thought and that is, obviously, we have a very strong balance sheet, whether we sell in las vegas or not. but we also have, i believe, in the next couple of years, as you know, 2019, we did about 5.5 billion of ebitda. i know these miserable years of '20 and perhaps even '21 make that seem like a distant memory.
but we think it comes back and it comes back strong. but also, i believe, when macao makes its decision, there's going to be a requirement to invest more in macao. it's, as you know, sheldon felt, well, i can't wait to invest $5 billion, $10 billion. that's a very, in my opinion when the macanese government makes its decision, i think it will be contingent upon a rather substantial capital investment, which we know exactly what sheldon will do and he bet with both hands.
and that may be something else to be thinking about. there's just no place like macao. i think grant and he also gave you a sense of londoner and four seasons. i hope we can all be there this year to see what that team has achieved.
but we're not done in macao. we intend to be there for many more years. and when all this gets away, it goes away, probably later this year, next, i don't know. i'm not going to predict because i've been wrong before.
i won't be wrong again because i won't make a bet. but i bet the one thing that will happen is the macao government is going to necessitate that licensees make investments in macao, and we want to be there and be ready. patrick referenced singapore and these are not small investors, they're in the billions of dollars. so i think we have to be prepared for outsized investments in our markets, which are macao and singapore for crazy growth.
and then there's the other possibilities in the u.s. we referenced. so as strong as we are, if we can get stronger, we will.
robin farley -- ubs -- analyst
great. thank you very much.
operator
thanks. next question we have stephen grambling from goldman sachs. your line is open.
stephen grambling -- goldman sachs -- analyst
thanks for the question, and condolences to everyone on the line.
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks, steve. appreciate it.
stephen grambling -- goldman sachs -- analyst
a question -- absolutely. my first question is on singapore, which continues to be remarkably resilient. what are you learning from the recent results about serving a domestic crowd that might inform your renovation plans? and does this make you more confident with potential roi on these investments? or will that ultimately require a full recovery in china consumers?
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
well, firstly is that we found that singapore is remarkably resilient. you're right. and the slot business there is actually not quite at pre-pandemic levels, but it's getting close so we've learned that there's a local market, but more important than the local market, frankly, are the outsized contributions of foreigners who are residing either during the pandemic or full-time in singapore. we have a lot of strong play inside the country from wealthy people that want to gamble.
and that's a very positive sign. you saw the numbers. if we can run -- even though it's not the $1.7 billion, it used to be nothing more than two, three, or four we like to be at. it's still a run rate of $0.5 billion-plus in the most dramatic times.
all it does for me is reinforce just how damn powerful singapore, our wonderful asset. and frankly, how wonderful the government is to work with there in terms of their -- they're still willing to talk and work with us, and we're hoping to get actually over there in march to continue our discussions on how to get phase two going. but it reinforces the enormous size and scale of that market and to think about having no foreign visitation yet make that kind of money and perhaps even more, it's very encouraging. on the flip side, it also makes you wonder how important the airlift is as an island.
it's hampered by the fact, unlike macao, which could open the doors up if the government -- so chosen to relax the visitation requirements. in singapore, the government is eager to open the doors, but it necessitates airlift, which means counterparty trading with other governments and other airlines. so we don't see it coming back in the short term, i think it stays in this $150 million a quarter or so level. and so there's no real growth opportunity, i think, to see until this airlift issue is resolved.
but it certainly makes us very much want to invest in singapore. it's a great place to do business. it's a great market. obviously, we need a return of all consumers, foreign consumers to enhance it.
but do we want to invest money in singapore, we sure do. we should get our product better. we have a lot of work to do in the building right now. we're actually embarking on an ambitious reinvestment program in the current asset to bring it up to a better standard.
and then we want to build our second phase and similarly resolve everything. so we're -- just like macao, we're lucky to be there. and the idea we did -- we can do $5-plus billion post-pandemic is pretty encouraging. it can be more.
we think it can be a lot more. yes.
stephen grambling -- goldman sachs -- analyst
and maybe a follow-up on digital and i-gaming. and i realize it's still early, and you said you've been studying the industry, but are there any initial thoughts on what you think the company can bring to the table different than the existing players?
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
i have very strong thoughts about it, but i don't want to talk about them at this time. i want to keep working toward our goals, which is understand it fully, complete the conversation, and frankly, we're undertaking to really understand how to get there. it's a very interesting business, as you know. it doesn't make a lot of money, but it sure has great valuations.
the question is, can we bring something to the table to make a lot of money. and we're working through it, and we're exploring. it's best i can tell you. we have something of concrete to say to you at a certain point.
but right now, simply exploratory in the same way we explore a lot of things all the time. you saw in thailand, i think someone came out about the possibility of an opportunity to either in thailand, we're exploring that as well. so everything is up for grabs. i think when we look at our company, the balance sheet enables us to have a very curious appetite to grow.
and again, we're going to adhere to the founders, gary growth adelson, and he believed in it, and we're certainly going to adhere to that. and i think you'll hear some things from us, hopefully, in the next 12 months that will make you believe in that idea.
stephen grambling -- goldman sachs -- analyst
sounds great. thanks so much.
operator
thank you. next question we are from shaun kelley of bank of america. line is open.
shaun kelley -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
hi. good afternoon, everyone. i also want to offer my condolences to you, rob, patrick, to the whole adelson and las vegas sands families.
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you. appreciate, shaun. thank you very much.
shaun kelley -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
so i guess i'd like to maybe turn back to macao for a quick minute if we could. i think grant's comments start off as a little sobering about sort of expectations of when we can start thinking about a recovery relative to kind of what's going on with the pandemic in china. and if we step back for a second, maybe it's a little harder for us over here, sometimes to monitor exactly the nuances of some of the vaccine developments. but one thing that's increasingly separating the u.s.
recovery narrative from overseas is probably that to some degree. so i'm wondering if we could get a little bit of thought around maybe some of the vaccination programs and what the expectations are around that for maybe within macao, broader thoughts on the local area there, possibly hong kong, and then how that could branch out to china in terms of -- is that what we may need to really see a more concrete reopening for this entire market at this stage?
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
is the sobering mr. chum still awake?
grant chum -- chief operating officer
yes. ok. yes. i think, shaun, firstly, we have to stand back and look at the domestic chinese economy during the course of especially the second half of 2020.
so it is different from the western economies, largely the domestic economy was recovering very strongly. so this is without, obviously, vaccination being applied to the whole population. and that's obviously attributable to the fantastic control of the pandemic. so as you look into the fourth quarter, you're getting the 6.5% gdp growth in domestic china without the vaccination.
so that's a very, very strong outcome. and obviously, the consumer is getting stronger across the board. so i think we have to look at china in a slightly different way. the strategy is to continue to control to basically 0 local cases.
and whether that is achieved through vaccination, whether that is achieved through what they've already been doing. clearly, there is a path either way to clearing the locations and localities from the virus. and that will enable travel to resume more normally between mainland china and macao. so i think that's the first and most important point.
in terms of the vaccine strategy, locally, you've seen comments from the local governments of both sars, both hong kong and macao, both have a strategy to procure a number of different vaccines, actually three from three different providers. and both cities are looking to procure the first batch during the first quarter as we understand. so the local populations in the sars will also be looking at a vaccination program in the months ahead. but really, the most important thing is still controlling the pandemic in terms of the local cases inside china itself.
and if macao then can be part of the domestic travel bubble, in a bigger way, in an easier way in a more fluid way than has been the case up to now, then obviously, the tourism and the consumption spend will come back very strongly. and there has been progress. i think obviously, it's from a low base, but there has been progress. there has been a gradual easing up of the logistics and getting used to some of the guidelines throughout the course of the fourth quarter.
but again, the central point is as the worldwide pandemic got worse in the winter months, there are more imported cases that lead to more isolated outbreaks in some of the provinces in china. then obviously, that puts pressure on restrictions again and the travel advisories that are issued by various different local governments and entities, especially prior to chinese new year, which is, as you know, a period of huge migration of the population and travel. so that obviously rightly gives some consideration from the perspective of authorities that we need to be very careful at this stage, which is very delicate. so again, another important point is as the pandemic -- obviously, if it subsides in the rest of the world as well, than that imported risk reduces, and that obviously relieves the pressure inside china as well, which hopefully is another factor that would lead to a normalization of the travel between macao and mainland china.
shaun kelley -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
that's helpful, grant. and then maybe just as a further follow-up, this is probably maybe more for wilfred, if he is still on. but last quarter, there was a little bit of commentary about the overseas gambling law. and i think we're approaching a little bit more or a closer kind of the point of probably both where we know more things about that law and also its implementation, which i believe is set from march 1st.
so just wondering, do we know anything more about that today than we knew before? any changes or additions to that, that we should be aware of?
wilfred wong -- president, sands china
yes. actually, the amendment to article 303 of the criminal law has been enacted. it was enacted about two weeks ago. and as you appreciate, this law, this amendment deals with people organizing, gambling, running casinos, and particularly organizing citizens of china to go outside of the country to participate in gambling.
now there were -- the inactive version made two changes of the previous draft. first, the definition of the criminal actor, which they tried to come up with a definition, was removed. so they just use a catch-all phrase of whoever organizes. so this is to avoid people arguing who falls into the net.
the second change appears to be a bit positive, but it's still ambiguous for macao is that in the legislation, they specifically say outside of the country, which, as you all appreciate, hong kong, macao, and taiwan is generally considered within the country. but then they leave ambiguity equity thereby putting the word offshore inside the bracket after outside the country. now this introduces the ambiguity, and i was discussing this with both our lawyers in beijing and the local npc, national people's congress, people attending the session. and they said that while the central people's government recognizes the special status of macao, they do not want macao to be exploited as a base for organizing such activities to take people outside of the country, such as the southeast asian countries.
and as we all know, the ministry of tourism has compiled and is compiling a blacklist of countries to which they are known to be accommodating gambling from chinese citizens. so to us, there is certain ambiguity, which will ultimately be decided by the authorities and the courts going forward. but at this stage, it is for sure that any person or a junket trying to use macao as a base to organize gambling to other countries would be condemned.
operator
for the last question, we have david katz from jefferies. your line is open.
david katz -- jefferies -- analyst
hi. my condolences as well. and the best part of this job is always the truly extraordinary people we get to meet, and that he was certainly a treasure and fun for sure.
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
that's so true. people -- one thing i miss with sheldon is the humor. everyone talks about everything else but he was -- he loved a laugh in a good time. and he just would sing and this guy's humor.
so what's your question, david? thank you for your comments.
david katz -- jefferies -- analyst
look, i think one of the slides in your deck, it suggests or implies that some of the rolling volumes that's gone away has been recaptured within the mass is premium mass. among all of the unknowables that you've done your best to address, are you able to look into what you have in the premium mass and measure how much of that is a recapture of potential vip dollars? and what is your best guess about -- if you were sitting down to model one to four years out, how you would think about modeling vip, just given where we sit today? and that's it.
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
grant?
grant chum -- chief operating officer
yes. yes. thanks for the question, david. i think structurally -- and this is not to do with the pandemic.
structurally, we've seen, obviously, the power and the growth of the premium mass over the last several years, and that trend is going to continue, whether it's pre-pandemic, during, and after. and the reality of that is because the players, the customers, they want to deal directly with the owners or operators of these great assets. and obviously, the great lifestyle destination that would provide the multitude of amenities and the services that we're able to offer is very, very appealing. so i think that will continue.
so your reference to is there a transfer from one segment to another? i think structurally, there has been over the last several years anyway. and that's one of the brilliant things about sheldon's integrated resort model is that we can offer everything from entertainment to the retail, to the food and beverage, the spas, all of these non-gaming lifestyle amenities. so that trend is structural, and that's why we strategically invested in products that serve this segment. in terms of specifically what's happening now, the situation is -- you referenced, it's more related to issues specific to the system in the junket segment, and that has stabilized at low levels of volumes.
and obviously, as a result of some of those issues, you may see that as new demand resurfaces resumes in the coming years, that new demand is captured directly by the operators rather than through intermediaries. that also is true. but i think the overarching trend was there before anyway and would have continued in that manner. it's just that what's happened in the last 12 months may somewhat accelerate that trend.
but it was going to be a big structural trend and driver for years to come anyway.
david katz -- jefferies -- analyst
perfect. thank you very much.

operator
good afternoon. my name is katrina and i will be your conference operator today. at this time i would like to welcome everyone to the las vegas sands first-quarter 2021 earnings conference call. [operator instructions].
i will now turn the call over to mr. daniel briggs.
daniel briggs -- senior vice president, investor relations
thank you, katrina. joining me on the call today are rob goldstein, our chairman and chief executive officer; and patrick dumont, our president, and chief operating officer. also joining us on the call are dr. wilfred wong, president of sands china; and grant chung, chief operating officer of sands china.
before i turn the call over to rob, please let me remind you that today's conference call will contain forward-looking statements that we are making under the safe harbor provision of federal securities laws. the company's actual results could differ materially from the anticipated results in those forward-looking statements. in addition, we may discuss non-gaap measures. a definition and a reconciliation of each of these measures to the most comparable gaap financial measures is included in the press release.
please note that we have posted supplementary earnings slides on our investor relations website. we will refer to those slides during the q&a portion of the call. finally, for those who would like to participate in the q&a session, we ask that you please respect our request to limit yourself to one question and one follow-up question, so we might allow everyone with interest the opportunity to participate. please note that this presentation is being recorded.
with that, let me please turn the call over to rob. 
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks, dan, and good afternoon, and very early good morning to our colleagues in asia. some brief comments then we'll write the q&a our results reflect the pandemic's impact we did generate $244 million of ebitda for the quarter. and we continue to have a strong belief in the macao recovery because the march numbers were very different from those in january and february and the recent visitation numbers and whether in this for april reflect continued acceleration. obviously, we cannot define the timing of the full recovery, but it's under way and we will continue in 2021.
at this time, singapore is in the $500 million to $600 million range annually ebitda. there is no visibility as to when air traffic will return to singapore. and unlike macao, it's more difficult to project additional our incremental ebitda from mbs until the resumption of the material air travel. our investments in macao continue to take shape as the market recovers, four seasons and londoner will present, i think large growth opportunities for us, and we continue to have -- we do have the largest structure in this incredible market of macao.
and china continues to demonstrate economic resilience. the spending in macao is very strong at the premium mass level for both the gaming and a retail perspective and referenced on page 29 and page 30 in invest from a retail perspective, there are some pleasant surprises there. but again, we have no reservations about our ability to perform to pre-pandemic levels once visitation returns. our company today is sort of divided into three different areas: the asia portfolio, macao, and singapore.
and while we believe macao will accelerate this year and lead the recovery, singapore follow-up on the resumption of air travel and participate in the recovery as well, and we anticipate a return to a $5 billion-plus ebitda from asia in the future. the sale of las vegas assets enables us to have huge optionality to explore large sale land-based destination works in both united states and asia. and finally, we have -- we're eager to have a material digital presence in the future. we are exploring multiple opportunities at the present time.
this is obviously a departure from our historical approach, and we'll update you at the appropriate time. so let's go to q&a and have our first caller, please.

[operator instructions]. the first question, we have robin farley -- i'm sorry, we have carlo santarelli from deutsche bank.
carlo santarelli -- deutsche bank -- analyst
rob, i appreciate there's probably some sensitivity around it. but in your prepared remarks, obviously, you talked about some of the asia opportunities. and clearly, upon the completion of the las vegas sale, which obviously came at a very nice multiple for you guys, and i'm sure you're having very nice proceeds coming out of it. how do you think about the use of those proceeds in light of some of the opportunities? you're obviously kind of eyeing in asia relative to, obviously, the return of a dividend, potential for buybacks longer-term, potentially owning more things china, all of the above? how do you kind of prioritize that pecking order and acknowledging you could do several of those things kind of what the balance sheet and the position that it's in?
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
sure. we're looking at -- obviously a great opportunity for return. i think we continue to believe there'll be something happening in macao at some point in the future, which will enable us to reinvest in macao on a non-gaming basis. we're hopeful that'll happen sooner than later.
you know that our project in singapore, our phase 2 project is -- we're still continuing to work through those issues there. we continue to look at other asian -- large-scale asian opportunities. and then, of course, we think in the u.s., there may be some opportunities for us here. and lastly, digital.
i think we look at everything individually and look at the returns and -- but our priority remains to get back on our feet in asia be back to a $5-plus billion ebitda and maintain -- that's the backbone of our company. that's what we'll start first. if something opportunistic opens up in the u.s., bob is with the bat and if something opens up digitally, we're deep into a digital and deep dive to figure out -- have deployed capital and intelligently to get a return. and i think there'll be some nice opportunities in the future there.
as far as the dividend, i like patrick to address that issue and return the dividend. patrick?
patrick dumont -- president and chief operating officer
sure. thanks, rob. so i think, as rob mentioned, we look very cautiously at the way we deploy capital, and we're very patient and we look for a way to maximize our returns for shareholders. and so when we look at the dividend, it really was and hopefully will be in the future, really the cornerstone, and you've heard me say that before, of a return of the capital program.
and i think where we are today is that we're going to look for operations to return to a baseline level and get a sense of where those operations are trending and then make an assessment with the board and with management looking at our long-term potential to where the dividend should be given our ability to reinvest and allocate capital to other projects that are higher growth. and so i think it's pretty consistent with what you've heard us say before in calls, and nothing's changed from that perspective.

great, guys. and then if i could, whoever kind of wants to take this, it's more of an opinion question than anything else. but obviously, there is some consternation in the investment community around the status of vip in macao and the direction of the vip going forward in macao, whether or not if there's a perception that, that will have a positive or negative impact on the premium mass segment. one could obviously make the case that vip customers who are having a harder time accessing capital, who do like to go -- could obviously move into the mass segment or premium mass segment, which wouldn't be the worst thing to happen or the fact that maybe some of that still overplay from vip if the vip is softer doesn't show up in mass.
rob, maybe what's kind of your view and a view from your folks in macao on how that -- how they would expect that to play out?
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
i have a very strong view, but since i woke up, grant at 4:30 in the morning, why don't grant take that call. grant? are you there?
grant chum -- senior vice president of global gaming strategy
yes. thanks, rob. yes. we're here yes.
sure. on the question of vip and premium mass, i think you've clearly seen the segments have diverged in terms of the recovery. clearly, premium mass is -- has made a very significant recovery and already approaching 50% of pre-pandemic levels. vip on the other hand is still struggling at around 20% or sub 20%.
so the segments are actually following very different trajectories, and we would expect that to continue for the time being. and of course, your question about whether there's spillover, whether there's migration, i don't think those dynamics have really changed since a few years ago that there is a structural change over time, where more of the customers and more of the new customers are dealing directly with the casino operators program. and of course, the great assets on the integrated resort that all of the operators, including us we've built up, have attracted more and more of these consumers to the premium mass program, and we expect that to continue over time as these non-gaming lifestyle assets and products continue to attract people to play in our programs.
carlo santarelli -- deutsche bank -- analyst
great. thanks, everybody. i appreciate it.
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
sure. carlo. thank you.

next question, we have joe greff from j.p. morgan. your line is open.
joe greff -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
hi, everybody. when you look at your advanced bookings for the golden week holiday in macao, do these bookings suggest or imply a further acceleration in the visitation or mix quality that might be tough on the sort of spend or ggr level relative to april and march? and anything underlying that suggests that maybe people are anticipating on any -- or macao patrons are anticipating any further incremental easing of travel restrictions?
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
i don't want to share with you our bookings for gold week. i just think we look at them -- i think the best reflection in the market right now is the acceleration in april. i think across the board, both visitation revenue is growing. and we might remain commenced macao is in a recovery mode already.
i think the term that came in march is very encouraging. i think it's foolish for us to try -- again, call the shots, so to speak, as when -- like this thing grows. i would think it might be a -- and then to define it. i think, instead, it's a slow process of gradual growth.
and i think the market will be disappointed to the way we reach the inflection point was just like golden week popped the numbers to a materially different level. i think we're seeing gradual growth. the easing restrictions, obviously, the government decision. people are getting there as evidenced by the numbers coming out of april and the revenues.
and i think we believe that this will just continue to accelerate with the only caveat being -- hopefully, you obviously, returned to any cases of the virus. we'll offer -- grant, any thoughts on that?
grant chum -- senior vice president of global gaming strategy
yeah. i think what rob said is absolutely right. the term really started in march. in march, we started to experience a pretty meaningful rebound in visitations versus january and february.
and as you've seen from the figures released by mgto, that has continued on a similar momentum in april with visitations reaching post-pandemic highs in the mid of april. so the acceleration is seen across -- very encouragingly across all the different segments, whether you're talking about premium mass, mass. but the encouraging thing is that since march, we've really seen an acceleration in the base mass as well as the leisure fit guests at the hotel, of course, retail, especially at the high-end consumption end of things. and we've even had an initial resumption of the mice segment activity in march and bookings for q2 look encouraging for the mice as well, which is a surprise.
but i think what you can see is a broad-based recovery in the different segments since early march.
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
i don't think we're going to get very emotional if there's not as big a number comes out of may. we -- i think it's more -- it's a slow but very steady road upwards. here in las vegas, it looks like the weekend is pre-pandemic levels, it's an amazingly busy year and demand is back. i think macao has a follow suit.
of course, vegas is still leading to the return of the group business, but that's inevitable. i think the u.s. is obviously in a different place than asia. but i think china and macao are just going to continue to move forward, accelerate.
i think you'll see a slow gradual return in the second half of the year it could be very positive for everybody over there.
joe greff -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
great. and then my follow-up question is maybe for all of you, those in las vegas and those in the ground early in the morning in macao. and i just wanted to ask a question about a topic you guys love to answer is sort of your thoughts on the timing or process for the concession renewals. and i think i'm going to ask in a way that's answerable.
if the government was thinking of renewing or extending 12 months in front of that expansion, right? and we're knocking on that and even if that was an extension for relatively short periods, would they have discussions for that with you by now? and maybe i'll have a -- i'll let you sort of open-endedly answer that question.
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. joe, i don't think we want to speculate because we don't know -- we're not working with the government. we don't know to want they think. but as we said, nausea in the past, we remain strong believers is opposition there.
the story about the asean and what we've done in cotai and the $15 billion investment and the non-gaming assets we built back. we just aren't that concerned about what the government tells us they tell us, but we don't have the insight and nor do we have any idea when they're going to do that. but we feel renewals will happen. we feel very confident in our position.
and other than that, i don't have any other insight, unless wilfred, anything you want to add to that? is that fair to say?
wilfred wong -- president, sands china
yes. all the sixth concession are waiting eagerly for the government to make announcements as we draw closer to the expiration of the concession. but as ever, we stand ready to cooperate with the government once they announced the timeline and what they intend to do over the next 12 months, 18 months.
joe greff -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
thank you, guys.

next question, we have stephen grambling from goldman sachs. your line is open.
stephen grambling -- goldman sachs -- analyst
hey, good afternoon. thank you for taking the question. as a follow-up, i think, to carlo's question on the proceeds from las vegas. i guess, where would raise your ownership of sands china factor into that list? and can you just remind us what the processor limitations might be if you did want to go down that path?
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
sure. pat, do you want to grab that?
patrick dumont -- president and chief operating officer
yeah, sure. how are you, steve. so i think from our standpoint, we feel very strongly about the long-term future and success of macao as the world's leading leisure and tour destination. and as rob has said before and as you've heard on these calls, we're very interested in investing more there in non-gaming.
we feel very strongly about the future in macao. so it's definitely something that we think about and consider overtime. i think where we are now -- we don't have the proceeds yet. we're looking at all the options, and we're going to consider everything.
i think we're going to be very focused on returns. and so i think we're looking at new developments we're looking at how to increase and develop more in the markets that we're in. and i think that will be something that we think about. and i think really for us, there's a lot of opportunity in front of the company.
and we're being patient. we're looking at it all. and we're going to look through the lens of maximizing return. so it's not something that i'm going to say we're going to do now, but it's something that is in the things that we consider as we look across the way we might allocate capital.
stephen grambling -- goldman sachs -- analyst
and so just to clarify, is there a maximum ownership percentage that you can go up to for sands china? so i think technically, they want to have 25% of the float outstanding for the exchange, but there are exceptions.
grant chum -- senior vice president of global gaming strategy
got it.
stephen grambling -- goldman sachs -- analyst
grant, i want to make sure that, that makes sense. grant, i just want to ask grant chum, i want to make sure i didn't invest thing there, but ...
grant chum -- senior vice president of global gaming strategy
yes.
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
that's correct. you're right.
stephen grambling -- goldman sachs -- analyst
that's helpful. and then as we think about the model going forward, i realize that you broke out the las vegas assets within the ebitda count. but is there any impact that we should be thinking about and it's more of a modeling question, but as we think about corporate expenses, going forward? is it basically what you reported this quarter kind of the right run rate to think about? or are there other things that might be in there?
grant chum -- senior vice president of global gaming strategy
no. i think what you should see over time is that corporate expenses should adjust post-sale. but i think, in the long run, we will continue to have a corporate office that manages the activities of the enterprise as a whole. so there's nothing in there that's noise right now, but you should expect to see some changes going forward after the completion of the sale.
stephen grambling -- goldman sachs -- analyst
make sense. thanks so much. i'll get back in the queue.
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks, steve. i appreciate it.
operator
next question, we have thomas allen from morgan stanley. your line is open.
thomas allen -- morgan stanley -- analyst
so just on marina bay sands, the performance of the property improved quarter over quarter. obviously, they're not getting any more chinese visitors there. so can you just talk about some of the drivers of that?
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes. surprisingly, our slot business there is exceptional -- the biggest drivers are slot performance has been outsized. it's been -- i mean we actually are not up against pre-pandemic levels, the slot floor. i think that reflects the comfort level with the team and others for the ability to buy slot capacity without having a feel uncomfortable.
it's more difficult on the table side to do that there's more spacing on the table side, which makes it difficult. but as you referenced, not having that fond of the station is very hurtful because -- singapore traditionally, the residents there, and the visitors and the current residents all. it was a slot -- strong slot market before we got there, just has gotten better over the years with the -- our ability to provide a good quality product. but that's the driver, no question about it.
but without that foreign visitation, it's hard to grow the premium mass in the high-end table business. so we convince struggle and i think we'll stay in this range until things improve. and unlike macao, i think we're going to see a move in this summer and fall. i don't think you can see that -- any reason to believe that happens in singapore.
the neighboring countries are still struggling with the vaccinations, be it malaysia or indonesia, or japan, there's no real evidence that this is going to change in the short term. but it's a slot business over there that's been really exceptionally strong.
patrick dumont -- president and chief operating officer
the other thing to note, and this is patrick, is just to keep in mind that while the pandemic-related restrictions have eased, the actual activity levels of the people in singapore have gotten more back-to-normal over time across the quarter, right? so as people get vaccinated, as public health initiatives bear fruits, people who are in singapore are more out and about. and so we benefited from some of that as well. so it's not as if there's a change, to rob's point before, it's not as if there's a change in visitation, but there has been a change in activity in singapore as things return more to normal there.
thomas allen -- morgan stanley -- analyst
makes total sense. and then this is my follow-up, it seems like you're getting more and more serious about your digital strategy. can you just elaborate a little bit more on that?
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
i don't see anything because we're not very yet, thomas. we have -- we're like the new guys with locker, i think the game is just beginning. and we're looking at it from many, many aspects. we've been a lot of man-hours, a lot of people looking at the opportunities.
we have a big appetite, but as you know, that market is still developing be it -- i think we're looking not just in the sports or the game, but all aspects of digital. we find it fastening and very, very complementary to our land-based business. but we're just not ready yet to disclose what we're going to do because we haven't decided. so not much color there, but i think you'll be hearing from us this year and next year about the direction we're taking.
thomas allen -- morgan stanley -- analyst

next question, we have shaun kelley of bank of america. your line is open.
shaun kelley -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
hi, good afternoon everyone. i just wanted to go back to the kind of question around some of the possible reinvestment back into asia as you've got so much cash or liquidity available on the balance sheet and obviously heading into the concession process. so my specific question was that there was some press recently about a possible investment in the broader greater bay area being potential criteria or a potential result of the concession process? and i would just kind of peaked my thinking around, would that be something that lvs would consider potentially investing in non-gaming, let's call it, in the broader region, but outside of macao directly? is that something you -- how would you react to that?
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
positively. and we are -- again, we're strong believers in the rebound of macao. it's coming back and there are people who somehow don't believe it, that's -- we'll have to wait and see. but it's going to come back in a strong way.
we'll be the leading site in that space, our londoner and four seasons investments are going to be having very well received. if the government wants us to invest in the region, and it makes -- we'll do it. we have capital, we've appetite, and we remain committed to macao in a big way. we believe it's going to grow and grow for us.
and despite all the distractions and all the pandemic, all the issues, macao still remains from a land-based perspective, the most opportunistic and advantageous market in the world. and we plan to be there for a long time and invest more capital. and again, the government's directions will be pound out to our thinking.
shaun kelley -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
great. and just maybe as a quick follow-up. potential reopening of hong kong, just kind of curious on latest there. i think the case counts have been, i think, very low.
and there's some positive news there, but i think the vaccination rate is also very low. so just curious about color from that part of the market and that as a possible avenue for reopening some of the travel in the region.
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
sure. wilfred or grant can grab that since you guys are right there in the middle of it?
wilfred wong -- president, sands china
yeah. i think it is gratifying to note that the cases every day have dropped to a single digit. and i think yesterday, there was no home case in hong kong. -- both governments of hong kong and macao have announced that if there is a continuous period of 14 days of zero cases, they would open or consider opening the border between hong kong and macao.
and i think the hong kong government is working very hard to achieve that. and hopefully, that if that happens, that's going to help our business a lot.
shaun kelley -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
thank you very much.

next question, we have chad beynon from macquarie. your line is open.
chad beynon -- macquarie group -- analyst
hi, good afternoon. thanks for taking my question. i know it's early on the londoner opening of phase 1 here, but just wanted to ask about the makeup of the customer or how you guys are running that right now between londoner and venetian? is there a major difference in terms of the customers that are visiting one versus the other from a base or premium standpoint? and are you deciding to comp certain players into one versus the other? just trying to get some additional color in terms of how that's running since it just reopened? thanks.
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
mr. chum?
grant chum -- senior vice president of global gaming strategy
yes, yes. on the subject of londoner, well, i think if you take a step back, we opened our first new product in the four seasons, the grand suites last year, and that has progressed exceptionally well in terms of customer feedback. and so clearly, that is more targeted at the premium mass and the long-stay leisure family guests. and then when we got to the early part of 2021, as you referenced, we opened the first phase of londoner.
that's really the main londoner hotel and the north side of the building with the crystal palace atrium and some of the signature food and beverage outlets and some other tractions that we've opened up so far. and i think it's important to remember that a large part of the building, namely on the south side, the sheraton side, is still under heavy construction -- actually both on the interior as well as the exterior side because we have been bringing forward the construction works on that side of the building to take advantage of the low levels of traffic. so in terms of your question about segmentation, it really follows the trajectory of the initial recovery that we see in macao right now. therefore, not very much in terms of base mass traffic, and that's both because of the demand side but also the fact that the south side of the building is undergoing large-scale construction.
and it's really focused more on the premium mass segment as well as the fit leisure guest. we've enjoyed a resumption of the fit segment in the various hotels that we have in the londoner macao. but clearly, there's a lot more to come in the remainder of the year into the early part of next year in terms of the products that are coming online. we've got the second all-suite hotel londoner opening up later on the year.
on the sheraton side, we're going to have the second wow space, atrium shakespeare hall coming online imminently in the second quarter. obviously, we still have the london arena. and another, call it, six, seven, eight food and beverage outlets, together with the theme attractions in the property as well as the retheming of the retail shops. so hopefully, that gives you a sense of where we are today.
chad beynon -- macquarie group -- analyst
ok. yeah, that's great. and then separately, just regarding your retail mall business in asia, which is on slide 29, you've outlined that rental concessions have come down sequentially, which should be a positive just in terms of the health of your tenants. is there anything that's going to change dramatically going forward just in terms of a turnover versus base component of the makeup of this business or when visitation kind of gets back to more normalized levels? do you still expect the profits of the retail mall portfolio to kind of mirror what you saw pre-pandemic? thank you.
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah, we absolutely expect it to be very much like the pre-pandemic levels. i mean what you're seeing now is similar to the u.s. outside spending by affluent people driving these crazy good numbers out of luxury four seasons and others. but i think we expect a full recovery.
we have no concerns in trepidation that as visitation in macao returns and to singapore, our malls are going back to pre-pandemic levels and perhaps even beyond that. so we -- i don't think there are any concerns that you've seen the correction on the rent concessions, you've seen it go the right direction. but we're very pleased with the caveat that we want to see a return to mass traffic as well as various people driving these large performances. but yes, we expect it to look a lot like pre-pandemic levels, hopefully, as the year continues.
and in macao -- singapore, the more difficult because, but again, until the resumption of air traffic and foreign travel. i think singapore is going to lag their pre-pandemic levels. and again, we feel much more aggressive in the return of macao than we do in singapore at this time because we don't see the vaccination kicking as large in the region, nor do we see air traffic -- and visibility in the resumption of air traffic. so it's hard to see singapore getting back to pre-pandemic levels this year.
chad beynon -- macquarie group -- analyst

next question, we have robin farley from ubs. your line is open.
robin farley -- ubs -- analyst
hi, thanks a lot. a lot of my questions have been asked already. but i'm curious about the online strategy. it sounds like it's going to be a little while from your comment earlier before there would be some announcement about lvs involvement.
is it fair to say, given that there's so much activity around getting market share when new markets open, that if you're kind of maybe coming to the online markets a little bit later than others that maybe your strategy would be kind of m&a focused rather than kind of building from scratch your presence in those markets?
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
well, the thought is we can go either direction, we can go to m&a or we could build organically. but at this point, again, i think we'll lay low. i think the challenging businesses -- despite the valuation, there are still challenging businesses. and it's early innings maybe -- in fact national anthem on time in terms of some of these businesses.
i mean online in the u.s. is still a very -- not online gaming, which has been the profited -- most positive still in a few states. and i think sports betting remains a conundrum to some extent to what's really happening there. so -- and there's also a lot of movement outside the u.s., there's europe and there's north america, there are all kinds of opportunities.
so i don't think it'd be that long, we'll come back to you, but we're trying to again assess how to be smart and targeted, not just -- obviously with the kind of balance sheet we have, the optionality is endless. and we'll be careful and do it the right way. we really have the finest land-based business. so we want to get back and healthy.
but we'll come back at the right time and the right strategy and right thought process. and then we'd want to obligate ourselves to say it's going to be organic or it's m&a, but we'll get there. i promise you that. we have a pretty voracious appetite to be in that world.
and it may be different than you think it's going to be, but we'll let you know, and we're going to talk about it.
robin farley -- ubs -- analyst

next question, we have steve wieczynski from stifel. your line is open.
steve wieczynski -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
hey good afternoon guys. so the guys on the ground earlier in the call, touched on the favorable -- talked about the favorable case counts they're seeing in hong kong. but i guess the question is, can you guys provide any color around the actual vaccinations process -- or progress in your key feeder markets like macao, hong kong, guangdong? obviously, it's very tough for us over here to get a good understanding of where they are today versus maybe somebody like the u.s. is right now. so any color there would be pretty helpful.
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
wilfred, grant, can you help me with that one?
wilfred wong -- president, sands china
yes. i think the situation on the ground in china, they have started the vaccination program, but there's no -- really no hurry for people to get the vaccination because china has been very safe for the last months. and for hong kong and macao, macao has no incidents for over 380 days. so the feeling of comfort is causing a lot of people to adopt the wait-and-see attitude.
but it's getting there, people are slowly ticking up the vaccination. same with hong kong. i think hong kong is -- there are, unfortunately, a few cases of people suffering after the vaccination so again, there are people adopting the wait-and-see attitude. but slowly, slowly, people are beginning to realize the importance, especially if they are thinking of traveling overseas that the travel bubble may require vaccination certification.
so i think people are beginning to take up vaccination.
steve wieczynski -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
got you. thanks for that. and rob, there's been some talk or some rumors out there about macao potentially moving to a digital currency down the road at some point, try to combat money laundering. do you have any high-level thoughts around something like that being implemented? and then if something like that would get implemented, maybe the impact you potentially could see across certain business segments?
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
i think a couple of thoughts to that. one is, i don't -- some people are concerned, we're not -- we think it's an additional form of liquidity into the market. two, it won't pre-empt other currencies, there are ways of having funds to gamble. but also, i think some of the problems we have in our industry we think that everything is done in beijing, they're actually thinking about casinos in macao.
i'm not sure if the case is a different thought process there. sometimes we very limit our thinking. i don't think macao is a target or as you mentioned anti-money laundering, much as a digital currency strategy by beijing. and i don't think it's hurting macao whatsoever.
i think it's just traditional liquidity. and grant, do you want to weigh on this at all?
grant chum -- senior vice president of global gaming strategy
no. i think you said it well, i think it's a big and complex topic. it's really more about the digital currency strategy of china more broadly. and also how macao can fit into that.
so probably most helpful is to refer to the comments by the chief executive recently in the q&a session in the legislature, basically, this digital currency china has been looking at since 2014. and so macao will also adjust and adapt in order to accommodate this broader strategy on digital currency. but a prerequisite of that is also getting prepared in terms of amending the existing relevant legislation. so this is still an early stage process from the perspective of macao.
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
i think the assumption has been by a lot of people, this is a negative thing. we view it as a positive as again, we would love to have more cross-currency and more cross-border currency. so to me, the long to protect the hong kong dollar and the renminbi, it's another form of currency. and i should only be concerned, our business is not built on money laundering or on necessary junket profile.
we're looking to focus on the mass customer, premium mass -- that's our bread and butter, that's who we are, where we want to go in the future. and we can build a business that keeps growing on the back of that. more visitation more penetration in china, more ways we're getting people to gamble and visit macao is what we're looking for. it is obviously, another value that adds to it.
i think it's positive. i know common wisdom is always going to be turbulent. i don't want to see people think that way. it's not an immediate concern nor i think it's a long-term concern.
it may be a very positive thing for the macao market as it becomes more traditional, more integrated into china, and more consumer-friendly, it will be very positive for us.
steve wieczynski -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst

our last question is from david katz from jefferies. your line is open.
david katz -- jefferies
hi, i appreciate in taking my question. rob, i just -- you used the term voracious appetite for digital before. and i wondered -- i appreciate it and wondered what intelligence you have or what survey work that gives you a sense that your people, your customers here in the u.s. or you have an audience in the u.s., particularly in the context of las vegas going away that that audience is there for you?
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
well, i think [inaudible]. and i guess, more voracious is a description of how we feel about that digital market, and you look at it. you can't deny the cumulative power of all those different businesses. and i think we have to do know which 1 we want to enter, which few want to enter.
i'm not that concerned about the fact where some people were late to the party or who don't have sports betting presence because i don't think it's all that difficult to enter them. we want to buy something we could we want to build the platform could. but i think we're looking at -- right now, it's a good kind of to reflect on what's making money, what's going to grow. and i don't think it necessarily in our thought process -- just simply in the u.s., it may be outside in europe, it would not be in asia because we would not do something that upsets the governments we do business within asia.
but it could be in europe, it could be in south america and north america, there're a lot of markets after -- beyond the u.s. and it could be in the u.s., it could be b2b, it could be b2c. i just think the market -- we are spending a lot of time leading and learning. and with our balance sheet with the sale of las vegas, again, we have outsized capital to look at these things.
when we build organically or buy something remains to be determined. we won't do something just to do something. it'll be something that's intelligent, well thought out, and profitable. and i think we all see -- not just lvs, but we can see the opportunities there for a digital market that goes to 20%, 30%, 40%, who knows the numbers.
the numbers keep growing in people's minds. and i think there is a belief that the digital market will become probably hugely opportunistic for people like us, but we plan to be part of that. but again, it's growing in each for us. we're just learning the business.
and i don't think it's a question of selling las vegas takes off the table in fact. i think the sale of las vegas puts us again even further because it provides the capital and the incentive to grow. at the same time, i think people have this speed and work concept or if you're a land-based, you can't be digital, you have to be -- we're not either we're going to be a land-based player for years to come, making probably $5 billion-plus in asia in the near future. we're going to be a digital player and we'll still look at it -- there's some speculation we want to lead the u.s.
market, which is absolutely untrue. we just felt it was a better place to earn more returns on our capital than in las vegas. and we think we can be in multiple businesses. we need digital, land-based, asia, u.s., where the opportunities grow that's where we'll grow.
and we're not tied to any one strategy and one thought process.

operator
good afternoon. my name is sade, and i will be your conference operator today. at this time, i would like to welcome everyone to the las vegas sands second-quarter 2021 earnings call [operator instructions] i will now turn the call over to mr. daniel briggs.
daniel briggs -- senior vice president, investor relations
thank you, operator. joining me on the call today are rob goldstein, our chairman and chief executive officer; and patrick dumont, our president and chief operating officer. also joining us on the call today are dr. wilfred wong, president of sands china; and grant chum, chief operating officer of sands china.
before i turn the call over to rob, please let me remind you that today's conference call will contain forward-looking statements that we're making under the safe harbor provision of federal securities laws. the company's actual results could differ materially from the anticipated results in those forward-looking statements. in addition, we may discuss non-gaap measures. a definition and a reconciliation of each of these measures to the most comparable gaap financial measures is included in the press release.
please note that we have posted supplementary earnings slides on our investor relations website. we may refer to those slides during the q&a portion of the call. [operator instructions] please note that this presentation is being recorded. with that, let me please turn the call over to rob. 
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you, dan, and good afternoon, and a very good early morning to our colleagues in asia. just some brief comments, and we'll go right to q&a. our results continue to reflect the pandemic's impact. we did generate positive ebitda of $244 million per quarter, about the same as the first quarter.
our macao performance reflected sequential improvement, but pandemic-related travel restrictions continue to impact our performance. we do remain confident in the eventual recovery in both macao and singapore, and we cannot define the timing of the full recovery that's underway and will continue in 2021. singapore remains in the $500 million to $600 million range annually, although the second quarter was impacted by heightened pandemic-related restrictions for a portion of the quarter. we will also be subject to closures of both portions of mbs from today through august 5 as part of covid-19-related protocols.
this will obviously have a negative impact on q3 results. and as if, there remains no visibility as to when air traffic will return in singapore, unless macao, it is difficult to project additional ebitda from mbs until the resumption of air travel. our considerable investments in macao continues to take shape as the market recovers four seasons and londoner will present growth opportunities, and we continue to have the largest footprint in this incredible market. china continues to demonstrate economic resilience.
the spending in macao's very strong at the premium mass level from both a gaming and retail perspective. you may want to reference pages 29 and 30 in your deck. we do have great optimism about our ability to form to pre-pandemic levels once the vacation returns. our company is dividing the three areas, the asian portfolio in macao and singapore.
while we believe macao will accelerate in the second half of this year and lead recovery, singapore will follow up on the resumption of air travel. we are confident we'll return to a $5 billion plus ebitda from asia in the future. the sale of the las vegas assets create liquidity and vast optionality to explore large land-based destination resorts in united states and asia. and finally, in the early innings of building out our digital presence, we are exploring multiple opportunities at present.
and we are eager to have this effort become entailed to our company in the years ahead. we'll update you at the appropriate time. let's take some questions.
",":
operator
[operator instructions] your first question is from robin farley from ubs. your line is open.
robin farley -- ubs -- analyst
great. thanks for taking my question. i wanted to follow up on your announcement about your online strategy and kind of pursuing b2b investments. and just if you could help us think about kind of how the brand that you have would help in the b2b effort? or how -- just in terms of what that does for sands as well in a reciprocal way? and then also, is that -- is that going to be the full extent? or are you still looking also at b2c options in the online market? thanks.
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
pat, do you want to take that?
pat dumont -- president and chief operating officer
sure. happy to. thanks, robin. so a few points.
i think our brand is very strong. i think we have decades of established brands and high-quality operations and a great relationship with customers. we think that's very powerful to your point. one thing we're thinking about is we're really investing for the future.
we take a very long-term approach. we're still evaluating a lot of different opportunities. i think b2b presents a very significant opportunity for us. david has a great history, and we're really looking forward to him getting started, and we're happy that he joined us.
i think we'll provide updates as we make progress. it's still very early stages, but we're looking forward to being able to deploy capital over many years, and really looking at it from the long term and create a lot of long-term shareholder value. and i think in the future, you'll see us looking at other things and other opportunities. as rob has said on other calls, we're going to be very patient.
we're going to be prudent and we're going to look for opportunities where we see ways to create real value in the long term. so i don't think this is the last thing you'll see from us, but i think it's really just the beginning, and we're looking forward to seeing this thing evolve over time. so as we make progress, we'll definitely provide more updates.
robin farley -- ubs -- analyst
ok. and i don't know if there's -- just as a follow-up. just thinking about the b2b. many of the b2b providers out there kind of working with those that would technically be your competitors in land based.
and so i guess, how do you think about framing that, how they would see sand's presence in the online business as somebody that they would partner with versus a competitor? thanks.
pat dumont -- president and chief operating officer
it's a very fair point. and i think interestingly, our company has seen a lot of changes in the last 12 months. and i think one of the things that we thought about when we considered this is that we really aren't conflicted. the operations in which we -- the markets in which we operate going forward are going to be singapore and macao.
and so from that standpoint, it's really a limited universe of people who are our true competitive set, particularly in some of the larger geographies where b2b services model could really be productive. so i think from our standpoint, we are a little bit neutral, like we believe we are from the sense that in a lot of the markets that we might look to target, we don't have any land-based operations and don't have any b2c operations where we could find customers from a b2b business model standpoint. so we feel pretty good about it.
robin farley -- ubs -- analyst
ok. great. thank you very much.
operator
your next question is from joe greff from j.p. morgan. your line is open.
joe greff -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
good afternoon, guys. nice to hear your voices. we probably kind of said it mostly just in terms of macao's reliance on travel and mobility-enhancing measures and timing there, so i'm not going to waste my time on that. but i think at the last call, wilfred gave a decent amount of detail and i would say, a decent amount of optimism in terms of your license potentially at markets getting extended sometime middle of this year, and that time frame is sort of passed toward about now.
i was hoping you could give us an update on your conversations or your thinking, renewal/extension process in macao.
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
wilfred, you there?
wilfred wong -- president, sands china
yes. thank you. yeah. i think the situation has not changed.
obviously, the extension is a very complicated issue. it's something that the macao government and the chinese government will have to look at very carefully. they also have their own preoccupation at this stage. for example, the macao government, apart from still working very hard on making sure that macao remain a safe city in all the precautionary measures against covid.
they are now preparing for the next legislative council election, which is due on the 12th of september. so the government is operating at a pace where they feel they want to launch the public consultation for the concession renewal toward the second half of this year, which we believe might mean that it will only happen after the legislative council election. now i don't think the government is in a rush to renew the license because they want to do things right. and as we all know, there are many legal issues they have to attend to such as the concession and subconcession issue.
and this -- they can only go to the legislative council when the new council is in place. and then so for -- at this stage, we are really focusing on doing our best, aligning our interest with the government, such as focusing on investment and reinvestment opportunities, building out our properties, improving our operational efficiencies, maintaining a stable workforce, which is very important during this pandemic. and i think that things will pan itself out eventually because as we move closer to the expiry of the concession, naturally, the extension of the concession is an option which the government will have to look at. but at this stage, there is nothing official and we have no privy information.
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
and just to follow up, joe, on wilfred's comments, we remain very comfortable with our position. we have to be patient, but there will be a resolution. as you know, we've said numerous times, we've led the efforts in macao for a diversified approach to development. we've gone above and beyond.
sheldon was the guy behind the cotai development. we invested usd 15-plus billion, and we continue to follow the government's advice and direction. so we remain very confident and very patient waiting for the government decision. but no real change, nothing new, but we have not altered our belief that we're in a very good position, very comfortable.
joe greff -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
appreciate the thoughts. thank you, guys.
operator
your next question is from carlo santarelli from deutsche bank. your line is open.
carlo santarelli -- deutsche bank -- analyst
hey, guys, good afternoon, good morning. rob, could you talk a little bit about the project at mbs? obviously, 2025 is the deadline -- or sorry, is the expected opening. as you kind of have this amount of setbacks and acknowledging that you guys kind of pushed it earlier given covid back in 2020, does '25 still seem kind of realistic as a target? and what are kind of the goalposts for some of the construction work along the way?
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
i'm going to give it to patrick, except for one. i'll say this before patrick jumps in. we remain very committed to singapore to expanding our presence and our footprint. obviously, covid has thrown a monkey wrench, a big monkey wrench in this whole thing.
but this is an extraordinary market. why do we invest in singapore? we've done very well there. and the addition is going to happen. i think the time frame really depends on the ability to get back to work in the construction area and getting things back in line.
i think we've lost '21, we're halfway to '22. so again, we are committed and i'll ask patrick to provide more color because he's dealt with the government directly.
pat dumont -- president and chief operating officer
thanks, rob. i think the key thing is what rob just said, which is there's a certain amount of uncertainty around the timing and availability of when we can actually get things done. a lot of the early parts of this project required us to work with certain government agencies to seek their approval and to work with them collaboratively to ensure that we fulfill the obligations and their desires, as well as part of this project. it's a very tight site.
it's eight acres. there's a lot of programming, a lot of density, a lot of things that have to be worked through and a lot of things that have to be integrated into the current environment to make it right. and so we're starting to work through some of those things. but as a practical matter, the nature of the construction project of this complexity and size would always be challenging in a normal environment.
so i think we're just trying to be cautious and make sure that we understand all the different parameters around labor and around construction time lines before we say that this schedule that is not achievable is achievable. i think a lot of it depends on the environment and how things go in terms of concession work -- excuse me, covid recovery over the next couple of months. we'll have a much better view at that time. but right now, i think we're just -- we're cautiously optimistic.
we're going to continue working with the government and hopefully have an opportunity to get going sooner rather than later.
carlo santarelli -- deutsche bank -- analyst
great. thanks, rob and patrick. if i could just one quick one. has there been any thought, obviously, now given the sale of the venetian las vegas, and the proceeds that are on the comp for that, can you -- potentially revisiting the bidding process in japan?
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
not at this time, carlo. we've had inquiries from a lot of parties there. we've tried very hard and put a lot of money and a lot of human capital work there in the last 10, 15 years, and we left with a feeling that there's just much uncertainty for us. you can always revisit something based on a change in circumstance.
but at this point, we remain in the sidelines.
carlo santarelli -- deutsche bank -- analyst
understood. thanks, guys.
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
your next question is from stephen grambling from goldman sachs. your line is open.
stephen grambling -- goldman sachs -- analyst
hey, thanks. could you just talk a little bit about some of the different expansion opportunities for land-based resorts in the u.s. or even other broader markets that we haven't touched based on so far and how you prioritize and evaluate those different markets?
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
well, being in the u.s., you know of our efforts in new york, which we've shut down because new york did not resolve that issue. so that's not available at this time. texas, we remain very committed to pursuing. i think it's a couple of years away, but i think there's a real chance down the road back in texas doing something down there.
there's some recent news about florida. we put a foot in the water in florida. we think that's a real opportunity. we're going to -- there's a path there in '22 if we're successful in gathering signatures to have a vote in the fall of '22 for a land-based opportunity.
in the u.s., that's the discipline we're looking at. we've obviously discussed japan, although previously. our best opportunities are to reinvest in macao and singapore because those places are proven huge successes. and i think when you're as fortunate as we are to have made $5-plus billion, we need to roll out there who knows what, but there's a lot of running room in both singapore and macao.
frankly, they remain our biggest focus because they're so extraordinary and hard to duplicate anywhere in the world. and i think that's our focus right now is getting mbs things to up and hopefully wait for the fall, and we can invest more in macao. the londoner we completed later this year or in '22, four seasons. we'd love to deploy more capital in asia.
i think the broad opportunity is interesting. we'll see we have -- if we can get there. but it's hard to find things extraordinary at the two places we operate to bet.
stephen grambling -- goldman sachs -- analyst
makes sense. thanks so much. i'll jump back in the queue.
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
your next question is from shaun kelley from bank of america. your line is open.
shaun kelley -- bank of america / merrill lynch -- analyst
hi. good afternoon, everyone. maybe a question for either grant or wilfred, but i was wondering i think we have a pretty good sight line on the core -- on the premium mass market and how that's performing and how the spending behavior is going. but i was wondering if there's any color or insights you guys have gleaned just from what you're seeing on more of the base mass or the lower end mass market.
i'm sure the samples had a small. i'm just kind of curious on how the customer is behaving when they are in the market and what you've seen at some of your properties if you could provide anything there?
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
grant?
grant chum -- senior vice president of global gaming strategy
yup. thanks, shaun. good morning. i think the trends have been pretty consistent in the last six months.
you see, i think, very strong consumption propensity, great strength in spending power for those who have returned to macao for leisure trips. and i think that applies across the different segments. but obviously, clearly, the premium mass, the segment has returned in greater volume, greater number of patrons. but you go further down to mid-level in the base mass, the spending power is definitely prominent.
however, you can see from the visitations, they are still around, let's say, low 20% of where we were before the pandemic. so the base mass is clearly impacted by just the drastic reduction in the number of people visiting. but the people who are coming are actually staying longer and in most cases, even more. and i think what was encouraging sequentially, although june was somewhat of a temporary hiccup.
what was encouraging was we saw the greatest amount of sequential growth in the base mass and the fit segments versus q1 order premium mass continue to recover, the bigger bounce back was actually in the base mass. so we hope to see some of those mix of encouraging trends continue into the summer, summer holidays and beyond.
shaun kelley -- bank of america / merrill lynch -- analyst
great. and maybe to change gears for a quick follow-up on the online topic, if i could. for patrick or rob, just kind of want to get your quick sense on maybe the build versus buy equation, right? so obviously, some of these technologies and things are out there, but they could be quite expensive. just how do you kind of weigh maybe some of the options set around acquisitions and sizing relative to possibly things that could be done maybe more organically?
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
patrick?
pat dumont -- president and chief operating officer
so it's a very interesting question. it's something that we've been looking at for a while, and we continue to look at. and it's an interesting comment about valuations. i think there's been a lot of optimism in the market call it, the last six to 12 months.
and valuations have definitely moved around a lot in the last few weeks. i think the key thing for us is we're really building for the long term. and so when we look at things, we're really going to take a long-term view of value. and if we do acquire something, it's going to be for the reason that it fits into a much larger, broader strategy and something where we see long-term value creation by owning it.
i also think we're not necessarily looking to take big bites right away. i think this is something we're going to look to develop it over time in a prudent manner and sort of build more and then maybe buy where it makes sense. i don't think you'll see us go out and make a splash by using las vegas sale proceeds in any large transformational acquisition, unless there's some really compelling reason why we have to do it. but that's not our focus.
our focus is to build the product, get the culture right, get the opportunity right and then make acquisitions as they sit in with the overall strategy.
shaun kelley -- bank of america / merrill lynch -- analyst
thank you very much.
operator
your next question is from thomas allen from morgan stanley. your line is open.
thomas allen -- morgan stanley -- analyst
yeah. patrick, just a follow-up to that question. respecting that you're not going to do a transformational deal. like how are you thinking about the size of the deal? like are you thinking of being kind of an incubator for start-ups? or are you thinking like hundreds of millions, low billions? how are you thinking about the sizes?
pat dumont -- president and chief operating officer
it's a pretty broad range. i'll tell you our goal is really -- i don't know that we provide a lot of value at the angel stage. we might be able to help some people, but i'm not really sure that that's where we provide sort of the most value. i think from our standpoint, if we can get kind of earlier stage and mid-stage, but again, sitting into a larger strategy, that's where we'll look to be really effective.
i think things that are much larger that would be transformational in the $1 billion range. we'd have to have a really good reason to do it. and i think we'd want to be operating for a while to understand why that would make sense for us, right? i don't think we're going to buy our way into a business. i think we're going to develop our way into a business and look to see how acquisitions help enhance that approach.
thomas allen -- morgan stanley -- analyst
helpful color. that makes sense. and then just on macao and singapore, respecting that the majority of your business and the majority of your future is really around the mass market. vip came in really light, only $600 million of rolling chip volumes in singapore stood out.
just, can you talk about what's going on there and your expectations?
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
i think you were saying you're looking at singapore as close to macao, you're saying, right, thomas?
thomas allen -- morgan stanley -- analyst
i think macao was down quarter over quarter, too, rob. so i mean singapore was what really stood out. could you talk about vip in general and kind of your expectations there?
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. well, the vip, as you know it right now, it's a closed market, just locals only. so you're trading mostly on -- exclusively on people who are living in singapore. now maybe -- that may be people residing there during the pandemic.
you might get -- and that's to push from some of the folks who moved to singapore, to weigh out the pandemic is part of the reason. but i don't think you can look at our numbers at this point and really make a whole lot of inference as the future because it's so -- without having a little bit of sloppiness, it's so outsized and yet it's surprising us how well it's doing because we never would have chased that kind of performance, yet people, they can't leave. they're stuck in singapore. the same way people can't leave, they're stuck in singapore right now on the high end.
so i think it's hard to make inferences like into the future. it's probably a trend, it's just an anomaly. i think that's going to be the case until this thing resolves, as air traffic have been down on singapore. you can see these trends, both good and bad, they are confusing.
and i think in the case of it's very difficult to look at singapore's numbers, come up with a clear direction where it goes and the sloppy performance confused all of us initially. and now you realize a lot of people have traveled outside singapore by staying, for example. the same probably holds true on the high end on the trends national to be residing in singapore during the pandemic. so i'm not sure you can make a whole lot of long-term trends based what we're seeing today in singapore.
pat dumont -- president and chief operating officer
there's one other comment that might be helpful, which is the way we're sort of thinking about it is that the investment and the products really matter. and so if you look at what we've done during the pandemic, we spent a lot of time and deployed a lot of capital in sort of enhancing the offerings that we have. so when there is a recovery, we have better capacity and more competitive product. it is a product of the industry.
and so from our standpoint, the way we think about the long term is the level of investment that we've put in during the pandemic, so we can position ourselves in a more strong way when the recovery happens. so i wouldn't look at the rolling volumes now and for you guys to indicate anything. i think you should look at the fact that you've been able to deploy capital, create higher-quality products, create higher quality experience for our customers. and that way, we're stronger positioned on the other side.
and that's how we're really approaching it.
thomas allen -- morgan stanley -- analyst
all helpful. thank you.
operator
your next question is from steve wieczynski from stifel. your line is open.
steve wieczynski -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
hey, guys, good afternoon. so probably going back to wilfred with this question, but i guess for americans and investors that we talked to, it's tough for us to understand where china is with respect to their vaccination progress. and case counts continue to look pretty promising, but china is still having issues. but is it -- china is still having issues with lack of availability with the vaccine? or is it -- the vaccine that's being used hasn't been effective? or is it just something else? i'm just trying to get more color around that if all that makes sense.
wilfred wong -- president, sands china
thank you for the question. actually, china is not lacking in vaccines. actually, they export quite a lot of vaccines. but the truth is if you look at the statistics, china today has already administered 1.5 billion doses of vaccine.
now that really means that over 50%, 60% of the population has been vaccinated. and if you assume everyone has two doses, that represents 53%. and they're still vaccinating at over 10 million doses a day. so what it means is that every 25 days, they can increase that vaccination rate by 10%.
now that is also, to some extent, true for hong kong and macao. hong kong already administered 5 million doses and its vaccination rate is already over 40%. macao administered 460,000 doses. that's also over 40% of the population.
so we're quite confident that if china continues in that rate, and with the increase of vaccination rate by about 10% per 25 days, when you come to winter, then almost the whole population, like 90%, 80% would be vaccinated. now i think once we reach that level, that travel bubble within china, including hong kong and macao, it's really possible. now what you have seen in the news is that because china adopts a non-tolerance policy toward covid, so whenever there's some outbreak in certain areas in the country, it's widely reported and they immediately go back to lockdown. and that's why i think the best scenario in the short term is a travel bubble between china, hong kong and macao because they're so concerned about the importation of covid cases, especially with the variant cases.
steve wieczynski -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
that's great color. appreciate it. thanks, guys.
operator
your last question is from david katz from jefferies. your line is open.
david katz -- jefferies -- analyst
hi. afternoon. thanks for taking my question. you've covered a lot of ground.
what i wanted to ask was just kind of a broader question here. taking in everything about the u.s. and what you've said in asia, if we were to think about what lvs looks like in, say, three to five years out or two to five years out, what's that picture look like? what's the vision for that? what are the -- and obviously that can be as qualitative and high level as you're thinking about it. but i'd love to just hear your perspectives on that.
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
we have a pretty simple market structure. we, first and foremost, see return to $5 billion, $6 billion ebitda in our macao and singapore markets. we see a renewed investment in both macao and singapore to grow that from $5 billion to $6 billion and beyond. we certainly see a one or two land-based facilities in the united states, maybe florida or texas.
and lastly, we have a strong digital presence. and reflecting our balance sheet, we have the ability to do all these things. i think we're convinced in asia that the most important thing in this company, the timing is uncertain of the turn to a more normal environment in asia, but the outcome is not uncertain. it's going to happen.
and i think it will reflect what's happened here in las vegas, which is people flock these casinos, we'll make more money than pre-covid, and our business will boom again. and that's -- we're not steering clear of that, but we're not quite sure of that timing, but not the outcome. i also think we -- and clearly, we want to invest heavily in both those places because that's our best path to $6 billion, $7 billion, $8 billion ebitda. we've made very clear our belief in both texas, florida and perhaps, other large field jurisdictions in the u.s.
we have the balance sheet and the optionality to pursue those. and as patrick outlined, we are very involved in the digital strategy. we're pretty slow to get there, but in three or five years from now, you'll see a real -- a positive outcome. and that's where we think we end up.
we feel pretty confident. we've been derailed the last 18 months by this terrific virus, this pandemic. but i think it's clear we're heading -- to me, it's very obvious that we are being patient and staying the course. and i think while we're doing that, we have ample liquidity to do anything we want to do anywhere and in a large scale.
so that will be my thought three to five years from now. patrick, your sentiments?
pat dumont -- president and chief operating officer
i couldn't agree with you more. and i think the great thing about it is we have a lot of opportunity in front of us, right? i can't tell you which one of these options, hopefully, all of them become available, but quality. and the great thing is that we've just invested $2.2 billion in macao. we feel very strongly about the market.
and the potential to invest more post concession renewals, we feel very strongly about the expansion in singapore and our long-term commitment. singapore is a very unique tourism destination and a high quality of earnings potential that we'll get from singapore. and then looking to the u.s., these are just great locations. and looking at the digital opportunity, we feel really strongly about the returns and the potential growth that's in this area.
so from a company standpoint, five years from now, we could be looking like a very different company in terms of our scale. and to rob's point earlier, i think our balance sheet and the capability that the liquidity from the sale of las vegas presents -- allows us to pursue all of these opportunities. so we're very bullish about it.
david katz -- jefferies -- analyst
if i may, just to follow it up quickly, and i appreciate all of that. with respect to the digital strategy, is the notion that it would be integrated with the company as it is today and branded as such? or is it more of a sort of a separate enterprise or potentially either still at this point? thank you.
pat dumont -- president and chief operating officer
rob, if you're ok, i'll grab that one.
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah, please do.
pat dumont -- president and chief operating officer
so i think the key thing to note is we have a very skilled team and a great platform. we have a very strong corporate culture. we have just the ability to execute on a variety different things. and i think we have the capital to have patience and invest for the long term.
and so i think this is going to be a business that will require separate people, separate infrastructure and be distinct. that being said, it will benefit from being part of our larger organization. so much like singapore and macao are part of a global team, they have things that are specific to them that they have to deal with and so will this business. but it will benefit from being part of a large organization.
david katz -- jefferies -- analyst
thank you very much. appreciate it.
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you, david, as always.

rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks, dan. good afternoon, and good morning to our colleagues in asia, and thank you for joining our call today. i'll provide some brief comments, and we'll go to the q&a. our results continue to reflect the pandemic impact, heightened restrictions directly impacted our results in both macao and singapore this quarter, we did generate positive ebitda for the quarter in both markets, and we remain confident in the eventual recovery in both macao and singapore.
singapore gaming operations were closed for a portion of the quarter, enhanced restrictions were in place throughout the remainder of the quarter. the good news in singapore is the travel corridors are being established with a number of source markets which hopefully will contribute to the strong recovery over time. our considerable investments in macao continue to take shape. as the market recovers, we believe the four seasons in london will present growth opportunities in the future.
the spending in macao has proven both resilient at the premium mass level from both a gaming and a retail perspective, you see on page 29 and 30 in your deck, and we have great optimism about our ability to perform to a pre-pandemic level once visitation does return. our company is divided into three areas. most importantly the asia portfolio in macao and singapore. we remain confident we'll return to a strong positive cash flow in both macao and singapore in the future as restrictions are eased and travel and tourism recover.
the sale of our las vegas assets creates liquidity and optionality as we pursue large-scale land-based destination resorts in both the u.s. and asia. we will continue to build out our digital presence and we're exploring multiple opportunities we'll face at the appropriate time in the future. so, thanks for your time again today.
let's go to the questions. dan?
dan briggs -- senior vice president of investor relations
operator, ready to go.

thank you. [operator instructions] your first question is coming from the line of carlo santarelli from deutsche bank. your line is open.
carlo santarelli -- deutsche bank -- analyst
hey, everybody. i hope everyone is well. rob, obviously, i'm not going to spend a lot of time discussing the results, as we all know that numerous things impacting results right now. but when you think about kind of the progress as it pertains to macao and what you're kind of hearing around potential easing of visa stuff, whether it's on a province-by-province basis or whatever the latest is, that you could kind of share would be appreciated.
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
sure. we woke up two guys. let them speak to it. let -- grant or wilfred, do you take that since you're on the ground and living and breathing these issues every day?
grant chum -- chief operating officer of sands china
yeah, let me give that a try. yeah. thanks, rob. yeah, on the visas, i think the main point is the visa channels for the individual business scheme remains open.
i think if you look at the quarter -- in the third quarter, what really impacted results during the quarter, month by month is really the conditions on the ground in terms of domestic covid cases. so, you will see that in july, at one point, for about three weeks in july, we had a pretty significant recovery in the visitation and also room occupancy. and we were starting to get a good momentum for the summer after the issues we had in the guangdong outbreak in june. and then as we moved into late july and early august, we had more local cases, starting with the nanjing airport outbreak.
and eventually, in early august, we did have four local cases. so that obviously curtailed the traffic immediately. and then as we moved into september, again, we were recovering well, especially in the second and third week of september. and we were building up ready for the october golden week again.
and unfortunately, we did have some local cases toward the last week of september, which again reduced the traffic immediately as it led to additional restrictions around the border. so, that really explains how the traffic flow evolved during the quarter.
carlo santarelli -- deutsche bank -- analyst
great. thank you. that's helpful. and then just as a quick follow-up, rob, you guys did disclose, and i think this is different from how you've disclosed historically around capital expenditures in the period, the one line in there was $24 million of corporate and other.
does that -- what exactly does that pertain to? and does that have anything to do with the comments that you made on kind of the digital piece of the business?
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
sure. pat, why don't you take that?
pat dumont -- president and chief operating officer
sure. i think there's a bunch of stuff in there. some of the stuff related to digital, and some of it relates to capex associated with moving.
carlo santarelli -- deutsche bank -- analyst
got it. and could you kind of just update your latest thoughts on the learnings of the last couple of months of the quarter as it pertains to kind of the digital initiative to any degree, patrick?
pat dumont -- president and chief operating officer
yes, sure. happy to do it. i think for us, we take a very long-term approach. we mentioned it last quarter.
i think this is something that's going to invest over quarters and years. we're really investing for the future. i think for us, we're looking to be sort of mindful of the way we deploy capital. we've always had a history of investing in things that we think provide a very high level of returns in the future.
and that's how we're thinking about it today. we think there's a great opportunity in digital in a variety of different areas. you key some of the valuations that the market is giving to certain areas today. we think it's very compelling, especially for the long term.
so right now, we're just sort of moving along slowly. and when we have more things to report we will, as rob said in his opening remarks, but we're very confident. we have capital to deploy against it. we're excited about the future, and when we have more things to talk about, we certainly will.
but right now, it's very early stages.
carlo santarelli -- deutsche bank -- analyst
understood. thank you, guys.
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you, carlo.
operator
thank you. your next question is from the line of stephen grambling from goldman sachs. your line is open.
stephen grambling -- goldman sachs -- analyst
hey, thank you. maybe changing gears to look at singapore. it looks like that market was also obviously impacted in the quarter of vip, particularly soft. if we look out further once restrictions ease, i guess how do you think about the potential ebitda potential of that asset if vip in macao remains pressured? in other words, what kind of overlap do you typically see in singapore from the chinese traveler.
and could that be impacted if vip is kind of permanently restricted?
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
sure. yeah. first of all, i think the fascinating part to me is we operate in three markets currently. and las vegas is the blueprint, i think for the recovery of asia.
we said about a year ago, when i was coming to work and someone told me, in las vegas, we wouldn't see normal returns here until -- revenues until '24 or '25. so here we are in the fall of '21, and the market is blown wide open. and what's the path? the path is pent-up demand, vaccinations, and doors get opened. and i think las vegas will be the blueprint for asia.
that's the path. so, vaccinations in asia are booming, if you can look at what's happening in singapore and malaysia, japan, china, korea, it's all above the percentage-wise, what's happened in the u.s. so first, we have extremely strong vaccination rates in asia surpassing the u.s. number two, i think you've got to obviously have a government that wants to open the doors in singapore is evidenced by their actions, they wanted just that.
i think you're going to see a big turn in '22. the recovery will begin in '22. when do we get back to $1.7 million and maybe beyond that ebitda, i don't know the exact date. i can't tell you.
i can tell you this. it's going to be a lot better in '22 if the government continues their path, which has shown a lot of leadership, thoughtfulness, vaccination rates i think are actually approaching 80-plus percent. the market over there feels it's ready to come back in '22. as the government opens those travel lanes and we look at -- again, the demand issues here in las vegas have been, i think, very instructive.
it's great to walk through here and see the numbers that's kicking out through the entire city. why wouldn't that happen in asia? singapore has been a hugely important market to us. your point about macao versus the chinese market. obviously, part of our business is dependent upon access to chinese market, but it's not dependent.
we probably could still make a lot of money, maybe as much as $1.5 billion without a lot of chinese inputs. so, if korea opens up and singapore opens up, malaysia opens up, and korea and japan, those markets are very, very sad and happy for us. and i believe we'll see them start opening up throughout '22. that's the path.
it's a vaccination rate, which is soaring. it's opened traveling. it's opening the doors up and then watching what's happened in vegas, happened in singapore. and i feel -- i don't want to identify a month or a quarter, but i think you're going to see a nice turn in '22.
and then the same will happen in macao when the government decides to open those doors up. so, i know there's -- people argue that people will say it's '25 to macao, end up '27. but the truth is vegas is just out 30 minutes. once we open doors up, it just recovers.
and as a gaming base recovery, it's not a convention banquet-based recovery actually have to come. so, i think the future in vegas remains, as we've always said, very bright, and there's no reason why it can't be emulated in both singapore and macao as vaccination rates take off and governments get more confident and travel lanes reopen. so, we're highly confident it's going to happen in singapore in '22. to what degree, i won't predict, but it's just a question of time for lvs goes right back to where it was pre-covid.
it's just inevitable. so, we're very confident.
stephen grambling -- goldman sachs -- analyst
that's helpful. and perhaps as a follow-up, going back to macao, i would love to just -- if you could provide any additional color on the consultation process. and what are the kind of the key points of clarification that you are watching for as you think about how to strategically position the business? thanks.
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes, i've been involved in a lot of my colleagues in macao over two decades. and we've seen everything in macao. i mean, we've been through everything. and starting 20 years ago and people said, oh, you can't do business in macao.
and then cotai wouldn't be successful. and then we have the incredibly crippling crisis in '08 and '09. we had smoking issues. it always worked out and we're very proud of what we've done in macao over the years.
i think our activities, our investments speak for themselves. i have faith in the process. they've always treated us fairly, and we responded with the largest investment in any gaming market in the world. so, we believe we remain believers.
we wait for the government's advice and direction. we've submitted our responses. but looking at our history, our success, i believe, we'll be instructive for the future of our business in macao, and so no more kind of beyond that. i think it's clear to say that we have a lot of lead in this market.
stephen grambling -- goldman sachs -- analyst
thanks so much.
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you.

your next question is from the line of joe greff from j.p. morgan. your line is open.
joe greff -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
hello, everybody. rob and grant, on macao's recovery and the potential for more meaningful increased travel and mobility between mainland china and macao, you get the impression, whether it's from conversations with the government or otherwise, that this is more likely after the olympics in beijing in february.
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
i'll defer to the fellows in the ground. but i don't think we've heard these points of golden week and it's going to happen when the olympics are over. i don't think we know, and i think it would be silly for us to predict, joe. i don't think we can really give you confidence that we have great insight to when the doors will reopen.
but we just know they will at some point. i think '22 will be a turn year. but i don't want to get into the game of saying it's going to happen in this state. i think we said in previous calls, we don't know when.
we just know when it does happen, it's going to be very powerful. it's going to be like las vegas. i mean, anybody doesn't see that hasn't spent time in macao. it's going to be quite a storm of activity over there.
but i don't want to the olympics or golden week or because we -- obviously, we've been wrong but those who predicted have fallen on the sword. there's no reason to -- grant, wilfred, do you have a different approach to this? speak up.
grant chum -- chief operating officer of sands china
yes.
wilfred wong -- president of sands china
so, we agree -- sorry, grant, go ahead.
grant chum -- chief operating officer of sands china
sorry, wilfred, go ahead. i'm just going to say -- i mean, we see underlying demand continues to be very strong when the opportunity arises. now the opportunity has -- maybe has been relatively brief one month here, a few weeks there, but we can definitely see the underlying demand actually across all the different segments as very strong. and i think rob referenced the pent-up demand that we're seeing in las vegas coming through.
and i think it's not going to be dissimilar in macao but agree with rob, that we can't be really drawing into predicting timing, but we definitely see the evidence on the pent-up demand for sure.
wilfred wong -- president of sands china
and i think that china will open up to the world when they feel confident that they can control any community outbreak situations. and that depends a lot on the vaccination rate, which at this stage, stands at about 80%, and the availability of medicinal cure. they're now testing with all kinds of cure methods, including chinese herbal methods, and there's a lot of research going into it. so, we're quite hopeful that very soon with -- and they are vaccinating at about 1.3 million, 1.4 million people a day.
so, if they continue like this in another 200 days, it will be another 10% of the population. so, i think as china's vaccination rate goes up, the government's confidence increases. and we're hopeful that macao, as part of china, adopting similar policies will benefit from the opening up.
joe greff -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
great. thank you. patrick, on the investments on the digital side, can you talk about how you envision maybe the size of those investments over the next couple of years? are we talking about relatively small more modest investments? or could we see investments in the hundreds of millions or $1 billion range, depending on what's available and what you like?
pat dumont -- president and chief operating officer
so, it's something we talk about a lot internally. i think some of it's going to be related to the value of the opportunity that we see. i think sort of our thoughts right now is that we're really thinking earlier stage or mid-stage. but again, it would fit into a larger strategy and that's kind of how we'll think about being effective for the long term and how we think will create long-term value.
i don't know that we'll necessarily look at something that's transformational right away. that's something that we may consider in the future depending on where things go and what market opportunity we see. but i think the good news is we've got plenty of firepower. we've got a strong management team and expertise in the industry, and we think we can be really helpful to growing technology.
so, from our standpoint, we're going to be opportunistic, and we'll see how it goes. but in the beginning, we're going to start small and sort of build from there.
joe greff -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
thank you.
operator
your next question is from the line of robin farley from ubs. your line is open.
robin farley -- ubs -- analyst
great. thanks. i wanted to ask about one of the proposals in the new legislation is that it would require government approval for dividends. and if that were enacted, i realize just in the discussion stages now.
but if that were enacted into law, would you think twice about investing if you -- if then there would be a chance that you wouldn't be approved to get a return on that investment. in other words, how much of a concern would that be for you?
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
pat, do you want to take that?
pat dumont -- president and chief operating officer
i'm sorry. yes. i think it -- i think from our standpoint, i think we're obviously very much focused on building on our past. and as rob mentioned, i think we have a great track record of investing in macao in scale and nongaming amenities.
and i think from our standpoint, we have confidence that what ultimately will result from this process will be a good path forward. and so, we're very confident. we're eagerly awaiting instructions on how to proceed. but in our mind, macao is the best market in the world.
we continue to invest. we're very excited about the long term in macao. and that we'll wait and see how things go. but from our standpoint, we're very confident about the future.
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
look, robin, one thing i think what we're trying to reference is after two decades of being there, we've never found the government to be not thoughtful. they're very thoughtful, and they're going to take these issues and make it reasonable for all of us. we're not that concerned. i mean, i saw initially the response was like that, big concern.
we don't have those concerns. and yes, we're eager to reinvest in macao. and we're assuming that the process will be fair and equal and we're also assuming that they want us to invest as well. the government, they want to see growth in macao.
so, we're not that concerned about that issue at all.
robin farley -- ubs -- analyst
ok. no, that's helpful. thank you. and maybe just a quick follow-up, just in terms of timing or potential extension of your existing concession.
is there a point at which you feel like the indication is that it's going to be extended for at least another 12 months? i mean, just given the timing already seems would be -- seems very challenging to do anything before june of '22, given the inability to travel into the country. is that safe to assume that at this point, it's not something you would expect to come up for bid before june. thanks.
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
i don't think we're going to -- we're not going to voice an opinion because we just -- again, we remain confident in the process to work out. again, we have two decades of history with this government. and it's been a very good two decades. this company built a great business based on it.
we've had -- like every business, you have stops and starts, we've had good days and bad days. but in the two decades since we started the business in macao, we've always found the government very reasonable, very thoughtful, and very fair. and we're not concerned whether they make that decision next month, the month after, or make it in june. i don't know when they're going to make that decision.
i'll let them make that decision and tell us. we'll respond accordingly. but we have no trepidation or any fear that there will be an issue of this. we knew this was coming.
i mean, it is a leasehold. we knew this day was coming, and we're prepared for it. and we're also fair to wait until the government tells us how they want to proceed, and we'll respect for that process.
robin farley -- ubs -- analyst
ok, great. thank you very much.
operator
thank you. your next question is from the line of shaun kelley from bank of america. your line is open.
shaun kelley -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
hi. good morning, good afternoon, everyone. just to maybe follow up on this -- the whole licensing process, i mean, i think one thing we've all thought about is the requirement or the idea that there are probably incremental capital that would need to be invested either in macao, theoretically in nongaming amenities, which you know well, or in somewhere in sort of greater mainland china. and just kind of wanted to ask about that last point.
any thoughts on your desire, your ability to invest directly in mainland china? is that something you'd be prepared to do? and sort of how would you kind of underwrite returns or think about underwriting those given some of your return focus, if that was the ask?
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
i'm going to refer to patrick, but i'm going to pre-empt that by saying, again, you know, we have the ability to invest now that's clear based on our balance sheet. we have the appetite to invest. and we have a track record obviously, we've invested $15 billion. we invested a few billion dollars right before the pandemic hit, which people thought, ""oh, gee, you want to cloud in-license, we did it."" so, we remain willing and eager to invest in macao and perhaps other parts of macao and just waiting that day to happen.
patrick, do you want to jump in?
pat dumont -- president and chief operating officer
sure. thanks, rob. we're very happy and very proud of sheldon's long-term vision for macao and for our company's investments, we're very proud of what sheldon and the company and the team has accomplished over many years there. the amount of investment, the high quality of tourism assets that we've created, the tourism drivers, the nongaming diversification.
and really to be fair, a lot of the tourism innovation that we brought to macao have all been things that have been complementary and followed through with the original goal of the first concession. and so, we're very proud about that, and we're very confident about the future and our ability to invest in order to support these long-term goals of the government and for the company. and so, i think as we look to potential things that we may have to do in terms of future investment, we welcome the opportunity. we would love to invest more.
we're very eager to deploy capital into these markets. we think they're very high quality. and we really believe in the future. so, there's just been a lot of commentary around things that may happen to occur or may have to occur.
i don't think anyone really knows. i think the only thing that we're very confident about is our ability to invest, to innovate from the tourism side, and to drive, really, the support of the initiatives that have been asked of us. so, from that standpoint, we're ready to do it. but until we get clear direction, there's not really much more we can say.
shaun kelley -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
great. and maybe just as the follow-up, sticking with the investment theme, probably for you, patrick, but just thinking about the -- like the same question for singapore. obviously, there, you have a little bit more of a developed path on dollars that have been allocated and when you want to get going. but can you just give us the latest on when you think you'd actually be moving on some of the investment you guys have committed to make there and building out the additional hotel tower and expansion?
pat dumont -- president and chief operating officer
sure. you know, as we've said before, i think we're very excited to do it. it represents a tremendous opportunity to support singapore's goals to deploy a significant amount of capital in the most privileged market in the world, which is really one of the great cities in the world. singapore is growing.
it was growing tremendously before the pandemic. and they've really been leaders in their public health initiatives to support their population during the pandemic. so, we're very proud to be there. i think we would love to get started as soon as possible.
but right now, they're dealing with a lot of things that have a higher priority. so, we're waiting patiently. we have a long-term partnership with the government, and we're looking forward to working through the open remaining items so that we can begin. but our plan is to begin and we're very excited about it.
so, the question is when, and i think that's going to be dictated by necessary public health responses around timing and opening.
shaun kelley -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
thanks very much for the question.
operator
your next question is from ben chaiken from credit suisse. your line is open.
ben chaiken -- credit suisse -- analyst
hey, how's it going? you know, there's been lots of conversation understandably about investing in digital and future investments that may be required in singapore and macao. but at the same time, you spoke about pent-up demand in macao and singapore, which seems to make a share buyback at these levels potentially a more compelling roi. i guess, how do you balance the optionality of those different options, i guess, yeah?
pat dumont -- president and chief operating officer
so, we think about this a lot. we spend a lot of time on it as a management team. we run a lot of sensitivities and scenarios around potential returns. and it's interesting.
we have a lot of opportunity as a company. we're really excited about it. and i think our highest and best use of capital and to create the best shareholder returns really is to develop new projects from the ground up. that's how we built the company.
that's how we've always created the return profile that has made our equity very compelling. and so, from our standpoint, that's our focus. rob and the rest of the team spent a lot of time looking at new development opportunities in many different jurisdictions. and so, we're focused on deploying capital into those jurisdictions to grow the business.
at the same time, we recognize there's opportunity in the equity. and in the past, we've always returned excess capital through share repurchases. and so that's something that we'll look to do in the future. but at this point, i think we're evaluating a lot of opportunities for real growth.
and so, from that standpoint, we're very excited, but we'll always look at the return potential of buying equity. do we believe the equity is at a compelling level? absolutely. but at the same time, we also like to believe that we have some real significant development opportunities in the future that will create very significant returns as well. so, to your point, it is a balance.
but we look at it, and we're trying to allocate capital in the best way that we can.
ben chaiken -- credit suisse -- analyst
thanks.
operator
thank you. your next question is from the line of dan politzer from wells fargo. your line is open. 
dan politzer -- wells fargo -- analyst
hi, everyone. good afternoon. thanks for taking my questions. so, on singapore, how do you think about margins for this property over the next couple of years? i think there's a higher tax rate that goes into effect and potentially impact from construction disruption and possibly some of the costs you were able to optimize over the past 18 months.
so, going forward over the next couple of years, how do you think about that given the expectation for pent-up demand to come back in 2022?
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
well, first of all, look at what's happened. again, it's instructive look at las vegas. the so-called 4-year recovery took again about less than a year. i think singapore is a viable las vegas in terms of the pre-covid recovery being stronger, which means stronger margins for us and bigger growth.
i think this market in singapore is proving very resilient in the past, especially when the governments come open the travelings, open the doors up, i think margins will be just fine. we didn't -- by the way, we didn't furlough people and lay off lots of people, didn't squeeze people out the door, we stood by our employees. and i think we didn't necessarily maximizing credit. we decided not to do that.
and i think that's to our credit. but on the other hand, i think our business there will reoccur back to pre-covid levels and probably beyond pre-covid. and again, if vegas is instructive, and i believe it is, the demand is going to be extraordinary in asia. the lockdown here in las vegas was much shorter than the lockdown in asia.
yet the gambling proclivity for lot of asian countries is stronger than las vegas. so, anybody who thinks singapore is not going to come back with a vengeance, i think has mistaken, the same in macao. and of course, those revenues will drive our margins. so, i have no fear that we're going to return to pre-covid margins and pre-covid revenues and exceed both.
in fact, i'm really bullish on singapore, will be the first and the best place open next year for the gamer or for the tourists or for the leisure traveler. it's going to be exceptional plan to revisit. you see where the government is going. i mean, they've indicated they're anxiously getting open there.
vaccination rates are soaring. the traveling to be established. the neighborhood is being better in malaysia, korea, japan. indonesia is still lagging but coming on.
so, i think it's just question of time, '22 is a turn year. so, we see margins and revenues and ebitda as being much more back to normal than in the last 24 months.
dan politzer -- wells fargo -- analyst
got it. thanks. and then just one more on macao. i mean, when macao does eventually recover, how do you think about your share of mass and slot ggr evolving given the opening of the londoner which we didn't have back in 2019.
and also, i know you targeted a different customer, but how do you anticipate any impact from lisboa palace on your properties? and if so, if there is an impact, which ones?
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. mr. chum, are you still there?
grant chum -- chief operating officer of sands china
yeah, rob. i think history of macao shows every time we have large-scale, high-quality product coming in on cotai, it helps the market. and i think when the demand comes back, it's going to be to the market's benefit and to the whole industry's benefit that we've got a good new product that customers can patronize. and that applies to lisboa palace that applies to what some of our other competitors will be -- will have opened by then.
and obviously, we think first and foremost is going to apply to what we've completed in grand suites at four seasons and also the londoner macao. so, we're very excited and confident that when the demand returns, all these new projects, but i would say, especially our projects is going to be a growth driver for the industry and by implication, we hope that we will achieve good market share. but i think it's much more about as the history and two decades have shown growing the overall pie. and i think in terms of segments, again, i wouldn't hesitate to say that it's going to be positive across a very broad base of segmentation of the mass, the premium mass and so forth.
dan politzer -- wells fargo -- analyst
got it. thanks so much, guys.
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you.

your next question is from the line of david katz from jefferies. your line is open. david? mr. katz? ok, we'll go to the next question.
it's from the line of steve wieczynski from stifel. your line is open. 
steve wieczynski -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
hey, guys. good afternoon. just one question here for me. and rob, i know you're probably tired of answering a bunch of hearsay questions about the renewal process and this one, it's probably going to be a bit more direct.
but i guess, a simple question is, do you guys see a scenario out there where you are not operating any casino assets in macao at some point in the near future. and i'm sorry to be so blunt, but it's a question i think a lot of investors are pondering right now given the vagueness that has come out of the chinese government about what they're actually looking for.
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
i do not. i see no chance of that whatsoever. i think we're -- but i'll refer -- i apologize if i sound like a broken record. but the truth is we've been doing this for a couple of decades.
we have the unparalleled track record. the whole cotai developer was the one guy did that at sheldon. one guy put $15 billion in ground of nongaming and gaming assets. one company made almost $4 billion ebitda.
and i think we have been a seller with our employees. so, i remain beyond confident that we'll be operating in macao. i don't think there's any chance whatsoever that we wouldn't be. and i'm not saying that rhetorically, i mean that sincerely, every indication we've gotten is the opposite.
so, we, again, are very proud of our track record, proud of our development, and proud of our investment. but i think the government has recognized we've been awfully good licensee and partner and friends with china and macao, and we're eager to be back there. so no, i don't believe that's a possibility.
steve wieczynski -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
ok, great. thanks for clearing that up.
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
sure.
operator
your final question is from the line of david katz from jefferies. your line is open.
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
hi, david.
david katz -- jefferies -- analyst
hi, all. can you hear me now?
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. we thought you fell asleep on us because you're in macao.
david katz -- jefferies -- analyst
there is no sleeping at jefferies. what i was really hoping to have the team's perspective on is really vip gaming because we do spend a fair amount of time talking with investors, with people on the ground, etc., around what the vip -- what the future of the vip business really looks like. there have been some sort of public pressures on it, talk about currency changes and things like that, that presumably would have some impact. what does the solid recovered core look like in vip?
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. i just want grant to take that question he lives and breathes. you're talking macao, i assume, in the whole junket issues. is that right?
david katz -- jefferies -- analyst
yes, i guess.
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes. ok. so, let's begin with a little bit of historical perspective. again, for the 20-plus years we've been doing business in macao, we've heard this.
this isn't going to work. that's not going to work. the revenues will never go anywhere. we've been hearing this for often lot.
segment is going to fall apart. the latest thing is to say the vip is going to go away to the junket. so, i just remain a huge believer in that market of all segments. obviously, we made our strength in the mass premium.
that's been our bread and butter and will continue to be, but i don't think there's every discount. those who have discount this segment has done it at their own prowl. i think it can -- it could move to a different channel, a different way of being available. but the gamers are going to keep happening in all segments in macao.
as a precursor to grant's comments, i think you have to realize how powerful this market has been, the growth has been unbelievable. those of us who started back in 2002, '03 and '04, never have dreamed the way every segment just developed. in the 2010, '11, '12 year, it was the junkets that drilled macao, that morphed into our premium mass market and now premium mass-mass market. and again, our company has been more focused on those base mass and premium mass segments.
but the vip has served the market very well. so, i think it will reemerge in a different form with different channels of distribution. and that's my take. grant, you're much closer to this, so please speak up.
grant chum -- chief operating officer of sands china
no, i think you said it very well, rob. i think it's important to remember, again, that the proportion of profit coming from that segment especially, i think you're more referencing the junket segment versus our own vip business is very, very small. it's really low single digit on pre-covid. so, i know people spend a lot of time talking about it, but our business is really geared to that large-scale destination resort with premium mass, mass, the leisure, the fit, and the future is going to be that structural growth in those segments, as well as the nongaming, the retail, the mice.
and so that's where really our reinvestments and our asset base have really focused on.
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
i think the driver -- to grant's point, the driver that market is always going to be what we're focused is lifestyle, extraordinary entertainment, restaurants, retail, rooms. that's where our investment is. you'll see the londoner, that's where the focus was, the four seasons is more toward the very high-end premium mass. but no matter what form it takes, the gamer is going to keep growing over there and the desire to come to macao is going to grow.
so, whether it'd be the new assets we built another company, it just enhances the market. and i don't think there will ever be a lack of customers, a lack of visitors to macao. the problem is going to be -- and the market is going to be back and wherever, it's '22, whatever, i think the problem is going to be lack of capacity -- i mean, lack of rooms. that market is always burdened by new capacity, new lodging because whether it be base mass, premium mass is no longer a hong kong-dependent overnight market.
it's a stay overnight market. it's a leisure market, a business market. it's a spectacular market. and we're going to be there with everybody else trying to get our fair share.
and i think our new assets, if you ever get to see them and we're open to the next year are going to surprise you. what we've done with the londoner and four seasons is the best thing we've ever done in my opinion. so, we look forward to getting back to macao and getting back to business.

good day, and thank you for standing by, and welcome to the las vegas sands fourth quarter 2021 earnings conference call. at this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. after the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [operator instructions] please be advised that today's conference is being recorded.
[operator instructions] i would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker for today, mr. daniel briggs. thank you, sir. please go ahead.
daniel briggs -- senior vice president, investor relations
thank you. joining me on the call today are rob goldstein, our chairman and chief executive officer, and patrick dumont, our president and chief operating officer. also joining us on the call are grant chum, our chief operating officer, sands china, and dr. wilfred wong, who are about to get connected.
and i apologize for starting late. before i turn the call over to rob, please let me remind you that today's conference call will contain forward-looking statements that we are making under the safe harbor provision of federal securities laws. the company's actual results could differ materially from the anticipated results in those forward-looking statements. in addition, we may discuss non-gaap measures.
a definition and a reconciliation of each of these measures to the most comparable gaap measures is included in the press release. please note that we have posted supplementary earnings slides on our earnings slides on our investor relations website. we may refer to those slides during the q&a portion of the call. [operator instructions] please note that this presentation is being recorded.
with that, let me please turn the call over to rob. 
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you, dan, and good afternoon and good morning to our colleagues in asia. a very good morning for our colleagues in asia. thank you for joining our call today. we'll have some brief comments, and then we'll go right to q&a.
our results continue to reflect the pandemic's impact. travel restrictions continue to affect visitation and our financial results in both macao and singapore this quarter. we did generate some positive ebitda for the quarter in both markets. we remain confident in the eventual recovery in both macao and singapore.
the good news in singapore, the travel restrictions and travel carters were established with many important source markets during the quarter. indonesia, malaysia, south korea, australia, thailand were all part of the initial rollout of the dto program. and obviously, emergence of omicron variant impacted the dto program in late december. the dto should contribute to a more robust recovery over time.
our confidence in the long-term opportunity in singapore remains deep. and i'm pleased to announce we've embarked on a usd 1 billion renovation project at mbs that will introduce luxurious new suite product to the resort. the program will meaningfully expand our room suite offerings and significantly enhance our appeal to premium customers. in macao, the londoner is near completion.
as the market recovers, both the four seasons and londoner will provide growth opportunities -- material growth opportunities in both the premium and mass customer segments. we continue to have the largest footprint in the world's greatest market, macao, and appreciate the opportunity to provide input in the public consultation process ongoing. we look forward to participating in the tendering process as it proceeds to fruition. customer demand and spending in macao have proven resilient at the premium mass level from both a gaming and retail perspective, as outlined, i think, on pages 29 and 30 in your deck.
we continue to have great optimism about our ability to perform to pre-pandemic levels once visitation returns. you may know our company is divided primarily into three material areas, the most important being asia, the portfolio in macao and singapore. we remain confident we'll return to strong positive cash flow in both macao and singapore in the future as restrictions are eased and travel and tourism recover. the sale of las vegas creates liquidity and optionality as we pursue additional large-scale, land-based destination resorts in the us and asia.
and we continue to build our digital presence. we're exploring multiple opportunities at this time, and we'll provide some color at the appropriate time. so let's go to your questions, and thank you for listening.

[operator instructions] your first question comes from the line of joe greff with j.p. morgan.
joe greff -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
good afternoon, good morning, everyone.
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
hi, joe.
joe greff -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
rob and patrick, i'd like to start off on the topic of capital return and how you're thinking about that, particularly in light of $5 million in gross cash proceeds coming in the next couple of months. does that cause you to rethink that capital return is more of a near-term event? or do you really need to see a recovery in both macao and singapore before you initiate some sort of capital return? i know you mentioned liquidity optionality for new jurisdictions in the us and asia, so that's part of the calculus. but if you can refresh your thinking on capital return, i think that would be helpful for us.
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
patrick?
patrick dumont -- president and chief operating officer
i'm happy to. yes. hey, joe. appreciate the question.
i think we've been pretty consistent in our thinking. it's been part of our long-term strategic plan, how to create additional capacity to really grow this business. sheldon has really started from the beginning, as you know. you followed us since day one that he's really been a developer of large-scale projects.
and i think that ethos continues today within our company. and i think we're very excited about some of the opportunities that we have in front of us. rob and the rest of the development team and our entire group has been working very hard. it's great opportunities to grow with large-scale development in the future.
so i think the way we see the capital that's going to come into our system from the consummation of vegas sale is really to grow the business. as we've always said before, the dividend and share repurchases really do represent part of our shareholder return strategy, the dividend being the quarter, so we're looking forward to the opportunity of restarting the dividend program. but as we've said, and i think we've been consistent about the idea that we really want to see a steady return to operational cash flow, understanding what those cash flow levels are from a trajectory and call it, a sensitivity scenario perspective and then make an assessment about the proper return of capital at that time. we really view the dividend as something that needs to return on a stable and long-term basis.
and so, that's something that we'll look to do when our cash flows return and we get out of pandemic operations, which, unfortunately, during this quarter, we were still in.
joe greff -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
great. that's helpful. and then, maybe the gentleman from macao can chime in on my follow-up question. just a clarification on the draft bill on the amendments to the gaming law.
can you talk about how the government is thinking about you and others in the market maintaining specific levels of gross gaming revenues in order to maintain your table count? can you talk about how they're broadly or specifically thinking how this will work and what the broad framework is here? and that's it for me. thanks.
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
grant? you here?
grant chum -- senior vice president of global gaming strategy
yeah, sure. thank you for the question. i think the amendment to the gaming is still work in progress. it's working its way through the legislature.
we need to wait further details in terms of the final form that the amendments would take. and there will be additional regulatory measures that will be potentially issued thereafter. so in general, to your question, we've always efficiently used our table allocation. and in general, we welcome the direction of linking table allocation with productivity.
but specifics, i think, are yet to be outlined.
joe greff -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
thank you.
operator
your next question comes from the line of carlo santarelli with deutsche bank.
carlo santarelli -- deutsche bank -- analyst
hey, guys. thank you. rob, maybe if you could kind of shine some light. i know singapore, obviously, it was kind of a tale of a couple of months.
but as you've seen things starting to normalize over the course of the period, could you comment a little bit about how you felt during the better periods of the quarter as it pertains to restrictions and stuff like that when some of them were more loose?
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. we were very excited to see when there's rays of light and you can get in and the vtl is established, it was extraordinary. and i think it indicates -- it's a real predictor of what's going to happen when that place opens back up. hopefully, we see it in the first half of the year.
clearly, demand is going to be there. the vtl -- the government's thinking is very positive for us. i think singapore probably gets there quicker than -- i think macao might be later. but citing singapore, the demand is clearly evident when the vtls were open.
it's a shame. i think we had a real -- a positive momentum going that got crushed by the omicron concerns. but i think that's just inevitable. the market is around us.
i mean the important source markets are opening up, japan, korea, indonesia, malaysia, all improving. so we have a lot of hope to see a big bounce in singapore. i would like to reference we had some nonrecurring income in that quarter you should be aware of. patrick, can you illuminate, just we're clear on the numbers on singapore, of course?
patrick dumont -- president and chief operating officer
yeah, of course, happy to do it. and carlo, thanks for the question. one thing we did want to highlight is that we were positively impacted by approximately $70 million of nonrecurring items during this quarter, including bonus reversals, job support scheme and some other items. so i wouldn't look at this as a run rate quarter.
i think i would point you back to some of the comments that rob made on some of our prior calls about that run rate envelope during these conditions, call it, the $500 million run rate ebitda context. the real problem is things have kind of been switched on and switched off so much, it's hard to get a real read on the quarter. i think what is really encouraging is the vaccine travel lanes, the public health posture of the government, which really has been a leader in both vaccinations and the way they approach public health. and we're very encouraged about their approach toward long-term tourism.
and we're very excited to see how that plays out in the upcoming quarters. but i think overall, the vaccine travel lanes were a big step.
carlo santarelli -- deutsche bank -- analyst
great. patrick, thank you. that's helpful. and just one point of clarity, that $70 million, was that all in the ebitda result for the quarter?
patrick dumont -- president and chief operating officer
it was. it was. that's why i referred back to the run rate that we talked about previously.
carlo santarelli -- deutsche bank -- analyst
yeah. thank you.
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
we've referenced $0.5 billion run rate. until things get better over there, until these travelings become real, we're still in the same range as our point not to get overexuberant about the 170 that it was that is impacted by nonrecurring. ok?
carlo santarelli -- deutsche bank -- analyst
thank you, guys.
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
your next question comes from the line of robin farley with ubs.
robin farley -- ubs -- analyst
great. thanks for taking the questions. i was wondering if you could talk about -- you've said for a while you're evaluating online gaming and sports betting options. and there's been a little bit of a change in valuation over the last year.
can you talk a little bit about how -- kind of what your current thoughts are and how that may be impacted by changing valuations?
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. i think we've said in the past, we've always been interested in digital and all these interests that's happening in the market. but two things are happening at the same time. our business, i think, is coming back to a stronger place.
i think '22 finally -- especially in singapore, and i think as well in macao, we'll see that getting better. our balance sheet speaks for itself. and we've all followed what's happening with digital equities and the struggle there. so i believe there will be a day when sports betting and online gaming are very successful businesses.
and we'll continue to look at the opportunity. we'll wait patiently. it hasn't been a bad idea to wait for the last six to eight months to see how this shakes out. and there's done a lot of blood spilled.
but i think we'll continue to evaluate is there an entry point that makes sense for lvs. we remain consistent, robin, as you know and you've known for years, our bread and butter is still going to be asia land-based as we'll make -- we can't replicate a $5 billion business, which we think will come back in place next year or so. so that's our first order of business in making sure our balance sheet is pristine, which now will be following the closing. but we'll continue to monitor as the difficulties continue, the equity markets and the valuations change.
the question is when does that situation get better. and i think it will and is there an entry point for us. and we'll keep our eyes and ears open for that possibility. but waiting hasn't been the worst idea to see how things shake out.
robin farley -- ubs -- analyst
definitely not. also, a follow-up question is, can you remind us what your kind of latest thinking is on the size of the investment when you go to rebid for the new license term? at times, you talked about things in the past. obviously, you're looking forward to investing more in macao. can you kind of remind us what your latest thoughts are on the size of that? thanks.
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
i'm not sure i understand. patrick, i may have been missing it. i don't think we had a -- i mean we continue to be very bullish on the macao market despite the last 24 difficult months. we like what we're seeing, the retendering process.
we're respectful of the process. we're continuing to help and be involved with the government. i don't think we have a dollar amount in mind or a specific approach at this time. patrick or grant, do you want to chime in?
patrick dumont -- president and chief operating officer
yeah. i'll just say one comment and i'll turn it over to grant. but i think the important thing to note, it's still very early stages yet. so i don't think there's any details that we can really talk about in terms of our approach because it's not known sort of where things are going to shake out.
grant, i don't know if you have any other comments that you want to add.
grant chum -- senior vice president of global gaming strategy
no, i think that's right. i think we just reiterate our general approach, which is continued reinvestment in our asset base. and it's worth reminding ourselves we're coming to the end of our $2.3 billion capex program in grand suites at four seasons and the londoner macao. and we've really stayed the course during the pandemic.
we've accelerated the works where we can. we've overcome all the challenges related to supply chain during this pandemic. and we're coming well within budget, and we're delighted with the outcome. so i think that gives you a pretty good indicator both of our appetite but also of our resolve to continue to reinvest, in particular, in the direction that the government is pointing toward across the various domains of diversification.
robin farley -- ubs -- analyst
ok, great. thank you very much.
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks, robin.
operator
your next question comes from the line of stephen grambling with goldman sachs.
stephen grambling -- goldman sachs -- analyst
hi, thanks. i guess two follow-ups. and the first is really a follow-up on robin's question and joe's earlier question just on the legislative proposal. you mentioned it is still a work-in-progress, obviously.
but i'm wondering if you could just walk us through where you feel like you do have incremental clarity and where specifically there may still be pockets of uncertainty based on the language in your conversations.
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
grant, that's yours.
grant chum -- senior vice president of global gaming strategy
thank you for the question. i think the main -- the key aspects of the legislation have been laid out in terms of the number of concessionaires and the duration of the future concession. but there are a lot of details in there that are accosted to be worked out through the legislature. we just encapsulated one through the first meeting with the legislative family and we're now moving to the stage so i think we can say at this point that it is still in draft form, but we really welcome the progress that's been made.
so issue in so rapidly since the launch of the first public observation in september. it's only been a short four months since that time, and we're already at this stage where we're going into the committee review of the draft. so i think the government has done an outstanding job in getting us to this stage of the process so quickly with a lot of framework being clarified. but it is important to remember that this is still draft legislation, and we await the final outcome, hopefully, in the coming months.
stephen grambling -- goldman sachs -- analyst
fair enough. maybe as an unrelated follow-up here. you continue to have impressive cost control despite a pretty difficult environment. how are you thinking about margins and labor inflation in macao, as well as singapore as we think about ultimate recovery versus maybe some of the cost reductions you've made?
patrick dumont -- president and chief operating officer
hey, it's patrick. it's something that we look at a lot with our team. and i think one of the focuses that we had during this pandemic over the last really two years has been to keep the core team together. so when we do recover, we have the ability to service our customers and get right back to business.
and i think it's to credit to grant, to the team in singapore and really to everyone at the local teams that we're able to keep the group together, continue to focus, continue working and keep everyone healthy and safe. and i think where we are today, as we look at margins upon the recovery, we were in a pretty efficient business both at sands china and in singapore prior to the pandemic. if you look at our margins in the years leading up to the pandemic, sands china team did an unbelievable job taking a lot of costs out of the business and becoming more efficient as we grew our business there. and so, i think if you look over a series of years, we've always been cost focused.
i don't want to say that there was really room in the prior operating level. what is true is that i'd like to believe that the run rate margins for the business will be consistent with those margins prior to the pandemic. the one thing to note is that in singapore, there is going to be a tax rate change, which will impact -- a gaming tax rate change, which will impact margins at marina bay sands. when that happens, there will be some slight margin impact from that going forward.
but as a practical matter, we would expect to have the same margins given the same level of volumes even taking into account mix because if you recall in macao, our exposure to lower-margin business such as junket and vip is less. we're more premium mass focused, so we'd like to believe our margin structure will be fairly consistent upon the recovery.
stephen grambling -- goldman sachs -- analyst
helpful. thanks so much.
operator
your next question comes from the line of thomas allen with morgan stanley.
thomas allen -- morgan stanley -- analyst
hey, thanks. can you just talk about potential future investments? i know that you've been looking at florida and new york. any comments on those markets? and then when announced the project in uae yesterday, have you considered that market? thank you.
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
i'll take the us, and i'll leave patrick to discuss the uae. tom, as you know, we've been for years talking about, maybe four-year time, it's been so long, new york. we're big believers in that market. the recent announcement by governor hochul about three licenses is encouraging.
we're in the hunt. i wouldn't want to overplay our hand and say we have -- what opportunity it might be, but it's a massive market underserved by the current product. and by any metric, that should be a massive market for us. so we're deep into it.
we were there last week. we have a team on the ground working through it. and we're hoping to get a license. that's all i'll say about that.
you've followed in the newspapers our efforts in florida. we're in a signature gathering mode. it's a struggle down there. it's not an easy process to go through, but we're trying very much to be in the hunt in florida.
we really appreciate how underserved that market is and the material opportunities exist for a top-tier land-based opportunity in florida would be wonderful. same goes for texas, all texas is a few years away from -- we have been down there. we have spent time in the market. we have people trying to find our place in that market if it does happen, but i think that's probably the farthest away from a decision.
patrick, do you want to address the wins that you raised, the uae, what happened over there yesterday?
patrick dumont -- president and chief operating officer
sure. happy to. so a couple of thoughts. first off, as someone who's in the tourism business, our company is very focused on looking at markets, evaluating them and what different markets present in terms of both competition and things that customers like.
and i would tell you, if you go to uae and you go to -- and you see the investments that are going on there, it's really remarkable. the scale of investment, the quality of the investment is really unique to the world. it's a very special place. and i understand why wynn would have interest going there.
it is a tremendous tourism market, has a lot of potential. and to be fair, it is an economic center for that region. so in terms of opportunity, we all understood why there would be interest there for them to go. so it's something that we'll continue to watch and look at.
but there are a lot of high-quality markets that are available to our company, rob just referenced a few. and we're going to keep all of our options open and continue looking for opportunities for las vegas sands to deploy capital in high-quality developments. so that's really sort of our view on that situation.
thomas allen -- morgan stanley -- analyst
perfect. thank you both. and then, just on the mbs $1 billion renovation. it's something you guys have been talking about for a long time, but you just added it to your slide deck this quarter.
is that just because now it's ready? any more details on the potential disruption or timeline? thank you.
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. well, it's a step that it's moving forward. i think the point we talked about a long time, thomas, we have underinvested at times in these rooms and suites that were deep into the renovation. i think we all know with the covid environment; you always have the risk of either labor or supply chain risk.
but they're moving nicely. and the team, we have not been there, so i can't say we have seen it. but the images we see are very positive. and i think it's moving at a really good pace assuming that there's no interruptions we can't control.
patrick?
patrick dumont -- president and chief operating officer
so i think what's interesting about it, and you've heard rob reference it before. and i think our team is very focused on using this time to the pandemic to enhance our product offerings and our attractiveness to our customers. and we've always been working with the singapore tourism board to help achieve their goals while we invest. and i think there's been a focus in singapore over the last few years on increasing high-quality tourism.
and we believe the mbs is a leader in that area. and we wanted to reinvest in the property to really enhance our suite of products and some of the other amenities that we have for our customers while we have some downtime. and so, this is something that we've been looking at for many years. we have a high-quality design team that will really create some of the best suites we've ever had in our system.
we've had some great success with some of our efforts in macao and some renovations with some of the new products we brought online during the pandemic. and so, we feel like our design level is really at a high level now. and we're really looking forward to investing this amount of capital into marina bay sands to create a level of suite product we never had there before, both in terms of account and in terms of quality. so this will address some of the goals that have been laid out by the singapore tourism board and the government there, as well as help us address and grow our business in high value tourism.
so that's really the objective. it's something that will happen really over the next two years. we're underway now, and we hope to be complete as soon as possible. but in reality, due to the labor and materials, it looks like it's going to take two years.
thomas allen -- morgan stanley -- analyst
helpful. thank you.
operator
your next question comes from the line of shaun kelley with bank of america.
shaun kelley -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
maybe just one, because it actually hasn't come up. i guess it's a sign of the times really that -- i was just wondering from either grant or wilfred if we could get a little color just on the covid conditions and signaling on the ground in terms of possible reopening milestones you might be looking for? i believe there was actually a little bit of press from the government talking about the tourism industry and its importance. so maybe just a couple of your high-level thoughts about things we can look forward to there.
grant chum -- senior vice president of global gaming strategy
sure. thanks for the question, shaun. i think in the last few months, if you could describe it sequentially, we've come through some local cases on covid that occurred in macao at the end of september to early october. so obviously, the business environment was heavily impacted during the month of october.
in fact, that was the lowest month in the entire year for the ggr for the city. as we move toward the end of the year, things improved in terms of the travel board policies around zhuhai and macao. and then, you saw the business volumes and visitations recouped accordingly. most recently, we've had some local cases in zhuhai, which has impacted the border again.
and hopefully, we're going to be coming through the other side of that as they get that under control and as they have done. so i would describe it as not a lot has changed in terms of the overall environment. the government, both central government and local government, continue to control the covid cases exceptionally well in accordance with their policies. and as we move forward, we obviously have the chinese new year and also the winter olympics.
and understandably, everyone is being more cautious in terms of traveling. and obviously, it's possible that beyond these events, as things improve in terms of the domestic cases in the various provinces and these big events are out of the way, we can look forward to a more positive picture in terms of travel.
shaun kelley -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
great. thank you. and then, just one probably for patrick. but patrick, you mentioned the singapore tax rate.
and i think we picked that up in some of the local press as well. just i was curious if you could give us a little bit more color on how that plays through. is this the change that was actually tied back to the license extension? or is this something that's incremental or different from that? because i think there was a tie-in to that, if i recall correctly, but it's -- frankly, it's been a couple of years.
patrick dumont -- president and chief operating officer
yeah. it's just been a couple of years. this is the implementation of what was tied into the development agreements. so nothing has changed consistent with prior disclosure, prior discussions.
but i just wanted to highlight it as something that may have an impact on margins going forward. that's all.
shaun kelley -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
great. thank you very much.
operator
your next question comes from the line of dan politzer with wells fargo.
dan politzer -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
hey. good afternoon, everyone. thanks for taking my question. so a quick follow-up on just the sports betting and i-gaming endeavors or analysis that you're doing.
have you given any thought or consideration to opportunities that would involve markets outside the us, such as europe? are you really just focused on us sports betting at this point?
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
we consider all markets. yes. we have markets that are on the table.
dan politzer -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
ok. and..
patrick dumont -- president and chief operating officer
yeah. sorry, one thing to highlight. so i think we're not just looking at sports betting. i think we're looking at a variety of opportunities in the digital space, and to rob's point, in a variety of different markets, but we're not rushed.
so we're building teams. we're making long-term investments. we're thinking about opportunities. we're focused on return on invested capital.
and we're really looking at it through the lens of a long-term strategy that can blossom into something meaningful. and so, we're not just sort of chasing certain specific areas that may have valuations that are peaked at the day. i think we're looking for long-term high-growth opportunities that present really positive returns. and so, it's not just in sports wagering.
it's a variety of different things, and we're looking at different markets.
dan politzer -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
got it. and then, just a clarification on the capital allocation question from earlier and as you think about a repurchase versus the dividend. i mean do you really need to see a more sustained recovery in macao before returning capital. or is there a scenario where you get the proceeds from the venetian sale and singapore starts to recover and you could be more active on that front beforehand?
patrick dumont -- president and chief operating officer
you know, i think from our standpoint, we sort of view return of capital for a very long-term shareholder enhancing process. and i think for us, we're going to want to see a return in our markets with a stable level of cash flow and post-pandemic conditions, where there's operational clarity before we begin return of capital. i think it's very important for the sustainability of any dividend and a return of capital program. and it's something that we hope will come soon.
there's been a lot of investment in public health initiatives and a lot of things that are incrementally making progress in both of our markets, and we're hopeful that this occurs in the near term. and so, once that happens, we'll start to evaluate potential return of capital. but again, we sort of view the proceeds from the las vegas sale as permitting us to develop large-scale destination resorts in new jurisdictions to help grow our business.
dan politzer -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
got it. understood. thanks so much.
operator
your last question comes from the line of david katz with jefferies. david, your line is open.
david katz -- jefferies -- analyst
good afternoon. thanks for taking my question. i just wanted to, if i may, follow up on two of the details from earlier, where you talked about the $70 million. and that sounds like it's in the ebitda line.
is that solely in macao? is that spread? does that include singapore as well?
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
it's just singapore. it's just [inaudible] singapore.
dan politzer -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
and rob, with respect to the $500 million run rate, which is macao, that is excluding what may or may not have occurred with respect to omicron in january, correct?
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
i think, dave, we mentioned -- i think, first of all, the $70 million patrick referenced was solely at mbs. and my $0.5 billion reference was on previous calls, i said i think the current situation which runs up and down every day, i think in singapore today is $0.5 billion ebitda annual run rate until we get further vtl and stabilization. my point is i want to -- as you're aware, we're running that same $0.5 billion. we have a lot of optimism that that will change in '22, perhaps first half.
but that's all singapore related, the onetime nonrecurring. and that $500 million was referred to singapore as well. we're not making any -- it's impossible in macao to rationally predict anything until the government makes decisions on the visitation. it'd be silly for us to speculate something that's so speculative.
you have no underpinning of fact. i think once -- look, we believe that market will explode when it opens back up again. but i think it's more of the second half of the year. but then again, who's to know? so we're not making any speculative decisions on a run rate in macao.
david katz -- jefferies -- analyst
understood. if i can just follow up very quickly. with respect to the makeup of business in macao, not looking for a guide or a range, but any insight around how vip business, which may go away, could be recaptured through premium mass? any tools or thoughts and perspectives to help us think about what portion of that would be really helpful.
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. i'll just give you my quick look, and i want grant to opine as well. i think we all believe that the junket -- having done this for many years in macao, in the us, these customers in that segment are going to just disappear and when they read the other junket businesses not happening. therefore, demand will go away.
it's not going to go away. it'll just resurrect in different segments and find new ways of materializing in the casino. and it always is that way in any business. it goes back to any segment doesn't necessarily just go away because the mechanism goes away.
it just evolves to a different segmentation. so we're pretty bullish that a business that was yielding 8%, 10% could be much more positively profitable as a resurrection of the segments. and so, that's my take. i think any belief that the junket business segment is only just -- not thoughtful.
grant, will you weigh in?
grant chum -- senior vice president of global gaming strategy
sure. yeah, i think rob is spot on, on that because you have to distinguish between the end demand and the distribution of it. so i think clearly some portion of the end demand and -- we're not going to get drawn into exactly what the proportion will shift into the other segments. and that's just natural because the end demand is there.
now, will some portion of it also dissipate and disappear, sure. but that's probably the portion that was not in the first place, that's sustainable in any event. so i think the core underlying and demand that will find its way through other segments over time. and we should distinguish between the end customer as opposed to the distribution system.
david katz -- jefferies -- analyst
perfect. thank you very much for taking my questions.

operator
good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the sands first quarter 2022 earnings conference call. at this time, all participants have been placed on a listen-only mode. but we will open the floor for your questions and comments following the presentation. it is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to mr.
daniel briggs, senior vice president of investor relations at sands. sir, the floor is yours.
daniel briggs -- senior vice president of investor relations
thank you, paul. joining the call today are rob goldstein, our chairman and chief executive officer; and patrick dumont, our president and chief operating officer. also joining are dr. wilfred wong, president of sands china; and grant chum, chief operating officer of sands china.
today's conference call will contain forward-looking statements that we are making under the safe harbor provision of federal securities laws. the company's actual results could differ materially from the anticipated results in those forward-looking statements. in addition, we may discuss non-gaap measures. a definition and a reconciliation of each of these measures to the most comparable gaap financial measures is included in the press release.
we have posted supplementary earnings slides on our investor relations website. we may refer to those slides during the q&a portion of the call. finally, for those who would like to participate in the q&a session, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up, so we might allow everyone with interest the opportunity to participate. please note that this presentation is being recorded.
with that, i'll turn the call over to rob. 
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks, dan. good afternoon, and good morning to our colleagues in asia. some brief comments, and we'll go to q&a. our results continue to reflect the pandemic's impact the travel restrictions, suppressed visitation, our financial results in both macao and singapore this quarter.
we did generate positive ebitda for the quarter in singapore and for the company in total. the good news in singapore as the travel corridors established last quarter have been replaced with an introduction of the vaccinated traveler framework, which allows vaccinated travelers to enter singapore in much the same way as prior to the pandemic. in short terms, we are open for business in singapore. our conviction and long-term opportunity in the singapore market remains steadfast.
the $1 billion capital investment currently underway at mbs, we introduced luxurious new suite product and amenities that [inaudible]. in macao, our considerable investments in londoner are nearing completion. as the market recovers four seasons londoner will provide growth opportunities in both the premium and mass customer segments. we continue to have the largest footprint in the macao marketplace and we appreciate the opportunity to provide input in the public consultation process and we look forward to participating in the retendering process as well.
while the current quarter results in macao were impacted severely by the enhanced travel restrictions in china, customer demand and spend in macao have proven resilient at the premium mass level from both a gaming and retail perspective in periods when the restrictions have been relaxed. we remain confident that we return to positive cash flow in both macao and singapore in the future as restrictions are eased and travel and tourism recover. we consider our portfolio of resorts in asia to be outstanding platform for growth for the years ahead. in addition, we continue to pursue opportunities to develop large-scale resorts in both the united states and asia.
the sale of las vegas was completed this quarter, which creates additional liquidity and optionality. lastly, we intend to build out our digital presence and to explore multiple opportunities. we will provide additional color at the appropriate time. let's go to your questions.
questions?
daniel briggs -- senior vice president of investor relations
paul, we're ready to go to questions. thanks.
",":
operator
thank you. ladies and gentlemen, the floor is now open for questions. [operator instructions] also, we ask each participant to limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. please hold a moment while we poll for questions.
and the first question is coming from joe greff from j.p. morgan. joe, your line is live.
joe greff -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
hello, everyone. i thank you for taking my question. rob, i'd love to get a little bit more detail on the recent experience in singapore with the vtl framework? and can you tell us or share with us business volumes, visitation improvements in march and april to date? and when we kind of look at the first quarter and looking at the $121 million of hold normalized ebitda. how much of that was sort of the last month of the quarter, given the benefits from more international inbound tourism?
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. joe, it's a fair question. the core to mbs was clearly driven, it moved upward as you went along. i started $17 million in january, went to $46 million in february.
we had $58 million of ebitda in march. and that trajectory is continuing the momentum is going upward in april. i think -- look, singapore is back, and it will experience the same post-covid numbers, you see in the u.s., in my opinion. the question is how fast does it get there? the demand is there, it will continue.
assuming there's no more surprises from the covid situation. we like to think that singapore to return to $1 billion run rate in this year. so, $58 million in march feels pretty good, and that momentum is continuing.
joe greff -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
great. that's helpful. and hopefully, i'm not going to follow up macao-related question, but is much to ask. can you talk about thailand and sort of that as an integrated resort opportunity and what the latest is there? i know there have been press reports with your efforts and that as an opportunity.
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah, i think it's premature, joe, and we're looking at a lot of different things in asia, and that's certainly a list of things, but i think it's premature to get ahead of ourselves there. i'll pass on that.
joe greff -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
great. thank you, guys.
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
sure.
operator
thank you. and the next question is coming from stephen grambling from goldman sachs. steven, your line is live.
stephen grambling -- goldman sachs -- analyst
hey. thank you. maybe sticking with new development opportunities. there's obviously been a lot of back and forth in new york, specifically new york city, different boroughs, you've been seeing some headlines around times square.
just curious what you're seeing there, how we should think about that as an opportunity?
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
well, new york has been on our radar for a long time. we continue to be in the hunt there. i don't want to get into specific boroughs, locations. i think that's proprietary.
but we remain interested. i think it's a huge market for us. we've been very clear about that in the past. the process is quite a long way to go.
and we'll just keep you posted as we hear and learn things, but we're in the hunt and we'll see how it works out for us.
stephen grambling -- goldman sachs -- analyst
and then you did mention you'll discuss digital when the time is right and they obviously say patience is a virtue, which has clearly paid off looking at some of these stocks. so, as you think about the opportunity set in front of you, has anything changed in terms of your thinking of what areas of the industry might be more or less interesting to dig into even before considering where the investment might end up?
patrick dumont -- president and chief operating officer
so, it's patrick. so, i think nothing has really changed in our view. we take a very long-term perspective on digital. i think our comments have been pretty consistent across the quarters.
we're really in a growth and investment stage. so it's very early on, and we have something to talk about, we'll definitely start discussing it. but at this point, it's a very early stage. we're building a team and looking forward to the future.
stephen grambling -- goldman sachs -- analyst
awesome. maybe one last one if i can sneak it in then. so since the development opportunities feel like they're still pushed out and you've gotten some proceeds in from vegas. i think you maybe have mentioned this in the remarks, but just remind us in terms of thinking about capital allocation priorities.
i mean is buyback something that's on the table that you'd be thinking about with some of those proceeds? or do you feel like there's enough other things to spend the money on the near term? thank you.
patrick dumont -- president and chief operating officer
no problem. you know, this is a question that i think we get pretty often. i'll refer to the answers that we gave in our last quarterly call. but i think the key thing to take away is we're very focused on new development.
the sale of las vegas was really to reinvest capital in high growth opportunities that we think are unique to our company. we feel very strongly about our development capabilities and our ability to execute large-scale developments in new markets. and we think there's a lot of them out there, a lot of potential. and so we're waiting to see which ones come forward.
and as rob said, where we can invest to get the highest returns. in terms of return of capital, i think we've always said that the dividend is really the cornerstone of our turn capital program. it's something that we want to look at in terms of really long-term operational cash flow growth, and then we'll size it accordingly and look to that to recur before we actually start the dividend again. in terms of share repurchases, we've always said we've been opportunistic to return capital that way as well.
if you look at our past, we've actually returned a fair amount of capital through share repurchases when we felt that we had the excess liquidity. so, i think at this point, our priority is to make sure we get out of the pandemic, make sure we have ample liquidity and a protected balance sheet to ensure that we recover from our pandemic operations. we can support a local host market, support our team members as we go through that process. then we're going to focus on new development and growth and investment in our existing markets, which we've been doing throughout the pandemic and then we'll look to restart the dividend as operating cash flows recover.
and then lastly, i think we'll look at share repurchases where the opportunities arise.
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
let's not forget that we are investing $1 billion currently in singapore. we're trying to invest more in singapore. and we think macao when things reopen might be opportunistic as well. people forget how much capital we could put to work in our existing marketplaces.
stephen grambling -- goldman sachs -- analyst
fair enough. makes sense. thanks so much.
operator
thank you. and the next question is coming from shaun kelley from bank of america. shaun, your line is live.
shaun kelley -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
hi, good afternoon, everyone. just maybe to actually touch on macao for a minute. you know, rob, there have been some fits and starts as it relates to the reopening in hong kong, and i think some positive progress there as case counts have come down. any signposts maybe out of that market and maybe reconnecting that with macao that the local team could give us some color on?
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
sure. grant, are you on the call?
grant chum -- chief operating officer, sands china
yes. good morning. good afternoon. yes.
thank you for the question. yeah. i mean at this stage, there is no new information or news in terms of quarantine-free travel from hong kong to macao. i think hong kong cases have been improved.
but we're not at the point where there's any change in the quarantine policy.
shaun kelley -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
grant, maybe just to clarify, is that specifically as it relates to its interaction with macao? or what about for visitors coming from overseas possibly opening up a corridor to singapore? so maybe help us think a little bit more broadly, if you could?
grant chum -- chief operating officer, sands china
i'm sorry, are you referring to overseas visitors from going or [inaudible]?
shaun kelley -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
yeah. either, i think arriving in hong kong and then, i guess, you know, coming in from inbound places or leaving hong kong going to places like singapore.
grant chum -- chief operating officer, sands china
so sorry, you're asking a question about people going to singapore or to macao?
shaun kelley -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
well, specifically talking about -- just is there any sign that hong kong is loosening up its overall visitation policy because it's been pretty closed from the external perspective. i guess that's where i'm trying to go.
grant chum -- chief operating officer, sands china
sorry, if you're asking about hong kong, yes, they have relaxed. so nonresidents can now travel to hong kong from the 1st of may and that was -- that hasn't been possible for some time. so you can go to hong kong from next month overseas into hong kong, but you would still have to be subject to the quarantine policy once you enter hong kong.
shaun kelley -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
understood. thank you very much.
grant chum -- chief operating officer, sands china
thank you.
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
grant --
operator
thank you.
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
you had something more to say, grant, and we cut you off, do you have more to say?
grant chum -- chief operating officer, sands china
no. no, that's it. thanks, rob.
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
ok. thank you. next question, please.
patrick dumont -- president and chief operating officer
thanks, shaun.
operator
next question is coming from robin farley from ubs. robin, your line is live.
robin farley -- ubs
great. thanks. i wonder if you could talk a little bit more about singapore and any change in the composition of business there in terms of what's coming back? is it more mass? is it more vip? is it higher win per visitor than what you saw before or just more absolute number of visitors? just kind of what are you seeing sort of come back first? thanks.
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
the answer is yes. it's all coming back. i mean it's demand over there for -- in the month of march, we saw outsized demand from free independent travelers on the pure leisure side, we saw premium mass. we saw high-end plate coming out of over the rim.
i just think singapore is a unique position. it's -- obviously, in macao is in a difficult place right now, so people are going to gravitate to other opportunities. they want to travel. they're no different than what we've seen here in the u.s.
i think our mbs products as a very, very unique opportunistic window here. we're hoping macao opens up obviously sooner. but until it does, i think you'll see a lot more demand than typical. i think it's from all segments, the team there is being very good about what happened in the month of march.
and again, it's leisure travel, it's casino, it's is vip casino, it's premium mass as casino, it's the mass casino. it's universal. and it feels like we're in the middle of a very positive beginning. and hopefully, without a covid interruption or a change in policy, i believe mbs is going to be very productive '22.
robin farley -- ubs
great. thanks. and then my follow-up question is about you had an announcement a week or two ago about it's probably a small investment, and i think it was sort of an integrity-related business for online sports betting. and i wonder if you could just talk about that because it seems like there are some b2b online sports companies that already sort of provide that kind of for free as part of their services between the leagues and the sports books.
and so i just -- i wonder if you could talk about what interested you in that angle or what's different about that? and kind of what's offered almost for free really by the other osb b2b providers? thanks.
patrick dumont -- president and chief operating officer
sure. it's patrick. and i think what you'll see over time is us make investments in small companies where we think they have a competitive advantage in the b2b space that has a lot of growth potential and also where we think over time we may form it to a larger platform. so from our standpoint, we're looking at a variety different businesses that are in start off or early stage in order to make sure that we stay in front of technological innovation in our industry.
and so this is part of a broader strategy. it is a relatively small investment relative to las vegas sands. but we think over time, this investment in others will help contribute to our overall digital efforts. so i'm not going to get into the exact thesis behind every investment that we do.
there's a long-term plan for what we're approaching. and i think over time, you'll start to see how that evolves.
robin farley -- ubs
ok. thank you.
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks, robin.
operator
thank you. and the next question is coming from carlo santarelli from deutsche bank. carlo, your line is live.
carlo santarelli -- deutsche bank -- analyst
hey, guys. thank you. i just have two kind of timeline-related questions. and i don't know, rob, maybe answer the first and then perhaps something on color on macao and the timeline there.
but just in terms of mbs, obviously, construction and things along those lines in this type of environment is very hard to predict. and i have not gotten a chance to get through the slides yet to see if there any changes to kind of your expectations for the timeline there. but what are some of the goalposts in terms of construction on that? and then secondarily, as it pertains to the tender process and whatnot in macao. how do you guys see the timeline for that shaping up as we move through the rest of 2022?
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
ok. carlo, in singapore, as you know, we're underway in a rather extensive renovation, $1 million-plus renovation in singapore that's underway as we speak. and it's going to take a while. it won't complete until the '23 but it's going to be a very encompassing.
we've had -- as everyone in the world has been impacted by covid, both getting supplies and labor has been issued, but it's happy it's underway. we're still working through our issues with ir2. we were not ready to talk about that today because we're still working through issues there. same issues supplies, labor, costs, etc.
we intend to complete ir1, again, '23 ir2 is still open interpretation. as for macao timelines and the retendering, i'm going to turn it over to wilfred or grant to take that question. maybe, wilfred, is suited.
wilfred wong -- president, sands china
thank you. the timeline for retendering of the concession is progressing according to the timeline announced by the macao sar government. now currently, a few things are at play, two bills relating to the gaming law is -- has been approved by the legislative assembly and will be approved in full after the panel discussion before the end of this legislative session in august. and we are hearing all kinds of suggestion that it will be earlier than august.
at this stage, we are going to be granted an extension of the current concession until the end of 2022. and that is the time that we expect the retendering exercise will be completed. and so, after the amendment of the law, then the retendering procedure will start a lot of information about the retender will come out. we are in the process of preparing for that retendering exercise and hopefully, everything will be done before the end of 2022.
carlo santarelli -- deutsche bank -- analyst
well, thank you. that's helpful. so just so i'm clear, in august, you'll more or less have everything you need from the gaming law perspective? and then that period from, say, august, if not maybe earlier through december will be the formal tendering process when everything is more or less buttoned up. is that the right interpretation?
wilfred wong -- president, sands china
that's right.
carlo santarelli -- deutsche bank -- analyst
great. thank you very much.
operator
thank you. the next question is coming from george choi from citigroup. george, your line is live.
george choi -- citi -- analyst
thank you very much. a couple of questions from me. firstly, in macao. the macao court has recently ruled that a couple of your competitors are jointly and separately liable for some illegal deposits with junkets.
how do you see the likelihood that you guys will also be found liable for this potential liability after the recent close down of the major junkets there?
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
grant, do you want to handle that?
grant chum -- chief operating officer, sands china
sure. thanks, george, for the question. i think, as you know, the cessation of operations of all of these fixed-room junket promoters, obviously happened fairly recently in december of last year. and as a result of that, obviously, there are some new court cases being raised by various stakeholders and participants in that system.
currently, there is nothing material to report from sands china perspective. there are a few cases ongoing, but none of them are material, and we will continue to monitor the situation and obviously report back if there any changes.
george choi -- citi -- analyst
thanks, guys. and my second question is on your balance sheet. now clearly, the first quarter was quite difficult for your macao operations, it's putting a lot of stress on your balance sheet as sands china. when it gets to a point where sands china needs to raise funds, would you guys consider equity as option or is because of that still cheap enough that you would continue to look to raise funds from the debt capital market?
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
patrick?
patrick dumont -- president and chief operating officer
hi, it's patrick. so a couple of thoughts here. i think we're very optimistic about the long-term future of macao. we understand there's articles out about concerns around liquidity.
i think we have a very strong balance sheet. yes, we've received some stress over the last few years under the pandemic's tough operating conditions, i think we all have. but the good news is that our company as a group has a lot of liquidity a lot of different options. i think the good news is also that we were an investment-grade company during the pandemic, which does a lot about the market's view about our ability to raise additional capital.
so, from our standpoint, i think we have a lot of flexibility. our balance sheet was designed to withstand shocks and a lot of variability in our respective operating markets. i think we've proven that. and i think where we are today is we'll look to see how the operations continue coming out of the pandemic, which hopefully soon.
look at our liquidity and make decisions based on available options. so i don't think we're stuck in one particular view. i think we have cash of the parent, we have cash around the system. we have an investment-grade credit rating.
we have access to credit markets. and i think the good news is we position ourselves well to benefit from the recovery on the other side. so i think we have a lot of flexibility, and we'll use it as needed.
george choi -- citi -- analyst
this is very good color. thank you very much.
patrick dumont -- president and chief operating officer
thanks, george.
operator
thank you. next question is coming from chad beynon from macquarie. chad, your line is live.
chad beynon -- macquarie group -- analyst
hi. good afternoon and thanks for taking my question. i wanted to ask about inflation. i know it's obviously something that people are a little bit more focused on here in north america and it's different in different regions of the world.
but wondering if you could kind of talk about the labor inflationary environment or employment situation in your key markets, singapore and macao? and how that could potentially impact margins when the business is fully recovered on the revenue side? thanks.
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
i don't want to say one thing about our business, and obviously, you know, more than the inflation, it's a question we're anticipating. but i would say that i believe the revenue side of the equation is going to more than take care of itself as far as margins. we're going to be really i'd be shocked if will see a big return in singapore this year and then hopefully a big return in macao in '23, hopefully, maybe '22, i don't know. we don't have any visibility more than you do about what's going to happen in china, to be clear.
but i do think, just like here in the u.s., margins have gone very powerfully positive, because the demand is there. i don't think asia is any different. the equation is going to be driven by excessive revenue, i think, in singapore, we'll see it this year, i believe, and hopefully see in macao this year or next. as for the operating entities, grant you want to discuss as you see as far as macao, for example, in wage inflation, i don't know how to address that question.
grant chum -- chief operating officer, sands china
sure, rob. i think right now, macao is a slightly different situation. if you look at the wage trend, it's very moderate, if not flattish in terms of wage inflation. but obviously, that's for reasons that are not hard to discern because there is pressure or unemployment since it's such a tourism-dependent economy.
and then interestingly, in terms of construction works, costs are, again, either in line with prior years or if not going down somewhat, again, because of the demand supply situation that's specific to macao as a lot of large-scale works have moderated, they being completed. so, at this stage, we're not seeing any significant signs on the inflation front. of course, there are some supplies such as food and so on, where we do experience inflation, but obviously, thoughtful for the totality of our business, this is not going to be material. but i think the important point is what rob said, i think you also have to consider for our type of business, the revenue side of the equation, which i think is going to be the more dominant driver, if obviously, prices take off.
patrick dumont -- president and chief operating officer
and just to sort of one other thought. i think -- the important thing to note is where you'll see the impact of inflation is really in construction costs and in materials that go into construction inputs for large-scale projects. you see that in the u.s., you'll see it in singapore and you'll start to see in other markets. in asia, as people come out of the pandemic and really there's a pent-up demand pipeline of things that needed to get done, as well as a shortage of labor and a shortage of labor movement related to pandemic restrictions.
so that is something that is a likely thing to be seen, you're already experiencing a little bit of it in certain markets. i think the other thing is, the good news is that inflation also comes pricing. and so our business is not tied into any long-term contracts. we have the ability to operate within the market.
singapore has always been a very high quality place for labor. it's been an expensive labor market. it's always been very tight, and we've always managed it. so i have faith in the team take on our execution capability to maintain margins through the cycle.
and i think that's really the nature of our business that we have pricing power. we have the ability to change rates as a hotel as a consumer products company and really work through the changing inflation and in effect, make that part of the business margin.
chad beynon -- macquarie group -- analyst
thanks, patrick. and then separately, just on -- kind of back on the digital portfolio opportunities that you talked about just given the current valuation change that we've seen in a lot of the public companies, has anything changed just in terms of the total amount of money that you want to invest in this space given that there might be some really good opportunities in the near term just because of a valuation disconnect? or are you still kind of disciplined in terms of the total amount that you would put forward toward this effort? thank you.
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
i believe we have to be disciplined. and the reason i say that is our core business, and let's be honest, our balance sheet is what it is. it's in a pretty good place. if our business returns in singapore, like we anticipate, -- and then behind that comes to macao, we get back to $4 billion or $5 billion, $6 billion ebitda.
our investment portfolio approach may change as it relates to digital. but at this time, we're going to stay doing what we're doing now, which is being very disciplined waiting for our core business return because there's no one like us. if the macao comes back and i think it will be back hopefully sooner than later, singapore is coming back, we'll be in a very different place in six months or a year and that may change our thinking. i think it's pretty simple.
we want to get back to our core strength and then we visit other things at that time.
patrick dumont -- president and chief operating officer
and i think one other thing that's important to note is we're very much focused on building rather than buying. we want to make sure that we create a lot of long-term value. our company has a history of being a platform of development in entrepreneurship and we are taking that approach through our digital efforts in several different areas. and we think over time, that will provide the most reward for shareholders.
so we're very patient. we're thinking long term. and yes, there are cycles in valuations across the digital space. in our mind, we'll execute against our long-term strategy and take advantage where we can.
chad beynon -- macquarie group -- analyst
thanks. appreciate it.
operator
thank you. the next question is coming from david katz from jefferies. david, your line is live.
david katz -- jefferies -- analyst
hi. afternoon, everyone. thanks for taking my question. you know, with respect to the u.s.
land-based opportunities that's out there. if you sort of have your druthers or how your wishes come to pass, what does the lvs u.s. land-based presence look like over time?
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
any place there's very large-scale buildings that can create large ebitda. we're not looking to be a small regional player obviously. so that limits the opportunities doesn't to texas, new york. we failed in florida recently, but we're not done with florida.
we're still looking at that. and there are few places we can go and invest the kind of money on investment, the kind of returns we want, we're not going to be buying small businesses. so, i think at this point, as you talk to you today, it would have to be texas, new york, and perhaps florida.
david katz -- jefferies -- analyst
got it. understood. thanks very much.
patrick dumont -- president and chief operating officer
thanks, david.
operator
thank you. and the next question is coming from steve wieczynski from stifel. steve, your line is live.
steve wieczynski -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
yeah. hey, guys. good afternoon. just one question for me.
rob, you talked about getting to that $1 billion ebitda run rate in singapore by potentially by the end of the year. and i'm not sure you're going to answer this. but is it fair to say that march and maybe more so april on a monthly run rate basis is enough to get you to that $1 billion run rate level? and i'm just really trying to understand a little more how strong recent trends have been?
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. well, i guess, looking at march, you're at about $700 million run rate if you take you annualize march, and april looks better at this point. so, i don't think it takes a lot to get there. i mean, to be honest, i don't know why we wouldn't get there.
we won't get into specific numbers in april, but the trending singapore, as i referenced earlier, robin, someone asked the question about what's happening it's outsized demand in all segments. so why wouldn't it happen? i mean i think it's going to blow past the $1 billion, frankly, i think it should. it just depends on if we see any pushback in covid restrictions. i mean we have an outsized opportunity.
singapore is the best product that we have in the market today. macao essentially is not available. i think we compete very well anyway in singapore, but it's unique now. and i think it's -- it should at $1 billion and better.
the only negative there, as you well know, is china is still relatively close to us. so that's the market we'll miss but we feel very confident about our prospects. in the last month, things have gone from hesitancy to full-bore excitement about what's happening in singapore. and i think the government -- i think i hope they share our enthusiasm.
steve wieczynski -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
ok, great. thanks, rob. i really appreciate it.
operator
thank you. and the final question is coming from ben chaiken from credit suisse. ben, your line is live.
ben chaiken -- credit suisse -- analyst
hey, how's it going? i guess just two or three follow-ups on singapore. you mentioned $58 million in march. can you remind me, is that -- i believe there was some tax changes coming into play, i guess, simplistically, vip and mass each go up roughly 300 basis points. is that -- was that in march already in the numbers you mentioned?
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes, it was as of march 1, that was-were impacted as of march 1 by the changes you referenced, yes.
david katz -- jefferies -- analyst
cool. thank you. and then two, i think in the last few days, there's been some changes in singapore regarding travel restrictions.
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes.
ben chaiken -- credit suisse -- analyst
can you remind us maybe -- can you just refresh us where we are today versus where we were in march?
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
where we are today is basically, if you're a vaccinated you can get into singapore pretty easily. there are still restrictions and you've got to be -- if you're in the casino, you've got to be smoking or drinking water or something to be able to take your mask off. but pretty much, it's -- if you're vaccinated you have full access to singapore. it's a very different place than it was a month ago.
so that's why we're still bullish in singapore. it basically is quarantine-free entry for all vaccinated travelers. and no code on number of daily arrivals is no more restrictions. so we're back to -- we're back in the business in singapore in a very positive way.
ben chaiken -- credit suisse -- analyst
gotcha. and then just last quick one, not to get ahead of ourselves, but -- you mentioned $1 billion a few times. but why not, i mean you're doing $1.7 billion, right, pre-covid and the new hotel coming, like what's -- is the billing just a round number to update the trajectory or --
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
well, you're saying there's no new hotel coming. we're not building any hotel yet. so, there's no new hotel. there's a renovation of a current hotel.
look, we just see the $1 billion of benchmark. we think that's attainable. we're not trying to oversell it or over -- get too excited ahead of ourselves. let's see where it goes.
we're looking at the results in the u.s. we're very excited about what's happened in the u.s. the demand is there. we've seen a reason why asia shouldn't just keep ramping more positively.
and again, as you referenced, that's a very unique asset. $1.7 billion at the peak was the performance of mbs. we get back to some day, yes, i think we will and then beyond that, but it won't be this year.
ben chaiken -- credit suisse -- analyst
cool. thank you.

operator
good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the sands second quarter 2022 earnings conference call. [operator instructions]. it is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to mr. daniel briggs, senior vice president of investor relations at sands.
sir, the floor is yours.
daniel briggs -- senior vice president of investor relations
thank you. joining the call today are rob goldstein, our chairman and chief executive officer; patrick dumont, president and chief operating officer; dr. wilfred wong, president of sands china; and grant chum, chief operating officer of sands china. today's conference call will contain forward-looking statements that we are making under the safe harbor provision of federal securities laws.
the company's actual results could differ materially from the anticipated results in those forward-looking statements. in addition, we may discuss non-gaap measures. a definition and a reconciliation of each of these measures to the most comparable gaap total measures is included in the press release. we have posted supplementary earnings slides on our investor relations website.
we may refer to those slides during the q&a portion of the call. finally, for those who would like to participate in the q&a session, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. so we might allow everyone with interest the opportunity to participate. please note that this presentation is being recorded.
with that, i'll turn the call over to rob. 
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you, dan, and thank you for joining our call today. a few brief comments and then move to q&a. the recovery in singapore at mbs accelerated during the quarter with property ebitda reaching $319 million. the relaxation of pandemic-related restrictions in singapore and many of its source markets has enabled this encouraging improvement in the financial performance at mbs.
we expect a more robust recovery over time as additional airlift in singapore comes online and further relaxation measures in the region are implemented. our conviction to the long-term opportunity in singapore market remains steadfast. our $1 billion capital investment is underway at marina bay sands as introduced exceptional new suite product and premium segment focused amenities to the resort. more offerings will be added throughout the remainder of 2022 and '23 and this will enhance the property's appeal to premium customers seeking the highest-level travel experiences.
in addition, we look forward to substantially increasing our investment in the singapore market as we execute our expansion plans at marina bay sands in the years ahead. singapore remains an outstanding market for additional investment. let's turn to macau. the operating environment there remains very difficult in periods when the restrictions have been lifted, the customer demand and spending in macao has proven resilient at the premium mass level from both a gaming and a retail perspective.
as the market eventually recovers, our $2.2 billion investment program at four seasons in london will provide outstanding growth opportunities in both the premium and mass customer segments. we appreciate the clarity of the revised gaming law in june. we look forward to participating in the concession retendering process as it proceeds. we continue to have the largest footprint in this incredible market.
we retain great optimism and our ability to perform to pre-pandemic levels and beyond the macau visitation returns. we would welcome the opportunity to invest billions of additional dollars in macau, we continue to believe macau is an outstanding market for additional investment. we can see our portfolio of resorts in asia to be an ideal platform for growth in the years ahead and additionally, we continue to pursue other opportunities in large land-based destination resorts in the u.s. and asia.
let's go to q&a.

operator
thank you. [operator instructions]. and the first question is coming from joe greff from j.p. morgan.
joe, your line is live.
joe greff -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
hello, everybody.
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
hi, joe.
joe greff -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
would love to start with singapore here. when you look back at trends within the 2q, which were obviously encouraging, and you look at the premium mass and the vip segments, was there anything notable in one segment versus the other throughout the quarter? how -- even with the recovery month to month in the segments throughout the quarter other than seasonality, you talked about source markets driving improvement. what geographies are driving that improvement? and then lastly, with my multipart question number one here, can you talk about what you've seen so far in july and the first 20 days here?
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
a lot of questions there, joe. we're not going to break out the quarter. i think we'll be -- it's suffice to say, we're pleased that we back in the -- in a strong position in singapore. and the fundamental growth there comes from obviously both base and premium mass.
i don't think either one outside the other is consistent movement in the right direction. i think the biggest thing we're seeing is the airlift is opening up, and that also remains to be the most challenging part of the singapore recovery. airlift is still a challenge. we're getting a lot of good business out of the region, especially of indonesia and malaysia, but i think there's a lot more opportunity as the airlift returns.
and i think you see that in our deck. the changi monthly visitation numbers are still relatively less than 50% of what they were pre-pandemic. so although we're delighted with singapore and the numbers reflect that, we think there's reason to be optimistic in the months ahead. if you want to just keep -- that's what i think i heard you say.
is there more to it?
joe greff -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
no. i mean -- can you just talk about what you've seen so far in july? has that trend continued?
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
i think you know we're not going to do that. we're not going to talk about july. i think the numbers -- our deck gives you a real good sense of what happened in q2. and i think the story in marina bay sands is a regional story and singapore story.
as that place gets more visitation. i think if you look on page 16 of your slide present today -- your deck there, you'll see that we've not even reached 50% capacity into china, it's like 46% of what it was may of '19. so we're doing these numbers with still a very, very distressed airlift. and i think you know, unlike the u.s.
where there's unfettered ability to get to regional markets, airlift is back, transportation is still a place you need to apply to. and so the airlift story can just hamper the recovery. so i think the $300 million plus quarter is a pleasant upside to what we thought we'd do. but there's, i think, a lot more room to run as this market opens up into places like japan, korea, and more travel.
we're really more dependent right now on the closer in foreign markets.
patrick dumont -- president and chief operating officer
joe, one other thing, it's patrick. i think one thing to note when you look at marina bay sands is that we're not at capacity. and what i mean by that is, to rob's point, if you look at the amount of airlift coming into singapore, it's not where it can be but we're at levels that are very strong relative to 2019. if you look at our non-rolling volumes, which are really speaking to the premium mass segment from the catchment area.
this is only going to grow. and the good news is we have our team together. one of the things that's been slowing some of the growth coming out of the pandemic and really capturing some of the pent-up demand and the return to normalcy is the fact that many operators in the luxury segment didn't necessarily keep their team together throughout the pendency of the pandemic. we were fortunate enough to do that.
and so now our team is ready to respond. so we have plenty of capacity to absorb the growth as it comes in. so our view is that this is a good start, but we have more room to run.
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
to patrick's point, joe, one more thing i think you're aware. we were there, i guess, a month or so ago. one thing that's disturbing is the hotel business, even the luxury brands haven't been able to get open to 100%, some running at 40%, 50% capacity because they don't have adequate personnel and that obviously feeds into marina bay sands. so as they get open fully this year, as that market returns as employment grows, i think we'll grow with that.
there's a lot of room to run here if we get that place fully open and airlift returns to pre-pandemic numbers.
joe greff -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
great. thank you for your thought there. switching over to macau. can you just talk about what your average daily operating expense average cash burn rate has been during this most recent casino closure there?
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
grant, are you awake? grant?
grant chum -- chief operating officer
yes, we're here. so yes, sorry, just momentary lost you. yes, joe, i think. obviously, second quarter, we were running at this $110 million ebitda loss.
so we'll basically just over 1 million a day. now as we went into second half of june, we have a local outbreak of covid in macau and therefore, into the third quarter, clearly, the revenue environment is lower than it has been in the second quarter, especially with the last week's closure of the casinos as well. so i think you can look back to where we were in 2020 in a very, very low tourism environment in the middle of that year and take it from that in terms of the actual daily cash burn rate although i think our operating expenses have moderated a little bit since then, but that's the ballpark region.
joe greff -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
thanks, guys.
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks, joe.
operator
and the next question is coming from shaun kelley from bank of america. shaun, your line is live.
shaun kelley -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
hi. good afternoon, everybody. rob, just sort of going back to singapore for a moment, the changi numbers are really interesting. is that a pretty good guide for, i guess, visitation levels at the property and sort of where i'm going is thinking about spend per visitor, right? we've obviously seen the pent-up demand and that those numbers rise across u.s.
regional gaming, las vegas strip. and i think we're all struggling a little bit to know exactly what asia is going to do, but we can all, i think, do the math if visitation is down 50%, and obviously, you're at 75% or 80% of your productivity levels already that suggests very good spend-per-visit levels, but obviously, i don't want to extrapolate just from the airport, if you could give us a little bit more guidance.
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
well, i think it'd be careful in terms of extrapolating without recognizing we are running high occupancies already at marina bay sands where i think you struggle a bit is to factor in when the rest of the market recovers. that's why i referenced the other high-end luxury hotels. there are lots of sleeping rooms, who we benefit from. they come to shop, eat with us, gamble with us.
we're not getting that lift. and i think that's the -- could be very impactful down the road. we're very happy with the spend levels we're seeing, and we're happy with the occupancy we're getting, but we're not getting that extra -- people don't sleep in our hotel necessarily coming over to gamble, shop, etc. so i think that's where we're trying to point out the visitation levels.
i also think it will be helpful in driving better levels of play and spend as these other markets. so you can't lose 3 million people in a month like may and not have some impact on your numbers. the question you raised is how high is up. and i don't -- i'm not prepared to answer that.
i don't know. but you can't ignore the fact that you're losing tens of millions of people versus pre-pandemic. the point here is just to make it clear how different is it over there versus in the u.s. where visitation levels are back and access to these properties is back here in las vegas and regionals.
it's not the case yet in asia, and i think we'll benefit as that rises, spend will get better. there are retail numbers that you might look at on page 31 as some indication is how powerful the recovery is happening even without full visitation. you can see the sales per square foot at mbs and the power of what's happening over there. so the good news is we're getting -- we're profitable, we're seeing growth.
the better news is there might be a lot more ahead of us if we can access more people into changi, fill up more hotels around our hotel and see a full visitation return. it's not there yet.
shaun kelley -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
great. and maybe just as my follow-up, thinking about margins in singapore, right, without the revenues being back online, it's been hard to analyze. but can you just talk a little bit about puts and takes there now as we get back to very recovered levels on the revenue side about some of the kind of on a stabilized basis as different segments come online because i think there was a tax change there that impacted the market and some other things. so can you just help us think about pros and cons or segments of business that could impact margins on a stabilized basis?
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
pat, do you want to take that?
patrick dumont -- president and chief operating officer
yes, sure. so a couple of things to think about. first off, just as you mentioned, after march 1, our gaming tax increased both by 3% in the premium and the non-premium side. so that 3% does impact margin.
now the -- i think there are some other things going on in singapore. there are some higher expenses, there's utility costs that have gone up, there's other costs to operate in the market that have gone up, inflation that you've seen in other markets are impacting some of the things that we buy. there's also some wage inflation because there's scarcity of labor in the marketplace in singapore. it's a high-quality environment to work in.
it's just a high demand as their economy continues to grow for high-quality labor. so we've seen some labor increase. so there are some things that from a cost basis side are impacting our margin. but the flip side of this is we're not at full revenue yet.
so as we grow revenue and as we make investment in these higher-value suite products and as we grow some of the services that we offer to our patrons, in the long run, we'd like to believe our margins return back toward where they were before. we just need to be operating under a normal environment. so we still have some start-up, let's call it fits and starts related to some expenses. and i think our goal is to get our margins back to where they were, but it's going to take some revenue growth for us to get there.
shaun kelley -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
great. that is very clear. thank you both.
operator
thank you. the next question is coming from carlo santarelli from deutsche bank. carlo, your line is live.
carlo santarelli -- deutsche bank -- analyst
thank you. hey, guys. thanks for taking my question. rob, maybe you could help here just in terms of the -- at marina bay sands.
obviously, i think vip recovered to close to 75% of '18, '19 levels. as you think about that kind of moving forward, are clearly some channels, as you mentioned korea, japan, and i would assume, to some extent, mainland china is curtailed to say the least. but when you think about like the stability of that in the current environment, does it feel as though that's a number that's kind of a new baseline thereabouts at least as we move forward?
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
you mean this current quarter's results being a baseline?
carlo santarelli -- deutsche bank -- analyst
i'm referring more to vip rolling chip volume and kind of the stability of that segment of the market.
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
i think there's room to run. i think there's room in there. i mean, look at what's happened in singapore, let's begin with [inaudible] in the beginning, but we're putting $1 billion in that product. i'll be very blunt about it.
it's always been a very appealing building, but it's never had the ff&e component in the suite and room product, i think, it observed. it now has that, over the next 18 months will finish. we were there and the product we're putting together is as good as any place we've ever operated. and i think that's going to be very helpful.
two, let's be clear that singapore is more desirable than ever as a destination. it's growing in appeal to a lot of people for a lot of reasons. we referenced the airlift. you referenced china, you're absolutely right.
china is obviously not there. but i think you add these things together, the desirability of singapore as a destination, the rethinking of the ff&e in that building, the return of a lot more airlift than there was, hopefully, in 2019. yes, i think that segment can run, yes, i do. i think we can -- we also have less competition in the region.
obviously, macao is not operating at this point. but i think this singapore business is going to continue to grow because the region, the city state of singapore is very desirable and more and more people are going to come to us. so you add our better building with a more desirable singapore with airlift, the opening of china, with the opening of japan, korea at all. i think the cumulative impact here is every segment can grow.
i have a lot of belief that we can drive. we have to drive it because there's the clear cost side, as was referenced by sean and patrick in the previous call. so we will drive revenue in all segments, and we'll be very attuned to it. but i think we're in a very, very privileged position in right now of what's happened there, both of our building and with the destination itself.
carlo santarelli -- deutsche bank -- analyst
great. that's helpful. and then just as it pertains to the expansion, the 1,000 new rooms, i believe you guys had the construction start kind of, i guess, it was an extension on when you had to begin construction in 2q of next year, if i'm not mistaken. is there anything firmer that you guys have around cost and/or plans there that you'd be able to share?
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes. patrick, do you want to --
patrick dumont -- president and chief operating officer
sure, absolutely. so rob referenced our visit to singapore. it was a great visit on a lot of fronts. i think we spent time in the building, and we have the opportunity to continue our dialogue around the ir2 expansion.
we're very excited to begin. i think one of the things that the pandemic did, unfortunately, was slow down that process. there's just a lot of things that have to be considered to fit it into this very complex and a very busy environment to make it sort of fit all the requirements that are necessary to get the approvals to begin. and so i think we're working on that now.
and it's something that we hope in the coming months that we'll be able to get more firm about a start date. but we're excited about it, and we're working with the government currently, and hopefully, we'll get a chance to begin soon.
carlo santarelli -- deutsche bank -- analyst
right. thank you. got it. thanks, guys.
operator
thank you. and the next question is coming from chad beynon from macquarie. chad, your line is live.
chad beynon -- macquarie research -- analyst
hi. good afternoon. thanks for taking my question. i wanted to ask about m&a in this environment.
and i know that's not a normal question for you guys. but given your strong cash flow position, your balance sheet, and just compressed multiples kind of across the gaming, lodging and leisure space. how are you thinking about maybe considering some opportunistic looks across the world? thanks.
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
patrick?
patrick dumont -- president and chief operating officer
so i think one of the things as a company that all through the pandemic and part of the pandemic, we've always focused on is how we allocate capital and how we drive the highest returns for shareholders. and you may have heard in the past, say, that our highest and best use of capital to do new development from the ground up. and that's really what we're focused on. if you look at the history of the company and success and the way it's delivered outside shareholder returns, is exploiting a strategy of building large-scale integrated resorts in new jurisdictions.
and that's what we're focused on. and so for us, i think we have opportunities unique to who we are. we have a long track record with rob in his decades of experience and the rest of the team's decades of experience in developing these resorts. and so we're going to look to do that before we look to buy anything.
i don't think the idea is that we would never look at something. i think we're always interested. i think we're interested in seeing if there's a way to create greater returns for our shareholders. but as a practical matter, we're not an m&a-driven business.
and i think for us, our priorities are going to be look for new markets, develop, build and scale and invest over the long term to create sustainable and durable returns. and that's really what we're going to look to do. so i understand that there's variability, particularly in the digital side, there's a lot of things that have valuations now that made people see them as compelling for the long term. there's perhaps some land-based opportunities that may come up over time.
but as a practical matter, like everyone else, we'll look at it, see if it makes any sense for us, but we're really going to be focused on route of development. that's who we are.
chad beynon -- macquarie research -- analyst
thank you. and then on mbs, again, just on margins. you kind of touched about some of the different pieces of that. has the promotional environment between you and your competitor in the market changed versus pre-pandemic? or does it feel as rational as it was at that time? and do you expect anything to change from a promotional environment once macau opens back up? thanks.
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
we've always been lucky that, that environment is not promotion driven. i don't think it will be in the future either. and i have to wait and see what happens in macao, but my sense is macao, when opens, will not be a challenge either. there'll be plenty of demand.
and usually, promotional activities get out of control in this lack of revenue. i don't think it be a lack of revenue in macao or singapore. so i feel pretty good about it.
chad beynon -- macquarie research -- analyst
appreciate it. thank you.
patrick dumont -- president and chief operating officer
thanks, chad.
operator
thank you. and the next question is coming from brandt montour from barclays. brandt, your line is live.
brandt montour -- barclays -- analyst
hey, everyone. thanks for taking the questions. first one was on singapore, a follow-up on that last question, but more just for the singapore market, specifically. and we've heard a bunch of chatter out there in terms of potential interest in your main competitor in the singapore market.
is there any scenario in which a different operator would come in and take that over and that would change the way you look at that competitive landscape?
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
we don't have any opinion on that. that's up to the government to make that decision, but it's a duopoly market, and i don't see it having an impact either way.
patrick dumont -- president and chief operating officer
yes. i think one thing that's important to note is that we view marina bay sands as the best building in the world. and in our mind, it's an unbelievable opportunity to continue to invest and operate the building and grow it over time. so i don't think we view it any differently.
we think the market opportunity in singapore is absolutely unique, and we're very committed to long-term investment there. so for us, i'm not sure it matters who operates it, that's up to the singapore government and to the owners of that business. but for us, we're just focused on continuing to develop our property and grow the market as best we can.
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
the one thing i would say about singapore, we said it before but just reiterate is that, that place has evolved to even better than it was when we started years ago, and it keeps getting better. and you look at changi running at such a still 40%, 50% capacity, look at the desirability of that market, the things we're doing, i'm sure genting is as well to improve the product. it just feels like that market has a lot of room to run and to grow for us and for our competitor. the offerings get better.
our phase 2 will be even stronger. so to me, that's a market just beginning to feel its muscle.
brandt montour -- barclays -- analyst
ok. great. that's helpful. and then just as a follow-up on that, as we sort of think about how to think about the constraints for how fast that mbs property can recover.
the singapore tourism board recently put out a number for 2022 international visitation that -- something along the line well 4 million to 6 million for '22. that it doesn't seem like that would incorporate a ton of ramp from here. and i know that's not necessarily exactly what you guys would see. but does that make it seem like the changi airlift is for the rest of the year is baked into the cake now? or is there -- can that be flexed up, do you think?
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
i'm not going to speak for the government and what the numbers say. i think the capacity opportunity speaks for itself. i think it's more dependent not on singapore, but on the airlines themselves and the other countries wanting to reengage and to open. i think the airport can obviously have the capacity.
i'd be surprised if singapore wouldn't welcome more access, more flights. it's a question of getting the requisite employees in these airlines to get the lift going and open up these countries in a major way. i think it's hard to forecast. we're in a world of change, every day is different.
and i'd like to think there's a lot more opportunity than that, but remains to be seen if the governments want to engage and if the airlines can get the employees make it happen. i think demand -- underlying demand is absolutely there, just getting the ability to get there.
operator
thank you. and the next question is coming from robin farley from ubs. robin, your line is live.
robin farley -- ubs -- analyst
great. just a quick one on -- i don't know if i missed in your introductory comments, any comments on what you've talked about in the past related to online gaming and sports betting and kind of looking at b2b investments. i didn't catch if you had an update there. thanks.
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
we didn't have an update. we didn't mention it. we're focused right now on what's happening. we remain committed to our digital investments and looking at that market.
but right now, the story for us is this land-based recovery, which we're filling in singapore. and we made some major strides in this company in terms of liquidity, the reopening of singapore, and we think the upside potential in singapore, the licensing process and how we're focused on that. and of course, most importantly, the return to a normalized operating environment in macau is paramount. we've just been so busy with that.
the focus wasn't on digitally right now. we continue to look at that opportunity. we continue to invest. we made two investments, as you know, in the past.
so just simply we're focused right now on land based.
robin farley -- ubs -- analyst
ok. great. and then also, has there been a change in what you expect for timing and spend in a potential new york project since last quarter?
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
i'm sorry, i missed you about new york.
grant chum -- chief operating officer
timing and spend?
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
no, i think we remain a believer in that market, and the process is taking longer than i thought it would. but hopefully, it will come to -- hopefully, this year or early next, we'll know what's happening there. now, still the density of population and the ethnicity and the access in new york makes it very appealing and lack of capacity still remains a premier market in my mind, if we can get there. a lot of competition, we're one of many in the hunt there.
so nothing new to report. we have a plan in place. we're executing to it. let's wait for the rfp to unfold.
so we have nothing new in new york.
robin farley -- ubs -- analyst
ok. great. thank you.
grant chum -- chief operating officer
thanks, robin.
operator
thank you. and the next question is coming from steve wieczynski from stifel. steve, your line is live.
steve wieczynski -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
so this will probably be for grant and it's probably going to be a difficult question to even answer. but grant, i guess for us, non-chinese citizens, it's extremely tough for us to understand where china is with respect to the reopening process. but i don't know if you can help us understand maybe what you're hearing around the zero-covid policy, which i mean, i think the rest of the world probably fully knows at this point is never really going to work. and if some of these harsher stances toward the virus could start to get relaxed before, maybe is there a time frame you guys are watching? or is there anything you've heard maybe is it the october election, i guess.
anything around that would be very, very helpful. thanks.
grant chum -- chief operating officer
yes. thanks for the question. i think as you alluded to, there's not much that we can help with in terms of any speculation on timelines or changes. i think what we are focused on is what's happening in macau.
so i think the things that we can effect is to make sure that we do help the prevailing government policy so that we can actually get macau reopen back with zhuhai, the neighboring city in mainland as quickly as possible. and that means, i think, aligning ourselves fully and safely with the overall covid policy. and that's what's happening right now. and so hopefully, over the coming weeks, we will be progressively reopening all of the facilities that we've had to close in the past week.
that's what we're really focused on. and it's really not our place to speculate on future changes on the overall health policy. i don't know if wilfred has more to add on that.
wilfred wong -- president, sands china
no, i think, grant, you're right. at this stage, i think the whole country is also employed in this covid situation. and obviously, policies will evolve. and we in macau trying our best to support the local government in order that macau can return to normalcy.
steve wieczynski -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
ok. great. and then, rob, obviously, there's been some bet some movement with regards to the new macao gaming laws, regulations, whatever way you want to think about it, which actually seemed pretty favorable, but wondering how you guys are viewing those regulation changes and maybe any of the pros or cons that you see emerging from those?
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
well, we're grateful for the clarity from the government. i think the process is moving very well. and i think a lot of the concerns some people have, have been eliminated. so we're just going to process and hoping to complete this thing in due course.
but obviously, we're all pleased. i think all the operators are pleased how this is playing out, and we're hoping for a positive conclusion. i think a lot of their fears have been erased. grant or wilfred are going to comment, that's as far as i can take it.
grant chum -- chief operating officer
i think that's right, rob.
wilfred wong -- president, sands china
yes. absolutely. grant, go ahead.
grant chum -- chief operating officer
i'm just going to add that, obviously, we're very appreciative that during this difficult time on the covid front that the government and the legislature were able to move forward to complete the passing of the revised gaming law in -- toward the end of june and that we were able to also execute the six-month extension. that takes us to the end of this year. so i think the whole process is moving forward expeditiously. and as rob said, we look forward to participating in the tendering process.
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
steve, one thing i would say, our company, as you know, has been through, it's been an awfully difficult couple of years more than most because we're asia-focused. but we've now completed -- the sands in las vegas gives us more than ample liquidity no matter what happens. singapore is up and making money, and there's more to come. it's a very -- we're very grateful for what's happening in singapore.
we see a lot better days ahead. the macao licensing process is the same way. it feels like we've survived as a lot of people are concerned. but in the end, it's worked out for everybody in a positive manner, thus far.
i hope that continues. and we're just waiting for the thing you referenced initially, which is when does macao, when does the government rethink the zero-covid or how does that play out? we don't know. don't pretend to know, but that's the last thing we're waiting for to get our company back to a much better place. but three of the four have been achieved.
so we'll continue to press on with the license and wait patiently for the government to advise us on the reopening of macao.
steve wieczynski -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
ok. great. thanks, rob. i appreciate it.
operator
thank you. the next question is coming from david katz from jefferies. david, your line is live.
david katz -- jefferies -- analyst
hi. good afternoon. thanks for taking my questions. number one, i wanted to ask about just the physical plant in macao.
and recalling that those are -- have a significant number of private rooms that were historically used for vip. how do we think about kind of that spatial layout and planning going forward? and then i have a follow-up in another direction.
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
grant, do you want to take that because i have my own views, but i think you should --
grant chum -- chief operating officer
sure. i think we've been watching as the market has been evolving and also planning for the future. i think a lot of the salons and certainly, that applies to the new salons that we've developed as part of the grand suites or four seasons and the london and macao projects. i think, they're really premium salons, premium gaming salons that could be applicable and used by the different segments, whether that's the vip rolling or the premium mass.
so clearly, i think macao overall may be relooking at how they each operator redeploys the assets. but as far as we're concerned, especially the new products that we've developed over the past two years, we feel pretty positive about redeploying a lot of those gaming spaces for the premium mass segment. but also over time, as we look toward the future, also the premium direct segment and attracting the overseas markets in the rest of asia into those products. so we've been currently going through a planning exercise on the future deployment of those areas.
but as the market evolves and as things normalize, we'll be able to get more definition around that. but even as of the past 12 months, we've been redeploying some of those rooms that were assigned to the rolling segment to the non-rolling segments.
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
david, no one ever thought additional gaming space in macao is a bad thing. as we focus more on base mass and premium mass, i think it actually expands our ability to make more money. the junket business, we always know is a margin-challenge business. i feel grateful we have all this new space coming back to us that we can redeploy and what is still going to be the world's biggest gaming market for land based, and we'll have the biggest footprint.
so as this -- as we -- as grant and wilfred and the team rethink that space, i think it adds all kinds of premium opportunities for base mass, premium mass and direct premium as well. so to me, it's a very valuable transition to a higher focused margin business that enables us to -- again, singapore -- i mean macao, the penetration in china is still, i think, sub-3% for the china population. it's going to be a growth market. capacity will be an issue down the road because there are new casinos opening.
so i think that space may prove to be very valuable as we get back to work in macao, hopefully this year or next. but i think we're lucky to have all that extra space we can redeploy a more profitable way down the road. so happy to have it back.
david katz -- jefferies -- analyst
understood. and as my follow-up, you've done, obviously, the singapore mbs did a lot better than what we had. but just looking at the adr of, i think, $330. and i'm not sure that you covered this directly so far.
when we look back to 2019, it was -- there's still some headroom there. it was about $90 adr higher. how do you sort of see that evolving as we roll forward?
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
pat, do you want to take that?
patrick dumont -- president and chief operating officer
yes, sure, happy to. i think some of it has to do with sort of start up across the quarter. i think one of the other things to note is that it's not fully recovered and with all the different segments because there is sort of not as much fit and mice demand as we had across 2019. so you're going to see some adr spread from that.
but i think the most important thing to note is we're making, as rob referenced, $1 billion investment in our product there. over time, our adr will be higher. so across the next six quarters, and let's sort of focus on at the end of '23 in time for chinese new year of '24, we're going to have 400 new suites that we never had before. and they're the highest-quality suites we've ever done as a company and we're going to drive different adr.
so while we're out a couple of hundred suites now with that rooms out of inventory, we've got a lot of things going on through the building, start-up period, i wouldn't look at this as adr as representative. and so over the next couple of quarters as we have rooms out of inventory, it's going to -- there's going to be some choppiness. but by the time we're done getting into '23 and getting across '23 when the project is completed, then you'll have a good look at what adr can really be under the value of the full investment, which is substantial. it's basically a complete redo of towers 1, towers 2 and some of the common spaces and amenity spaces that we have.
it's going to be a fundamentally different experience for our guests, and we hope and believe very strongly they'll pay a lot more for it because it will attract a higher-value tourists, and that's really our goal.
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
our biggest problem today [inaudible] mbs is as that changi recovery continues and [inaudible] come back as our game, our biggest problem won't be adr. it is going to be putting -- have enough rooms to accommodate all the demand. adr will climb, either the casino direct or through cash customers or to convention. there'll be no problem getting back.
that's not the issue. the issue has always been we're capacity constrained at mbs, we need more sleeping rooms and we'll get the adr. that market, the recovery you're seeing here is in its infancy, just beginning and be assured that we can get the adr back to pre-covid levels and above. in fact, i hope we can do much better with casino demand and drive the casino adr as well.
so --
david katz -- jefferies -- analyst
perfect. thank you so much.
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
sure. thank you.
patrick dumont -- president and chief operating officer
thanks, dave.
operator
thank you. and the last question is coming from dan politzer from wells fargo. dan your line is live.
dan politzer -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
hey. thanks for taking my questions. so given the momentum you're seeing in singapore and the recovery is still in its infancy, how do you think about the long-term path to getting back to pre-covid, the $1.7 billion of ebitda in the event china doesn't open? do you need china to reopen to kind of get back or get close to that level or given what you're seeing now, do you have a line of sight to getting near there in the absence of china reopening.
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
it's a good question. and we're watching like you all. i think let's not ever dismiss the importance of china in any of our businesses. china is still a powerhouse as a consumer market, and we should never dismiss it as powerful.
can we get to $400 million a quarter without china, most of you would think not. but then again, i would have thought we wouldn't have on this well with changi still having underperforming in terms of visitation. so it depends -- like the u.s., i think you have to question what -- where will the over-indexing come from? well, indonesia, malaysia and other source markets over-indexed. and that's the question, we don't know the answer to that.
will there be pent-up demand coming out of thailand and vietnam and indonesia and could they -- could korea outperform? i just don't know. we have to wait and see how those markets open up again. we're in uncharted waters here, it's new. but i would never dismiss the importance of china as a market for anybody in our retail business, our hotel business, our casino business.
china is very, very critical to everybody in asia. and you can see that in any market that you participate in. but how high is up without china returning, i think we'll have to wait and see it together. there's a lot of good drivers here that make us feel good, the visitation makes us so there's opportunity there.
our renovation feels like it's going to be very impactful as it comes online, the over-indexing of non-china markets feels like it's coming on strong. but i think we'll revisit that and we'll have a better answer for you next quarter when we print our numbers.
dan politzer -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
got it. and then just as a follow-up. i know covid cases in singapore actually have been rising lately. given your experience working with the government and your perception, i guess, and stance of living with covid, and the stage of reopening we're in, do you see any risk with additional restrictions coming back or being put in place?
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
patrick, want to grab that.
patrick dumont -- president and chief operating officer
yes, sure, happy to. i think at this point, all we can do is be optimistic about the public health posture that singapore has shown, they've shown a lot of leadership. they have a significant history of investment in their hospital system and their public health infrastructure, and i think they're proceeding as they've said. i think they broadcast it all along and they follow what they've laid out.
so as we sit here right now, i think they're moving in the way they said they're going to do, which is continue to have visitation, continue to be involved in the growth in their economy and move forward with this is an endemic situation. but we don't know. and i think this is something where we've obviously shown flexibility to respond as needed to support the government and their initiatives. but at this time, it seems like we're heading in the right direction.
but could that change in the future? we don't know.
dan politzer -- wells fargo securities -- analyst

2022-Q3,LVS,2022-10-19 16:30:00,"prepared remarks:
operator
good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the sands' third quarter 2022 earnings conference call. [operator instructions] it is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to mr. daniel briggs, senior vice president of investor relations at sands. sir, the floor is yours.
daniel briggs -- senior vice president, investor relations
thanks, paul. joining the call today are rob goldstein, our chairman and ceo; patrick dumont, our president and coo; dr. wilfred wong, president of sands china; and grant chum, evp of asia operations and coo of sands china. today's conference call will contain forward-looking statements that we are making under the safe harbor provision of federal securities laws.
the company's actual results could differ materially from the results reflected in those forward-looking statements. in addition, we will discuss non-gaap measures. a definition and a reconciliation to the most comparable gaap financial measures are included in the press release. we have also posted an earnings presentation on our investor relations website.
we may refer to the presentation during the q&a portion of the call. [operator instructions] please note that this presentation is being recorded. i'll now turn the call over to rob. 
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you, dan, and thank you for joining our call today. a few brief comments and we'll move to q&a. the recovery of marina bay sands continued during the quarter with property ebitda reaching $343 million. relaxation of virus-related restrictions in singapore and many of the source markets, coupled with the improvements in airlift have enabled this performance and financial -- this improvement in financial performance.
we expect a robust recovery over time as further relaxation measures in the region are implemented and additional airlift in singapore comes online. our $1 billion capital investment program currently underway at marina bay sands has introduced exceptional new suite product in premium segment focused amenities of the resort. the response to these initial offerings has been strong. additional offerings, including spacious new suite products, will be introduced throughout the remainder of this year in 2023.
we look forward to substantially increasing our investment in the singapore market as we execute our expansion plans at mbs in the years ahead. turning to macau, the operating environment remains difficult. importantly though, in areas where restrictions have been relaxed, customer demand and spending in macau have proven resilient at the premium mass level from both gaming and retail perspective. we appreciate the opportunity to submit our tender proposal for one of the six gaming concessions in macau in september.
we are now in the consultation phase of the tender program and as such, we won't be able to comment much further on the process at this time. we are big believers in macau as a world center of tourism and leisure. we have been the biggest investor and operated non-gaming businesses over the past two decades in macau. we absolutely welcome the opportunity to invest even more in nongaming products and offerings in macau.
we have great confidence in macau's tourism recovery as long-term growth prospects as we do most of our -- we'll do our utmost to support macau's economic diversification and its evolution as asia's leading destination for mice and leisure visitors. we consider our existing portfolio of resorts in asia to be an ideal platform for growth in the years ahead. in addition, we continue to pursue opportunities to develop new large-scale land-based destination resorts in both the u.s. and asia.
we thank you for listening today, and i'll turn to your questions.
",":
operator
thank you. [operator instructions] and the first question today is coming from joe greff from j.p. morgan. joe, your line is live.
joe greff -- jpmorgan chase and company -- analyst
thank you. good afternoon, everybody. rob, marina bay sands, you're run rating close to $1.4 billion in annualized ebitda. and as you referenced in the investor slide presentation, without any contribution from a geography, namely china.
given what you're seeing with improved easing regional visitation volume in, say, other non-china geographies, do you think you can get to 2019 ebitda levels at some point in the next year or so without direct contribution from china?
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
joe, we think singapore is in a very unique place. i think we easily achieved 2019 levels. and as you referenced, we have three great impediments right now. we have -- obviously, tours into china is very limited.
we also are running about 55% visitation into singapore from the rest of asia, which means -- and that may seem odd to reference that because you think, well, we're running at the high levels of occupancy. but keep in mind that that residual tourist that comes in does not sleep at the mbs property, gambles there, shops there, eats there. so we're getting hurt, i think, on the table business by not having all the hotels in singapore operating at full level. it's a big business for us because mbs is the first protocol from those visitors whether they're sleeping there or not, they go there.
that hurts our business. and despite that, we're achieving $700 win per units on the slots and huge retail numbers, but the upside is material. third impediment is our sleeping rooms. we had about 400 or 500 units down right now.
i think singapore, it's just beginning. i always joke with the guys here, the party is just starting in singapore. the truth is that singapore is going to grow, and for a couple of reasons. one is the destination is getting more powerful than ever.
our building is getting better than ever. and i think when you see a rebound from china and the rest of asia, $1.6 billion was very small in terms of our ability to grow with much larger than that. i think we can keep going to $2 billion the next couple of years if we get it right and the market fully recovers. so as much as we like the numbers currently, we think there's much better days ahead for singapore.
that market and that destination has grown quite a bit in terms of the asian tourism world. and i think our numbers will reflect that in years ahead.
joe greff -- jpmorgan chase and company -- analyst
great. and then switching over to macau, i'm not going to sort of waste, i guess, my bullet of the question on the concessionaire terms and other things i'd love to ask about. but maybe can you just remind us what your expectation or what your conversations during the consultation process, what the timetable is for the license renewables to be finalized? when would you expect to hear from the government and then the government's end result to be publicly communicated? and that's all for me. thanks.
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
we woke our colleagues up in asia in a deep sleep to participate. i'll let them answer that question. gentleman, grant and wilfred, both online. correct?
daniel briggs -- senior vice president, investor relations
correct.
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
are you awake, guys?
wilfred wong -- president, sands china
yup.
grant chum -- senior vice president, global gaming strategy
yup.
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
answer away. do you need the question?
wilfred wong -- president, sands china
well, we've been working with the government closely. and a couple of rounds of discussion has been held. we are waiting for the government notification, whether there will be another next round of discussion. and the timetable remains the same.
everything is in good progress, and we expect some notification toward the end of the month for us to know what's the next step.
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
great. grant, do you have anything to add? any additional commentary, grant?
grant chum -- senior vice president, global gaming strategy
no, i think that's right. and we obviously welcome the smooth progress in the process. and we still do expect the entire process to complete by the end of the year, as obviously stated by the government.
joe greff -- jpmorgan chase and company -- analyst
thanks guys.
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you. i appreciate it.
operator
thank you. the next question is coming from carlo santarelli from deutsche bank. carlo, your line is live.
carlo santarelli -- deutsche bank -- analyst
hey guys, thank you. obviously, rob or whoever wants to take this, you guys had a significant boost in kind of hotel revenue out of singapore and namely in adr. any color you guys could provide? i mean, i know strategically, you're looking to put the best customers in that building right now from a gaming perspective. and obviously, that's showing up in the numbers, both on the vip segment role and mass segment role.
anything you could provide as to kind of how the mix has changed at that property? i assume some of that adr is just kind of casino comp room and that's kind of what's making that sound so significant?
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
i think, carlo, one of the most significant things is what's not there. we're running like 96%. you see on page 14, the reference page, adr $515. i think, again, we're just beginning.
we only have half the recovery in terms of -- china is not there, most of asia is not there. our point is the mix gets better and better because demand gets higher and higher. our problem there's going to be to have enough rooms to service all the demand fit casino. and i think we pointed two great variables: one being retail, which is that mall just keeps getting better and will keep getting better.
and then our win per unit on the slot side looks strong. but i think the refocus on singapore as a destination market, as a market in great ascent illustrates what the upside could be in the -- on the tables, and non-rolling tables. rolling tables will probably get to whole new level, but demand for the non-rolling tables is what i'm waiting for recovery. and that's where you see china and the rest of asia full lift comes back.
so right now, we're just faced with -- the sad reality is we like to have a lot more rooms in singapore because that $515 is a real number, it could be a lot higher as demand gets lifting. we can sell hotels rooms all day long at top dollar rates from the fit side. we have great demand, much better than prepandemic demand from the rolling side. so again, the $343 million is a very nice number, a good print in lieu of what's happening in that market.
but i think the best phase of singapore next couple of years as we keep growing -- and you're going to see our refocus on our mix in the retail segment. our room mix, we're going to continue to focus on the right room mix, top-tier rooms, the right food and beverage product. we've got to work harder because singapore as a destination is growing measurably. we want to be a part of that.
so we're just in a very good place in singapore. i think looking back, we always thought [inaudible] was a very nice number, but hopefully that looks like a small number in the future.
carlo santarelli -- deutsche bank -- analyst
great. thank you, rob. that's helpful. and then if i could, as you guys have talked about in the past kind of the thoughts on development.
clearly, the new york process is kind of underway. could you perhaps maybe share a little bit of your thinking around your approach and perhaps how you're thinking about the broader process time line in general for new york?
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
waiting for a governor hochul's advice to how that's going to process will begin. as you know, we've always been focused on that market for many years. we have a big we're putting together right now. we have property we're put together right now.
very bullish on new york as a market. tough because really, i think, one available license at the end of the day, i think it's been a very -- a dog fight. and hopefully, we have a bid that gets attention. but other than that, timetable looks like january for the rfp.
i think sometime in '23, maybe you see a decision. and we'll put our best foot forward, that's for sure. it would be a perfect market to be in with the density of population and ethnicity.
carlo santarelli -- deutsche bank -- analyst
awesome. thank you, rob. appreciate it.
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you, carlo.
operator
thank you. the next question is coming from robin farley from ubs. robin, your line is live.
robin farley -- ubs -- analyst
great. thanks. can you give us a sense on when -- what your expectation is for a more open border and whether there's still an expectation that november would see the package tour visas and electronic visas. is that something that you feel like is still moving forward and will still allow for increased visitation to start?
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
i'm going to ask your former colleague, mr. chum, to answer that question, robin.
grant chum -- senior vice president, global gaming strategy
sorry, robin, i couldn't quite hear the question. can you repeat that?
robin farley -- ubs -- analyst
it was just about your expectations around timing for the border to be a little more open in macau and specifically anything on the changes that were planned by early november for visa applications to be electronic and package tour visa to restart.
grant chum -- senior vice president, global gaming strategy
yeah, sure. i mean i think, robin, there has been a positive announcement on the relaxation with regards to two groups, as well as the electronic visa application in four provinces and also in shanghai expected to commence end of the month or early november. and so that's obviously going to be a very positive signal for a gradual recovery in the visitation especially from these key provinces and municipality. and obviously, we welcome the development.
clearly, in the past few weeks and also months, is still being relatively impacted by the covid cases in different provinces as far as the non-guangdong visitation is concerned. so what we're seeing right now in macau is predominantly coming from the guangdong province. but hopefully, as we get out further into the fourth quarter with these recent measures, we're going to start to see a more well-rounded mix of visitation building up toward the end of the year.
robin farley -- ubs -- analyst
ok. and then also for my other question on singapore. i know you said that the deadline to start construction was extended till april 2023, and that's -- you had said that before this quarter. just wondering if you have anything more definitive about when that would happen.
thanks.
patrick dumont -- president and chief operating officer
i think -- hi, it's patrick. i think the great news is, as rob said in his opening remarks and the questions, our performance in singapore is very strong. it's a privileged market and now tourism there is really remarkable given some of the constraints. the spending power of the consumer there is tremendous.
we're really focused on high-value tourism and you're seeing the results of that in our results. and i think the tower 2 and our ir 2, in our mind, has just tremendous potential. we're very excited about it. but unfortunately, we don't have any update right now about the timing.
so we're working on it. we're in process. and as we make a little bit more progress on our work there, we'll be able to disclose further about where we're headed. but as of right now, we're very optimistic about it.
we're excited about the project. we think it really will speak to a very powerful part of the market. now we don't have an update on timing.
robin farley -- ubs -- analyst
can i just ask one clarifying question on that? it had sounded previously like the timing of the budget and all of that was because of the pandemic and the disruption from that. if your business level is sort of fairly recovered, is that still the kind of uncertainty in the commencing construction? or are there other factors that are more of a gating issue at this point?
patrick dumont -- president and chief operating officer
it's really just process. i think there's a certain number of steps that we have to go through to be able to build. and so those processes were delayed because of the pandemic and because of some of the government agencies that we have to deal with being focused on very pressing matters. so now that they're able to reengage, we'll start that process again and begin on the path.
and as we follow sort of the steps necessary, we'll be able to provide an update. but it's really just timing related to things necessary to begin. there's a lot of things that have to happen to make a building of this scale and complexity in the location that it's in, get all the approvals, go with the steps necessary to begin.
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
and robin, i would say, the process for us is a learning -- is an evolutionary process. we keep thinking how about this market differently as we learn more and see more. and so our thinking has changed on size of room, gaming capacity, who the customer is. singapore is morphed from what it was five years ago and hold it in place now.
and i think it's affected our thoughts on what we build in singapore and how good should it be and how powerful should it be. and i think it's slower we want to be, but it's going to be at the end of the day a very, very important product.
robin farley -- ubs -- analyst
ok, great. thank you very much.
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks, robin.
operator
thank you. the next question is coming from dan politzer from wells fargo. dan, your line is live.
dan politzer -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
hey, good afternoon everyone, and thanks for taking my question. so just -- you guys are seeing a lot of strength in terms of the room product right now. you're doing the $1 billion project renovation on your room product and mbs. i mean how do we think about the return of that given this should be fully online next year? and do you think you can get to that typical kind of 20% return historically or maybe higher even in the absence of the chinese consumer coming back?
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
i think we need the chinese consumer. we need couple of things to happen, let's be clear, we need to see china return at some point to achieve our goals. we also need to see the balance of asia open up and come back at, again, as i referenced earlier, the 55-or-so percent number, which is compared to 2019 isn't good. we need singapore to be full on because our building, if you walk through there, when there's tens of thousands, hundreds of thousand people there, they're all staying there.
there's the other hotels from the business. so these other hotels are very important to us. so we need two things happen. our renovation will complete in late '23.
the balance of singapore -- of asian tourism into singapore should be hopefully by q2 complete. and that leaves the one barrier we can't answer that: the china return. but when all that happens, do we think we can get to a very fat return? yes. i'd like to believe we can -- our goal is to get to $2 billion in singapore.
and we believe that's not difficult if the market returns in full. so keep in mind that we went into singapore with a very different mentality a decade plus ago. the evolution of macau into a really being the premier fit gaming market probably right now in that region is mbs. and i think we're experiencing the beginning to return, but it's not nearly where it needs to get to for us to get to $500 million a quarter.
but i think that -- we'll hopefully see that in the years ahead. so we feel very bullish. and i can't think of a better place to invest our capital than singapore and macau. and singapore has proven to be terrific opportunity.
we put a lot of money in macau. that will open up [inaudible] and be a good opportunity. but right now, singapore is very, very exciting for us. and yes, we're very confident the returns will be there.
dan politzer -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
got it, thanks. and then just pivoting to macau. another one on the group tours and the e-visas being resumed. i mean can you maybe frame how big these components worked for your business in 2019? and then secondarily, if we think about these parts of the business returning and coming back online, is there a path to macau getting to positive ebitda in the fourth quarter, assuming no major outbreaks?
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
i'll ask grant to reference that. but i think we should be careful. we don't -- it's very hard, as you know, right now, predictions on macau have been erroneous for the last couple of years because we don't know who's going to come and we don't know when they'll close the market. it's been a stop-and-start for so long.
it's kind of silly for us to pontificate on exact gains in ebitda. could be ebitda positive? sure, these are positive tomorrow if things open up and visitation return. and that's going to happen at some point. but i think it's not -- it's difficult for us to tell you fourth quarter could be ebitda positive without knowing what effect the business team will have in november and then also not knowing how zero covid enforcement will happen.
so there's certainly unknowns in macau. it's very difficult to guess. grant, wilfred, any commentary?
grant chum -- senior vice president, global gaming strategy
yeah, rob, i think rob is right. i mean, the prediction of the future is tough. i think what we can say about the past is that group package tours represented roughly a quarter of the visitation before the pandemic. with respect to electronic visas, we don't have those numbers.
obviously, it varied significantly from province to province. but clearly, the provision or availability of that mode of application absolutely is helpful to facilitate the visa application for those relevant provinces.
dan politzer -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
got it. thanks for all the commentary.
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks, dan.
operator
thank you. and the next question will be from shaun kelley from bank of america. shaun, your line is live.
shaun kelley -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
hey, good afternoon everyone. maybe just to stay on singapore, my first question is just to ask a little bit about trying to triangulate a little bit more on sort of what you're seeing behaviorally. when we look at revpar, for instance, i think it's about 6% versus 2019. is that a decent gauge of, let's call it, the consumer and, let's call it, the spend per person or per head.
is it better than that? i'm just trying to kind of think about pent-up demand or what you're seeing on kind of a core visit-to-visit basis versus what we've seen in some of the western markets because we don't have a great proxy in asia yet about sort of how pent-up demand is going to play out and just trying to kind of see what you're seeing a little bit more.
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
i'm going to ask patrick to take that, but i want to say one thing, shaun, is critical to understand is that singapore is much different. i think this is the obvious response to that. singapore is much different than las vegas or u.s. regional because of the obvious that you got to fly to get there, so you had to take other countries opening up and it's like buying wine in burgundy, a lot of different regions in burgundy.
well, there's a lot of different regions in asia that don't open, haven't opened. airlift is a problem. so we're really hampered. as nice as what $3.40 billion is for the quarter, i think you're not getting the full power.
it's hard to differentiate versus other places. the truth is that singapore remains really held back by no china or little china and the regional market there, depending on airlift. the difference in macau will be when macau opens up, it's like las vegas or regionals. you can come right in without airlift.
you're not airlift-dependent. so i do think singapore right now is in kind of unclear, uncertain environment. it's nicely making $1.4 billion, whatever the number annualizes. but we won't know the full power of this market.
we see it in retail. we see it in local slot play is still strong. we see it in rolling volumes are strong because everyone is coming to singapore, especially the f1. but i think what you're not seeing yet is unleash the full power of this destination and what's happening.
patrick?
patrick dumont -- president and chief operating officer
it's a very interesting question. i think the key thing to note is that it's a data point for the quality of tourism coming into singapore. and the high amount of consumption that's there when tourists visit, there are constraints and there were constraints for marina bays sands during the quarter. so as rob mentioned at the beginning, you see from the deck, we had approximately 500 rooms out of inventory during the renovation, the rooms that are coming online are probably the best products we've ever had.
we're very proud about that. we think we'll be able to trade up in terms of the quality of the tourism that we get out of those rooms once the completion is there. one thing to note is that we'll be done at the end of '23. so we're going to have a few more quarters of disruption as we take rooms out of inventory to complete the renovation process in marina bay sands.
the other thing to note is that the airlift is not there. and some of the other hotels around the singapore market do not have the full capacity because of labor constraints. so once these things are removed from the market that act as limiters, then you can get an idea of what the true potential would be in a run rate environment. but i would still call this a little bit of a recovery quarter.
so we think there's more potential to run as we fix some of these things that are sort of limiting the way that we can earn. and to be fair, the market can earn.
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
if you look at our sales in the retail mall on page 31, it gives you some indication that we're running at $2,300, $2,400 a foot at marina bay sands from the third quarter. i also think if you look at the rolling volumes as they start to kick in, i think those are great data points to see the quality coming. but again, it's early days. i think the recovery quarter is the right way of approaching it.
shaun kelley -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
super helpful. and sort of want to go down the same path, transitioning over to macau. and i'm not sure it's the exact right way to look at it. but here, you do this slide on slide 12 where you kind of break down the mass win per visit, which i find to be very, very valuable.
just as we think about that level, and we saw the sort of pullback from what was probably a very premium mass-driven business back over the -- like last eight quarters or so. the last two quarters, have looked a lot like where you were back in kind of 2018, 2019. is this the right -- which one of those two, either the sort of pent-up demand we saw over the last eight quarters or kind of these more recent numbers is a better guide for what we think normal activity might look like in macau?
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
grant, do you want to take that?
grant chum -- senior vice president, global gaming strategy
yup, i'll take that, rob. yeah, thanks for the question. i think it's interesting looking at that trend as you highlight for the past several quarters. i would say the difference that you highlighted with the previous two quarters versus the prior eight, it's really just a function of the regional mix.
so into 2022, we've had a much more guangdong bias mix, if you look at the visitation data, and that's mainly a result of the various covid outbreak impact on the non-guangdong source of visitation. so if you're looking at the period post pandemic, that's clearly the differentiator. and then if you compare with pre pandemic, then it's, of course, still very much premium mass coming back faster. and i think that broadly stands notwithstanding or adjusted for the regional provincial mix.
i think that's still a valid point, and it's borne out by the data series. so obviously, premium mass comes back first and then the mass comes back later. but this year, definitely, there's an impact from the regional mix as well.
shaun kelley -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
very helpful. thank you.
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
i think we all agree to underlying demand in macao's going to be there once covid resolved. and no difference happened probably in the u.s. and again, with our footprint there, our size, our scale, we know the base mass, premium mass is going to drive this thing. the only variable we don't know is the missing junket segment, how impactful it will be.
but we believe -- again, when that door does open, i think the pent-up demand is going to be extraordinary.
shaun kelley -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
thank you again.
operator
thank you. and the next question is coming from brandt montour from barclays. brandt, your line is live.
brandt montour -- barclays -- analyst
hey, good afternoon everyone. thanks for taking my questions. on singapore, can you guys give us the room rate differential between the finished room product and the legacy room product at run rate?
patrick dumont -- president and chief operating officer
i think the problem is the -- it's patrick. i think the problem is there's so much noise in the comparison because what we would be giving you is 2019, and this is not a fully open market yet. what we'd like to believe is after the quality of the renovation to be fair, we were taking keys out of inventory to create larger suite product. the level of design, we have a new service model.
we've changed out a lot of the team there in order to improve our service delivery. there's a lot of things that are going to be different. so i don't want to quote you a number until we get to the run rate. but the key takeaway is that we're very focused on high-value tourism.
we're investing in room product, we're investing in personnel and training and in service delivery and in food and beverage and other amenities in the property to ensure that we can sort of capture that high-value tourist. and that's really what you'll see over time.
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
i think one thing you just have to do if you want to understand this thing is you will have pictures and listen to us, but jump on a plane somebody and go see it. the product we're building there is unlike any haven't been done in singapore is our spirit to what we've done the best in our competitors. and so i think when people -- our response has been across the board, perfect in terms of how people view this product. i think the impact is going to be much higher than we understand because if you build something that good, people respond to it.
i would encourage anybody who's in that part of the world to spend a day at marina bay sands and we'll show you what we're building is pretty impressive.
brandt montour -- barclays -- analyst
great. thanks for that. that's helpful. and then as you -- again, on singapore, one of the narratives on the early days of the reopening in that market was that singapore was gaining share of groups and convention business from hong kong.
as you talk to your meeting planners and bookers and they're looking out six, 12 months, 18 months, is there a sense that with hong kong starting to reopen that that market is sort of trying to regain some of that share? or is that market too uncertain? and the momentum is being maintained for singapore in that business?
patrick dumont -- president and chief operating officer
so singapore is open for business. and so that means a return of leisure tourism, which we're benefiting from directly and the return of business tourism, which we're seeing in a strong way. i don't think we can draw a comparison with hong kong because access is different. so i think the way to look at it now is singapore has always been a very strong mice market.
and i think it will continue to be so because of the investment, the high-quality tourism assets, it's important as a financial center. we intend to invest behind this thesis. and so we think it's generally a very strong place to do business tourism. in terms of hong kong, i don't think we're at run rate yet to really understand sort of what that means.
there's still covid restrictions. there's still other restrictions in operation. so until those return to a more normal time, i think it's going to be hard to have any view at all.
brandt montour -- barclays -- analyst
great. thanks for the thoughts.
operator
thank you. and the next question is coming from stephen grambling from morgan stanley. stephen, your line is live.
stephen grambling -- morgan stanley -- analyst
hey, thanks for taking my questions. you mentioned the trade-up and quality of the new rooms in singapore. can you just remind us of the cadence of rooms coming out and coming in over the next couple of quarters? and also talk to the net impact from these actions split across any uplift from renovated rooms versus the older rooms and maybe even tying in headwinds from those closed? thanks.
patrick dumont -- president and chief operating officer
so we're going to have, let's call it, anywhere from 300 to 500 keys out of circulation across the next five quarters. and then the room renovation will wrap up and the tower will be fully -- the two towers will be fully ready by chinese new year '24. and actually by the end of '23. so that's sort of the cycle.
so we're going to have we're going to have not our full potential of room delivery during the next five quarters.
stephen grambling -- morgan stanley -- analyst
are you currently delineating between the new rooms in terms of pricing in the old rooms?
patrick dumont -- president and chief operating officer
there is some variability there, yeah, but it also depends on which room within the segment so that we have certain suites that are out, certain rooms that are in, depends on the time. yes, there is some differentiation. so there is a blend there.
stephen grambling -- morgan stanley -- analyst
got it. and then maybe turning to macau. the market share there in mass has been quite volatile. how would you frame how your market share may evolve in a market recovery as different segments return, as you've described in a bit of a cadence premium mass and then mass?
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
grant, do you want to have that?
grant chum -- senior vice president, global gaming strategy
sure. yeah, thanks for the question. yeah, i think it is volatile right now because the volumes are so thin. so i'm not sure looking at this quarter or even the prior quarters is particularly meaningful at this point.
but i think going forward, i think as rob referenced, we expect a strong comeback of both premium mass and mass. and i think in those segments, we're going to perform very well. obviously, there's a past history there, but also, i think looking forward, we are coming off these fantastic product investments that we've made during the pandemic with the $2.2 billion investment program that we've implemented and now coming out on the other side, pretty much completing with the london arena being the last component. so with the london arena and the grand suites at four seasons, we feel very strongly that we're going to perform very well in the market share front.
across all of these segments, not just because of the suites, speaking to the premium mass segment, but also for the mass segment, i think we'll end up with these three wonderful iconic destinations to follow on from venetian and parisian and now with the london and macau, which is already starting to gain so much traction with the people who have been able to visit and also locally as well.
stephen grambling -- morgan stanley -- analyst
got it. helpful. thanks so much.
operator
thank you. and the last question is coming in from david katz from jefferies. david, your line is live.
david katz -- jefferies -- analyst
hi, good evening everyone. if you could just talk a little bit about what you may have learned past quarter or so about the mix of revenue and recovery in macau, what should we expect? and what role does sort of vip play in all of this? and i know obviously, premium mass is the focus. but help us break down the different streams, if you can.
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
mr. chum, are you still awake?
grant chum -- senior vice president, global gaming strategy
yup, still going. yeah. i think as i referenced earlier, i think there is a mix between the business segment -- the matrix between the business segment as well as the regional breakdown. so i think if you're just looking at the business segment, then clearly, vip right now is -- has very low levels of volume, especially versus premium mass and even mass.
but part of this impact in 2022 is also the regional composition of the business where we're obviously very guangdong-dependent right now and have been for most part of this year. but i think going forward, it should be like how we've been seeing, which is the premium mass will come back first and more strongly and then followed by the mass. and this is also true if you look at the retail numbers, what we've seen is 2021 very, very significant performance in the luxury retail segment. and of course, 2022, less so.
but again, it's really impacted by that regional difference. and then going forward, yes, similar trends, we expect the luxury retail to come back first and the fastest and then you follow through with the mass retail.
operator
looks like we lost david. we did have another question come in, from ben chaiken from credit suisse. ben, your line is live.
ben chaiken -- credit suisse -- analyst
hey, how is it going? thanks for squeezing me in. just kind of want to level set as we close the year. i think we mentioned tour groups and e-visas for a few provinces in shanghai, either at the end of this month or early november. is it possible that macau could have breakeven or positive ebitda as we go into the -- in the fourth quarter? or do you think that's out of the realm of expectations? thanks.
patrick dumont -- president and chief operating officer
yeah. i think the difficulty is, we don't know. we've been in these conditions for two and a half years. we're very hopeful.
we're going to continue to invest in macau. we feel very strongly about macau's future and the opportunities that exist there for leisure and business tourism but we just don't know. so as of right now, we're just waiting patiently, and we're going through the process, and we're looking forward to the opportunity for the upcoming concession.

operator
good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the sands' fourth quarter 2022 earnings conference call. at this time, all participants have been placed on a listen-only mode. but we will open the floor for your questions and comments following the presentation. it is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to mr.
daniel briggs at sands. sir, the floor is yours.
daniel briggs -- senior vice president, investor relations
thank you, operator. joining the call today are rob goldstein, our chairman and ceo; patrick dumont, our president and coo; dr. wilfred wong, president of sands china; and grant chum, evp of asia operations, las vegas sands and coo of sands china. today's conference call will contain forward-looking statements.
we will be making those statements under the safe harbor provision of federal securities laws. the company's actual results may differ materially from the results reflected in those forward-looking statements. in addition, we will discuss non-gaap measures. reconciliations to the most comparable gaap financial measure are included in our press release.
we have posted an earnings presentation on our website. we may refer to that presentation during the call. finally, for the q&a session, we ask those with interest to please pose one question and one follow-up question, so we might allow everyone with interest the opportunity to participate. the presentation is being recorded.
i'll now turn the call over to rob. 
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you, dan, and thank you for joining our call today. a few brief comments, then we move to q&a. macao's future is bright, remains the largest integrated resort market globally. our commitment to investing in this incredible market is never wavered and with an unrivaled critical mass of world-class irs, as well as continued improvement in transportation infrastructure in the region.
macao will mature into a vibrant, diversified tourism market over the coming years. scl's positioning and scale are perfect to capture the opportunity. our diversified ir model with continuous investment in non-gaming segments, including mice, hotel suites, live entertainment, retail, food and beverage, positions us well to capture the growth opportunity. our diversity, scale, and track record in non-gaming make us uniquely positioned to cater all segments of the market, enabling macao to appeal to international tourists as well.
the new concession is a win-win. we deeply appreciate the opportunity to operate one of those gaming concessions in the next 10 years. we are excited to deploy more capital to expand non-gaming offerings at scl. the $3.8 billion commitment is just a baseline.
we hope to invest more as the market continues to grow. the commitment to develop non-gaming is the core of our investment and operating strategy for the past two decades, whether it be mice, entertainment-themed attractions or destination, sales and marketing in overseas markets. we view the investment commitments by scl and the rest of the industry is positive for macao. over the past few weeks, travel restrictions have been lifted.
it is too hard to tell the true measure of the underlying pace of recovery, but indications are extremely positive. we have seen significant improvement on property visitation, gaming volumes, retail sales and hotel occupancy. we remain positive on investments in, the londoner and four seasons. our investments position us well as the market recovers.
the quality of our new products will also help drive high-value tourism from the region, especially the overseas markets. turning to singapore, our normalized ebitda and gaming volumes are back now to the 2019 levels. normalized ebitda reached $386 million for the quarter. rolling volumes are approaching 2019 level and mass win per day is now exceeding the level of 2019.
we have also delivered strong performance in non-gaming across all segments, including retail, mall, hotel, f&b, and mice. retail is especially noteworthy with a 26% increase in tenant sales per square foot versus 2019. our suite and casino renovation program is progressing. new product will come online throughout the year.
looking ahead, marina bay sands is poised for further growth as all of our markets recover and become free of travel restrictions and airline lift continues to recover. let's move to q&a.

thank you. ladies and gentlemen, the floor is now open for questions. [operator instructions] also, we ask each participant to limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. please hold a moment while we poll for questions.
and the first question is coming from joe greff from j.p. morgan. joe, your line is live.
joe greff -- jpmorgan chase and company -- analyst
hey, everybody. good afternoon and good morning to those in macao. my first question, obviously, is going to be on macao, and rob, patrick, dan, can you remind us what levels of mass ggr either on a dollar-per-day basis or as a percentage of 2019 levels, do you need to be at in order to be ebitda breakeven? obviously, the 4q saw a [inaudible] narrowing relative to the 3q. i'm presuming and would love for you to expand on it, i'm presuming what you're seeing thus far early in january is either at ebitda breakeven or maybe more recently generating some level of positive ebitda.
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
so pessimistic, joe. we're more than breakeven.
joe greff -- jpmorgan chase and company -- analyst
am i? 
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
a lot more than breakeven, doing just fine. i'll ask patrick to give us some color on those issues, but i think we're past the breakeven. we're now in the positive territory moving toward very positive territory. patrick?
patrick dumont -- president and chief operating officer
thanks, rob. so, a couple of things to note. mix is important here. so, as you know, we're a mass and premium mass and really a large-scale tourism investment company.
and i think the key thing to note is the market is open. liquidity is in the market. this is going to be a premium-led recovery. we invested significantly during the pandemic.
and the benefit of that investment is on full display. we have new suite products. we probably have the -- what we think is the best new property we've had in a long time, opened up in macao. that investment is really showing power in the market right now today.
there's a significant non-gaming scale and investment that we've made that is bearing fruit. and so, it's great to see the recovery. it's great to see the volumes coming back. it's interesting, i think, rob has talked a lot about pent-up demand over the years.
he's witnessed it in other places earlier in his career. we saw it here in las vegas, and we experienced it fully in singapore and now we're at a run rate that is really, really strong. and i think we're seeing that in macao. i think the key thing is this is going to be a premium-led recovery.
in terms of breakeven, i don't think that's really a consideration anymore. i think we're way past it.
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. joe, i think we can be confident, be very honest and direct. we are in very positive territory and keep moving upside. i think the one thing i would say to you is that no one ever questions the power of the base mass market.
i would remind you i was looking at our numbers, base mass in macao in our building costs about 1,500 hong kong per hand as an opening bet. so, it's a couple of hundred bucks a hand usd. that's the base mass business. the problem we have right now is you can't get a seat in the games in our buildings.
we're running 95%, 100% occupancy in those games. and the same applies to slot etgs. the big question everyone's thinking about obviously is premium mass. and i think you'll be pleasantly surprised when you can see the numbers coming out of the premium mass.
and you'll see the liquidity, you'll see resilience in that segment. and it's been a very pleasant surprise. grant, can you add some color to that?
grant chum -- senior vice president, global gaming strategy
sure. good morning, everyone. good afternoon. yeah.
i think the key thing we're seeing right now is that the quality of patronage is very high across all segments. so, it's not just premium mass, it's also the base mass, it's in the retail segment. so, we are seeing a very strong recovery in spend per customer. and again, that's not concentrated in any one segment.
it's extremely broad based. and i think what you're seeing in the public numbers on presentation were recovered. i think for cny against 2019, we're about 40% of where we were in 2019, chinese new year for the first three days. and we're seeing revenues and volumes outperforming that visitation recovery, which is natural, which is what we've seen in other markets.
so, things are looking extremely positive right now.
joe greff -- jpmorgan chase and company -- analyst
great color, guys. thank you. and then maybe switching over to singapore for my follow-up question. obviously, your comments on mass gaming, rob, obviously, very strong.
can you maybe talk a little bit about your comments that you believe on like forcing late december and thus far in january, there's been an inflection at least from the mainland chinese segment? can you give us some perspective on the relative -- i don't know if you want to look at it on a revenue or ebitda contribution looking at 2019 levels. and then where that was sort of more recently as a percentage of the total mix?
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. i'll let patrick -- you want to address that?
patrick dumont -- president and chief operating officer
yeah, sure. i think the important thing to note is that there was this pent-up demand story in singapore and now it's blossomed into full-on bonanza. and so, what we're really seeing is every segment is working. and so we had a lot of noise in this quarter because of the hold.
we rolled north of $7 billion, which is pretty unbelievable considering where we came from. and the mass play was very, very strong. and so, while we were doing this, we had almost 20% of our room inventory out. and so, when you look at that 477 win number in mass and you look at the rolling volumes and realize we're out 20% of our rooms, there's a lot of legroom here.
there's a lot of room for us to go. and so i want to be careful when we talk about margins and contribution because we're going to adjust that as we change mix, as we get rooms online as we go through the innovation, as we change our suite product, as we price up, as we yield up, and as we have access to higher value tourism. so, this is really a forward-looking thing more than it is what happened in this quarter because we're going to continue to sort of adjust while we get our mix right. so, what i would look to in this business is margin expansion over time, more rooms coming online, better product, better service and, of course, being able to capture a very strong component of both vip play and mass play.
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
joe, i think we're missing -- to patrick's point, we're missing -- we're in a great place. we're back to 2000 -- we're back to 1.6 run rate if you take out the abnormal low hold on the rolling. but the two drivers that we just thought -- there's a lot of drivers, but the two jump off the page or renewed tours throughout asia and china in particular. that's yet to come.
we haven't -- we're doing all this -- we're in 2019 with no china participation and/or limited china participation. and as patrick mentioned, a handicap physical plan, we are in a very, very fortunate position with mbs. i think it's going to become a property, a lot of growth. and i believe it's going to be a $2 billion business in the future.
and i see nothing holding it back, except for our own renovations, which are extraordinary. i hope you get a chance to see it. and the reemergence of asian tourism, including china back into the property. the only regret we have is singapore.
we just like to have more capacity because -- you'll see -- i think you'll see in this year the power of -- the earning power of mbs. it's an extraordinary product, and we're lucky to have it.
joe greff -- jpmorgan chase and company -- analyst
and patrick, just back to your mix and yield comment. do we interpret that, at least if we look back to 2019, that, that china mbs patron was a -- had a positive mix on spend per trip or spend per day or gaming revenue per day?
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
i think it's a combination of factors, joe. i think, obviously, the china market is always powerful. but i also think there's cost issues in all these markets. there's these inflationary factors, undeniable, be it energy, wages -- i mean, there's a different world out there, and you've got to cope with it.
but the thing about mbs that fascinates us is we believe we can drive revenues across the board. we're going to rethink our retail, rethink our table mix, our floor, our room pricing. we think we have a product that the demand will be close to insatiable for it, from the gamer and non-gamer perspective. and we're going to overcome margin cost -- margin by overcoming costs with higher revenues, a lot higher revenues across the board in every segment.
that's the approach. we see mbs as a very unique product that's unrivaled in that part of the world. and we can just push pricing across the board, gaming pricing, adr pricing, retail pricing, f&b pricing, it's just that good and that desirable. and let's face it, the market right now is using our favor.
singapore is very desirable from a lot of perspectives.
joe greff -- jpmorgan chase and company -- analyst
great. thank you.
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you.

and the next question is coming from carlo santarelli from deutsche bank. carlo, your line is live.
carlo santarelli -- deutsche bank -- analyst
hey, everybody. good evening. rob, or whoever wants to handle this, i was just wondering, in the brief time that china has more or less reopened, have you guys seen positive or negative, any change in behavior as it pertains to patronage at mbs?
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
mbs, that's a good question. i think it's too early to say we're going to see that. i see us as getting plenty of trying of participation, both in macao and singapore. but it's really too early to say.
it just happened so quickly and the turnabout was so rapid that i think it's too hard to predict. i think the way this is going to segment though is that we're going to get more than our fair share of the rolling business in mbs. that moves in that direction, and we'll get the premium mass customer to visit more into macao. i think our business really is going to split in that direction.
i think it's very predictable what's going to happen here, and we're ok with that. so, singapore will get the top of the top. but each of those places will get tons of premium mass demand from china and throughout the region. i also think people underestimate how powerful macao can become as a desirable visitation place throughout china.
it's got everything. it's got the rooms, it's got the access, it's got the -- one thing, it has beyond singapore, it has lots of capacity and lots to offer. so, i think macao is going to be a very strong international destination ahead. we plan to be very aggressive trying to push people into macao to see the property, all of our products.
carlo santarelli -- deutsche bank -- analyst
that makes sense, rob. thank you. and then just as a follow-up, and i understand kind of looking backwards at things that are macao related is somewhat pointless in the environment that we're in right now. but it's just -- it does stand out a little bit when looking at your base and premium mass table revenues from the slide deck, your premium mass is representing, i think, 20% of 4q '19 base mass kind of more like mid-teens,16, something like that.
however, the premium mass is down considerably year over year, whereas the base mass is reasonably steady year over year. is that a whole dynamic on just lower than normal historical volumes? or is there something else that's kind of made those two diverge more recently here, and then the fourth quarter specifically? 
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
no, i think it's just a visitation issue. it's not a whole issue. its visitation is sure. i think you're going to find that washes out.
i wouldn't take those numbers too much to heart. i think when you look at q1, i wish when you see january when those numbers are out there for the market, i think it will all wash away quite nicely. it won't be -- it won't enter into your thinking, carlo. it's a nonevent.
i think you'll see a surprising strength in both those segments. i would say in macao, we're going to be very strong, very represented in the base mass because we have the capacity. we're a scale player. and so, we have the capacity in the gaming, non-gaming, retail, restaurant space to do extraordinary things in the base mass.
and again, as i'll reiterate, base mass in macao is a different animal than the u.s. it's a $200 base bet, $175 base bet. so pretty special customer. we are going to represent because of our scale.
but on the other hand, with all of our suite product, etc, i think we'll also be the leaders in the premium mass business. so, we have a very strong future ahead of us in macao. i always chuckle, people, if you're looking for a negative commentary in the macao market, you're in the rolling earnings call.
carlo santarelli -- deutsche bank -- analyst
understood. and then, rob, just quickly, if you could remind us, to the extent you guys are willing to share it, 2019, your direct vip volume, your in-house vip volume as a percentage of total, would you guys be able to share something like that?
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
we would, but we won't. 
carlo santarelli -- deutsche bank -- analyst
understood. you could, but you won't.
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
we could share it, we just won't. no, we're not going to do that. but carlo, thank you. it's good to hear from you.
carlo santarelli -- deutsche bank -- analyst

thank you. the next question is coming from stephen grambling from morgan stanley. stephen, your line is live.
stephen grambling -- morgan stanley -- analyst
hi, everyone. thanks. can you hear me ok?
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
pretty clear, stephen. go ahead.
stephen grambling -- morgan stanley -- analyst
so the visitation data for chinese near looks like hong kong has been the bigger driver in the recent uptick in visitation. is there any way to parse out recovery between hong kong and mainland china? and any reason why spending behavior and recovery may be different between these source markets?
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes. and i've got a perfect answer to that. mr. chum? 
grant chum -- senior vice president, global gaming strategy
yeah, you can see from the visitation numbers published by the tourism bureau. the mainland chinese visitation is at about 30% recovery rate versus 2019 cny. so obviously, with a 40% recovery for overall visitations, hong kong visitation recovery has been higher. mainly, i think, as a result of just the ease with which they've been able to go.
and obviously, hong kong has had a longer stabilized situation, as it relates to the pandemic. so i think from a pure visitation point of view, it's just not unexpected. and bear in mind, the transportation support for the hong kong visitor only really opened up on the eighth of january. so this has been a very rapid increase in hong kong visitations.
that said, i think we referenced back to the comments that rob made earlier and i alluded to as well, i wouldn't get too stuck on the visitation recovery. i think in these types of reopening, we're going to see the premium customers come back first. the core customer coming back as a much bigger percentage than the overall visitation. so i think what we're seeing is the quality of revenues and the patronage from all regions that visit in chinese new year has been very, very high.
so, we are way outperforming the visitation recovery in terms of volumes and revenue. and indeed, i think if you look at our property visitations our recovery rate in visitations to our own property, is far outperforming the recovery in the overall visitation numbers in the market versus 2019.
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
steve, to grant's comment just, again, we don't want to confuse visitation with ggr. there's not necessarily an easy way to make them work. i was recently in singapore, i walked in one of our retail stores with our retail person and she told me the sales in the store were like $70 million. and i said there's nobody here, no one in the store.
and she said, rob, we only need the right people, not a lot of people. i think that's what's happening in macao, we gained the right people showing up in mass, and it's reflecting in the numbers. you'll see that when the market numbers come out. i think the early adapters to the market are the right people for the market.
and i think that's why there's a confusion in the visitation versus the actual revenues.
stephen grambling -- morgan stanley -- analyst
it makes sense. and maybe as a related follow-up there, there's been a similar dynamic, stronger spend per visitor in the u.s. that ultimately drove much better margins. how are you thinking about the puts and takes to margins in macao versus what we've seen in other markets?
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
grant, margins? 
grant chum -- senior vice president, global gaming strategy
yeah. i think, first of all, our cost structure is in good shape. it's been -- unfortunately, we've had to spend extra effort in optimizing the cost structure over the past two or three years. so, we've got a very lean cost base right now.
in terms of gross margins on the revenue, i think a couple of things. one is our mix, obviously, is more favorable going forward just from a gross margin mix perspective simply because a vast majority of our revenues will be coming from the non-rolling and slot segments. and then secondly, the non-gaming, we expect to be growing, and that's obviously a much higher margin. we expect to be growing retail, hotel, f&b, actually all the non-gaming segments.
so that's the structural framework for the margin. but obviously, the actual flow-through in the percentage margin we ultimately deliver from this very positive structure is really dependent on the rate of volume recovery. so we still need the top line to recover to a certain level before you get the flow through. and then to go beyond that, obviously, we hope and we all are working toward that, is for this market to continue to grow and, hopefully, at least in the mass segments and non-gaming segments glad to go beyond where we were in 2019.
so if that happens, obviously, our margin structure should be very positive. so hopefully, that gives you a sense of how we think about the structure of margins going forward.
stephen grambling -- morgan stanley -- analyst
absolutely. thanks so much.
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks, stephen.
operator
thank you. and the next question is coming from robin farley from ubs. robin, your line is live.
robin farley -- ubs -- analyst
great. thanks. i wanted to ask, you've obviously always been very focused on the mass business there. but some of your competitors that have been more vip focused, are you seeing them do things differently now that there's not the vip market to go after in the same way there had been? is that -- is it too soon to be seeing what changes that might mean?
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
i would assume it is, but i'll defer to grant since he's on the ground. i can't imagine we have any visibility into that at this point. but clearly, we have a new market here, which favors our asset base. and our approach for the last 20 years has been scale.
as you well know, robin, it's a mass story with premium mass and retail commencing, etc. so, we don't have things like -- it's tailor-made for what we do, this environment. our competitors will adapt and have to change. but i don't know.
grant, any color on that?
grant chum -- senior vice president, global gaming strategy
yeah. i think, robin, the competition for premium mass has always been very intense. and i think we'll continue to be, given the dynamics you just referenced. but at the same time, i think as rob says, we've got a footprint and scale advantage on our [inaudible] non-gaming asset facilities, i think really position us very well for all segments of mass.
and then as patrick referenced at the outset, the product that we've been developing for the last three years, especially, the london and the grand suites at four seasons, are really prime position to help us be more competitive the premium lifestyle segments up in market, as well as, i think, hopefully, to drive overall high-value tourism to macao over the coming years. and i do as to point about international tourism as well. i think our footprint combined with our new products and our traditional strength in mice, in international marketing network really positions us very well to bring those high-value guests to macao as well. 
robin farley -- ubs -- analyst
great. and then just for my follow-up question on macao. can you give us sort of a rough sense of that dollar commitment that you've made to invest over the next 10 years in macao? kind of roughly what percent of that might be new projects and what percent might be -- might kind of fall into the opex line, kind of like overseas marketing and things? just kind of capex versus opex split, just ballpark? thanks.
patrick dumont -- president and chief operating officer
yeah. sure. i think one thing that would be helpful. if you turn to page 22 in the presentation, you'll see some details on that.
so it might be best to refer to those pages because we do break it out, and there are several pages behind it that explain what our concession renewal commitments actually are. so, it's there in the presentation.
robin farley -- ubs -- analyst
it's always tough to get through all of your slides before the earnings call.
patrick dumont -- president and chief operating officer
i apologize. i think the key thing here is that we're very committed to investing in the macao market. we think this investment will drive additional long-term tourism value and diversification of macao's economy. we're very excited to make these investments, and we think these are things that will really help achieve our goals in the goals of the government.
so, we're looking forward to it actually.

thank you. the next question is coming from shaun kelley from bank of america. shaun, your line is live.
shaun kelley -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
hi. good afternoon. good morning, grant. so just high level, as you kind of look through kind of what you're seeing probably real time, could you give us just your latest thoughts on maybe the pace of recovery here? do you expect things to be pretty linear or any chance of whether it's covid or restriction-related setbacks or anything else that could change what you're seeing on the ground? and obviously, chinese new year is fantastic.
but it would seem like the opening here is just going to continue. any reason that, that would be kind of different from the reality? or how are you seeing your bookings shape up and the patterns you're expecting to see over the next couple of months?
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
i'd begin by saying, first of all, we're just thrilled to be open and making money and seeing demand like we're seeing. i don't think any of us have the aptitude or the insight to tell you what's going to happen -- they have post-change news. but i do think longer term, you have to have real strong confidence. and you see -- when you get to see these numbers that we are seeing that this is a market that's going to rebound.
this market has a strong base mass, premium mass. and some of the fears be in the market about, it was liquidity like, what's resiliency, i think those fears will be pushed to the side. what's the trajectory and how fast it happens? i don't think any of us have the gumption to make venture a guess. i think it would be silly.
we just feel fortunate we're open. we're operating. we think it keeps getting better, not worse. i don't believe covid is going to be -- obviously, china has gone through a different trajectory than we did here in the u.s.
but hopefully, that won't be a problem. again, i don't want to speak anything that i can't speak for. but if things keep going like they're going, we'll all be in a very happy place in 2023, especially, i think, somewhere in the second half of the year. as normal travel patterns resume, hong kong gets back on speed, mainland china.
i think there's a lot of growth potential and a lot of good thoughts coming our way vis-a-vis the future. we are -- again, as i said earlier, we're not going to tell you that we don't believe in this -- we believe in this story very strongly. we believe in our assets very strongly. we believe in international tourism in macao very strongly.
so, we're not going to predict when it happens, how it happens, how fast it happens. but we feel very positive about what's going to happen in macao in the long term, very positive. and we're looking to investing money in there and getting back to where we were in the past in macao. we couldn't be more positive in macao long term. 
shaun kelley -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
great. thanks for that, rob. and then maybe a little bit more specific one for grant, if i may. but just wanting to dig in a little bit more on the labor and staffing side of what you're seeing in macao right now.
you talked about the margin structure high level. but are you fully expecting to return to levels of staff that you had pre-covid? are you already there? will it be even above those levels? kind of what's needed and what have you optimized? i know those people have -- many of them have found employment elsewhere, the market has grown since where we started. so, kind of how do you think about maybe either ftes or overall operating expense run rates relative to 2019?
grant chum -- senior vice president, global gaming strategy
i think, shaun, we've also become more productive and efficient through the past couple of years. so, i think we'll have to rethink -- it wouldn't necessarily be referencing exactly back to 2019. and also, a mix of product has also changed quite a bit through the londoner. we do have more high-quality non-gaming asset base to operate as well.
so, to give you a bit more color, today, we are short of manpower relative to full operating capacity and relative to the demand that we're seeing. so, we're not operating one of the sheraton towers as we speak. so, we are minus 2,200 rooms from our operating capacity. and our [inaudible] hotel londoner court, which we soft opened in the past year, we're not at the full operating capacity for that high-end all-suite hotel.
we're still only about two-thirds of the way through in terms of ability of manpower to operate the whole hotel. so, both at the top end and at the mass end, we are still short of manpower to operate at full capacity. and we'll be progressively hiring to fill the gaps as we go through the recovery. and hopefully, within the next few months, we're going to be in a better place relative to our full operating potential because we clearly see the demand pattern, i think is going to urge the whole industry to staff up and to be able to operate, especially for these peak periods.
and that's another part. we have no crystal ball as rob says served on the post-cny. but clearly, the early indications of metrics like the demand for the hotels is telling you that, yes, the demand is staging a strong recovery. and obviously, we're going to have [inaudible]

thank you. the next question is coming from chad beynon from macquarie. chad, your line is live. 
chad beynon -- macquarie group -- analyst
hi, afternoon, and thanks for taking my question. in the slide deck, you highlighted principal areas of development being macao, which we just talked about, singapore, which we talked about, and new york, which i was wondering if you could elaborate a little bit more on. but second part of that question is, i know in the past, you talked about other potential opportunities in asia like a korea or a thailand, years ago we talked about japan. wondering if those are going quiet at this time.
so, i guess, firstly, on new york, and then secondly, potential asian opportunities? thanks. 
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
chad, let's revert your mind, i'll reverse it just. i think we all know that thailand has been discussions there, and we're certainly looking at thailand. and that's no secret has been in the press that thailand is a possibility. so, we're certainly looking hard at thailand.
i would love to be -- have a presence there in the future. japan, as you referenced, is not there. and korea is nothing viable to speak of today. so we'll jump to new york, which is an extraordinary and unique opportunity.
and i think for the winning bidder or bidders, it's going to be an amazing opportunity because of a very simple dynamic of a huge market with limited capacity. there's only a few casinos there. it's probably the only place in the u.s. where you can have millions and millions of people, and yet there'll be probably just a handful of casinos total.
the win per units there will be exceptional. the lucky winner is going to do very, very well. i think the evidence of the market is clear just by looking at the three operating properties under the table games. and we really don't have much of a -- it's not a great product right now in new york as far as room capacity.
it's still doing approaching $2 billion with just slot machines. so our approach is very much in lvs, it's anchored by an ldh historical approach, which is scale and quality. we're not looking to build a casino, looking to build not a regional casino but rather a truly large hotel with spa convention space, dozens of restaurants, a new theater, a huge entertainment feature, a transformational product, which will positively impact the community and grow tourism a powerful statement. we're not looking to be in this thing in a limited way.
we'll be all the way in. and we think if we do it, it will be transformational for the county we're working in, very good for the people in the county and something they can be very proud of. and it will drive tourism -- outsized tourism into nassau. our bid is very much traditional on the thinking of lvs large-scale with numerous non-gaming assets, lots of meeting space, probably 400,000 square per foot new space.
so, i view new york very much very unique to the rest of the united states. it's not -- it's a population in the many millions to just a couple of casinos, very different here in las vegas. we've got a huge local market but dozens and dozens and dozens of casinos. there you'll be basically alone.
and so it's going to be very -- it's an exceptional opportunity. it won't come along again. i think this is one and done. so we're trying very hard.
and we've been trying to do new york for a number of years, but it looks like this is finally someone's opportunity. hopefully, it's ours.
chad beynon -- macquarie group -- analyst
thank you very much, rob. and then secondly, i just wanted to ask another one on macao, now that you've had some more data in the market, grant. it seems like there's an even bigger shift toward peninsula -- or i'm sorry, versus to cotai versus peninsula than we've seen in the past. i was wondering if you could confirm that or if that's really just kind of a mix of a reflection of what we're seeing from the different modes of transportation.
wondering if that's a trend that could continue in '23. and then related to that, how are you thinking about your asset and the peninsula there's capex opportunities? i know that's not part of the big capex plan. thank you.
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
grant? 
grant chum -- senior vice president, global gaming strategy
sure. rob, should i take that? yeah. yes. i think i haven't seen any data on the split between cotai and peninsula.
however, it stands to reason, i think, structurally, we see -- and we have always said that cotai will become the primary hub. and i think even pre-covid, we were already more than half of the mass revenues from cotai. and i think that trend will continue. i think there's a lot of different reasons.
but i think at its heart, the main reason is just the cluster of world-class integrated resorts that you have on cotai. and what this, i think, next generation of these lifestyle consumers are looking for from macao as a destination, and all of the investments in non-gaming that are going into basically making these results even more desirable over the next 10 years, all of those structural factors are surely will continue to push the balance of revenues toward the cotai side, and that's a structural issue that will continue to evolve over the long time. as regards to -- we obviously have one asset on the peninsula, we do intend to reinvest in that asset. but it clearly the majority -- the vast majority of our capital will still be going toward our cotai properties.
chad beynon -- macquarie group -- analyst

thank you. the next question is coming from brandt montour from barclays. brandt, your line is live.
brandt montour -- barclays -- analyst
hey, everybody, good morning. thanks for taking my questions. starting on singapore. i was curious if you could compare the spend per visitor that you're seeing there to what we saw in las vegas in 2020 and 2021.
if that's sort of holding up in the same way, if it's -- if the curve looks different quarter over quarter. and then if you want to throw macao early days into that comparison, that would also be helpful.
patrick dumont -- president and chief operating officer
yeah. i think it's really hard to compare between markets. the key thing to note is that it's really all about pent-up demand, consumer tourism experience, and the products that we offer. and sort of the nature of those assets for high-quality tourism.
so it's not really fair to compare between markets. the price points are different, the consumer behaviors are different. it really doesn't look the same. what is thematically similar is the pent-up demand story.
and rob -- as i said before, rob's seen it in his career in other locations. we experienced this here in las vegas in a very strong way. we saw it in singapore in a very strong way, and it's still in effect and we're starting to see them in macao now and it's coming on strong. so i think it's really the nature of consumer behavior as opposed to the specific price points in each market.
brandt montour -- barclays -- analyst
ok, that's great.

it's [inaudible] to patrick's point, think about what singapore is market ggr versus macao, macao could be a $25 billion, $30 billion ggr market has been higher historically. and singapore just doesn't have the capacity. and then las vegas is much more of a -- it's got a gaming component, it's got a very strong non-gaming. so it's almost impossible to apples-to-apples.
the driving force is the scale of people in macao in singapore -- in mainland china, the accessibility to adjustable market is so huge in macao. and so, the product offering. to grant's point, the peninsula, versus the cotai, it's got such enormous capacity and great product. it's hard to -- that market is so outsized when it is just back at full capacity, it's hard to compare than anything.
it's so powerful.
brandt montour -- barclays -- analyst
ok. ok. thanks for that. and then on slide 22, the long-term commitments in macao slide, on the capital, the left side of the slide, i was curious, looking at your plans for the next 10 years if you think you're going to be able to achieve return levels commensurate to recent projects that you've done in that market and you've enjoyed in that market?
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah, we sure do. we forget, we -- you're talking to a bunch of people have been doing business in the count for 20 years, and we've seen the returns. we've seen what non-gaming can do. our theaters, our retail, our entertainment has driven billions and billions and billions of dollars of ebitda, and they will in the future as well.
we have no concerns whatsoever about investing and getting a solid return on non-gaming commitments. all they do is drive more visitation to the market. they are additives to the market, certainly going to drive more business right now. we look at this as a 10-year starting commitment and going beyond that.
our commitment to macao is as long as we can be there. and so, we have no hesitation to invest or show the market a very, very considerable return. just look we've done in the past. i mean, on our current assets, mostly non-gaming.
the lion's share of our investment in macao is non-gaming, the great majority. it's worked out pretty well for us. so we think next 10 years, we'll continue that trend, and we're very happy and very committed to macao.
brandt montour -- barclays -- analyst
excellent. thanks so much, everyone.
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
thank you. the next question is coming from ben chaiken from credit suisse. ben, your line is live.
ben chaiken -- credit suisse -- analyst
hey, how's it going? just a quick one for me. historically, capital return has been really important to you guys. obviously, macao is just beginning to ramp, and there's a lot of areas to invest. but how are you thinking about the dividend these days? is that still important? and if so, how should we think about timing of that?
patrick dumont -- president and chief operating officer
if sheldon were here, he would say, yay, dividends. [technical difficulty] i think someone put us on hold in macao.
daniel briggs -- senior vice president, investor relations
sorry about that. 
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
brief commercial from macao. 
patrick dumont -- president and chief operating officer
so as i was saying, if sheldon were here, and we miss him dearly, he would be saying, yay, dividends. i think las vegas sands is a growth company. we're back to growth. we're a development company.
we do large-scale developments in key markets. but most importantly, we're also returning capital company. and i think as our business returns and as we see normalization of cash flows, we're going to look to start the dividend again and be very shareholder friendly. but at the end of the day, we're very focused on the strength of our balance sheet of new development.
and you heard rob talk about new york, it's very exciting. there are other things that hopefully we'll get a chance to do in the near term. and opportunistically, i think we'll continue to deploy capital where the highest returns are. and as part of that, the dividend will be fundamental to our shareholder return strategy.
but i think we're going to wait and see where operating cash flow ends up and we'll make some assessments at that point.
ben chaiken -- credit suisse -- analyst
got it. thank you.
patrick dumont -- president and chief operating officer
thanks, ben.
operator
thank you. and the next question is coming from steve wieczynski from stifel. steve, your line is live.
steve wieczynski -- stifel financial corp -- analyst
guys, good afternoon. so, rob or whoever wants to take this, i mean, if we look at visitation in macao over the last, let's call it, week or so around the start of chinese new year, it does seem like it has been pretty strong. and i guess, is there any commentary or color you could give us about the spending patterns of these folks that are coming to the market? meaning, are these folks gambling as much as they did before? or is that some of that spending being pushed more into the non-gaming side of the floor? and maybe it's just too early to tell. but i think with how high chinese savings levels are right now.
i'm just wondering if you can provide any color around that.
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes. yes. yes. they're spending in retail, they're spending in gambling, they're spending, as we referenced earlier, steve, it's just the right customers showing up.
and i think this is historically how it's worked out in the recoveries where those who are the most aggressive gamers and retail spenders show up first. and we're seeing that strongly in macao. it's a very good audience, a very strong audience. you'll see the market numbers then come out.
it's really gratifying for those of us who wait along terrible three years to see these days return, and they returned. and i think the real question is these customers that are now the question is, how many more are coming behind them? because to your point, visitation has been mediocre out of mainland china, relative to what had been previously. we're not even there. we're getting some pretty big numbers coming out of macao in the market.
so, we're very enthused about it. i don't think -- it's not necessarily choosing gaming or retail, i think they're doing both, and then they're eating and shopping and funding everything. so -- it's very typical of these recovery situations where the people who wanted most to shop there and they're buying their spending enjoying life again. i think the chinese are no different from the americans who came to the u.s.
markets and enjoy themselves. and hopefully, a party continues is just getting started, and we've got a very encouraging start to this reopening after the last three years. grant, do you want to add some color to that, any issues you can raise that i haven't?
grant chum -- senior vice president, global gaming strategy
no, i think it's just as you said. the nature of these reopenings, it will attract high-quality customers first, and that's what we're seeing. and i think we saw that in singapore in april as well. we had a much stronger recovery in the southeast asian overseas spend in singapore versus the recovery in the tourist arrivals.
and i think macao has also followed something similar, except for the fact macao has a much bigger advantage in being able to support visitation, not just by international airlift, regional airlift, but also by land and sea as well and domestic airlift then connecting through the southern china as well. so, i think it's -- let's see how -- what the pace of visitation recoveries like versus the revenue recovery. but so far, i think the pattern that we've seen in cny does support that pattern. yes, you're getting a much stronger revenue.
i think you are in visitation.
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
i think that last comment of grant's, that's a great one, in that this is on the air-dependent market like singapore. you'll need the airlines. you can come other ways, access to macao is mostly vehicular or both. so, i think it's a huge advantage for macao that as the population conquers, the virus situation gets more confident, there's nothing to -- no impediments to massive growth in visitation coming to macao from china.
that's a very positive point. but steve, look, we just -- we are pleased we're seeing and they're spending in every direction. so, we very -- we feel very fortunate. hopefully, it just continues to ramp up from here.
steve wieczynski -- stifel financial corp -- analyst
that's great color. that's it for me, guys. really appreciate it.
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you as always.
grant chum -- senior vice president, global gaming strategy
thanks.
operator
thank you. the next question is coming from david katz from jefferies.
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
hi, david.
unknown speaker
hi, this is cassandra on behalf of david. happy chinese new year to everyone. yes. i think a lot of my questions have been answered already, so i hope it's not getting repetitive.
you've mentioned cost issues in all markets, especially in energy wages. so, could you discuss to what extent are those permanent? and where we might be running in terms of ebitda versus 2019 level today?
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
we're not going to discuss ebitda at this point, except for what you've seen in singapore. i do think energy is a vast thing. it does vastly. it doesn't go one way, as you well know, whereas wages, i think, worldwide are going to be an issue for everybody.
and i think we'll deal with that. they're not -- i don't see them coming down a whole lot. again, our resorts and our capacity constrained ability to price up -- the rating at our business is you can price up and retain your margins. that, i think, will be our strategy in singapore and also in macao.
i don't think wages are going to decline greatly. i think grant alluded to efficiencies, and then that's important. we have a large workforce, in the tens of thousands, in macao. so more efficient and better doing what we do, that should be helpful.
but i think we're all going to live with at this point in the u.s. and asia, higher wages appear to be in the structure for now. patrick?
patrick dumont -- president and chief operating officer
i think the key thing is that by the nature of our business, we have resiliency in the face of inflation. as rob mentioned, we have a lot of flexible pricing, hotel rooms, gaming pricing, the way we operate food and beverage, that we operate all of our non-gaming amenities. these are not long-term contracts. we have the ability to go with the market.
so, while there are some structural increases around wages, around inputs that we use, at the same time, we have the ability to price because of the unique nature of our products the experiences we offer to be fair to the positioning of the products that we have. we've invested a lot over many years in both markets, the reason why they're so strong. so, in our mind, inflation is a real thing. we have to take into account that we have the ability to work through it and actually grow the margins of our business over time.
unknown speaker
great. thank you. and shifting to new york, how do you share or disclose publicly what kind of investments you expect to make if you win the gaming license versus if you don't?
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah, the current thought in our heads is about $4 billion to $5 billion. again, this is not a regional casino. this is a full-blown resort. with mice, entertainment, retail, restaurants, it's the real thing.
it's not meant to be a small-time investment. we're going all the way in and building something transformational that drives tourism. and we think will be the biggest, in terms of the casino business will be the biggest revenue generator.
unknown speaker
great. thank you so much for taking my questions.
rob goldstein -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you. appreciate it.
operator
thank you. and the last question today will be coming from dan politzer from wells fargo. dan, your line is live.
dan politzer -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
hey, good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for squeezing me in. i guess, first on macao. i know vip was historically about a quarter of your total business. i mean, to what extent, if any, have you seen this customer return and in what form has it been more of a credit, a direct vip type customer? or is this customer showing up in premium mass?
patrick dumont -- president and chief operating officer
so one thing to note is the vip contribution was much lower than that. so, let's call it, high single digits, low double digits historically. we've always been mass and premium mass driven. so, it's -- on a contribution basis because the margins in premium and vip and, to be fair, junket business, were always structurally much different than they were for our mass business.
so we've always been led on a contribution basis by our mass play and our premium mass play. and you can tell that by our asset base and how we speak to our customers and the type of tourism we attract. that being said, i do want to turn it over to grant for some additional comments.
grant chum -- senior vice president, global gaming strategy
thanks, patrick. not a lot to add. i mean, all of our rolling business currently is in the premium direct program. and i think the second point is premium mass is recovering much, much faster than premium direct.
i think that's what we're seeing right now.
dan politzer -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
got it. and then just a follow-up on the new york investment, the $4 billion to $5 billion you mentioned, i mean, is there -- should we expect a commensurate return on that type of project that you've seen in your asia-based investments or given the high-density population, the spend curve per unit, is it reasonable to think that there could actually be upside to that kind of 20% historical return?
patrick dumont -- president and chief operating officer
i think for us, we're very focused on return on invested capital. so, rob and the rest of the team really looks everywhere that we can to try to best deploy capital in the highest return outcomes. and so, we would be interested in new york, if we didn't think the returns were there. we think it's a very strong potential opportunity.
and for us, it's going to be about the jobs we create, about the tourism we drive about the investment in the local community, the relationships that we have. in every market that we're in, we're typically the largest trade partner with small and medium enterprises. we're looking to develop deep community routes, so we can support the community and really show this industry is something that can benefit everyone. so, we're very excited about it.
we think the returns are there. otherwise, we wouldn't be interested.
dan politzer -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
got it. thanks so much.
