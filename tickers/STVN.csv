lisa miles -- head of investor relations
good morning, and thank you for joining us. with me today is franco stevanato, executive chairman; franco moro, chief executive officer and chief operating officer; and marco dal lago, chief financial officer. i'd like to remind everyone that a number of statements being made today will be forward-looking in nature. please remember that such statements are only predictions.

franco stevanato -- executive chairman
thank you, lisa. we are pleased with another successful quarter. our strong financial results reinforce the solid fundamentals of our business, the long-term demand and our leading position in growing markets. we remain focused on delivering our integrated end-to-end product portfolio, supported by our scientific analytical process and service .
all of which are designed to meet the rise in need of our customers across the entire drug life cycle from preclinical to commercialization. we continue to make progress toward: growing our industrial footprint to meet the demand for our high-value solution as a customer and move up the value chain; investing in research and development to maintain and accelerate our market-leading position to increase the pipeline of our proprietary solutions like alba, nexa, and our drug delivery system; expanding geographically in u.s. and china; and building a multiyear pipeline of opportunity heavily weighted in the growing biologic market. we are investing in the business to deliver sustainable organic growth that we believe will drive increased shareholder value.
before i hand the call over to franco, i want to thank you, all of our employees, for their extraordinary efforts over the last 18 months. the remarkable work during a global pandemic help ensured business continuity, support our customers and grow our business. so in the third quarter, we awarded a eur 6.7 million discretionary bonus to employees as a thank you. 
franco moro -- chief executive officer and chief operating officer
thanks, franco. our third quarter featured over delivery on the top line, thanks to strong sales for both segments and better-than-expected results from the engineering segment. this gives us confidence to raise our full year revenue guidance for 2021 and the bottom end of the ranges for adjusted diluted eps and adjusted ebitda. for the third quarter, we had a strong order intake of eur 310 million, and the backlog of committed orders totaling eur 834 million.
we believe that the strength of our results and robust backlog are indicative of favorable customer demand and the growing markets in which we operate. the positive momentum in new order intake and backlog set the stage for fiscal 2022 and beyond. an important pillar to our long-term strategic plan is responding to rising demand for our high-value solutions. in the third quarter, high-value solutions represented approximately 23% of total company revenue.
based on high visibility of our backlog, we expect an increase in revenue from high-value solutions in the fourth quarter. the trajectory for how high-value solution is unchanged from the 2021 forecast, we previously provided. we still expect that it will contribute approximately eur 205 million to eur 210 million for the full year 2021. let's turn our attention to strategic investments in capacity building.
the expansion of our footprint in the united states marks an important step in boosting our presence in one of the fastest-growing markets. we broke ground in indiana, and we are recruiting, hiring and training for key managerial positions. we expect that construction will last approximately 18 months, followed by start-up and validation in 2023, with revenue generation sometime between late 2023 and early 2024. the plant is designed to expand production for our ez-fill pre-fillable vials and syringes.
this meets the stringent quality and performance requirements needed for biologics and high-value treatments. this product offers significant benefits to customers by reducing time to market, lowering risk, and most importantly, reducing the overall total cost of ownership. the ez-fill hub strengthens our presence in this important region where we expect to support customers from design and development through commercialization. the new facility will also house our north american engineering after sales support services.
this heads to our existing manufacturing facility in california. and our boston-based technology excellence center that provides vital scientific and analytical support to customers. at the same time, we are expanding our production facilities in italy. thanks to our current efforts that started in 2016, we have been able to meet increased demand and drive double-digit revenue growth.
we recently operationalized two new lines tied to high-value solutions in our italian facility. the first is dedicated to ez-fill syringes and the second to premium ez-fill vials. as we approach 2022, we are trying to maximize production of high-value products through continuing expansion and optimization of our industrial footprint. construction is well underway on a new building in italy where we are having new glass forming lines to boost ez-fill capacity.
this includes the planned addition of two new lines devoted to ez-fill syringes and one dedicated line for premium alba syringes. these efforts aim to meet the increasing growth and demand for premium products. we expect that this will have a significantly boost production output and bridge capacity demands while the u.s. and china projects are underway.
our ongoing investment will let us benefit from sector demand trends as customers bring new treatment to market that require products which are further up the value chain. our integrated end-to-end solution, coupled with our high growth, high-value solutions are important elements to creating and driving shareholder value. during the last couple of months, there has been much discussion of constraints on global supply chains. to date, we have not experienced significant supply chain issues, but we have taken precautionary steps to increase the amount of raw materials on hand.
and in some cases, we are keeping more inventory available. in the short term, logistical costs have created some temporary pressure on our cost structure, which has been partially offset by recent operational efficiencies. dealing with the rising input cost is a near-term challenge that we are managing carefully. we're in contact with customer, are negotiating individually.
in general, our long-term contracts include the cost escalation clauses that allow us to pass on certain cost increases. this is done regularly, and we adjust our pricing accordingly. the reality is that no one is immune to these pressures, and this creates an environment where price increases are largely expected by our customers. we are actively monitoring the situation and we will continue to manage our operations diligently in this dynamic environment.
when the pandemic continues to dominate frontline, covid remains a tailwind to our business. we are currently working with customers as they consider a future transition to single-dose vaccine formats. we can support any mode of distribution whether it is a single-dose vial or syringe. in fact, today, we are already supplying single-dose syringes for covid vaccines in addition to a range of multi-dose vials around the world.
recent use of a pill for treat covid and the first onset of symptoms is a welcome development. we know that prevention and care are the hallmarks of a good healthcare system and keeping people healthy. we believe that covid vaccine and oral treatment will play complementary roles in managing the pandemic. the relationship will be comparable to that of a flu vaccine and tamiflu.
the key takeaway according to most health expert is that the pill is expected to supplement, not to replace the current covid vaccination effort. even without contribution from covid, we achieved robust double-digit growth in the third quarter. we believe that our existing foothold coupled with our successful track record in supporting vaccine rollout keep us squarely positioned to remain a top player in the overall vaccine market. in summary, our third quarter was highlighted by strong sales, solid order intake, and robust backlog, and continued progress of our investments, innovation and capacity expansion plans.
we operate in growing markets, and we will continue to meet the demand expectation of our clients. with another good quarter of financial operating results behind us, we are pleased with the trajectory of our business and the foundation for the future. i will hand the call over to marco to discuss our third quarter results in more detail. 
marco dal lago -- chief financial officer
thanks, franco. we are pleased with delivering solid third quarter results and raising our revenue guidance for the year. for the third quarter, revenue increased 37% to eur 214.5 million, driven by strong growth in both segments. as a leading player in vaccine, we are proud to support the fight against covid.
as expected, approximately 16% of consolidated revenue in the third quarter was linked to this ongoing tailwind. the solid fundamental of our business and the robust demand for our core products helped us deliver 25% year-over-year growth, excluding covid. for the third quarter, revenue from high-value solutions grew 29% on an absolute basis and represented approximately 23% of consolidated revenue. this was lower by one percentage point compared to the prior year period due in part to total company revenue increasing more rapidly than anticipated.
as franco noted, we currently expect revenue to increase from high-value solution and then improve mix. while we may experience normal quarterly fluctuation in mix, we still believe that our long-term growth trajectory of double-digit organic growth. the shift to high-value solution and expanding ebitda margin remains the same.  total company gross profit increased 34% to eur 63.3 million despite higher sales from engineering segment, which has a lower margin. as a result, gross profit margin was 29.5%.
employee recognition reward is an important part of the stevanato culture, and we awarded a eur 6.7 million discretionary out-of-cycle bonus to employees for their extraordinary effort. the bonus was already included in our full year guidance that we provided last quarter. this was the primary reason for lower operating profit margin, diluted earnings per share and ebitda margin in the quarter. this resulted in a net profit of eur 18.6 million or eur 0.07 diluted earnings per share on a gaap basis.
as noted in a reconciliation table of this morning press release and adjusting for certain items in the third quarter, adjusted operating profit margin was 17%. adjusted net profit totaled eur 26.4 million or eur 0.10 adjusted diluted earnings per share. and adjusted ebitda margin was 24%. moving on to segment results, starting from biopharmaceutical and diagnostic solutions segment.
third quarter revenue increased 31% to eur 172.8 million compared to the prior year. revenue growth was driven by a 29% increase in high-value solutions, and a 32% increase in other containment delivery solution over the same period last year. third quarter gross profit margin of 31.2% was lower compared to prior year mostly due to product mix. this segment is expected to benefit from an increased contribution in high-value solutions in the fourth quarter.
operating profit margin of 18.1% in the third quarter was tempered by mix and the discretionary bonus. for the third quarter, adjusted operating profit margin for the bds segment was 21.3% compared to 21.2% last year. moving to the engineering segment, which delivered strong financial and operational results. for the third quarter, engineering segment revenue derived from third-party sales increased 67% to eur 41.8 million compared to the third quarter of last year.
this segment recorded strong sales from premium products in glass converting and visual inspection machines. gross profit margin for the third quarter was 15.4% compared to 11.9% in the same period last year. this also helped deliver operating profit margin of 7.1%. this includes the unfavorable impact of discretionary bonus.
for the third quarter, adjusted operating profit margin for the engineering segment increased to 9% compared to 0.6% last year. let's turn our attention to balance sheet and cash flow. our balance sheet is stronger than ever, bolstered by our primary proceeds from the ipo. during the third quarter, we raised primary net proceeds from the ipo of approximately eur 380 million.
as of september 30, we had a positive net financial position of eur 153 million and cash and cash equivalents totaled eur 428 million. for the third quarter, net cash generated from operating activities was eur 17.9 million and adversely impacted by the income tax payment of approximately eur 13.7 million and increased working capital to sustain our growth. the cash paid for capital expenditure totaled eur 28.6 million during the quarter to support our expansion plan. this resulted in a negative free cash flow of eur 9.9 million for the third quarter 2021.
we currently expect to spend less on capex in fiscal year '21 than previously forecast. this is primarily related to timing, and some of this will be realized in fiscal year '22. changes in our capital spending plans for 2021 are currently not expected to impact our expansion plans, validation timing or commercialization of new lines. in a nutshell, we believe that our cash, future generation cash from operating activities and availability under our existing debt facilities will be adequate to address future liquidity needs and capital allocation plan.
our capital allocation plan is a critical element to our long-term growth strategy. we prudently manage capital with the primary aim of driving organic growth. our top 3 priorities remain unchanged. first, investment in capacity expansion focused on growing our capacity in our high-value solution to satisfy market demand.
second, we are investing in research and development to boost our competitive advantage to drive growth in our high-value solution product set. and third, opportunistic m&a to broaden our offering, technical know-how, and international footprint. following the quarter end, the company completed two transactions as we sharpen our focus on our long-term strategic objectives. first, the company paid approximately eur 7 million to purchase the remaining 35% minority interest in denmark-based svm automatik, which specialized in assembly and packaging machines, and serialization to the pharmaceutical and copper manufacturing industries.
svm has played a meaningful role in broadening our effort in specialized assembly and packaging. second, the company entered in an agreement to sell its remaining minority interest in swissfillon, a provider of fill and finish services to the pharmaceutical and contract manufacturing industries for a net gain of approximately eur 12.3 million or eur 0.05 earning per diluted share. our adjusted guidance exclude this gain on sale. we intend to invest the net proceeds from the transaction to support our organic growth plans.
and finally, guidance. based on company's year-to-date financial results and the high level of visibility from backlog, we are increasing our revenue guidance and raising the bottom end of ranges for adjusted earnings per share and adjusted ebitda. we now expect revenue in the range of eur 825 million to eur 835 million, adjusted diluted earnings per share in the range of eur 0.45 to eur 0.47, adjusted ebitda in the range of eur 214 million to eur 217 million. and with that, let's open it up for questions.

thank you. [operator instructions] our first question today comes from paul knight of keybanc. paul, your line is open. please go ahead. 
paul knight -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
franco, could you talk about the italy expansion? it seems like these line expansions come online relatively quickly. is it due to this increased backlog? if you could talk about those expansions.
franco moro -- chief executive officer and chief operating officer
yes. nice to hear you again, paul. yes, we are bridging the capacity expansion waiting for the availability of plants in u.s. and china.
but this is something that we started with the program in the recent years. and now we are progressing according to our plan. we are meeting the demand of our customer, and this expansion will allow us to keep continuing meeting the demand. we are in line with our program.
paul knight -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
and marco, this out-of-cycle bonus, has this occurred in the prior years?
marco dal lago -- chief financial officer
well, we stated in our guidance last quarter that it is a discretionary out-of-cycle bonus to recognize the efforts done from the employees in the last 18 months.
paul knight -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
so it wouldn't necessarily be something to build into a model for future years?
marco dal lago -- chief financial officer
no. we are treating it as any -- many other positive items as nonrecurring items that overall in the year are offsetting one another. and then neutrally impacting the ebitda and adjusted ebitda level. but in the quarter, of course, we are somehow hitting the reported p&l.
but we are treating as a nonrecurring item. so this is not hitting our adjusted ebitda and adjusted operating profit.
paul knight -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
thank you. 
marco dal lago -- chief financial officer
thank you, paul.
operator
[operator instructions] our next question comes from patrick donnelly of citi. your line is open.  please go ahead. 
patrick donnelly -- citi -- analyst
hey, guys. thanks for taking the question. maybe one on the covid front. obviously, last week, we had an approval that caused some noise in the space certainly in terms of the durability of the covid tailwinds and some people's expectations.
so can you just talk through your visibility into, not only 4q but into '22 on the covid front? what your expectations are, and if last week changed anything?
franco moro -- chief executive officer and chief operating officer
yes. sure. that is an important topic, patrick. you know that we are linked to the majority of the players in the vaccine space.
so we have good visibility totally with them. we know very well that we are at the very beginning of boosters administration, and there is a lot of people around the world that are waiting for the first shot of vaccine. we see the trend to move from multi-dose vials to single-dose forms, but we are in a good position. we can deliver any form of delivery for the administration.
but at the end, you can remember that the covid is a tailwind for our business, but our business is independent from covid. so we are focused to serve the customer according to their needs. but it is our focus in expanding the high-value solution that will drive the growth of the company. 
patrick donnelly -- citi -- analyst
ok. that's helpful. and then maybe just on the 4q guide. i think it's implying more kind of mid-single-digit growth.
was there anything onetime in 4q last year that makes the comp a bit off? it's probably more for marco. i just want to talk through again that guidance, and what conservatism levels in it. and then again, if the comp had anything weird in there?
marco dal lago -- chief financial officer
yes. last year, we had a nonrecurring item in this period for about eur 2.3 million hitting the p&l and our g&a expenses, yes. it was related to an old acquisition we had done back in 2016. so we recorded as not recurring last year.
and we put some specific color in our press release about that.
lisa miles -- head of investor relations
patrick, i just want to confirm that we've answered your question. i think there was a thing that we may have missed.
patrick donnelly -- citi -- analyst
yes. it's a little more on the revenue side in terms of -- did you guys see any -- i know engineering was strong in 4q '20 last year. was there anything one-time in 4q last year in terms of the revenue? anything that got pushed into 4q last year that will make the comp a bit harder on the revenue side for this 4q?
marco dal lago -- chief financial officer
not in the generic part of the business. we recognized last year in q4, we had some important revenues related to in the injection molding project. so we recognized a big revenues in a project last year in q4, but in bds segment not in engineering. we consider it as ordinary cost of business.
thank you, patrick.
operator
our next question comes from john kreger of william blair. john, please proceed. 
john kreger -- william blair -- analyst
hey, guys good morning. at least good morning in chicago where i am. question for you. i believe in your slides, you talked about orders in the third quarter of about eur 310 million.
can you just talk about how that compared to your expectations? and what that tells you about the mix of the business in the coming year or two, either kind of covid versus non-covid or high-value solutions versus other? thanks. 
franco moro -- chief executive officer and chief operating officer
yes. a very interesting point. the driver for this increase in backlog is the strong demand that we see in the market. and this demand match exactly with our value proposition and with high-value solution that we bring to the customer.
in terms of details of our financial calendar, i'll pass over the answer to marco.
marco dal lago -- chief financial officer
yes. you are right. we are keeping on increasing our backlog. we are at eur 830 million -- eur 834 million at the end of the quarter.
we have a very strong visibility on the fourth quarter. and as franco was saying this assuming if we grow, we have a clear visibility on q4 growing in high-value solutions. so our trajectory in the medium term remains unchanged, and we are delivering according to our forecast. there could be some temporary mix effect in the quarter, but the trajectory in the medium term is definitely unchanged from our side.
john kreger -- william blair -- analyst
ok. thank you. and then a quick follow-up. in your prepared remarks, you mentioned supply chain pressures.
can you just elaborate a bit on that? where are you seeing pressure? is it raw materials or labor? is it something else? thank you. 
franco moro -- chief executive officer and chief operating officer
that's a very good topic. i like most companies we are managing through the current condition. our supply chain is robust because it delivers to multiple supplier and different facilities around all the geographies. in the meantime, we consider the situation, we have taken precautions steps, increasing the raw material on hand and keeping some more inventory.
they are not a specific topic that is under pressure, it's the overall situation that we are managing to continue to meet the customer demand.
marco dal lago -- chief financial officer
you asked for higher effect in q3. beside the mix, we were hit by some logistic costs but not in a relevant way, especially it's not material with respect to stevanato group overall numbers. but we had about eur 1 billion higher logistic costs than expected.
john kreger -- william blair -- analyst
ok. thank you. 
marco dal lago -- chief financial officer
thank you, john. 
operator
our next question comes from david windley of jefferies. david, please proceed. 
david windley -- jefferies -- analyst
hi. thanks for taking my question. good afternoon to you all. on the -- following up on john's bookings backlog question. would you be able to break that down for us in terms of what coverage you have for the fourth quarter and then in '22? and how much of the backlog stretches into '23?
marco dal lago -- chief financial officer
thank you, david, for the question. let's say, we are covered for the bottom part of the revenue range for the year with the orders we have in our backlog for 2021 and q4. and we can tell you that as a matter of fact, we have more than eur 600 million for 2022 and beyond. so we are providing the guidance for 2022 in the next earnings call, but we start from a good position for 2022.
david windley -- jefferies -- analyst
got it. thank you for that. i think you mentioned in the prepared remarks that you were, in fact, already supplying some -- i may have missed it, single-dose or low-dose format glass for covid vaccines at this stage. is that -- i understand your comments around readiness and flexibility to basically do what clients want you to do.
i guess i'm just trying to get a feel for whether single-dose formats are being manufactured for commercial distribution? or is that still kind of development and validation work? can you help us with what stage of commercialization those volumes are going to?
franco moro -- chief executive officer and chief operating officer
yes. thank you, david, for this question. as you know that we are engaged with the majority of the players. so there are different approaches, and each customer has a different strategy.
but for sure, we are delivering both the kind of form, the vial and syringes. and we are in combination phase sometime, but we have already started the commercial production for them, both of them.
david windley -- jefferies -- analyst
and if i could just tag on to that. are those high-value solutions where those clients are pulling those through for covid vaccine? is that high value? or is that also a mix of your product?
franco moro -- chief executive officer and chief operating officer
we already stated that the mix of product in covid business is representing more or less the same distribution that in the standard business, let's say. so we don't see any big significant difference.
david windley -- jefferies -- analyst
ok. thank you. 
franco moro -- chief executive officer and chief operating officer
thank you, david. 
operator
our next question comes from derik de bruin of bank of america. your line is open. derik, please go ahead. 
derik de bruin -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
hi. good day. thank you for taking my call. just -- we've gotten a lot of questions from investors on, obviously, the pfizer commentary.
and just wanting some clarity, are the contracts that you have with customers, take-or-pay contract, means they're obligated and to buy minimum volumes? and i guess, is there any way for them to renegotiate those or change them should their sales projections change?
franco moro -- chief executive officer and chief operating officer
that's a very good question. you know that each commercial agreement is negotiated individually. but in general, we embedded in this agreement also reduction or cancellation fee or minimum quantity. that is a case-by-case situation.
we don't have a general arrangement that is suitable for every customer.
derik de bruin -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
great. and then just one follow-up. on the diagnostics products in the bds segment, is there anything that's notable in terms of where you're involved in those products? meaning, are you involved in any specific covid diagnostics? is there anything on the molecular side that is growing outside? just a little bit more color on what's involved in diagnostics segment and how we should sort of think about that growth contribution in that business?
franco moro -- chief executive officer and chief operating officer
yes. the covid impact in the diagnostics space is controversial because we had some higher requests for specific diagnostics. but at the meantime, the standard treatment suffer from the slowdown of activity in the hospital. so we don't see overall a net impact in a single direction in that area.
derik de bruin -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
thank you. 
franco moro -- chief executive officer and chief operating officer
thank you, derik.
operator
[operator instructions] the next question comes from john sourbeer of ubs. john, please go ahead. 
john sourbeer -- ubs -- analyst
hi. thanks for taking my question. i was wondering just a little bit on the supply chain commentary, if you could talk a little bit on pricing and what is your ability to maybe pass through some of the increased costs on to customers?
franco moro -- chief executive officer and chief operating officer
yes. that's also an important point. but as i mentioned before, the situation is negotiated individually. but in general, we embed in agreement that closes for escalation of prices in case of increased cost, for industrial costs like logistics, raw materials, utilities.
we are monitoring carefully the evolution of cost trends and price accordingly.
john sourbeer -- ubs -- analyst
got it. and as a follow-up, maybe can you talk just a little bit about the 3q performance across the different regions in eu, u.s., and apac?
franco moro -- chief executive officer and chief operating officer
you know that we don't disclose the precise figures in different geographies, but you can have a flavor because you know that u.s. is a very strong market for us.
marco dal lago -- chief financial officer
yes. we can experience some fluctuation quarter over quarter, but the trend remain unchanged. so we are growing very, very rapidly in asia pacific. we are growing the same in north america even during this quarter, we slowed down a little bit.
but overall, those are the two markets where we expect to grow the most also based on the backlog we have in our hands. overall, we are growing in every and each area: south america, north america, europe, and especially in asia pacific, as we were saying.
john sourbeer -- ubs -- analyst
thanks for taking the question. 
marco dal lago -- chief financial officer
thank you, john.

lisa miles
good morning, and thanks for joining us. with me today is franco stevanato, executive chairman; franco moro, chief executive officer; and marco dal lago, chief financial officer. i'd like to remind everyone that a number of statements being made today will be forward-looking in nature. please remember that such statements are only predictions.
actual events and results may differ materially as a result of risks we face, including those discussed in item 3d, entitled risk factors and the company's annual report on form 20-f for the fiscal year ended december 31, 2021, filed with the sec. we encourage you to review the information contained in our earnings release today in conjunction with our associated sec filings. the company does not assume any obligation to revise or update these forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances, except as required by law. today's presentation may contain non-gaap financial information.
management uses this information in its internal analyses of results and believes this information may be informative to investors in gauging the quality of our financial performance, identifying trends in our results and providing meaningful period-to-period comparisons. for a reconciliation of the non-gaap measures presented in this document, please see the company's most recent earnings press release. and with that, i'll hand the call over to franco stevanato for opening remarks. 
franco stevanato -- executive chairman
thank you, lisa. 2021 was a landmark for stevanato group, underscored by the power of our integrated capability and value proposition. for 2021, compared to the prior year, we delivered double-digit revenue growth, excluding covid, expanding margin and increase the mix of high-value solutions as raising customer demand was measured with the first rate execution. with a successful ipo behind us, we met or exceed our full year 2021 financial performance metric despite the complexity of the current global supply chain environment.
we finished 2021 with a solid backlog and new order intake as well as a robust pipeline of new opportunity. at year-end, stevanato have more than 400 million in cash, a flexible balance sheet and ample liquidity to fund future investments in growth platform. the recently announced investment from barda illustrate our strong reputation and further confirm our strategic approach in the u.s. to invest and broaden our offering in this strategic region.
our three-year track record demonstrates consistent delivery in our financial and operational objectives. today, the fundamental of our business continues to strengthen as we steadily advance our strategic priority to capitalize on strong customer demand. amid the favorable macro trend, our integrated capability resonates with customers as we aim to drive double-digit revenue growth, increase our mix of high-value solutions, expand margins and deliver long-term shareholder value.
franco moro -- chief executive officer
thank you, franco. our successful financial and operational performance in 2021 sets the foundation for sustainable organic growth. for the full year 2021, revenue grew 27.5% over the last year, driven by growth in both segments and an increasing mix of high-value solutions. we closed the fourth quarter of 2021 with a new order intake of approximately 278.3 million euros and a committed backlog of approximately 880 million euros.
we view these key performance indicators as an important measure for our future growth prospects and represent ongoing favorable customer demand trends as new treatment come to market to tackle chronic diseases and advanced patient care. turning to slide 6. revenue from high-value solutions was strong in the fourth quarter, which have boosted the full year mix to 25% of the 2021 revenue compared to 22% last year. we expect that this trend to continue as customers choose a ready-to-use platform because they reduced customers' total cost of ownership, get treatment to market faster and increase quality and flexibility.
in 2021, we experienced a rising demand for syringes compared to last year. the increase was driven by our high performers ready-to-use syringes platform where orders doubled in 2021 and compared to the prior year. these proprietary platforms include our alba and nexa syringe products that are gaining traction. this platform ideally suited for biologic and high-sensitive drugs like monoclonal antibodies, mrna vaccines, and recombinant proteins because of their advanced technology and superior performance.
we expect this trend will continue into 2022. the evolution in our high-value solution extends beyond the primary packaging. we continue to expand our integrated capabilities in the drug delivery space of pen injectors, auto injectors and wearable pods. in january 2022, we expanded our agreement with haselmeier for our proprietary alina pen injector, granting a exclusivity to support a broader range of therapeutic areas beyond the diabetes.
we designed and developed the alina variable-dose and fixed-dose pen-injector platform, which is compatible with the established therapeutic regiments and innovative drug therapies related to diabetes. this expansion marks another important step as we continue to expand our presence and diversify the opportunities within this product family. let's turn to slide 7 of the presentation. we are excited to announce our first agreement with the u.s.
government biomedical advanced research and development authority or barda. under the agreement, barda will invest up to approximately 95 million to support an increase in manufacturing capacity in indiana for both standard and ez-fill vials. this will help strengthen the u.s. government's domestic capabilities for national defense readiness and preparedness programs for current and future public health emergencies.
we are very pleased to be selected for this important investments from barda as we build and rapidly scale our capacity in indiana to help fortify the u.s. government's pharmaceutical supply chain. turning to slide 8. the barda investment dovetails with our plan to expand our global industrial capacity to satisfy the market demand.
the build-out of our facility in indiana remains on track. we still expect that construction will continue into 2023 followed by start-up and validation, leading to revenue generation sometime between late 2023 and early 2024. in the meantime, the pace of demand has increased over the last year, particularly for our high-value solutions. in response, we are moving forward with an incremental investment in italy to further shore up our capacity until the u.s.
and china facilities are expected to go live. we believe that we have the necessary flexibility through our modular approach to incrementally add or modify capacity to match customer evolving needs. our capital investments are intended to hit a sustainable organic growth as new treatments come to market that require high-quality, high-performance solutions, further up the value chain. we believe that our integrated capabilities coupled with our high-value solutions are important elements to create and drive shareholder value.
turning to slide 9. while the pandemic continues to present the challenges to businesses around the world, we remain resolute in managing the complexity around inflation and the supply chain. we worked hard to effectively manage the impact to the business in 2021. and now we are keeping a sharp focus on inventory management, manufacturing and on-time delivery to customers.
we have been capturing cost increases and have raised the prices accordingly. we were not immune to the rapid rise of omicron variant and we experienced higher rate of absenteeism in january in some of our european facilities. and while production was temporarily slowed in january, we began returning to more normalized levels of staffing and productivity by mid to late february. we are also following the situation in the ukraine carefully and its potential business impact.
we are closely managing inflationary cost and supply chain with a high degree of discipline and perseverance. we anticipate that these headwinds will persist throughout the year. and finally, we are executing against our strategic operational priorities to capitalize on rising demand trends and support customers across the entire drug life cycle. in 2022, we remain focused on adding incremental capacity in italy in response to rising demand as customers move up the value chain.
advancing our expansion plans in the u.s. and china as we diversify our industrial footprint and enhance our proximity to customers. continuing our investment in r&d to accelerate our market-leading position and increase the pipeline of our solution, building a multiyear pipeline of opportunities heavily weighted in the biologics market, where we expect to continue to see a growing demand for our high-performance products. i now hand the call over to marco to cover the financials in more detail.
marco dal lago -- chief financial officer
thanks, franco. we are very pleased to deliver another solid quarter of financial results, which have topped our full year estimate. for the fourth quarter of 2021, revenue was better than expected and grew 12.5% to 232.6 million over the prior year. this was driven by another strong quarter from our engineering segment due in part to the ongoing capital deployment by customers to satisfy industry demand.
for the fourth quarter, covid represented approximately 14.3% of revenue. and as we mentioned on our last earnings call, the fourth quarter of 2020 included the benefit of approximately 15 million in our bds segment related to the timing of revenue, which concentrate revenue recognition in the fourth quarter, but had no impact in full year 2020 revenue. for the full year, revenue increased 27.5% to 843.9 million over last year driven by growth in both segments. as expected, covid represented approximately 14.7% of revenue for fiscal year 2021.
excluding covid, revenue grew approximately 15.2% over year 2020. please turn to slide 12. as expected, contribution from high-value solutions increased approximately 62.9% to 66.4 million in the fourth quarter compared to last year, representing approximately 28.5% of consolidated revenue. for the full year, high value solutions grew approximately 42% over last year to reach 207.8 million, bringing the full year mix to approximately 24.6% of consolidated revenue.
and while investors should anticipate quarterly fluctuations, our long-term trajectory remains unchanged with a target mix of mid-30% by 2026, contributed to the expansion of ebitda margin over the long term. moving to slide 13, the increase in more accretive high value solutions and ongoing operating efficiency gain from our lean manufacturing initiatives contributed to increased gross profit and operating profit margins. for the fourth quarter, gross profit margin increased by 310 basis points to 31.4%, while operating profit margin was up 40 basis points to 18.7% compared to last year. operating profit margin reflect increased investment in r&d mostly related to the advancement in innovation in premium products, including ez-fill platforms and bds.
this resulted in a net profit of 44.6 million or 0.17 of diluted earnings per share. as expected, the higher number of shares outstanding in 2021 impacted the quarter and the full year. adjusted net profit was 33 million and adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 18.2% to 0.13 euro. for the fourth quarter, adjusted ebitda grew 10.3% over the prior year, and adjusted ebitda margin was 25.3%.
for the full year 2021, gross profit margin increased 310 basis points to 31.4%, while operating profit margin was 19.2%. this resulted in a net profit of 144.3 million or 0.53 of diluted earnings per share. adjusted net profit for fiscal year 2021 was 120.5 million, and adjusted diluted eps grew 54.8% to 0.48 compared to last year. adjusted ebitda increased 36.3% to 218.3 million, resulting in adjusted ebitda margin of 25.9% for fiscal year 2021.
please turn to slide 14 for segment results. for the fourth quarter, bds segment revenue increased 9.3% to 185.9 million compared to the same period last year. for fiscal year '21, bds segment revenue increased 22.9% to 694 million. period-to-period segment revenue increases for both the quarter and the full year were mainly driven by growth in our core products and more importantly due to an increasing mix of accretive high value solutions.
as expected, high value solutions accounted for approximately 35.7% of bds revenue in the fourth quarter and 29.9% for the fiscal year 2021. the mix shift led to expanded margin for the segment. on a full year basis gross profit margin increased 350 basis points to 33.1%, and operating profit margin grew 330 basis points to 21.4% over the prior year. the engineering segment delivered another solid quarter of financial results.
revenue derived from third parties increased 27.2% to 46.7 million in the fourth quarter and grew 54.3% in to 149.9 million for fiscal year 2021. this segment benefited from growth in all business lines in both periods. for the full year gross profit margin was 19.3%, and operating profit margin was 10.5%. let's move to slide 15.
we have a healthy balance sheet and as of december 31, we had a positive net financial position of 189.8 million and cash and cash equivalent totaled 411 million. for the full year, capital expenditures were 122.1 million and used to support our ongoing expansion plans. for 2021, net cash generated from operating activity was 133.3 million, which reflects the increased working capital as we continue to build sustainable growth and free cash flow was 25.1 million. on slide 16, we'll drill down into the details of capital expenditures.
we finished 2021 with capex of approximately 122.1 million. this was lower than our initial expectation mostly due to timing and the shifting of spend into 2022. we estimated approximately 90 million of capex spend that was previously expected to occur in 2021 is now included in our fiscal year 2022 capex budget. as franco noted, we also anticipate some incremental expenditure as we have more capacity in italy to meet rising demand.
so together with the shift of approximately 90 million of capital expenditure into fiscal year 2022 and incremental capex for italy, we are estimating capital expenditure for 2022 will range between approximately 35% and 40% of revenue. our capital investment are vital to growing revenue, increasing our mix of high-value solutions and expanding margins all of which we believe will create and drive long-term shareholder value. therefore, our overall capital allocation plans remain unchanged. first, our no.
1 priority is investing in and executing against our ongoing capacity expansion plans to satisfy market demand and drive organic growth. second, research and development, to maintain our competitive advantages and drive innovation. and third, we may consider opportunistic m&a to broaden our offering, technical know-how and international footprint. but for now, we are squarely focused on organic growth.
in a nutshell, our balance sheet gives us the flexibility to invest in sustainable organic growth by expanding our capacity to meet the long-term demand dynamics in our core business. with a strong financial position, we believe we have ample capital to address future liquidity mix and execute our strategic and capital investment plans. moving to slide 17, guidance. the company is establishing 2022 guidance that is framed by the strength and visibility of our backlog.
for the full year 2022, we now expect revenue in the range between 935 million and 945 million, adjusted diluted eps in the range of 0.49 to 0.51, adjusted ebitda in the range of 248 million to 253 million. using the midpoint of revenue guidance, we estimate that we have approximately 75% of our forecasted revenue in the form of committed backlog. our guidance also assumes continued durability from covid, with expected revenue contribution in the mid-teens as a percentage of total revenue. our guidance also considers the temporary headwind related to inflation and supply chain.
we currently expect that revenue will be higher in the second half of fiscal year 2022 compared to the first half of the year. this aligns to our industrial plans as we continue to bring more capacity online during the course of fiscal year 2022. thank you. i will pass the call back to franco moro for closing comments.
franco moro -- chief executive officer
thanks, marco. our 2022 guidance reinforces our belief that we can continue to deliver on our long-term objectives. we have earned a reputation as a leader in premium drug packaging and engineering, serving as a vital link to the safety and effective administration of our customers' injectable treatments, diagnostic tests and therapies. we have a relentless focus on driving constant innovation in r&d, delivering high-quality products, offering scientific and technical support and meeting market demands.
we serve some of the fastest-growing market segments and we are integrated into the drug production and delivery supply chain with favorable multiyear secular tailwinds including pharmaceutical innovation, aging population with chronic conditions, growth in biologics and biosimilars, acceleration expansion of vaccination programs, self-administration of medicine and increasing quality standards and regulations. above all, we believe that our strong reputation coupled with these favorable macro trends and our high-quality suite of products position us well to benefit from continued demand and in turn, deliver double-digit revenue growth, margin expansion and long-term shareholder value. operator, let's open up the line for questions.
",":
operator
thank you. [operator instructions] our first question today comes from david windley from jefferies. your line is open.
david windley -- jefferies -- analyst
hi. good morning or good afternoon. thanks for taking my questions. i want to start with just a couple of kind of housekeeping type questions.
marco, i was hoping you could tell us what the dollar value or the percentage of revenue from your ez-fill products that you're not including in high-value solutions?
marco dal lago -- chief financial officer
yeah, we are going after actively in ez-fill. so our practice we provide data about segment in high value solution. anyhow, i can tell you that high value solution went up 42% in the year and ez-fill sales will end up more or less in the same range year over year.
david windley -- jefferies -- analyst
ok. then secondly, do you have -- you mentioned the inflation factors and the pricing that you're taking watching supply chain, things of that sort. can you quantify any kind of unexpected negative impact that the fourth quarter p&l absorbed? maybe talk about the timing of the pricing. is there any lag between the pickup on pricing versus the costs that you're incurring?
marco dal lago -- chief financial officer
yes. as anybody else in the industry, we are facing inflation pressure like any other industry. we have experienced, we mentioned in q3, some logistical cost increase. we are putting our model some other cost increase in our total manufacturing cost.
and as franco was saying, we are recalculating pricing frequently and rising price accordingly. but overall, we expect also taking out the inflation from our model and organic double-digit growth for 2022 compared to 2021.
david windley -- jefferies -- analyst
ok. and then the last question i have is around your capacity. you mentioned the shift in some of your capex spend. and i guess, first of all, i want to just confirm that that's not impacting the timing of capacity that you're bringing on.
and then kind of maybe flipping the coin and asking the question in the opposite way, does the barda investment give you any ability to accelerate the pace of buildout and validation of your indiana greenfield? thanks.
franco moro -- chief executive officer
starting from the first part of your question about the capacity, since we have our original plan for capacity expansion, the demand grew more than expected. so we took the decision to boost the capacity in italy, that is the way we can bridge waiting for the availability of a new capacity in u.s. and china. and our modular approach to investment make -- have the possibility to be reactive and responsive to match the upside in demand.
back to the second part of your question about barda. barda agreement involved a multiyear plan to expand the capacity. for sure is a sort of acceleration of part of our initial plan, but it is not for the short time.
david windley -- jefferies -- analyst
ok, thank you.
lisa miles
thanks, dave. operator, can we please have the next question.
operator
our next question comes from paul knight from keybanc. your line is open.
paul knight -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
hi. thanks for the question. could you update us on the planning on the china expansion as well? 
franco moro -- chief executive officer
yes, our plan has not changed at all. we are proceeding. as we mentioned, we spent some time to improve to optimize the capital allocation also to work on having the right appropriate financial incentives. but we are in line, in line both with starting -- designing and starting construction and hiring people, training people to get ready for the data we already mentioned that is having the first activities in the first and first revenues in first half and second half of the '24.
paul knight -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
and then it looks like covid and non-covid grew a little better than expected. is the industry moving to lower doses per vial with covid at this point, do you think?
franco moro -- chief executive officer
but there is the continuation of this trend to move from multi-dose to single dose that impact the volume needed for the market both in syringe and vial. we see opportunities in both areas because you are well aware that we produce both the syringe and vial. our synergies proved to be the right solution also for -- in terms of suitability with cold chain distribution. so we monitor these trends and there is no impact in our planning about the capacity expansion.
paul knight -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
thank you.
operator
our next question comes from derik de bruin from bank of america. please go ahead.
derik de bruin -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
hi. good afternoon. thank you for taking my question. one housekeeping question.
what's embedded in your guidance for fx in the top line?
lisa miles
derik, let me just clarify. you're wondering what the currency translation rates are that are embedded in our guidance?
derik de bruin -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
yeah, what's the head -- yeah, what should we model for currency headwinds? i'm trying to -- the question about what's the organic revenue growth guide for the total business? yes.
marco dal lago -- chief financial officer
thank you for the question, derik. we don't expect material changes compared to 2021 in our model.
derik de bruin -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
great. thank you. when you look at your business, i mean, the covid expectations you had -- you're guiding to are basically in line with where we are. i guess the question i have is like if you didn't have -- if you weren't doing covid work, is there -- would your core business -- your non-core business is even higher.
that is, are you turning away business or delaying business due to covid? do you have any covid work? is it basically trying to get to sort of like what's the underlying core demand?
franco moro -- chief executive officer
as we so many times mentioned, that our business is not covid dependent. and the visibility we have because of the backlog, interaction with customers make us a good position to look at the order intake and we have good visibility in covid revenue that we think and we believe we remain consistent also in the near term. it's harder to speculate about the future of the covid, but we feel reasonably confident that we can match any possible free capacity with threshold, because the demand is very strong in different therapeutic areas.
marco dal lago -- chief financial officer
and just to complement you mentioned the fact have visibility in our revenue in form of backlog for 75% of 2022 midpoint guidance. so again, we have clear visibility also about covid for 2022. and as franco was saying, it's obviously more difficult to speculate for 2023 and beyond.
derik de bruin -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
great. and then just one final question. high value solutions to 25% exiting kind of fiscal '21, mid-30s by '26. how should we think about that number for '22? another increment -- basically, i know it's not going to be leaner, but should we think about another 2 to 3 percentage point increase on average per year?
marco dal lago -- chief financial officer
so thank you for the question. as you noted, we were 17% range in '19, 22% in '20, and we are close to 25% in 2021. we see the trajectory going on. we have a robust backlog and visibility and we see high 20% range for 2022, consistent with our trajectory and expectation to meet with 30% by 2026.
derik de bruin -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
great. thank you very much.
operator
our next question comes from lizzie speyer from citi. your line is open.
unknown speaker -- citi -- analyst
hi. thanks for taking my question. i'm on for patrick. so i think backlog, as you touched on earlier, ramped to 880 million euros this year.
can you just talk more about how that 75% for 2022 that's covered compared to prior years?
franco moro -- chief executive officer
yeah, the backlog is much stronger this year compared to 12 months ago, where we had approximately 600 million of backlog. so we have much more visibility this year compared to 12 months ago. we see robust backlog in both segments, the percentage is more or less the same in the two segments. so we have clear visibility and ability to plan in advance.
unknown speaker -- citi -- analyst
great. thanks. that's helpful. and then, i guess, just broadly, can you talk about how you guys performed in the three regions within europe, the u.s.
and apac? and what your outlook is for these regions going into 2022?
franco moro -- chief executive officer
yeah, both regions, we are -- we have grown in asia pacific, particularly as you have seen in 2021. we expect robust growth both in asia pacific and north america regions for 2022. europe is still there, a very important market for us, but we see growing more in those regions than europe.
unknown speaker -- citi -- analyst
thank you.
operator
our next question comes from tim daley from wells fargo. your line is open.
tim daley -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
hi. thanks for the time. so my first question is digging a bit more into the booking trends and the backlog, how should we be thinking about this, i guess, the lead times and the percent of revenues that were captured in backlog heading into the year as we go forward. are you expecting some sort of normalization lead times? any sort of detail you could provide around what happens when, i guess, things start normalizing a bit more.
and how should we think about the trajectory of backlog and book-to-bills and everything throughout 2022?
franco moro -- chief executive officer
yes, great question. i mean we experienced, as mentioned a couple of times, our customers are booking in advanced capacity to secure their supply chain. and this is one of the reasons why we have been able to grow the backlog so significantly besides growing over stevanato group business. it's not easy to speculate what will going to happen in the future.
but we see, as franco was saying, very robust demand in the market. so we are not worried about filling our capacity for the future.
tim daley -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
ok. and in a similar vein there. just -- i know you noted that 75% of the sales for 2022 are captured in backlog. for the around 140 million or so euros of covid works expected per your guidance here, how much of that is captured in the backlog? or are there any assumptions baked into that 140 million euro number?
marco dal lago -- chief financial officer
yes, more or less the same percentage. i mean the 75% comment.
tim daley -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
ok. no, that's helpful. and then my final one is on margins. so obviously, lots of noise going on the macro front, especially in europe around energy prices.
what are the assumptions baked into the ebitda guidance for, i guess, energy prices? how much of your expenses this year were spent on energy? and do you have any hedging mechanisms in place to account for the macro volatility going around right now?
marco dal lago -- chief financial officer
yes, those are the costs we are talking about when we say we are frequently calculating our total manufacturing cost. again, this is a situation everybody are facing in any industry. our customers understand it. obviously, we try to minimize the cost increase, but we are increasing our price accordingly.
lisa miles
and then, tim, just to follow up on that, as marco mentioned previously, if you exclude the cost increases year to year, we still anticipate double-digit organic growth.
tim daley -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
all right. and are there any hedging mechanisms in place for energy costs?
franco moro -- chief executive officer
there is no mechanism. if not, the clauses that are embedded in generally in our agreement with the customer. but the relationship with the customer also to share the situation and we think they can really understand what is going on in market.
marco dal lago -- chief financial officer
and you probably know, an important part of our production is in italy, where we have some protection due to the long-term agreement we have with utilities here in italy.
tim daley -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
all right. great. thank you. appreciate the time.
lisa miles
thanks. and operator, next question, please.
operator
our next question comes from drew ranieri from morgan stanley. your line is open.
drew ranieri -- morgan stanley -- analyst
hi. thanks for taking the question. just on guidance for a moment. you grew 15% ex-covid in 2021.
2022 looks like it's taking a little step down. is this just modeling conservatism into your guidance? or just as you're kind of looking at the business, can you talk about maybe areas of the business where you are starting to see any type of slower growth rate relative to 2021? and then just on your commentary about phasing between the back half and first half of the year, can you give us a little bit more detail there on how the businesses should ramp over the year?
marco dal lago -- chief financial officer
thank you for the question. so for 2022, as mentioned, we expect strong sales in second half of the year compared to the first part of the year. because of the capital deployment, we are doing increasing capacity mainly in ez-fill high value solutions. we can tell you also that we expect double-digit growth in our bds segment, boosted by high value solutions.
in january, we are initially modeling a high single-digit growth compared to 2021 when we went up to almost 55%.
drew ranieri -- morgan stanley -- analyst
ok. and then just on the inflationary environment. you touched on this a little bit, but should we think gross margins are -- will be able to actually expand in 2022? or should we kind of think about it more consistent with your 2021 levels? or will high-value solutions really drive the mix shift and you'll see some pricing benefit? just trying to get a better sense of gross margin expansion here.
franco moro -- chief executive officer
but i think that there is -- in order to grow back to the driver of our growth that is the market. the market demand is growing very fast and the demand for our high-value solution is very strong particularly in syringes with our alba and nexa products, ez-fill vials also enjoy very robust demand. so this is the main driver and we are growing because we are putting our investment in that direction, deploying capital step-by-step to increase the share of our high-value solutions in our portfolio. so the marginality as a -- it is the result of this effort coming from the demand on the market.
drew ranieri -- morgan stanley -- analyst
got it. and then just lastly, just on covid-related revenue. is there any way to put out a 2023 number of kind of what you're thinking about for potential covid contribution?
marco dal lago -- chief financial officer
there are many variables playing in the forming for 2023. we mentioned that the shift from multidose to single dose that can happen, that could be from neutral to favorable from the economic point of view. we cannot speculate on the presence of new variants and there are many, many factors to be understood before providing any numbers on 2023.
drew ranieri -- morgan stanley -- analyst
understood. thanks for taking the questions.
operator
our next question comes from john sourbeer from ubs. please go ahead.
john sourbeer -- ubs -- analyst
hi. thanks for taking my question. i guess any update around new customers in the quarter with hvs growing pretty solid 63% roughly year over year. i guess specifically, what percentage of that hvs growth was from new customers?
franco moro -- chief executive officer
no. we know our result have -- we will not disclose the figures. but what i can say is that there is a very good demand for high-value solutions linked to new therapeutic and a new drugs, specifically in biotech space. so this is one of the main drivers of our emerging business in that space.
lisa miles
and john, just as a reminder, many of our contracts with our customers are under nondisclosure agreements. and so therefore, that would be the type of information that we won't be able to provide on a regular basis.
john sourbeer -- ubs -- analyst
got it. and then i guess just as a follow-up, the comment in 1q with the increased absenteeism in january in europe due to the omicron spike. any way to quantify the impact there? or just how we should see on the cadence on 1q for the guidance?
franco moro -- chief executive officer
yes. when omicron variant hit europe, also we had to face increased rate of absenteeism in our facility in europe. and we took a countermeasure in terms of having more a shift from people that were happy and we've been incentive to have people at work. we are not going to quantify the impact.
but what i can say is that mid to late february, we came back to the normalized condition in terms of staffing, in terms of productivity and we expect it to continue in the direction.
john sourbeer -- ubs -- analyst
got it. thank you for taking my question.
marco dal lago -- chief financial officer
our guidance includes this headwind.
operator
our final question comes from john kreger from william blair. please go ahead.
john kreger -- william blair -- analyst
hey. thanks very much. maybe just one more to try to clarify on the first quarter outlook. do you expect revenue growth to be positive in the first quarter compared to last year? should we assume down a bit given the omicron surge?
marco dal lago -- chief financial officer
i will expect significant growth compared to previous year in the range of double-digit growth.
john kreger -- william blair -- analyst
marco, just -- is that in the first quarter? or is that for the full year?
marco dal lago -- chief financial officer
first quarter, we expect lower revenues than in q4 in both segments. but nevertheless, we expect an organic growth double digit year over year.
john kreger -- william blair -- analyst
great. thank you. another question. it sounds like you've had strong orders.
are you capacity constrained at all? in other words, what -- how does your time to complete orders now compared to where it was, let's say, a year ago?
franco moro -- chief executive officer
first of all, the demand for how our high-value solutions has remained very, very strong. so our plan to expand the capacity in the space is obviously something that is vital. we recognize that the execution is a vital factor to match the customer expectation. and we will continue to put the data for -- to match their needs in the short-term time possible.
john kreger -- william blair -- analyst
ok. and then one last one. you noted capex is supposed to be much higher in '22. i understand part of that is a push from '21.
can you remind us what you think your longer-term capex spending ratio should be relative to revenues.
marco dal lago -- chief financial officer
yeah. 2022 is expected to be the peak year for capex because of the initiative we launched. we expect also high capex in '23 as we complete the buildings and the machinery for u.s., europe and china. as normalized capex, we see for the future something in the range of 9% of revenue to keep on growing double digit.
we can expect on a year where we are installing more capacity to follow it by years when we leverage the existing capacity and we can just concentrate on driving execution. but this is what we have in mind in the medium term as normalized level of capex.
john kreger -- william blair -- analyst
ok, thank you.
lisa miles
thanks, john.

thank you, lisa. we are pleased to post another quarter of strong financial result as we foster a track record of consistent performance. our management team is executing against our multiyear strategic plan to drive sustainable organic growth and increased adoption of high-value solution as we aim to expand ebitda margin over the long term. we are building upon an already solid foundation guided by our philosophy that the customer and patient are at the heart of everything we do.
our focus on science and technology, together with our history of pioneering a new trends to enhance the integrity of medicine, has helped us to became one of the global leader of integrated capability in the primary packaging space. in fact, sanofi, one of our top customer partner recently nominated stevanato group to its distinguished 2022 supplier hall of fame in recognition of our collaboration mindset. stevanato group was the only glass supplier included on the list. our inclusion speak to the value we bring to our customers and our teams committed to advancing pharmaceutical innovation to help improve people's lives every day.
lastly, i'm proud to announce that the board has recommended the approval of a cash dividend of $13.5 million, eur 13.5 million subject to shareholder approval at the annual general meeting on june 1. on behalf of the entire board, this proposal affirm our confidence in management, the strength of underlying fundamental of the business and a favorable multiyear secular trend and robust demand that we see in the market. i will now hand the call to franco moro and marco dal lago to discuss this quarter result.
franco moro -- chief executive officer
thank you, franco. starting on slide 7. our solid first quarter performance gives us a good momentum, and this keeps us on track to achieve our full year guidance. for the first quarter of 2022, we delivered double-digit revenue growth, grew high value solutions and increased order intake compared to last year.
our mix of high value solutions increased to 29% of total revenue for the first quarter. we remain on course to hit our target mix by 2026, which is our revenue from high value solutions in the mid-30% range. favorable demand trends continue to underpin the steady flow of incoming orders. for the first quarter of 2022, new order intake increased 29% to approximately eur 324 million, which led to a committed backlog of approximately eur 992 million, up from eur 665 million last year.
as illustrated on slide 8, we started fiscal year 2022 on solid footing. we are executing our strategic and operational priorities to drive sustainable growth and expand ebitda margin. under the main pillars of our plan, our efforts are squarely concentrated on: advancing the build-out of our new ez-fill regional hubs in the u.s. and china; and adding incremental capacity in italy.
this broadens our production footprint, increases capacity in premium products and anchors operation in these strategic markets. growing the mix of high value solutions and rapidly responding to customer demand for premium containment and ready-to-use platforms. the adoption of high value solutions is driven by customers' needs to match more complex and sensitive treatments like biologics, monoclonal antibodies and mrna application with the right containment solution. our ready-to-use format reduce a customer's total cost of ownership while offering greater flexibility and higher quality.
driving innovation through investments in our research and development. our r&d efforts are focused in premium primary final packaging and drug delivery systems to accelerate our market-leading position, strengthen our ip and develop new technologies to advance patient care. building a multiyear pipeline of new opportunities as emerging therapies create a growing demand for high-performance products like nexa and alba. in addition, as the patient care advances beyond the laboratory to a point-of-care model, we are developing opportunities to increase our presence in drug delivery systems.
moving on to slide 9. we announced an exclusive partnership agreement with owen mumford, a global leader specializing in the design, development and manufacture of auto-injectors. the auto-injector space is one of the fastest-growing markets within drug delivery systems, with strong demand driven by increasing self-administration trends and new biosimilars entered. the new agreement supports the aidaptus auto-injector, a next-generation platform that is compatible with glass pre-fillable syringes and accommodates a range of fill volumes designed to deliver subcutaneous injections with a patient-centric design.
the partnership underscores the power of our integrated solutions across both segments. we are the exclusive manufacturing and engineering partner for owen mumford, and we will supply sub-assembly and final assembly equipment to customers. customers have the option to use a range of our ez-fill glass syringes as part of a completely integrated auto-injector solution. we will market the aidaptus auto-injector directly to customers, supporting their combination of product programs.
we also announced the expansion of our agreement with bexson to more therapeutic areas beyond pain management. bexson is using a customized version of our patient-friendly wearable sg ez-be pod, for the advancement of new therapeutics to treat a wide range of mental health conditions, including treatment-resistant depression and ptsd. these agreements follow on the heels of our expanded agreement with haselmeier for the alina pen injector. collectively, these efforts mark another key step in broadening our integrated capabilities, diversifying our portfolio and growing our presence in the drug delivery space of pen injectors, auto-injectors and wearable pods.
turning to slide 10, the cornerstone of our long-term strategic growth plan is building capacity for high value solutions to meet robust customer demand. we are making meaningful progress on our capital projects in the u.s. and china to better serve our customers. in north america, we remain on track with the build-out of our ez-fill hub in indiana, where commercial operation and revenue generation are still targeted to begin sometime between late 2023 to early 2024.
we are in the design phase of our new regional hub in china, where work has continued despite the lockdowns. our new hub will house production for ez-fill syringes and vials, and standard format. we continue to expect that the revenue generation will begin in the second half of 2024. within our existing production in china, we implemented a closed loop management system, which allowed us to continue production during the lockdown.
and today, we are back to normal operations. these priority projects expand our industrial footprint in the fastest-growing markets and add capacity amid rising demand. as you know, our modular approach allow us to maximize our capital investments with the flexibility to match our capacity buildout to demand trends. turning to slide 11.
while inflation and supply chains remain challenging, we continue to actively manage to mitigate the impacts. we are working in partnership with our customers, and i understand that the inflationary dynamics and the associated cost increases. as you may know, unprecedented demand for electrical components, coupled with the lockdowns in china, has further impacted already tight supply chains. while this has caused a temporary disruption for manufacturing parts we use, we pivoted our efforts to optimize production in high value solution where demand is strong.
we are also sourcing from multiple suppliers, ordering materials further in advance and keeping more raw materials and inventory on hand. over the last two years, we took action to reduce the downstream effects from the pandemic, and we continue to find practical solutions as the challenges evolve. manufacturing innovation and operational efficiencies are helping to counterbalance both inflation and tight supply chains. we are successfully managing our global supply chain and working closely with our suppliers and customers in this challenging environment.
we believe these business challenges will persist throughout 2022, and our guidance considers this. in summary, the first quarter was a good start to the fiscal year. we are advancing progress on all fronts with a sharp focus on execution against our strategic priorities to drive durable organic growth in the coming years under the backdrop of a favorable demand environment. i will now hand the call over to marco.
marco dal lago -- chief financial officer
thanks, franco. starting on slide 13, we are pleased with the overall performance in the quarter and financial results came in largely as expected. revenue for the first quarter of 2022 grew 10% or 8% on a constant currency basis to eur 212.1 million driven by growth in both of our segments. i want to point out that the first quarter last year included a eur 5.5 million revenue benefit in our bds segment from a licensing agreement all of which dropped to the bottom line and boosted margin, net profit and earnings in the first quarter of 2021.
excluding the favorable impact of currency translation and the eur 5.5 million revenue benefit year-over-year revenue growth would have been approximately 12%. for the first quarter of 2022, revenue related to covid represented approximately 10% of revenue compared to 14% for the same period last year. excluding covid, revenue from the base business grew 14% in the first quarter compared to last year. as franco noted, the mix of high value solutions increased to 29% of revenue in the first quarter, up from 23% last year.
gross profit margin in the first quarter of 2022 was 31.8% and benefited from a higher mix of high value solutions, which was offset by a temporary slowdown in production due to the higher absentees during the month of january and february related to covid-19, and to a lesser extent, inflationary costs. while we have been successful in recovering the majority of our cost increases, the steep rise in natural gas tempered margin, which we expect to recover in future periods through price adjustments. for the first quarter, operating profit margin was 17.9% and 18.3% on an adjusted basis. operating profit margin reflects higher operational expenses in r&d as we boost our efforts in this area, as well as increased g&a mostly related to public company costs.
this resulted in a net profit of eur 27.8 million or eur 0.10 of diluted earnings per share. as expected, the number of weighted average shares outstanding were higher in the first quarter of 2022 compared to q1 last year. adjusted net profit was eur 28.6 million and adjusted diluted eps were eur 0.11. for the first quarter, adjusted ebitda was eur 54 million and adjusted ebitda margin was 25.5%.
please turn to slide 14 for segment results. for the first quarter, bds segment revenue increased 7%, or 5% on a constant currency basis over last year to eur 172.4 million. as a reminder, the prior year period included a eur 5.5 million benefit from licensing agreement. revenue growth for the bds segment in the first quarter was driven by our high value solutions, which increased 37% year over year to eur 61.5 million, while revenue from other containment and delivery solution was down 4% to eur 110.9 million due to the revenue benefit in q1 last year.
for the first quarter of 2022, gross profit margin was 32.9%. while the segment benefited from a higher mix of high value solutions, gross profit margin was unfavorably impacted by the production slowdown due to covid-19 and, to a lesser extent, inflationary costs. operating profit margin was 20.7%. the engineering segment continues to achieve double-digit revenue growth, driven by strong customer demand.
for the first quarter, revenue derived from external customers increased 23% to eur 39.6 million compared to the prior year, driven by strong sales in our glass forming and visual inspection machines; separately, the increase in inter-segment revenue was due to the company's ongoing capacity expansion efforts under its strategic plan. gross profit margin for the first quarter of 2022 was 21.4%. we've taken steps to improve segment margins such as growing our more accretive aftersales business and implementing optimization efforts. operating profit margin was 13.8% in the first quarter.
turning to slide 15. our balance sheet is strong and, as of the end of march, maintained a positive net financial position of eur 143.3 million, and we ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents on hand of eur 366.7 million. our increased working capital needs are partly reflective of our sensible approach to keeping more inventories on hand and navigating the current business and supply chain environment as we drive long-term sustainable growth. for the first quarter, cash generated from operating activities was eur 5.2 million.
we are executing against strategic priorities and our global expansion plans. as a result, capital expenditures for the first quarter of 2022 were eur 53.8 million, and the main driver behind negative free cash flow of eur 48.8 million. turning now to slide 16. we thought it would be useful to provide a breakdown of our forecasted 2022 capex plans.
as the chart illustrates, our top priority is centered on growth platform with 82% of spend for italy, the u.s. and china to expand our capacity in high value solution, to meet the growing demand for this premium product set. we believe this demand-driven investment create a best path to deliver organic sustainable growth over the long term. we are investing 6% into our r&d activities.
as franco noted, our r&d efforts are focused on innovating in our glass primary packaging products and the advancement our drug delivery devices to maintain and accelerate our market-leading position. and lastly, 12% from other investments are, such as innovation in operating efficiency and quality, information technology, maintenance and safety. on slide 17, we are maintaining our full year guidance we believe that revenue from covid may be lower than our initial expectations, which was in the mid-teens as a percentage of 2022 revenue. it is more likely to be at the lower end of that range and favorably offset by higher revenue in our base business.
for fiscal year 2022, we continue to expect: revenue in the range from eur 935 million to eur 945 million; adjusted diluted eps in the range from eur 0.49 to eur 0.51, assuming weighted average shares outstanding of 264.7 million; and adjusted ebitda in the range from eur 248 million to eur 253 million. thank you. i will pass the call back to franco moro for closing comments.
franco moro -- chief executive officer
in closing, on page 18, we delivered another quarter of solid financial results that were in-line with our expectations. we are building a track record of consistent performance, and this gives us the confidence to maintain our fiscal 2022 guidance. we are operating in an environment of a strong demand, with attractive end markets, with durable secular multiyear drivers. we are poised to capitalize on these favorable trends as customers develop a more advanced treatments that demand a more sophisticated approach to drug containment.
at the same time, we are strengthening our portfolio of drug delivery solutions to improve patients' lives as therapies shift from point of lab to point of care. through these efforts and more, we are investing in areas that ensure that the stevanato group remains at the forefront of scientific innovation and a trusted partner for our customers. we are excited about the future. with that, let's open it up for questions.

[operator instructions] the first question we have from the phone lines comes from derik de bruin of bank of america. your line is open, derik.
derik de bruin -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
hi. good morning. thank you for taking my call. just a couple of ones.
and apologies, i've been -- i was like on and off the call. the embedded expectation for organic constant currency growth in the guide is what, at this point?
marco dal lago -- chief financial officer
so foreign exchange rate is -- effect is embedded in our guidance, with favorably impacting in q1. but in the guidance, we are taking into account the opportunities and risk and the foreign exchange is one of them. nevertheless, we still expect a double-digit organic growth without taking into account the foreign exchange effect.
derik de bruin -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
ok. so double-digit organic revenue growth in the revenue is great. and have you sort of -- i mean, it's good to see that you can sort of maintain guidance even with the covid tailwinds coming off. i guess, any sort of like visibility into how this is going to trend in the upcoming quarters and sort of how you look at initial thoughts on 2023 and derisking them?
franco moro -- chief executive officer
yes, let me just say that we are sorry also for the technical issues you experienced in the beginning of this call and thanks so much to everybody to staying with us in the call. then, derik, the answer to your point is that as marco said, we have the possibility to confirm our guidance. we always take into account the possibility of a quarterly fluctuation. we see the trends, the overall trends for the business being very strong in terms of the base business.
and also the trends related to covid is still there in term of possibility to have a different situation in the last part for the year, taking into consideration all the variables at the time in place. in terms of the view about the next year, it's very early to speculate about covid itself. we have a very strong backlog, very strong demand that are in place and give us lot of opportunities. so we remain optimistic about keeping the trends also for the future years.
derik de bruin -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
thank you.
operator
thank you.
lisa miles -- vice president, investor relations
next question please.
operator
we now have john kreger from the line of justin lin of william blair. your line is open.
john kreger -- william blair -- analyst
hi. good morning. congrats on the quarter. just a follow-up question on derik's question on covid.
i guess you're revising estimates to low teens for the year. so i guess my question is, are your customers canceling orders? are some orders perhaps being pushed to 2023? just -- any additional color that you can provide there would be really helpful.
franco moro -- chief executive officer
yes, we had the changes in the forecast of our customers for covid business. but in the meantime, we adjusted also our forecast for different therapeutic areas. as a matter of fact, we've already backfilled the changes in one direction with the good changes in the right direction linked to different therapeutic areas. it's something that always in any therapeutic areas, but we confirm the guidance for the year because of these very strong positive trends in other therapeutic areas.
and the overall demand, i can confirm, is still strong for the overall business.
john kreger -- william blair -- analyst
ok. in terms of high value solutions, obviously, it's been quite strong in recent quarters. and if i remember correctly, we're probably above the trend line previously communicated or expected maybe, say, a few months ago, right? so -- but the longer target of mid-30% has not changed since. i guess what's preventing you from perhaps growing high value solutions more quickly?
marco dal lago -- chief financial officer
yes. you are right. first of all, the trajectory is there. we did 22% in 2020, almost 25% last year.
and we have a forecast this year guidance of high 20%. so we are in line with our trajectory to reach the mid-30% by 2026. and we are, let's say, confident we will be there in the next year. so the shifting is happening.
we push as much as possible to accelerate the conversion.
john kreger -- william blair -- analyst
ok. thank you.
operator
we now have dave windley of jefferies. dave, your line is open.
dave windley -- jefferies -- analyst
hi. thank you for taking my question. good afternoon to all. just following on justin's question on the high value solutions.
could you talk qualitatively first about which among your portfolio of high value solutions, your clients are leaning toward or demanding the most?
franco moro -- chief executive officer
yes. thank you, david. it's a very exciting topic for us. because overall, we see very strong demand in many of our high value solutions.
as you asked, i can say that we have a very strong demand in our syringes in nexa and alba configuration. but in the meantime, we had also the same good welcome from the market in terms of nexa vials. and we -- you know that we are pushing the conversion of the market from glass vials to ez-fill vials. the demand is so strong.
we are investing a lot to match with the capacity, the increase in demand. and we see very, very favorable transfer for the future. it's one of our focus, and we will continue to pass it very strong.
dave windley -- jefferies -- analyst
your -- franco, your comments there about pushing client uptake. i think we've seen several announcements of capacity expansion. perhaps i'm thinking, maybe leaning more toward contract manufacturers that are adding filling lines. can you provide any color on that front? if you're having success, i know the contract manufacturers maybe an incrementally harder sell on the ez-fill front.
but are you having success in getting them to format or align those filling lines in a way that would be compatible with ez-fill?
franco moro -- chief executive officer
i'm not really sure to have captured the full question, but we are so strongly focused on our value proposition that is linked to what is now our integrated offering in terms of having different business lines in terms of ez-fill vials. we are not in the space of a filling, if i capture your question, right --
dave windley -- jefferies -- analyst
please go ahead, sorry. go ahead.
lisa miles -- vice president, investor relations
dave, just to clarify your question, i think what you're asking is that from the adoption of the high value solutions, are we seeing more filling lines going in at contract manufacturers as an example? is that the spirit of your question?
dave windley -- jefferies -- analyst
yes. are your customers installing lines that are configured for ez-fill? i understand that to be a precursor to their adoptions of actual ez-fill vials.
franco moro -- chief executive officer
yes. sorry, and also for my misunderstanding at the beginning of the answer. yes, the answer is yes, we see more adoption. we know that some of our customers are planning the conversion of their capacity, not only for the short-term installation, but also in the longer run to have different capabilities in terms of filling lines, shifting to ready-to-use format.
this is the trend. and obviously, we are working in partnership with many customers to understand their needs and also to be in line with their expectation for the next future. the answer is yes.
dave windley -- jefferies -- analyst
great. sorry, i didn't ask the question well. a couple of, i think, marco questions here on numbers. would you be willing to provide the percentage of your revenue in ez-fill that is not in high value? and then, would you be willing to give us some perspective on how much of your backlog relates to -- or do you expect to recognize in 2022 and how much spans over into 2023?
marco dal lago -- chief financial officer
so i start from the backlog. the backlog is we are pretty happy with the orders intake and the backlog about high value solution. this has given us strong confidence in delivering the high 20% we mentioned before as revenue in the year. so the backlog is very consistent with this assumption for 2022.
about your question about ez-fill, we are keeping on growing ez-fill. most importantly, we are converting our capacity to our high value solution. so in a nutshell, we will not disclose the kpi as usual, as ez-fill are growing less than 37% high value solutions are growing. i hope this is enough for you to model.
ok. yeah, that'll work.
dave windley -- jefferies -- analyst
thank you very much.
lisa miles -- vice president, investor relations
thanks, dave. next question please.
operator
we now have paul knight from keybanc. please go ahead when you're ready.
paul knight -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
hi. thanks for the time. the pricing, you mentioned that will flow through for the current quarter or the rest of the year. so pricing wasn't fully in place in the first quarter, marco?
marco dal lago -- chief financial officer
yes. so as we explained, there has been a sharp increase in gas -- natural gas price that is part of our process. as a matter of fact, we have some delay in transferring into price adjustment, this increase that was pretty strong end of q4 and in q1. we're estimating about eur 1 million to hit.
the other negative effect we mentioned is about the omicron variant that absentees as we already anticipated, hit our production in january and february. nevertheless, through the shift into our high value solutions, we have been able to improve the margin compared to q4 in spite of the very same mix. so i think, yes, we offset the two headwinds through the shift into high value solutions and efficiency we put in place.
paul knight -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
and then franco, your backlog increase of 49% from prior year, is that again -- i'm assuming it's ez-fill. but can you be -- is it -- do you think it's around monoclonals? is it being impacted by trends in generics? what's the color around that size increase in backlog?
franco moro -- chief executive officer
yes, it's a very good point because, as you mentioned, we mentioned that the shift to high value solution is continuing to proceed according to our expectation or with a very optimistic view for the future. in terms of therapeutic areas or technologies that we see very strong demand is mostly linked to biotech and partially to biosimilars. there are general growth also in other areas, but our focus and our best opportunities are in biotech and biosimilars.
paul knight -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
ok. lastly, on the dividend, thanks for the shareholder vote june 1. would that be dividend for the third quarter, marco?
marco dal lago -- chief financial officer
the record date is expected to be june 14.
lisa miles -- vice president, investor relations
and the pay date is in july, paul. it's in our agm materials that are on our website, and i will send that to you after the call for you, so you have the specifics.
paul knight -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
ok. that's a quarterly dividend starting at that time.
marco dal lago -- chief financial officer
it's an annual dividend.
lisa miles -- vice president, investor relations
it's an annual dividend, paul.
paul knight -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
ok. thank you.
operator
thank you. we now have tim daley of wells fargo. please go ahead. your line is now open.
tim daley -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
hey, everybody. thanks for the time.  so i just wanted to circle back on dave's question about the backlog, just general ordering patterns and how it relates to backlog growth in your inventory build. so you all mentioned that you guys are -- you're increasing your safety stocks, you're ordering raw materials out a bit further to make sure you don't have any supply chain disruptions. but if we think about it in terms of how your backlog is growing, i'm sure customers are doing something similar.
but could you kind of help us understand how much of that backlog growth that you're putting up is maybe a similar dynamic happening at customers, where they are placing orders further out, maybe increasing safety stock? or is that not a factor in the backlog? and then, i can state other questions as well after that one.
marco dal lago -- chief financial officer
i start from the numbers, then i'll probably hand over to franco for other comments. so first of all, we have a strong visibility to our backlog. we are happy about the mix as mentioned. we have a strong visibility for 2022 being covered very well for the year and for our guidance.
at the same time, we are building the foundation for next year. we have in excess of eur 370 million for the years to come. so we are building the foundation also for 2023 and beyond. we have strong backlog in both segments and the shift in the mix is shifting to our high value solution.
i'll hand over to franco for some other comments.
franco moro -- chief executive officer
yes, in terms of the trends that you can imagine about booking advanced capacity, i must say at least two things. the first one is that we are not in front of a temporary upside reasons upside. so the backlog is stronger because the mid long-term demand is strong, not because we are in a crisis that pass a lot about our supply for pharma. at the meantime, we are very close to our customers.
so what we have to do to secure our own supply chain for material that is coming from a different supplier, different area, also geographic area, is not the same case for our pharma, because -- our pharma customer, because we are very close to them. so i don't think that we can copy and paste what we are doing to secure the supply chain in terms of what our customers are doing in terms of their own demand. is that the long-term steady growth in our business that is driving the backlog? and obviously, the success of our specific value proposition, high value solutions and the flexibility that we deliver to our customers.
tim daley -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
great. that's very encouraging commentary. appreciate that. and so, now i wanted to touch on the exclusive agreement.
so we saw a couple of press releases come out this quarter. i guess if we just dove into the owen mumford kind of anecdote here. so can you just kind of run us through how the economics works and effectively with the exclusive agreement, what has materially changed? i know you guys were expecting previously. and -- and what -- how do you convince someone -- a customer like this to effectively fully integrate your solutions here? so how do you increase the penetration of the glass components beyond the plastics and the assembly exclusivity that you have?
franco moro -- chief executive officer
yes. obviously, i cannot disclose any specific figures linked to this specific agreement and the expected outcome in term of business. what i can say is that the approach to dds is part of our overall strategy, where we want to become more and more a solution provider for our customer. dds space that isn't fast growing is not in the very short term, but is in the mid to long term, is the faster, fast-growing area because of it's coherent with the trajectory of mega trends like chronic diseases, like providing the patients better life in terms of stay away from the hospital and take the treatments at home.
so this is the strategic reason why we are investing in that space. the life cycle of dds project is not the short one, it's for me the long run. and that is the reason why we are pushing our efforts in r&d also in that direction.
lisa miles -- vice president, investor relations
tim, just to clarify, i think that we have one more question that was tied into your string of questions regarding the integrated capabilities and the glass component as well.
franco moro -- chief executive officer
yes, yes. we mentioned several times that in the dds space, we play with all our own capabilities in glass, in plastic for the injection modeling and then for assembly line that are part of our offer in engineering. all together, we can provide the customer the fully integrated solution to have dds available in -- and on top of that, we also put our experience in services to develop the right containment solution for the customers.
lisa miles -- vice president, investor relations
and does that answer your question?
tim daley -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
yes, no. that's great. thank you.
operator
we now have john sourbeer of ubs. please go ahead. i have opened your line, john.
john sourbeer -- ubs -- analyst
good morning. could you talk a little bit on the regional performance in the quarter across americas, emea and apac? and anything to highlight in the second quarter from china lockdowns?
marco dal lago -- chief financial officer
yes. i start from the regional breakdown, as you will find it in a 6-k long form. europe is still the main market with 58.5%. north america is the second market with 25% of the revenue.
we have about 13.4% in asia pacific and 3.2% in latin america. so we are keeping on growing in asia pacific. and the other very important market for us in the medium-term is north america, of course. i don't recall your second question.
sorry.
franco moro -- chief executive officer
i can take it, marco. you asked about the q2. in covid, it's very difficult to say anything. we cannot anticipate nothing about the q2.
i can reinforce what the outcomes are in q1, when we experience in the area where we have our own facility short-term lockdown two weeks. and in that period, we secured the continuity of the business in the closed loop set up, having our people in the plant working 24-hour days, seven days a week. and i take the chance also to say thank you to all our colleagues, because they experienced a very tough time. they showed our customer-centric approach to secure the supply for our customers even if the environment wasn't so strong, so difficult.
so thanks to all our colleagues in china.
john sourbeer -- ubs -- analyst
and on the capital expansion in italy, any update there? and any way to quantify when you expect these to start generating revenue?
franco moro -- chief executive officer
if i end up to the -- well, the question, we are investing in italy, and we expect to take advantage of the capacity expansion also during the next year. about the new green facility in the u.s. and china, we can confirm that we expect to have the first revenue generation late 2023 in the u.s. and mid second half of 2024 in china.
lisa miles -- vice president, investor relations
john, i just want to clarify your question as it relates to our italy capacity expansion. can you please ask that question again?
john sourbeer -- ubs -- analyst
yes. i guess, i saw the updates, i think specifically on north america and china in the presentation. just any update there on italy? and have you stated when you expect these to start generating?
franco moro -- chief executive officer
it's not just a switch. we are continuing investing since many years in italy. so we are releasing additional capacity month by month, if not quarter by quarter. so we are in line with our investment plan in italy.
and we will see more capacity available also in the next month, but it's not a one-off. it's several lines that are coming in production weeks after weeks, if not more frequently.
john sourbeer -- ubs -- analyst
got it. appreciate the color. thanks.

we now have the next question from drew ranieri of morgan stanley. please go ahead when you're ready.
drew ranieri -- morgan stanley -- analyst
hi everyone. thanks for taking the question. marco, maybe this is specifically for you, but in maintaining your 2022 guidance. can you maybe just help us: one, frame where bds growth and engineering growth could shake out for the year? it just seems like engineering continues to maybe outpace our expectations, but just curious if you could provide more detail there? and second, is there -- or are there any other onetime licensing orders that we should be aware of for the remaining three quarters of the year?
marco dal lago -- chief financial officer
today, so let's start from the end, we don't expect any onetime for the months to come, as of today, obviously, based on what we know today. about your question about engineering, we went up very rapidly last year. we went up about 50% year over year in '21. as mentioned during our previous earnings call, we expect a high single-digit growth this year, and this is what we have in our guidance today.
on the other segment, we expect double-digit growth, having an overall growth of 11.4% if we take the center point of our guidance. we are not changing our model today. we are in the first quarter, basically we have a robust backlog impact in both segments, providing us a good visibility on the next month.
lisa miles -- vice president, investor relations
does that answer your question, drew?
drew ranieri -- morgan stanley -- analyst
yes, sorry. and maybe just on the onetime orders, just -- i meant maybe on a year-over-year comparison, is there anything in 2021 that was like a onetime order in 2q, 3q or 4q like you had in this first quarter of the prior year?
marco dal lago -- chief financial officer
you mean in the prior year? well, for sure, end of the year, we have the interest income, the sales of the minority in swissfillon that improved the margin this time. i don't recall any other significant event besides the well-known onetime bonus we provided to employees in q3, and the closing of the older stock agreement with some manager in second quarter that has been -- so we had last year, many nonrecurring events. if we talk our adjusted ebitda was -- has been cleaned by this specific event also last year. so this is the main ones we had last year, but we treat them basically as nonrecurring items.
drew ranieri -- morgan stanley -- analyst
all right. thanks for taking the questions.
operator
thank you. as that was our final question, i'd like to hand it back to lisa miles for some closing remarks.
lisa miles -- vice president, investor relations

operator
good afternoon. this is the chorus call conference operator. welcome and thank you for joining the stevanato group's second quarter financial results call. [operator instructions] at this time, i would like to turn the conference over to ms.
lisa miles, svp ir. please go ahead, madam.
lisa miles -- senior vice president, investor relations

franco stevanato -- executive chairman
this has been an exciting year for all of us at stevanato. last month, we celebrated the first anniversary of our ipo, and we continue to successfully execute against our long-term strategic plan to drive sustainable organic growth, increase our mix of high value solutions, and expand ebitda margin. we're creating a track record of performance that includes meeting or exceeding our financial objectives since we have been reporting as a public company. we are currently operating in an environment of robust demand with attractive end market characterized by durable secular multi-year driver.
we have set the stage to capitalize on favorable macro tailwind of aging population, pharmaceutical innovation, the growth in biologic, trend toward outsourcing, and self-administration of medicine. our business philosophy is rooted in science technology, a driving constant innovation to support customer and improve patient life around the world through a singular focus on product and service for the pharmaceutical industry. in june, we published our first sustainability report, and while we are at the start of this journey, i am proud of what we have accomplished. as a global provider to the pharmaceutical and biotech industry, we are committed to embedding sustainability throughout our policy and practice to make a positive impact for all our stakeholder around the globe.
thank you for your continued support. i will now hand the call over to franco moro.
franco moro -- chief executive officer
starting on slide 7, for the second quarter of 2022, we delivered double-digit revenue growth and expand our gross profit margin. contributions from high value solutions reached record levels, accounting for approximately 30% of total company revenue. our results demonstrate our ability to successfully execute in a challenging environment, and we are pleased to be raising our full year guidance. for the second quarter, new order intake was approximately eur 252 million, bringing new order intake for the first half of 2022 to 576 million, compared to 529 million last year.
at the end of the second quarter, our commitment backlog increased 37% over last year, topping eur 1 billion. turning to slide 8 for an update on our priority capital projects. in the united states. the growth in biologics and the upcoming wave of the biosimilars helped reshape our industrial plants in indiana.
since our last call, we completed the foundational work on our new facility and started construction on the building. we remain on track for commercial operation in late 2023 or early 2024. in italy, we are making solid progress on our capacity expansion efforts. construction is nearly complete on our new building in piombino dese.
in addition, two of our three planned new lines for 2022 are operational, including one ez-fill syringe line and one line dedicated to our premium alba syringes. we expect to operationalize another ez-fill syringe line in the fall. and in china, we are nearing the end of the design phase but still anticipate revenue generation in the second half of 2024. we are firmly focused on the execution of this priority project as we expand our global industrial footprint to meet the rising demand and the evolving needs of our customers.
in our meetings with the investors over the last several months, we received many questions on industry collaboration partnerships, which is a standard practice. on slide 9, we want to address how we think about our framework for collaboration and partnerships, specifically in that containment, and drive delivery systems. first, the foundation for any framework is understanding our customer needs. by fostering customer intimacy and keeping them at the heart of everything we do, we must anticipate market trends and help customers tackle their greatest challenges.
these are r&d, capital investments, and partnership agreements, all of which broaden our capability set. our long-term strategy consider market trends and matching the needs of customers in the decades to come. in that containment, stevanato was the first to market with washed and sterilized, ready-to-use vials and cartridges, known as our ez-fill platform. today, only about 5% of the vial market and less than 5% of the cartridge market has transitioned to ready-to-use format.
we see a real desire by customers to transition to ready-to-use formats to gain efficiencies, improve quality, increase speed to market, and reduce total cost of ownership. that customer demand is driving our strategy. for our market-leading ez-fill platform, our collaborations include sales and service agreements. we also license our ip and technology to other industry players.
this is important to customers because it establishes a gold standard in the industrial process with the same technology, platforms, and processes for ready-to-use vials and cartridges. it also gives customers the ability to source from multiple suppliers using the same platform, which is also supported by the vast majority of fill-and-finish line producers. by doing this, we serve as a market enabler to better support our customers needs and galvanize the transition. in the drug delivery space, partnerships help us broaden our product portfolio.
we can bring the power of our integrated capabilities to deliver a complete solution to customers. for example, under our agreement with owen mumford, we are harnessing the full breadth of services to deliver the aidaptus auto-injector. our comprehensive set of services ranges from manufacturing, engineering, plastic injection molding, cartridges and syringes, inspection, and assembly. by leveraging a robust network of partnerships and investing in dds platforms, we help our customers advance patient care while at the same time capitalizing on the long-term trends of the self-administration of treatments.
to sum these all up, the primary goal for every partnership is to bring a real value to our customers. this means constantly innovating to take quality to the next level, improving efficiencies, streamlining processes, and simplifying the industrial process to deliver more value for their money. we believe this approach will help us cement our role as a leading partner of choice for pharma and biotech players for decades to come. turning to the comments, geopolitical crisis and the european gas prices on page 10.
we are monitoring the situation closely and it is something we must manage. energy costs have increased in the last six months, but we are working directly with customers, keeping them informed and adjusting our prices accordingly. from a supply side, the vast majority of our natural gas usage in europe is in italy for our glass conversion operations. as press reports indicate, the italian government has taken a swift action to lower its dependence on russia by signing gas agreements with other countries to diversify supply.
given our mission critical role in the pharmaceutical supply chain, we believe that we will be eligible for priority status similar to our designation during covid. and lastly, on page 11, i want to commend our team's efforts in sustainability. our 2021 sustainability report provides complete and transparent non-financial reporting to our stakeholders. most importantly, it creates the foundation for setting future targets.
the report considered the company's financial results and highlights the esg performance of the group. our report is subject to limited assurance and was prepared in accordance with the global reporting initiative standards, which demonstrates our commitment to sustainability. i will hand the call over to marco.
marco dal lago -- chief financial officer
thanks, franco. starting on slide 13, revenue for the second quarter increased 15% and 11% on a constant currency basis over the prior year to 234.2 million, driven by growth in both segments. today, we are pleased to be raising guidance based on our year-to-date strong performance in our core business, which is offsetting revenue declines related to covid and improved outlook in the engineering segment and favorable currency effects. for the second quarter of 2022, revenue related to covid continued to decline and represented approximately 9% of revenue, compared to 15% for the same period last year.
excluding covid and the favorable impact from currency revenue in the second quarter would have grown approximately 17% compared to the same period last year. gross profit margin in the second quarter of 2022 increased 60 basis points to 31.8%, driven by the favorable mix in bds business segment and expanded gross profit margin in the engineering segment. turning to sg&a. compared to the prior year, increases in sg&a expenses reflect investment to support the growth of the business and the costs associated with the public company status.
as a reminder, the biggest year-over-year change was due to a one time benefit in the second quarter of last year for the termination of an equity incentive plan. for the second quarter of 2022, the company recorded approximately eur 6 million in other income for a contra-modification, which reflects a decrease in covid-19 related business. we believe that the modification represents a fair and equitable arrangement to support the changing needs of our customer and reflect changes in revenues, lost production time, cost incurred, and process to reallocate capacity. with the rise of new covid-19 variants and different parts of efficacy in virus vaccines, customers are making appropriate adjustments to their capacity plans.
we believe that customers intimacy and offering our customers flexibility is an important element to support and therefore over the long term. for the second quarter, operating profit margin was 18.7%; and on adjusted basis, 19.6%, excluding certain start-up costs in the u.s. this resulted in a net profit of 30.6 million or eur 0.12 of diluted earnings per share. as expected, the number of weighted average shares outstanding were higher in the second quarter of 2022 compared to last year.
adjusted net profit was 31.9 million and adjusted diluted eps were eur 0.12 also. for the second quarter, adjusted ebitda was 61.8 million and the adjusted ebitda margin was 26.4%. please turn to slide 14 for segment results. despite the year-over-year decrease in covid revenue, the biopharmaceutical and diagnostics solutions segment still posted growth.
in the second quarter, revenue from external customers in the segment increased 8% to 188.6 million compared to the same period last year and approximately 3% on a constant currency basis. revenue from high value solutions increased 46% over the same period last year to 70.1 million and represented approximately 37% of bds segment revenue. revenue from other containment and delivery solutions was down 6% to 118.5 million. a favorable mix shift led to higher margins compared to the prior year.
for the second quarter, gross profit margin increased 80 basis points to 33.7%, and operating profit margin grew 100 basis point to 23.6%. the engineering segment delivered another solid quarter of financial results, driven by strong customer demand and growth in all business lines. for the second quarter, revenue derived from external customers increased 57% to 45.6 million compared to the prior year. for the second quarter of 2022, gross profit margin improved to 22.3%, and operating profit margin increased to 15.5%.
margin expansion was driven by contributions from more accretive projects and after sales activities, as well as ongoing business opportunity to improve operational efficiencies. on slide 15, we continue to maintain a strong balance sheet, and as of june 30, we had a positive net financial position of 109.4 million and cash and cash equivalents of 314.9 million. for the second quarter, cash generated from operating activities was 42.2 million. as expected, the increase in working capital reflects ongoing investment in the business to fund long-term sustainable growth.
we continue to keep more inventory on hand for supply security as we aim to prudently balance the needs of the business in the current supply chain environment. we are advancing progress on our global expansion plan, which result in a capital expenditure of 77.5 million in the second quarter. as expected, capex plan was the main driver behind the negative free cash flow of 33.7 million. on slide 16, we are raising our full year guidance, which considers a number of factors.
first we are forecasting a decreasing revenue from covid. this is being offset by strong demand in our core business, which has allowed us to overcome this headwind. our full year guidance now assumes approximately 10% of total revenue will be related to covid, down from our previous forecast in the low teens. check on our increased full year revenue guidance assumes favorable currency effect of approximately 18 million for 2022.
this compares to our initial guidance, which assume a favorable impact of just over 3 million for the year, resulting in a net change to our full year revenue guidance of 15 million from favorable currency impact. further, an improved outlook for our engineering segment. we now expect double digit revenue growth in fiscal year 2022 over the prior year, up from our original guidance of high single digit. lastly, our guidance still considers the effect of inflation.
as a result, we now expect the revenue in the range of 955 million to 965 million, compared to prior guidance of 935 million to 945 million. adjusted diluted eps in the range of eur 0.51 to eur 0.53, up from our prior guidance of eur 0.49 to eur 0.51. and adjusted ebitda in the range of 253.3 million to 258.3 million, compared with prior estimates of 248 million to 253 million. our assumed capex spend range remains unchanged in absolute dollars.
i will pass the call back to franco moro for closing comments.
franco moro -- chief executive officer
in closing, on page 18, we are operating in an environment of strong demand, growing end markets, and multi-year secular drivers. above all, we are satisfying customer needs by driving innovation and providing a rich set of end-to-end capabilities that support them through their entire drug license cycle. we remain focused on operational excellence and the successful execution of our four strategic and operational priorities, including advancing our global capacity expansion in the u.s., china, and italy; growing the mix of high value solutions, investing in r&d to advance premium primary packaging and drug delivery systems; and lastly, building a multi-year pipeline of new opportunities by supporting our customers through scientific innovation to meet their evolving needs. these priorities are specifically designed to capitalize on market trends to drive long-term sustainable organic growth, expand ebitda margins, and build shareholder value.
and with that, let's open it up for questions.
",":
operator
thank you. this is the chorus call conference operator. [operator instructions] the first question is from paul knight with keybanc. please go ahead.
paul knight -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
hi, franco moro. on the engineering growth that we're seeing this year, should we take that as a leading indicator for more high -- hvs demand in the future? so what's your read on this strong engineering growth?
franco moro -- chief executive officer
hi, paul. yes, sure. we see the increase of business in engineering, a signal of what can happen later on for bds segments. our customers are investing because we are in a growing environment in healthcare and pharma business.
we see amazing initiative of our customers worldwide, mostly linked to biotech and biosimilars. that is also good to have a more opportunity for our high value solution in the future. so i confirm that with this trend, and we are matching what our customer needs in terms of innovation, in terms of standardization, level of services around the world, that is also linked to the expansion of our initiative in the u.s. and china.
paul knight -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
and last question would be, you're obviously guiding down covid this year? do you have any initial thoughts on 2023?
franco moro -- chief executive officer
no. in terms of the business, we see still has some level of uncertainty about the future in covid. we continue to see the transition to single-dose vial that you can remember is growth to neutral or positive for us in terms of the business. but it's too early to speculate about the next year or the mid and long term.
for sure, the trend is in line with our expectation to see this business landing somewhere in the regular business for vaccine.
paul knight -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
ok. thank you.
operator
the next question is from justin lin with william blair. please go ahead.
justin lin -- william blair and company -- analyst
hi. good morning. on natural gas prices real quick, can you clarify what the priority status means for you? and any way you can quantify the likely impact your margins in the coming quarters if things don't necessarily go according to plan?
franco moro -- chief executive officer
yeah. i thought the same that as i told in my commentary, we have the most of our usage in italy in terms of gas because of our gas converting operation. in italy, our government is taking a lot of action to mitigate the risk of shortages. and if we look at the path of when the pandemic started, we immediately received the designation as a special business because we are part of the pharmaceutical supply chain.
so we receive a special attention from the government. so in terms of shortages, we are not afraid. in terms of gas prices, we monitor the trends regular and we pass on these costs to our customer. it's different situation in germany where the major of our energy consumption is supplied by electricity, more than 95%.
and also in this country, there are initiatives from the government to think about of pharmaceutical supply chain with special attention. so we are confident that we will not impact the entire operation in terms of the impact of the utility costs on our cogs. marco may complement my answer.
marco dal lago -- chief financial officer
yeah, sure, franco. just to remind you that in 2021, our utilities and our cost of sales was less than 5%. so we had an increase. it is now about 5%, but slightly above that percentage on our total manufacturing cost.
so as franco would say, we are passing either price to customers, so we don't expect an impact in our p&l from inflation in 2022.
justin lin -- william blair and company -- analyst
ok. thanks. that's very helpful. and have you seen any changes in customer ordering pattern? and do you get the sense that customers have been building inventory in the past two years, and therefore, we might start to see some impact from customer destocking going forward? just want to get a sense of that.
franco moro -- chief executive officer
we cannot a report about significant changes. you have seen that our order intake is very strong. the demand is very strong. obviously in this environment, customer wanted to have a secure supply so they continue to look in the mid to long term.
and the intimacy we have with them help us to shape our progression and capacity that i confirm is mostly focused on high value solution because the demand in this area is very, very strong.
justin lin -- william blair and company -- analyst
ok. that's fair. thank you.
operator
the next question is from derik de bruin with bank of america. please go ahead.
derik de bruin -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
hi. good morning. thank you for taking my question. i've got two.
so the first one is the 30% high value solutions in the quarter was a couple of points ahead of where we were. how do we think about that number exiting 2022?
franco moro -- chief executive officer
yeah. is it very good news, first of all, because the confirmation of that demand and really the customers are pulling us to speed up in providing their what they need in terms of benefits coming from our high value solution. we consider to -- the possibility to have some quarterly fluctuation quarter by quarter because it linked to a planning of activities, also customer demand. but if we look at the next two quarters, we see in steel, a consistent increase time of absolute value for high value solution.
that is partially compensated in terms of share by the stronger demand also for other product lines that are not high value solution like engineering we mentioned before. so it's fair to look at the full year landing is somewhere in between 28% to 29% of the share and we will keep you updated in the next results. in the same time for the longer run, we see consistent additional growth in the next years, landing near the 30s, around the 26.
derik de bruin -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
great. thank you. and just on the covid contribution from this year, your 10% guide for total revenues essentially implies roughly, i don't know, 50 million in the back half of the year or two. that seems like it would be a step up from 2q levels.
am i reading that correctly or can you sort of explain the dynamics or covid demand in the back half of the year?
marco dal lago -- chief financial officer
your number are accurate. it's -- our guidance is covered basically by our backlogs, so the committed orders we can see. this is what we planned today. we don't expect further contract modification, and so this is what we have in our guidance fully covered by our backlog.
derik de bruin -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
got it. thank you very much. appreciate it.
lisa miles -- senior vice president, investor relations
thanks, derik.
operator
the next question is from patrick donnelly with citi. please go ahead.
patrick donnelly -- citi -- analyst
hey, thanks for taking the questions. marco, maybe one for you on the margins. obviously, a lot of moving pieces between the pricing, fx, the supply chain, gas pricing, some of the mix shift with high value. can you just talk about kind of what gives and takes on the margin piece as we work our way through this year and then kind of the broad set up as we go into '23 with with some of those factors?
marco dal lago -- chief financial officer
about about the guidance, as we mentioned, we expect this center point in the range of 960 million. we expect double digit organic growth in both segments and we expect to expand the gross profit margin in both segments compared to 2021. more color about engineering, we can have some quarterly fluctuation depending on project mix, but overall the trajectory is keeping on improving the gross profit margin. about bds, so they're shifting to high value solution is helping, as you can see.
you mentioned also rightly the fact that for us in being able to pass through our cost in price increases without adding margin is a little bit dilutive for our gross profit margin. if you imagine that 30% gross profit margins we have in bds segment, 3% inflation is diluting 100 basis point our gross profit margin. so the shifting to high value solution is expected to more than offset these. so we are confident to keep on improving our gross profit margin in both segments.
patrick donnelly -- citi -- analyst
that's helpful. and then maybe one on the high value solutions continues to be really strong growth there. can you just talk about the various drivers or whether it's the product side or certain customer bases that are kind of continuing to drive that elevated growth there?
franco moro -- chief executive officer
yeah. it's something that is not really new but the demand of a customer is particularly stronger in biotech and biosimilars because the here we play with both the pillars of our value proposition in terms of high value solution. because one side we provide the best answer to the scientific requirements of molecules that are highly sensitive and needs spatial containment solution that preserve the integrity of this kind of treatment. and the other side, this company are more keen to focus on their core business, which is the new molecule, new treatment.
and sometimes they are smaller company, not only big pharma that don't want or they don't have internal capacity and they wanted to limit that their expenditure in capex. so it's high value solution in terms of ez-fill, ready-to-use formats are the best answer in terms of total cost of ownership reduction, flexibility, speed to market. so i cannot mention a specific therapeutic area because biological biosimilar are for many therapeutic areas and we are focused on the two main needs of the customer, scientific requirements, saving total cost of ownership reduction.
operator
the next question is from steven couche with jefferies. please go ahead.
steven couche -- jefferies -- analyst
hi. this is steven on for dave windley. thank you for taking my questions. i guess the first one is i wanted to clean up that eur 6 million contract modification from the covid contract.
most of the times we hear -- and they're straightforward take-or-pay fees, this sounds like it might be a little bit different. is that 6 million sort of net of the expenses and that's all in the other income, or are there costs associated with that modification that might have shown up in bds?
marco dal lago -- chief financial officer
yes. thanks for the question. first of all, we consider the agreement a fair agreement. the agreement to replace is a business we wouldn't have had if the contract didn't change.
so it's somehow compensating the lost revenue, lost production time, and cost incurred in the process of reallocating capacity. so it's not something not related to the business. it's really tied to the cost we had in this period. and this agreement, we do not expect this changing a relevant way our full year guidance with respect of profit.
steven couche -- jefferies -- analyst
ok. and so just to just to reiterate, that 6 million fee did not show up -- either revenue or costs did not show up in bds or es for the quarter?
marco dal lago -- chief financial officer
it is in our bds segment, but is a fair compensation of cost occurred and the need to reallocate capacity.
lisa miles -- senior vice president, investor relations
but that's correct. that did not come through as revenue. it came through in the other income line.
steven couche -- jefferies -- analyst
ok. perfect. thank you. and then maybe the second, fx obviously helping the full year outlook.
can you maybe give us a framework of the flow through of fx to the ebit or ebitda line? and i guess another way of asking that is, are your expenses on an fx basis relatively matched with your revenue exposure?
marco dal lago -- chief financial officer
yes. thank you for the question. yes, you are right. we have also relevant part of cost denominated in u.s.
dollars. that is the main driver of the changes both in the top line, but also in cost. so we estimate an impact in the -- overall impact on the ebitda but keep in mind that is a modest compared with the top line increase. so we estimate we have about a 25% to 30% impact, compared to the 18 million ebitda -- revenue, sorry.
so the assumption we have in the model is having 100 revenue denominated in dollars and 75 cost denominated in dollars.
steven couche -- jefferies -- analyst
ok. thank you very much.
operator
the next question is from john sourbeer with ubs. please go ahead.
john sourbeer -- ubs -- analyst
hi. and thanks for taking the question. maybe just another one on the hvs, the growth continue to be strong there and maybe specific to the lines that you're bringing online in italy. with the three new lines this year, i think two of them are on line, one in the fall.
are you starting to see that impact there from those two lines now and that's why the hvs is approaching that 30%? and then how does the new line in the fall come on, accelerate that penetration?
franco moro -- chief executive officer
yeah. putting more capacity in place is something that we started years ago. so you see the impact, the different the proportion quarter by quarter depending of, not only the availability of their line, but also the progress in terms of the validation activity. so i can confirm that that we have seen some good impact from the two lines that we have put to running in the quarter.
and we expect that to have a minor impact compared to the total capacity in the last part of the year because we expect to have the line already in the last part of the year, but then the capacity utilization cannot be immediately 100% because we have to run also the validation activities, so -- but if you look at the biggest scenario, you can see that our investment in capacity for high value solution are matching the demand of the customer that is very high and we are progressing in our investment accordingly and we see constant improving our share of high value solution in the portfolio.
john sourbeer -- ubs -- analyst
thanks. and just a follow up on the regional performance. any color you can provide there? and did you see any impact from the china covid lockdowns on the business there or with the capacity expansions that you're building up?
marco dal lago -- chief financial officer
yes. in the second quarter we experienced slowdown with revenue in asia pacific, mainly driven by covid slowdown, and as you mentioned, the slowdown in the environment also in our customer's factory. we consider it, obviously, a temporary effect. we continue to count on asia pacific for our growth.
john sourbeer -- ubs -- analyst
thanks for taking the question.
