adam elsesser -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you, dan. good afternoon, and thank you for joining penumbra's first quarter 2019 conference call.
our total revenues for the first quarter were $128.4 million, an increase of 25.1% as reported and 27.2% in constant currency from the first quarter last year. we had operating income in the quarter of $11.2 million, compared to $4 million for the same period last year.
2019 began with great momentum across our entire business. we saw strong sequential revenue growth over the fourth quarter of 2018. this growth is being driven by our ability to treat a growing number of patients in large patient end markets and our ability to continuously innovate within our existing areas such as stroke and vascular thrombectomy, as well as within new areas. i will share a few updates and developments from the first quarter focusing on these themes.
beginning with our patient end markets, our primary discussion with investors over the past four years has been on ischemic stroke. we have detailed the impact of the disease on patients across the world. we also outlined our views on how we saw the future opportunity. in terms of the addressable patients, we expected growth of patients treated and the likely role of aspiration in the procedure. four years later, we are here talking about a larger addressable patient population, faster growth in patients treated, and the validation of aspiration as the preferred frontline mechanism for stroke thrombectomy. there has been great progress, and we believe the foundation is set for continued growth.
we are now in the process of introducing a second meaningful patient end market for penumbra. recently investors have taken notice of the results in our vascular business. we have learned a lot over the past few years about the disease states and the potential of our technology. this has given us greater confidence and visibility on the future opportunity. i would compare this to how we felt about stroke four years ago. coincidentally our vascular business is at a similar level of annual revenue as our neuro business was four years ago, but it is growing at an even faster rate.
we have learned enough to say that the number of patients with clot in their bodies that we can help in the united states has the potential to expand significantly beyond the current 150,000 addressable patients that we have initially focused on. it is helpful to note that our indigo system is currently used in about 10% of those patients currently being treated by interventional methods. we are at the very early stages of this patient opportunity.
i would now like to turn our focus to the next theme, innovation. starting with stroke, in march compass was published in the lancet, one of the world's most prestigious medical journals. as you may recall the compass trial was a landmark study in ischemic stroke. the publication confirmed that direct aspiration is just as effective as stint retriever thrombectomy. it also reported higher numerical revascularization rates and faster revascularization times for direct aspiration. this study helps demonstrate the importance of aspiration for stroke patients. penumbra has believed in this view, and we have been working diligently with physicians to continuously improve the technology since our first fda-cleared aspiration system for ischemic stroke over a decade ago.
while the compass study is validating, we are not done innovating in stroke. the ambition to keep improving is what defines penumbra. last fall, when we launched penumbra jet engine, we mentioned that it was the first step in a multiphase effort to continue making the procedure better and better. we believe that our newest technologies that will progressively come this year and next year will each alone serve as significant improvements, and together will fundamentally reshape the way we think about the procedure for stroke patients.
in the first quarter, we also made progress innovating in new areas. in march, we received fda clearance for our real immersive system. as you may recall, about two years ago we formed a joint venture to try to do something better than traditional rehab for the millions of people who suffer disability from strokes and other neuro conditions. rehab is typically administered by physical and occupational therapists who try to help patients recover as much function as possible. these professionals do heroic work in their communities for these patients. our work in this area began with a belief that we can design and build technology with the potential to accelerate and improve therapists' ability to help their patients.
the real system is a fully mobilized system that creates a full presence immersive virtual reality experience. with the fda clearance, we will begin the journey to potentially help millions of stroke rehab patients. we are very busy with the next phase of this work, and we will plan to provide an update on how we see the commercial opportunity later this year.
creating the real system demonstrates the very best of penumbra. in a very short time our dedicated team took an idea, built an entirely new team, and then created a sophisticated platform that could help millions of people. this is the result of penumbra's unique and lasting culture of innovation.
i'll now turn the call over to sri to review the financials.
sri kosaraju -- chief financial officer and head of strategy
thank you, adam.
for the first quarter ended march 31, 2019 our total revenues were $128.4 million, an increase of 25.1% reported and 27.2% in constant currency compared to the first quarter of 2018. our geographic mix of sales in the quarter were 64% us and 36% international. neuro and vascular represented 63% and 37% of sales respectively.
in the quarter, we saw very strong momentum across our entire business, demonstrated by strong sequential growth and strong year-over-year growth despite difficult comparables. revenue from our neuro business grew to $81.5 million in the first quarter of 2019, an increase of 14.1% reported and 16.5% in constant currency compared to the same period a year ago. our neuro growth was primarily driven by sales of our penumbra system for ischemic stroke, where we saw strong sequential growth.
within the united states our sense is that the ischemic stroke market is growing according to our expectations and that physician preference for frontline aspiration continues to grow. the compass trial and recent publication validate this trend. outside of the united states, we saw strong growth as well, and as a reminder our results can vary on a quarterly basis as we enter new geographies.
revenue from our vascular business grew to $47 million in the first quarter of 2019, an increase of 50.2% reported and 51.8% in constant currency compared to the same period last year. in the quarter our vascular growth was driven by results from both our thrombectomy and embolization businesses. we are increasingly encouraged by the future long term growth potential of this business. as a reminder, our growth accelerated beginning in the second quarter of last year with the addition of new customers and the introduction of new products.
our gross margin in the quarter was 65.3% of revenues compared to 64.8% of revenues for the same quarter last year. total operating expenses for the quarter were $72.8 million or 56.6% of revenue compared to $62.5 million or 60.9% of revenue for the same quarter a year ago. our research and development expenses were $11.7 million for q1 2019 compared to $8 million for q1 2018. sg&a expenses were $61.1 million for q1 2019 compared to $54.5 million for q1 '18. our spend increased primarily due to increases in headcount and related compensation expense.
we had operating income in the quarter of $11.2 million compared to operating income of $4 million for the same period last year. we continue to expect to invest in the growth of our current business and also in the development of potential new areas.
as it relates to our revenue guidance, while we are not formally revising our states 2019 revenue range of $525-535 million, we do feel comfortable toward the top end or slightly above the top end of our initial range. following two consecutive quarters of strong sequential growth and consistent with our commentary on quarterly variability, we would expect to see our second quarter revenues only slightly above our first quarter.
and now i'd like to turn the call back to adam for closing remarks.
adam elsesser -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you, sri. normally we would end our remarks by highlighting a particular patient's story as an acknowledgment to everyone, including the penumbra team, of the critical importance of the work we do every day. this quarter i would like to slightly alter that tradition and instead end our remarks by highlighting the physicians who are on the frontlines of the significant change taking place, removing blood clot in the peripheral arteries and veins.
i have spent the last several weeks traveling with our commercial team throughout the united states meeting with physicians. we learned a great deal from them about their practices and the challenges they face. we have also been able to share our vision of how we are trying to shift the paradigm regarding the blood clot in the body. i would like to share a representative story from a few weeks ago.
we visited a physician in the heartland who had not yet used our indigo system for clot removal. his approach was to use older legacy tools and techniques. our commercial team recently approached him and began to share how penumbra's approach could change his practice over time. following that work i joined our team in discussing with him our long term ambition in this area. after careful deliberation he agreed to consider our approach.
soon after these discussions he asked our team to come to the hospital because he was treating a teenage girl with a very complex issue in her veins. in his first case using the indigo system he was able to successfully remove the clot and resolve the symptoms. the result was great for this young girl, but it also represented the start of a new opportunity for this physician and his practice. this illustrates how our amazing team is tackling this challenge and the opportunity to fundamentally change the paradigm of treatment.
thank you for your attention on this call, and we look forward to further updates on our progress. we would now like to open the call for questions. thank you.

at this time i would like to remind everyone in order to ask a question press * then the number 1 on your telephone keypad. we'll pause for just a moment to compile the q&a roster.
your first question comes from the line of robby marcus with jp morgan.
robby marcus -- jp morgan -- analyst
great, and congrats on the good quarter.
adam elsesser -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks, robby.
robby marcus -- jp morgan -- analyst
so maybe i'll just combine my two questions here. first, there was a lot of noise out in the market about competition coming from your competitors in the first quarter. doesn't look like we've seen it yet in the first quarter. you've put up really good numbers in neurovascular. so maybe talk about what you're seeing out in the market.
and then second follow-up question, in peripheral vascular you made the comment that this is for stroke cases four years ago. you know, this is a market i think people understand a little less, and there's no big clinical catalyst coming. so help us understand why you made that statement, and how do we get it to where stroke is today? thanks.
adam elsesser -- chairman and chief executive officer
great. well, thanks, robby, for both those questions. let me start with the first question around competition in the stroke market. really, i think there's sort of three sort of points to make here. the first, we have not seen really or experienced any competitive activity that we haven't seen during the last three years or that was really unexpected by us. but there is, i think, a little bit different dynamic here, sort of a, if you will, a potential benefit to this round of competition that is actually very helpful to penumbra. right now there are so many aspiration systems out there, from big companies and small companies, and that has really validated what we have said for a long time that aspiration is the primary frontline tool. and i think the market now has embraced that. they know that because everyone has joined that market.
so this for us has been really helpful because, as you know, we've never had 100% market share in the stroke market, and this allows us the chance to go educate new customers on our devices that we haven't been able to do before. that's sort of the first point.
the second is we're saying that, you know, we feel really good about where we are right now in terms of our place in the market in a competitive way, but we're also extremely confident about where we will lead the market in the next several years. and then finally, and this might be the most important point, when you take our incredible stroke franchise that we're obviously proud on, you add it to our faster growing vascular business, and then you add some of the new opportunities, one of which we talked about today, penumbra as a company is really well positioned for growth for many years to come. so we feel like we're in a good spot.
to address your specific question on peripheral, how does one think about this? it's true that there isn't yet an obvious catalyst like a clinical trial that takes care of the whole area because this is not that easy. and we're here in 2019 talking about it for the first time really because it's that hard. and just to remind you of some basic sort of statistics, there are a million people, just taking us numbers but obviously globally this many more, a million people in the us alone every year have some form of clot in their body. i don't mean in the head or in the heart but just in the body, and that's not good. no one has said that that's a benefit and that that's not somehow problematic.
so just like we looked at stroke many, many years ago and started the journey, we now i think have the confidence and we've done enough work to know that we, over time, can really, really impact this. and this isn't immediate. this isn't next quarter where we go from 0% to 100%, but really impact dealing with this clot in a much more cohesive and thoughtful way. and i think the growth over the last number of quarters is showing the effect of that base or early work that we did, and we have a lot more confidence because of that. so there won't be one thing that turns the corner, but i think you just have to look at our success and i think that will show what is ahead for us.

your next question comes from the line of bob hopkins with bank of america merrill lynch. your line is open.
bob hopkins -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
oh, thanks. can you hear me ok?
adam elsesser -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. hi, bob.
bob hopkins -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
great. hey, good afternoon. so, adam, you don't often proactively talk about your pipeline, and i heard something on the stroke side that i wanted to get a little bit more color on because you talked about fundamentally reshaping the market and you talked about new technology launches coming this year and next year. so i was wondering if you could just develop those comments a little bit more for us because they obviously sound pretty interesting.
adam elsesser -- chairman and chief executive officer
no. i always like my one word answers with you. listen, it's not actually a new comment other than putting out a little bit of a timeframe. when we launched penumbra jet engine, we went, i think, out of our way to say we renamed the sort of series, if you will, and every time we do that it's the beginning of what will be a series of new things coming, not a one-off product. and by putting a timeframe out there, it obviously is simply giving you guys a sense of our confidence of where we are between this year and next.
and there's a lot of work to still be done. we aren't yet at a point where treating stroke is just so benign and easy that it's just sort of an expected thing that we can remove the clot in every patient easily, but that's where we have to keep heading. and that's where our just constant work and innovation -- and our team, i really wanna give a shout out to what we call the ""pengineers."" they have never given up, and they have just continued to do things that really have never been done, never thought was possible, and we're just getting closer to it and have a higher confidence than ever before that we can do that.
bob hopkins -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
so are these new -- maybe i'll try sri. so are these new relative to the guidance? are these incremental to the guidance? or are these things that were contemplated at the beginning of the year?
sri kosaraju -- chief financial officer and head of strategy
yeah, bob, our sort of historical approach in the guidance is to update it based on everything that we know at the time, and as you know we try not to go into a lot of specific detail about specific areas, products, or geographies. but i guess the fair thing to say is it's updated based on sort of everything as we sit here today that we know.
bob hopkins -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
okay. and then lastly, adam, you also talked with peripheral and indigo with some sort of new confidence in kind of quantifying the market opportunity, or at least that's what i thought i heard. so is there an update to how you guys are thinking about the market opportunity for indigo specifically? and i hear you on the 1 million patients, but i'm just -- it sounded like something a little bit more specific as it related to indigo in terms of how you think about the market opportunity.
sri kosaraju -- chief financial officer and head of strategy
so maybe just something on the market sizing, and adam can jump in on this as well. but i think most of the investors are used to hearing us talk about the incidents that the million patients that adam referenced in the united states and the treatable patients of 150,000, which is somewhat analogous to how we describe the addressable market on the stroke side, but i think what we said pretty more directly in this call was we see the visibility on being able to grow the opportunity where indigo can be used, we see as a strong likelihood and with greater visibility. so the opportunity to be in greater markets for that number to grow i think is an opportunity for us that could benefit indigo in our results.
and the second thing is, you know, we mentioned that we feel like we're only in 10% of that initial addressable market, and naturally as that market gets bigger we'll be a smaller percentage. so the opportunity to kind of penetrate that market, and we talked about all the ways in which you do that and the catalysts, whether it's on the technology side or clinical data side, those are the two opportunities that give us a great deal of confidence that there's some pretty long term sustainable growth for us to have in that part of the business.
bob hopkins -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
great. adam, sri, thank you.
sri kosaraju -- chief financial officer and head of strategy
thanks, bob.
adam elsesser -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks, bob.

your next question comes from the line of larry bieglesen with wells fargo. your line is open.
larry bieglesen -- wells fargo -- analyst
hey, guys. thanks for taking the question. one on stroke, one on the new real system. so it looks like you had a pretty big acceleration in neuro on a stack two year basis in q1. so my question is was that driven by us or ous? i remember in q4 you said the us market grew by over 30% for stroke and international was relatively flat-ish or i think you could back into that? so i'm just curious how those two trended in q1. and on the stroke market, i think you had guided, your guidance assumed only about 5,000 new cases in 2019 versus 8,000-10,000 last year. has anything changed on your thinking about the stroke market growth for 2019? and i had one follow up.
sri kosaraju -- chief financial officer and head of strategy
sure. larry, those are great clarifying questions. on the neuro side of the business, i think as you look at this against last quarter, and i think the thing that becomes somewhat challenging for folks who tend to look at this on a year-over-year basis, the comps and even last quarter when we talked about the dynamics in japan make it hard sometimes to look at that. but if you just look sequentially from last quarter, the neuro business grew 10%, and we saw, i mentioned in my commentary, strong sequential growth on the stroke side.
the comment that we also made, we said that the feelings about how the stroke business is in the united states but also the comments about how it is outside of the united states. we're confident in the opportunity. we think there's a lot of runway outside the united states for us. as you know, stroke is a global disease, and we're just entering some parts of the world newly. in much of those areas those are with a little bit of a different commercial model, too, that being working with distributor partners.
so where you see us entering a new geography, where you see us launching new products, both with distributors like we did in japan, you're gonna see some variability. the international results you could tell last quarter looked a little bit lighter than previously. this quarter you can tell are stronger, and what we're saying is there's some variability to that and particularly as we go into q2, as well. so that's, i think, some help on sort of the dynamics if you look at us or outside of the us and a little more pointed commentary around what to expect.
on the stroke side, you're absolutely right. last quarter we talked about our guidance reflecting an expectation. we said it was around 6,000 or 7,000 patients, additional patients treated in 2019 over 2018, and that's simply just looking at sort of an average of the last three years of patient growth that we've seen. so that's what reflective in our guidance and what we continue to believe and what we're currently reflecting in our updated guidance today.
larry bieglesen -- wells fargo -- analyst
thank you. and then on the real immersive system, adam, you know, you commented on that earlier. i guess my question is, adam, any color you can provide on the business model? i mean, it seems like a significant opportunity, but at this point it's hard to give you any credit for it today. i mean, could this be as big, for example, as neuro or vascular over time? any color would be helpful. thank you.
adam elsesser -- chairman and chief executive officer
that's a great question, and i give you credit for tempting me to answer in sort of a more detailed way than i really am prepared to do now. i will just point -- the answer is if you measure the number of patients we can help, and i said that in my prepared remarks, we can help an awful lot of patients when you look at all of neuro rehab. it really touches people into the millions a year, and so that by definition matters and is a significant effort and journey for us to do that. we want to be able to do that. so if we just stay with that way of talking about it, i think you will understand how important it is for those people that we can help. in terms of trying to quantify it in dollars and all that, it is just premature, and we will promise you we will do that later this year.
larry bieglesen -- wells fargo -- analyst
thanks for taking the questions, guys.
sri kosaraju -- chief financial officer and head of strategy
thanks, larry.
adam elsesser -- chairman and chief executive officer

again, if you would like to ask a question. please press *1 on your telephone keypad. your next question comes from the line of jason mills with cannaccord genuity. your line is open.
jason mills -- cannaccord genuity, inc. -- analyst
thank you, adam, sri, and dan. can you hear me ok?
adam elsesser -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. hi, jason.
jason mills -- cannaccord genuity, inc. -- analyst
good afternoon, adam. how are you? i wanna just start with peripheral thrombectomy. so i'm gonna do my best at making a simple question hard because that's just my thing, but you have a market or business that's doubled in two years. so rule 72s, you know, some 35% growth, but you've accelerated that in the last year. at a physician level, we've talked a lot about triaging and the development of the market in stroke. what's going on in taking fat out of the peripheral veins and arteries at a customer level that might explain this acceleration? and what are you doing to exacerbate it vis-a-vis salesforce? you haven't given us granular detail there, but maybe qualitatively you could talk about what you're doing there.
and to a previous question about data, what was clear in 2015 at the stroke conference was the paradigm changing data that changed stroke. understanding there's nothing in the pipeline right now, but do you think that that will be something that will drive market acceleration again at some point in the future? and what can we look for in that regard?
adam elsesser -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah, jason, i think it's a really good question. let me try to just answer it sort of just in sort of trying to describe what we've actually done, both in the field and with sort of how we think about the market. so we started out addressing and sort of focusing on the patients that were already getting intervene done. that's the sort of 150,000 roughly patients that have some form of clot in their peripheral arteries or veins that are having some form of intervention, that could be catheter-directed lysis or some combination of legacy tools or us. and that was the group that we started. they're already there. they're already being treated by a physician, either an interventional radiologist, a vascular surgeon, or in some cases interventional cardiologist.
and so we started sort of one group, the interventional radiologist. we started working then last year with the vascular surgeons and obviously now the interventional cardiologists. and we're just starting to educate them. it was sort of the representative story that i told. somebody who hadn't used our product who really spent the time with our team and then me to understand its...benefits, its limitations, its techniques, and then used to great success on really kind of a profoundly satisfying case with that teenage girl.
so that's the effort that we've been doing. i think what you're hearing is two things. one is our confidence in that effort, in the sort of ability to continue to have those dialogues, continue to have those interactions and see the success that comes from that. and that's what you're seeing in our numbers, and that's what you're seeing in sort of our comments today.
the other part that you talked about sort of with data is still relevant. we indicated that we think there's a possibility of expanding that 150,000 patients to be a much larger number, and that's gonna have to come from data...over time. and that is really a cool opportunity, an important opportunity for us to take on on top of the continued penetration of the 150,000. when you add both of those together, there's just an awful lot of room for us to have success in this field really for a number of years ahead of us, and that's what you're hearing in our voice right now.
jason mills -- cannaccord genuity, inc. -- analyst
that's helpful, and then i'm gonna ask you about intracerebral hemorrhage because i care about it. you haven't talked about it much. it's another opportunity that you mentioned about mentioning it, i think. but what struck me at the isc meeting in hawaii was the level of discussion about endoscopic techniques for evacuation, and clearly you have an advanced effort there. and what also struck me is the juxtaposition of the physicians that care and those that actually are doing stroke, and many of them seem to be step-retriever people. so if you're helping them with ich, and maybe you could give us an update on the trials, maybe also talk about the leverage that you can bring to bear with respect to technology, not just in stroke, to bob's question, but also in evacuation of ich and its ability to augment over time your stroke business. or am i overreaching there, which is entirely possible? thanks.
adam elsesser -- chairman and chief executive officer
that's a great question, jason. so before i start to talk about the relationship between the physicians doing this procedure and our products, let me sort of address isc, the international stroke conference, and the trial. just to remind everyone, the misty-3 study was presented. it turned out not to be successful, but it wasn't using our product or technique but an older idea. and it showed, though, the one thing that if you remove enough of the clot, if you will, there's a better chance for patients to do better, which is really what our whole premise has been. and don't use lytic, don't open up a big whole. do a minimally evasive approach and remove an awful lot of the clot.
and so i think that trial opened the door for a lot of people to be confident in our approach and what we think we can do with this group of patients. i think this will be different than the peripheral opportunity in that it does, i think, require our trial to show that this is the right way to go. i don't have any specific updates on this call. we have announced in the past that trials can take several years. that hasn't changed in the couple of months since we last said that. so we're gonna just do the hard work and hope that we can bring to bear something that will help this group of patients.
as it relates to the neurosurgeons who also do endovascular work who would use artemis for hemorrhage, there is some overlap. there's obviously lots of open neurosurgeons who don't do endovascular work who aren't in overlap. it is certainly not impossible that as you spend time with one customer, they may hear and understand our other approach, but it's not typically how we sort of think about things. we remain pretty focused clinically on what we're doing, particularly when we're in an experimental study like the mind trial, and we remain pretty serious about that. so i don't think that's something that we would look at and count on as a driver there. doesn't mean we won't go to them separately in a different time and place and make sure that they're using the right tool for stroke.
jason mills -- cannaccord genuity, inc. -- analyst
fair enough. thank you.

and your last question comes from the line of joanne winch with bank of america -- with bmo. sorry. your line is open.
joanne winch -- bmo -- analyst
[audio cut] joanne. how are you guys doing?
adam elsesser -- chairman and chief executive officer
we're good.
joanne winch -- bmo -- analyst
good. good. so my first question is on cat rx. i haven't heard much about it if at all during the call. could you provide us an update on that launch? and then has that taken a back seat on a priority basis to the real system? that seems to be getting more attention lately.
adam elsesser -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. that's a great question. i'm actually grateful you brought it up. so the cat rx is one of the three or four devices that make up the indigo system. so when we talk about indigo and removing clot, the cat rx is part of that, and it is, i think as we said i think on the last call maybe or the one before, the product itself is performing incredibly well.
the three physician groups or trained type of physicians that use all of these products are interventional radiologists, vascular surgeons, and interventional cardiologists. so the cat rx is a really important tool in its own right in terms of removing clot from the coronary arteries, and there are an awful lot of patients that have it that this tool has been very effective on. at the same time it's also a really helpful tool as we move into that third group of physicians that also do a lot of the peripheral work. so there's a lot to cover and we certainly didn't call out every product sort of by subcategory, but it has definitely been a well-received product and is part of our longer-term strategy that we're talking about in the vascular business.
it is not at all taking a back seat to real. that's really a separate opportunity, and, as i said on the call in my prepared remarks, we really had built a whole new team around that product so that we can do more than one thing at once. and there will be no effort lost on any of our current business because of real and what we're trying to accomplish there.
joanne winch -- bmo -- analyst
that's helpful. and then lastly for me, just an accounting question. sri, you talked about the ous neuro business, you know, the results can vary on a quarterly basis. was there any stocking that took place this quarter or anything else that we should be aware of as we look at the first quarter and second quarter or even just the quarterly cadence throughout the year?
sri kosaraju -- chief financial officer and head of strategy
the comment about variability in international and we talked about moving into new geographies, and i think you've heard this commentary from us before about that. and in some of these countries we're working with distributors, so whether you call it -- you know, it's really a function of them launching newly into a geography, and until we see that sort of normalize you're gonna see a couple quarters that don't look even.
stocking is, you know, it sometimes is used interchangeably with that concept, but in the case of stroke, these are largely devices that we're selling that aren't sort of sitting on a shelf or consigned. so the usage is what we're gonna start to see after a couple quarters in some of these newer geographies that we enter, but there are new entries into new geographies that we're seeing in the first quarter.
joanne winch -- bmo -- analyst
that makes sense. thank you very much.

adam elsesser -- chairman, chief executive officer, and president
thank you, qi. good afternoon and thank you for joining penumbra's second quarter 2019 conference call. our total revenues for the second quarter were $134.2 million, a year-over-year increase of 22.4% as reported and 23.8% in constant currency. we had operating income in the quarter of $12.8 million compared to $9.3 million for the same period last year. as we finish the first half of 2019, our business continues to have great momentum and growing opportunities to help more and more patients. our overall revenue growth is being driven by the ischemic stroke market as well as our ability to develop new and significant opportunities within the vascular market. on today's call, i would like to focus on two important updates.
first, as you may remember on our last earnings call, we spent time discussing the number of patients that could be treated in the united states with peripheral thrombectomy. when we first launched our indigo system four years ago, we estimated that 150,000 patients could benefit from our system. now, four years later, with greater understanding of the variety of cases and with advancements in training and techniques, we believe the indigo system has the potential address over 350,000 patients per year in the united states. this figure represents the number of patients with clot in their body who are currently being treated either surgically or interventionally. it will take us time to penetrate this patient opportunity, and future technology improvements will be important for us to do so. in addition, as the procedure improves and is made easier and easier, it is possible that the addressable patient opportunity could grow even higher.
to put this into context for penumbra, our current addressable patient opportunity in peripheral thrombectomy is larger than our estimates of the addressable opportunity in ischemic stroke. taken together, we see the ability for our company to positively impact well over a half a million patients each year in the united states alone. this gives our team a huge amount of motivation and the confidence and dedication to positively impact as many of these patients as possible.
[audio cuts out] neuro franchise, last september, we launched penumbra jet 7 and engine in the united states, which marked the beginning of a new phase of innovation for penumbra in ischemic stroke. the penumbra jet 7 aspiration catheter, when paired with the penumbra engine, provides the strongest thrombus removal force available, which we believe increases the ability to quickly remove the blood clot causing the stroke. now, less than a year later, we're advancing the jet platform with an important and novel technology called xtra flex. this technology, developed through highly innovative engineering and design substantially improves navigation and trackability while maintaining the full lumen of the catheter and therefore delivering the strongest thrombus removal force in the market.
the introduction of the xtra flex technology is part of a new series of stroke technologies that we began discussing earlier this year. it was first showcased a few weeks ago at the society of neurointerventional surgery meeting and has received extremely positive feedback on its performance. we're excited by the early success of this new technology and even more excited about our subsequent innovations, which can ultimately transform the procedure and address the critical issues of fast and complete clot removal.
the importance of aspiration as a front-line treatment for stroke patients is now clear. in addition to the strong clinical data, aspiration has also been validated by our competitors. this validation has motivated us at penumbra, as we take on the complicated engineering challenges in order to make the procedure faster and more effective for patients. we believe that we have the vision, experience, and multifaceted engineering discipline needed to solve these challenges. we are committed to lead the field forward as we move to newer and more advanced ideas.
while we were at the snis meeting, we also observed a few consistent themes through the meeting that support our broader view of their future of stroke treatment. physicians and hospitals are focused on optimizing their stroke systems of care. there was a broad interest in exploring the expanded use of thrombectomy to treat tangential patient populations, and lastly, it is clear that advancements in technology can play an important role in improving stroke patient care in the future.
along these lines, snis represented the first time that we publicly demonstrated the real system for neuro rehab. the consistently positive feedback at the meeting further validated the work we have done over the past few years with rehab specialists around the country. we expect to share more details of our commercial plan later this year.
before i turn the call over to sri, i would like to share an extraordinary patient story from a few months ago. we had previously shared many uplifting stories about stroke patients, but today's story is different. a young boy came home one day and interrupted a home invasion. at that moment, the unthinkable happened, and this young boy was shot from behind by the intruder in the neck and head. fortunately, the boy was found and rushed to the hospital where dr. dwayne anderson of our lady of the lake medical center in baton rouge, louisiana saw bleeding from the boy's carotid artery and the arteries feeding his nose. he opted to use penumbra's very specialized pod 400 and pack 400 neuro embolization coils, which are specifically designed to stop blood flow in the arteries, as opposed to the more traditional use in aneurysms.
typically, dr. anderson would have used adjunct tools to help stop the flow of blood, but with the quick and successful placement of these coils, he was able to complete the procedure very quickly. dr. anderson's skill and the use of our specialized coil helped this young boy come out of this procedure with no neuro deficit at all-a truly remarkable result. these are the stories that motivate all of us. we are grateful to dr. anderson and his entire staff for their great work on this case and for the recovery of this young boy.
i'll now turn the call over to sri to review the financials.
sri kosaraju -- chief financial officer and head of strategy
thank you, adam. for the second quarter ended june 30, 2019, our total revenues were $134.2 million, an increase of 22.4% reported and 23.8% in constant currency. our geographic mix of sales in the quarter were 64% us and 36% international. neuro and vascular represented 61% and 39% of sales respectively.
in the quarter, we saw great momentum across our business, which resulted in sequential growth over an exceptional first quarter. revenue from our neuro business grew to $81.5 million in the second quarter of 2019, an increase of 9.9% reported and 11.5% in constant currency compared to the same period a year ago. our neuro growth was primarily driven by sales of our penumbra system for ischemic stroke. through the first half of the year, we faced difficult year-over-year comparisons in neuro, particularly in neuro embolization. additionally, as you may recall from our fourth quarter of last year, with the launch of our peripheral embolization products in japan, we saw aa shifting of revenue from neuro to vascular. we have seen the stroke market growth and competitive dynamics both within our expectations. as we look ahead to the back half of the year, we're encouraged by our pipeline of innovation and the recent introduction of penumbra jet 7 xtra flex.
revenue from our vascular business grew to $52.7 million in the second quarter of 2019, an increase of 48.6% reported and 49.5% in constant currency. in the quarter, our vascular growth was driven by results from both our thrombectomy and embolization businesses. we are continuing to see accelerated growth from initiatives to reach new customers, to introduce new technologies, and to enter new geographies. as we head into the back half of the year, we expect to see our momentum continue, but with normalizing year-over-year growth rates.
our gross margin in the quarter was 70% of revenues compared to 65.9% of revenues for the same quarter last year. compared to last quarter, our gross margin increased due to favorable revenue mix and lower production variances. while we are encouraged by our gross margin performance in the quarter, which is the highest that it's been since going public in 2015, we do not yet expect this to be a new level. given new product launches and further operational expansion initiatives through next year, we would expect our gross margins to remain within our historical levels.
total operating expense for the quarter was $81.1 million, or 60.5% of revenue, compared to $63 million, or 57.4% of revenue, for the same quarter a year ago. as previously discussed, we are actively investing in our growing opportunities, which will result in growth in our r&d and sg&a spend. our research and development expenses were $13.5 million in q2 2019 compared to $8.2 million for q2 2018. r&d expenses increased due to an increase in costs related to development programs within both existing and new areas. sg&a expenses were $67.7 million for q2 2019 compared to $54.8 million for q2 2018. our spend increased primarily due to increases in headcount and related compensation expense.
we had operating income in the quarter of $12.8 million compared to operating income of $9.3 million for the same period last year. we continue to expect to invest in the growth of our current business and also in the development of potential new areas.
with the update of our second quarter results, we are formally increasing our 2019 revenue guidance to be in the range of $535 million to $540 million. this new range compares to our previous range of $525 million to $535 million. as it relates to the third quarter, we typically see summer seasonality and expect our revenues to be sequentially flat to our second quarter results.
and now, i'd like to turn the call back to adam for closing remarks.
adam elsesser -- chairman, chief executive officer, and president
thank you, sri. as we move into the second half of 2019, we have laid the groundwork for a new chapter of the penumbra story. we have confidence in our ability to develop, produce, and sell market-leading devices in our current areas of neuro and vascular diseases. we have also honed these skills and applied them in new areas, such as neuro rehab.
just as important as the actual products, we are well under way in evolution and growth of the entire leadership team at penumbra. this starts with the addition of our new board members who will be taking over leadership roles at key committees as well as the development and growth of our expansive and amazing management team. we have leaders -- in many cases, three to five layers deep -- in specific departments and functions that have developed the maturity and skills that allow us to have this strong conviction that we can continue to scale our growing business for many years to come. our leaders are thriving as they take on new and additional challenges. with this capacity, we are excited to embark on the next chapter of the penumbra story.
...
thank you, and now we'll open the call to questions.

at this time, i would like to remind everyone in order to ask a question, press *1 on your telephone keypad. we'll pause for just a moment to compile the q&a roster.
your first question comes from bob hopkins with bank of america. your line is open.
bob hopkins -- bank of america merrill lynch -- managing director
great, thanks, and good afternoon. great results overall. a bit more weighted to vascular than we modeled, so i just wanted to ask you a couple questions on neurovascular to make sure i understand the moving pieces. the year-over-year of neurovascular growth decelerated a little bit relative to q1. it was flat sequentially. can you just talk about some of the dynamics in the second quarter of neurovascular results that caused a little bit of a de-cel in q2?
sri kosaraju -- chief financial officer and head of strategy
sure. hey, bob, it's sri. in the year-over-year context and growth rate that you mentioned, neuro, obviously, there's three components within that franchise: stroke, neuro embolization, and neuro access. as we mentioned in our prepared comments, most of that year-over-year comp-related issue resides in neuro embolization. if you look at the us, obviously, we're focused on stroke. and if you look outside the us, in q4, we highlighted a pretty substantial shift of revenues related to our japan peripheral embolization launch, so it's really a shifting of revenues. it doesn't affect the overall level of revenues but just where it resides, and some of that is settling down. so, really, the acute focus and the comp is really around neuro embolization. the other two franchises performed with good momentum.
bob hopkins -- bank of america merrill lynch -- managing director
and then, just curious if you could talk a little bit about the feedback from snis on xtra flex aspiration catheter. maybe just mention that the early feedback you're getting on the launch, and should that lead to perhaps an uptick in neurovascular stroke growth as we look to the back half of the year?
adam elsesser -- chairman, chief executive officer, and president
bob, it's adam. thanks, and a good question. as i alluded to on the prepared remarks, the reaction from customers has really been pretty extraordinary. we have done a number of cases, enough to give us a fair amount of confidence that that reaction is pretty universal, and obviously, as you know, this field is not standing still. it's constantly changing and evolving, but at this moment in time with this particular product, we have a lot of confidence that in the back half of the year, we can continue to push this field forward with its performance.
bob hopkins -- bank of america merrill lynch -- managing director
great. i'll leave it at that. thank you.
adam elsesser -- chairman, chief executive officer, and president

your next question comes from larry biegelsen with wells fargo. your line is open.
larry biegelsen -- wells fargo -- senior medical device equity research analyst
hey, guys. thanks for taking the question. so, one on peripheral, one on neuro. so, maybe, adam, a little more color on what's driving the growth there. from a products standpoint, it sounds like it was pretty balanced with embolization and thrombectomy. maybe you can talk about from an indication standpoint, from a physician specialty standpoint just a little bit more color on what's driving the pretty extraordinary growth in peripheral, and then i had a follow-up.
adam elsesser -- chairman, chief executive officer, and president
sure. on the peripheral side, let's touch on the embolization part of the business. that continues to grow nicely. as we've said i think a few times, as that product, which it's a series of coils, gets broader and broader exposure, we're able to start to have physicians think about types of cases that they might not have used traditional coil technology to treat but other types of embolization tools, and so we think that it's potentially sustainable for a while as we grow that part of the business. on the thrombectomy side, it really comes down to just the simple math that we're incredibly underpenetrated still, and as we get broader exposure and more and more physicians are starting to think about clot in the body differently than they did traditionally and sort of embrace the idea of just taking it out, we think that we can grow that business for some time. as i said on the call, if the number is 350,000, and that's without adding potentially new areas or applications, i think we're in pretty good shape for growth there for a while.
larry biegelsen -- wells fargo -- senior medical device equity research analyst
thanks, adam. and then on ischemic stroke, could you give a little bit of color on us versus ous ischemic stroke growth in the quarter? and i'll give you an opportunity -- there's obviously some public data from iqvia showing your us aspiration business is declining in recent months. it's a sample, obviously, but i thought it would be useful to hear your perspective on that data. thanks for taking the questions.
sri kosaraju -- chief financial officer and head of strategy
larry, it's sri. just to touch on stroke, so obviously, there's a lot of data sources that are out there. we obviously are aware of them all. they're all varied in where they come from, the type of information that they survey. we know our results. i think we have a pretty close touch, given our presence and share in the market. we've always contended that the growth of the market is the bigger factor in sensitivity to our results, and when we introduced our guidance early in february, we talked about the notion of looking at the last three years of patient growth in thinking about 6,000 to 7,000 patients more this year that could be treated as a market. so, that's high-teens growth. that's in the us, and we feel like through the first half of the year that that has been consistent with what our expectations and predictions have been. i think we feel as we go forward, that continues to be our prediction for the year.
as it relates to outside the us, there is a vast opportunity for us to treat stroke patients. the populations and incidents already speak for themselves. i think as we talked about in other calls, we expect some variability outside the us business, a lot of that entering new markets, a lot of that with distributors. if you look sort of going back to q4, q1, and certainly this quarter, i think we took the expectation that there would be some variability outside the us and stroke. but i would just wrap all that up by saying our overall stroke business is strong. it's got great momentum, and particularly, as we look forward to the back half of the year, we feel quite good.
larry biegelsen -- wells fargo -- senior medical device equity research analyst
thanks for taking the questions, guys.

your next question comes from jason mills with canaccord genuity. your line is open.
jason mills -- canaccord genuity -- managing director
hi, adam and sri. can you hear me ok?
adam elsesser -- chairman, chief executive officer, and president
yeah. hi, jason.
jason mills -- canaccord genuity -- managing director
good afternoon. i wanted, adam and sri, to talk about three topics. you covered a lot in stroke and thrombectomy, and i wanted to cover those areas in a little way, and then also gross margin. on stroke, the setup in the second half of the year is a bit different than the first half. sri, you talked a little bit about that given the comp, and adam talked about the xtra flex launch and the momentum early there, can you talk about your setup as a company in us stroke in the second half of the year relative to that high-teens procedure volume growth for the market sort of juxtaposed to the first half and what you faced without xtra flex in the first half?
and then, peripheral thrombectomy, i'm curious what sort of color you'd be willing to give, adam, with respect to growth coming from uptake or utilization increases of existing accounts versus new accounts using thrombectomy that otherwise were doing drips heretofore. and then the last part, gross margins that you commented on, that's a phenomenal gross margin. should we expect it to go back to the 65% level, or with volume increases, should we expect to see that improve over time? thanks, guys.
sri kosaraju -- chief financial officer and head of strategy
hey, jason. it's sri. i'll start with a couple responses to your questions and adam can take a few of the other ones that you had asked. related to stroke, i think you hit the nail on the head, and i think there's going to be, i think as you look at the neuro division number, a lot of questions to look into the details of it. as i mentioned, there are tougher comps in neuro in the front half of the year, and as you alluded to, the back half of the year changes quite a bit.
neuro embolization, you can look at your own modeling of it. the comps change dramatically as we head to the back half. so, there is that sort of comp-related issue, but if we think about the thing that really matters, which is sort of where is the business today, the momentum we have in the business, and how it's growing sequentially, specifically in stroke. we are seeing that momentum, and with the market, which again, we continue to think is the bigger driver of our results and also with some of the new things that we talked about here, as i said, we obviously feel like we got great momentum heading into the back half.
let me just comment on gross margins for a second, and i'll let adam sort of catch more on the jet 7 xtra flex and peripheral questions. gross margins, this is the highest gross margin that we've had as a public company, so we're obviously very enthused about it. the expectations we've set around gross margin is not to be driving that right now, so that truly is a very encouraging sign that we could achieve that in the current dynamic where we're growing quite rapidly, expanding operations, and launching new products, but we are in the midst of launching a new product in jet 7 xtra flex. we believe that we will have other new products to be launching, and we're in the midst of really growing our capacity, not just in alameda but also in roseville, california as well.
so, i think the right expectation that we would share is that mid-60% as we're going through this period, but i'll say i think we are extremely encouraged that we hit 70% this quarter. and maybe i'll let adam touch on the remaining questions.
adam elsesser -- chairman, chief executive officer, and president
thanks, jason. let me touch briefly on the xtra flex launch and how it sort of fits in, and then i'll try to answer the peripheral question. on the xtra flex launch, so the first half of the year, i am extremely proud of the whole penumbra team. we, as you know, are constantly facing new catheters launched in this field and have for many years, and the team has done a great job of reminding and educating everyone sort of what matters in this field, and it's a number of things. you need to be able to get the clot out as fast as possible, and you wanna be able to track and navigate your product there, but you also then wanna be able to sort of ingest the clot as fast as possible. and so, with the original jet 7 and engine, we really pushed the ball forward with the part of being able to have the largest catheter with the most thrombus removal force.
with this update to that product, being able to make it even more navigable is really gonna give the team a lot of momentum going into the back half of the year. and as we also said, that's not the end of the line. that's not the last product out there, and we feel that there's more to come that will continue to move that ball forward. so, we're in a really positive and exciting phase as it relates to our stroke franchise.
now, on the peripheral side, a very specific question around where we're seeing the growth on the peripheral thrombectomy side, either adding new accounts or seeing existing accounts expand the number of patients or the types of patients that they're treating, and the answer is really both. we're seeing both happen. it really depends on when and how those accounts are sort of coming on board. many times, they come on board specifically focused on one type of disease and expand beyond that, and so we're really the beneficiary of both further penetration by new accounts as well as deeper penetration into existing accounts.
jason mills -- canaccord genuity -- managing director
thank you both.
adam elsesser -- chairman, chief executive officer, and president

your next question comes from the line of robbie marcus with jp morgan. your line is open.
robbie marcus -- jp morgan -- senior analyst
great, thanks for the question. two from me. first, adam, at the end of your prepared remarks, you made the comment that you're moving into the next chapter of penumbra, and i know you guys are always excited about the business and the products, but i don't think i've heard you guys talk about the next chapters for several years now. maybe you could just give us a recap of why it's the next chapter, what to look forward to, and what you're most excited about?
adam elsesser -- chairman, chief executive officer, and president
that's a great question, and i'm delighted, robbie, to be able to sort of attack it. so, we really have three areas that make up the next chapter. first, and i never want anyone to not believe that we care about this because we started out really treating stroke patients, and we are incredibly confident and excited about the products that we have now and coming in the future as it relates to our original franchise around stroke, and i think those products, both with flex currently but with the other ones as well, provide a real catalyst for the future growth of that franchise for us.
as it relates to our vascular business, having the understanding that our addressable market is growing and can continue to grow, both with our existing products but with newer technology that will be coming in the future as well as the xtract trial that goes into new areas, that's two more catalysts in the upcoming year-plus that will allow us to be very, very confident about that part of our business.
and then, finally, when you look at new areas and the reaction broadly to what we're doing for neuro rehab and how the technology that we've developed is being viewed and reacted to by the professionals in the field, it's incredibly heartening. i mean, it's really exciting and motivating, and that performs or provides yet another catalyst in the future.
so, when you add it all up, we feel like we're in a really, really good spot, and i really particularly wanted to highlight not just the product side but just the extraordinary people that make up the penumbra team because they're maturing and growing into, as i said, just amazing leaders and have the capacity to take this that far. so, it's a great time, and we feel particularly excited about it.
robbie marcus -- jp morgan -- senior analyst
thanks. and just a follow-up on larry's question from before, sri, i just wanna make sure everybody understands because this is a big sticking point for a lot of people in terms of the stroke growth. i think everyone understands the market is growing in the high teens. we saw it even better last year, but so far it looks like high teens. just wanna make sure we understand what you're saying is that the patients growing are high teens. there's a shift from stent retrievers to more aspiration, offset by some degree of share loss, net net, you're coming out to that high-teens market growth. that's part a of the question. part b, can you give a sense of maybe where you stand in share in the us versus your international markets, if you're willing? thanks.
sri kosaraju -- chief financial officer and head of strategy
sure, robbie. i'll answer this to the best that we can and know that you're looking for some additional color around this. what i'd say is i think a lot of the parameters that we've outlined before are unchanged, and i think that's an important statement to make. i think there's a lot of questions on are things changing in a way that's different than sort of what we've been discussing, expecting, or predicting. let's talk about the market. as i mentioned, the market growth in the us, if we sort of focus on that for a moment, is moving along the expectation that we had around that 6,000 to 7,000 patients, and we see that through the first half, and then we continue to believe while the foundation is getting stronger, that that is sort of the growth that we're experiencing today.
we are of the feeling that there is a movement consistently toward aspiration as a mechanism. that, obviously, is a market phenomenon that it's hard to measure. from our experience, i think some of our other folks and peers in the space have confirmed and validated that point. and then, the third one, which is harder to measure, is competition. and people have a couple things to evaluate there -- what companies are themselves are saying, what various market data sources are saying. and as i mentioned, we're aware of the market sources out there. i'd say all of them are very different, and they all collect information in different methodologies. i think they're trying their best to be instructive, but we obviously know our information, our data, and try to triangulate on that.
it's been our expectation that as this market grows, we'll face more competitors, and as adam mentioned, none of the tactics and strategies are different than what we've experienced in the last three years. there are periods where you hear about competitive launches from one particular competitor or another. those are all things that we have, over the last three or four years, anticipated. and as we look forward, the biggest thing beyond the market is what do we do in our control, and we've outlined a strategy that isn't singular, but it's more comprehensive in how we approach the future. and today, you've heard of one of those components with the launch of jet 7 xtra flex.
internationally, i think that's a very exciting topic for us. stroke is a global disease, much more incidence outside the united states, much more opportunity. many of those countries are just getting started, and they're well behind regions like the us and europe are. we're excited. we're just getting started in some of those regions in asia and south america, and it will be, just by nature of those markets and our distribution, a bit varied quarter by quarter, but we think there is a significant amount of growth there to be had, and we're on the right track to achieve it.
so, i guess what you're hearing, net net, is the momentum and the enthusiasm that we have in this business is consistent, and as we look forward, we're quite confident we have things in place to allow us to capitalize on.

again, if you would like to ask a question, press *1 on your telephone keypad.
your next question comes from margaret kaczor with william blair. your line is open.
margaret kaczor -- william blair -- partner, medical technology analyst
hey, good afternoon, guys. thanks for taking the questions. maybe the first couple for me, and i'll probably leave it there, is on vascular. and so, i think you guys said earlier on the call, you had talked about not having full geographic coverage. i'm not sure if you guys can give us any metrics in terms of some of that market development work, the coverage that you guys do have versus don't have, and then any sense of account development, targeting of accounts, or how sticky some of that new account business has been?
sri kosaraju -- chief financial officer and head of strategy
margaret, i'll touch on the international piece, and i'll let adam touch on your second question on new accounts. vascular for us is predominantly a domestic us business right now, and as we've outlined the opportunity, you can tell the 350,000 addressable patients was a us statistic that we introduced on this call. that is a pretty significant opportunity, and there's obviously a lot of growth opportunity for us in the united states. we equally think there is an opportunity outside the united states. that's gonna take some time to develop. the first geographic opportunity for us in vascular was in the fourth quarter with the launch of our peripheral coils in japan i think that we mentioned a couple quarters ago, and that is just starting to get going. but we really are not really in many of those other countries yet, which remains a future opportunity for us, and you'll hear about that in the future.
adam elsesser -- chairman, chief executive officer, and president
and margaret, the question as it relates to sort of maybe the us business and how sticky it is, we have coverage throughout the us, but we're not fully penetrated in all the accounts, so we have that capacity. it just takes time, and education, and really training physicians and their staff to think about clots in patients differently than they've thought about, and that's been sort of the effort under way now for many years is we sort of take on that education process. the business typically is pretty darn sticky. i won't say it's 100% sticky in every situation. there are times where people may resort back to what they know and have more experience with, but the business, i think i answered it as it related to i think jason's questions. the business is both sticky and there's opportunities to gain more and more at the same time in more and more areas and diseases or types of clot, but also, there's still a lot of room to go to penetrate.
margaret kaczor -- william blair -- partner, medical technology analyst
and so, that then brings me to the next question, which was some of the tam discussion you guys had at the front-end commentary. and so, that increase for domestic, i think you took it from 150,000 to 350,000, which is a really nice jump. so, maybe talk to us about those changes. i assume that's still within pao dvt and pe, but are these patients that are already in the channel of receiving some sort of peripheral intervention, or is this more market development work and new tech development that needs to be done to kinda get to those addressable cases? thanks.
adam elsesser -- chairman, chief executive officer, and president
i think that's a really important question, and we tried to answer that really, so let me be even clearer. that number represents the number of patients that are being treated today for some form of clot in their arteries or veins, either surgically or interventionally, and we understand that broader based on the work that physicians have done with our product. and so, we've added the patients that were surgically treated as well as some areas that we didn't really think we're sort of main line, but our product has done quite well. and so, for that reason, just with the experience that we've had with our product, we've been able to sort of add those patients to our goal of going after it. it doesn't include patients in which we don't have a specific indication for and areas where we think that number could grow even more, and those patients, we will certainly talk about in the future when it's appropriate.
margaret kaczor -- william blair -- partner, medical technology analyst
great. thank you, guys.

your next question comes from joanne wuensch with bmo capital markets. your line is open.
joanne wuensch -- bmo capital markets -- managing director
good afternoon, everybody. two quick questions. can you give us an update on how you're progressing with cat rx and the coronary effort?
adam elsesser -- chairman, chief executive officer, and president
so, cat rx is two things, not in those numbers that i just talked about. that is just the peripheral side of our business, so that's an additional group of patients. the product itself is performing quite well. it's a little different type of procedure than the vascular side directly in which many times, the clot's really an adjunct to something else, and the physician's using it in a much faster and more dynamic situation than where the clot itself is creating the issue. the product's performing incredibly well. we went into that area with no data and just the idea that using power aspiration in this form could be helpful, at least for the limited patients that have severe clot burden, and i think for those people who are trying it and seeing that, they're coming to the conclusion that the device has done really, really well for them.
joanne wuensch -- bmo capital markets -- managing director
thank you. and as my second question, you alluded to more information on your stroke rehab effort ""later in the year"". is there a forum that we will get that, and can you just sort of give us an idea of how to bring in the parameter of what that might mean for you? thanks.
sri kosaraju -- chief financial officer and head of strategy

with that i would like to turn over the call to adam elsesser.
adam elsesser -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you chee, good afternoon and thank you for joining penumbra's third quarter 2019 conference call. our total revenues for the third quarter were $139.5 million a year-over-year increase of 24.8% as reported and 25.5% in constant currency. we had operating income in the quarter of $13 million compared to an operating loss of $20.8 million for the same period last year. our business continues to see robust growth. and we remain highly encouraged by our patient markets and our ability to innovate within these markets. and the third quarter we saw significant growth in the us, but stronger growth in our international business, which was due to the timing of some over international orders from distributors. reviewing the highlights from the quarter, or vascular business continues to outperform and drive significant growth contribution. over the past year, we have introduced our view of this, growing patient opportunity, we believe that it will be a highly attractive area where we can make a difference for years to come. to that end, today i will share the positive and exciting results from a clinical trial studying our indigo system and acute pulmonary embolism. just yesterday at a late-breaking session at the vascular interventional advances or viva meeting data from extract trial were represented by dr. akhilesh sista.
as a reminder extract is a single-arm trial studying penumbra's indigo system in acute pulmonary embolism. the study enrolled 119 patients across 22 centers in the united states. according to the american heart association pulmonary embolism or pe affects roughly 300000 americans per year. we believe that 150000 of these patients may someday be treated interventionally. however we estimate that less than 15% of those or only 20000 are currently being treated today due to inadequate clinical evidence and technology. the extract trial achieved its primary endpoint in reducing the rv/lv ratio by 27.3% and had a major adverse event rate within 48 hours of 1.7%. these results were achieved without the use of thrombolytics in 98.3% of patients and the median procedure time of indigo was 37 minutes. we are very encouraged by these results and more excited about the potential for indigo to help patients who suffer from pe. with results of the extract trial we're pursuing regulatory clearance from fda that indigo system to be used in pe. we will keep you updated on this effort and the expected timelines as we know more. we believe that pe can be another meaningful opportunity for penumbra to help countless more patients and it will further expand penumbra's opportunity in peripheral thrombectomy.
our excitement for the indigo system continues to grow and our team continues to take on the hard work and challenging tasks that are necessary for us to succeed. our investors have been curious about how we are penetrating this patient opportunity. we have talked about innovation and clinical evidence. but i want to take a brief moment to share an indigo case from this past quarter. the story behind it helps illustrate what our team faces in the field and how we handle it. the particular vascular surgeon involved in this case had brought in the indigo system into his practice a few years ago but decided he would use it only if surgical embolectomy did not work. a few months ago a 90-year old patient presented to him with large clot burden in both legs. due to the age of the patient and the unique circumstances the physician elected to use the indigo system with our new high-flow tubing and new engine pump. to his surprise he removed the clot in the first leg in 60 seconds and did the same thing on the second leg. this was a fantastic result for this patient and it was an evident enough for the physician to convert the indigo system as his frontline tool. conversions like this, requires significant time and effort from our commercial team and positive patient outcomes like this provide the motivation for our team to do this difficult work.
as we move into 2020 and beyond the extract data potential pe indication and new technology innovation will all help support our continued growth and momentum in vascular. now i would like to provide 2 updates on our neuro business. first in late july we launched our latest stroke technology penumbra jet 7 xtra flex. since it's launch we observed a few developments. as we have shared during investor conferences in september the launch of penumbra jet 7 xtra flex has been different than prior lunches. given the large number of competitive products entering the u.s. market this year it's taken longer than prior launches to get meaningful physician experience with penumbra jet 7 xtra flex. through the end of the third quarter we believe that just about half of our current customers in the united states have the product. notwithstanding the longer time frame the initial feedback from physicians has been outstanding. and it has been more positive than any of our prior launches. physicians have been extremely favorable about its navigation ease-of-use and the increase speed of the overall stroke procedure. the positive feedback has not only been from current customers but also from competitive catheter users as well.
another early and unique observation is that penumbra's jet 7 xtra flex is allowing some physicians to reduce the need for adjunctive devices such as stent retrievers and/or microcatheters. while this had some clear negative near-term financial impact on our results particularly with our own 3d device. this speaks to the strength of the product and is very positive for our long-term strategy. second following 6 straight quarters of strong growth in the u.s. stroke market we have recently seen 3 data sources suggest that the u.s. stroke market grew at a less robust rate in the third quarter. we remind you that we've always said that market growth is not linear as measured quarter-by-quarter. looking at the past four years periods of less robust growth have never lasted longer than 2 quarters. that historical pattern coupled with our view, that the efforts to treat more and more patients are still as strong as ever, gives us great confidence in the longer term outlook for market growth. along with our confidence in the longer term growth of the stroke market, aspiration will continue to gain share as the front line mechanism in stroke intervention. the clinical evidence has now been established in support of our early conviction. just last week an independent physician initiated meta-analysis was published in the journal of stroke & cerebrovascular diseases that included over 9000 patients from september 2012 to december 2017.
this analysis showed statistically significant higher rates of revascularization as measured by tici 2b or 3. and better numerical patient outcomes as measured by mrs score of 0 1 or 2 at 90 days in favor of aspiration versus stent retrievers. this evidence adds to what we learned in the aster and compass trials as well. and finally just last week the american heart association updated its guidelines to recommend aspiration is non-inferior to stent retrievers as a first-line technique to treat stroke. as we head into 2020 we're excited about our newly launched penumbra jet 7 xtra flex as well as the new innovation coming in our stroke technology which will drive growth in our neuro business. while our initial focus has been in the united states for both our major patient markets the underlying diseases that we treat are global. over the past few months i've spent considerable times with our team across several countries in europe and asia. we see large international opportunities with corresponding challenges across regulatory reimbursement and commercial capabilities that we need to address to be successful. over the last few years we have seen 2 trends in our international business: first we have gained greater confidence in the vast patient opportunities in stroke as well as vascular; and second we have seen more variability in our international financial results as a result of distributor models and larger international markets.
while many of our distributor relationships have enabled us to quickly enter our market we see such structures as having limitations as we grow. we have begun working to evolve our structures to build the capabilities to better support long-term sustainable growth. our goals for future structures are to have continued growth and leadership in the stroke market to develop a regulatory and commercial platform to bring our vascular portfolio and the remainder of our neuro portfolio to these markets and to have more visibility in these geographies. as we move to the end of 2019 we are very confident about the prospects for durable growth for many years in the future. we have done the hard work by continuously innovating and adding new products that help patients. we are now undertaking the hard work but proper structures in place so that we can invest in our global growth. these efforts are a reflection of our size and success to date. simply put we are more excited than ever about our future.
i'll now turn the call over to sri to review the financials.
sri kosaraju -- president and chief financial officer
thank you adam, for the third quarter ended september 30 2019 our total revenues were $139.5 million an increase of 24.8% reported and 25.5% in constant currency. our geographic mix of sales in the quarter were 65% u.s. and 35% international. neuro and vascular represented 60% and 40% of sales respectively. while the third quarter has historically demonstrated seasonality due to summer both neuro and vascular saw sequential growth. our overall growth was largely driven by our vascular business and the timing of certain international orders coming in q3 amounting to roughly $2 million. revenue from our neuro business grew to $83.2 million in the third quarter of 2019 an increase of 11.5% reported and 12.4% in constant currency compared to the same period a year ago. our neuro growth was primarily driven by sales of our penumbra system for ischemic stroke. as adam mentioned in his prepared remarks our results in the quarter were impacted by dynamics related to our penumbra jet 7 xtra flex launch and by less robust growth in the u.s. stroke market. revenue from our vascular business grew to $56.3 million in the third quarter of 2019 an increase of 51.6% reported and 52% in constant currency which represents our 6th straight quarter of greater than 45% growth.
in the quarter our vascular growth was driven by results from both our thrombectomy and embolization businesses and specifically from our growing patient opportunities within both current and new physician customers. as a note next quarter our year-over-year comparisons include the launch of our peripheral embolization products in japan which will have an impact in our year-over-year growth metrics. that being said we expect strong sequential growth into the fourth quarter and we see our vascular business having significant multi-year runway ahead. our gross margin in the quarter was 68.8% of revenues compared to 67.1% of revenues for the same quarter last year. total operating expense for the quarter was $83 million or 59.5% of revenue compared to $95.9 million or 85.7% of revenues for the same quarter a year ago. as previously discussed we are actively investing in our growing opportunities which will result in growth in our r&d and sg&a spend. our research and development expenses were $13.7 million for q3 2019 compared to $9.1 million for q3 2018.
our r&d expenses increased largely due to an increase in product development and testing costs within both existing and new areas. sg&a expenses were $69.3 million for q3 2019 compared to $55.9 million for q3 2018. our spend increase primarily due to personnel related to expenses largely attributable to headcount to support our growth. we had operating income in the quarter of $13 million, compared to an operating loss of $20.8 million for the same period last year. we continue to expect to invest in the growth of our current business and also the development of potential areas. with regards to our revenue guidance, while we are not formally revising our revenue guidance range, we are comfortable slightly above the top end of our previously stated range of $535 million to $540 million. this guidance implies a slight sequential increase to the fourth quarter and reflects the possibility of another quarter of less robust market growth and the timing of international orders.
and now i'd like to turn the call back to adam for closing remarks.
adam elsesser -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you sri. as we near the end of the year i would like to reflect on our progress. we spent over a decade at penumbra building a strong foundation for our company an incredible capacity for constant innovation our world-class manufacturing operation the best commercial team in medtech and supporting functions that make it all work. at our upcoming investor day we look forward to sharing more detail on our business and how we are positioning ourselves for future durable growth. this represents our first investor day since going public in 2015 and we're looking forward to seeing you all there.
thank you and now we'll open the call to questions.

[operator instructions] your first question will come from the line of larry biegelsen of wells fargo. please go ahead, your line is open.
larry biegelsen -- wells fargo -- analyst
hey, good afternoon, guys. thanks for taking the question. two for me, one on the real system and one on stroke adam, so first on the real system. what's the latest there? where are you in your preparations for commercialization? and how meaningful can revenues be in 2020 even just directionally would be helpful? and i have one follow-up.
adam elsesser -- chairman and chief executive officer
okay, great question. so we're going to go into as we have said in the past a little more involved detail at the investor day coming up in december. we are prepared and getting ready for a launch in 2020 of that system. so that time frame is on track as we have indicated in the past. and we'll use the opportunity at the investor day to sort of go through the details of the commercial launch or the pricing the model itself as well as give you some early indication of what we think the expectations will be for that product in 2020.
larry biegelsen -- wells fargo -- analyst
fair enough. and then adam this year you've been talking about changing the stroke treatment paradigm. so i guess my question is where are you on that path? are you still on track to accomplish that over the next 12 to 18 months? and when are we going to learn more about this lightning system? are we going to learn more at the investor day?
adam elsesser -- chairman and chief executive officer
great question. let me try to answer that question the right way. the answer to the first sort of larger question of how far along are we are we still on track around my comments about continuing to sort of change the paradigm which as i've said publicly really involves getting all of the clot out in -- as fast the time frame as possible for almost all the patients. the answer is we are still very much on track with that work and there's no update on specific timing but there are certainly not -- there has not been a delay or change in my optimism around that. i still am very excited to continue to provide a lot of the innovation that this field has seen and enjoyed over the last sort of four or five years and i remain excited about that. as it relates to the product name lightning which i think you determined as part of a trademark filing i think it's premature to attribute that product name to any particular franchise within our business. and we'll just have to wait till that product is cleared or approved and launched.
larry biegelsen -- wells fargo -- analyst
alright guys, thanks for taking the question.

your next question will come from the line of jason mills of canaccord. please go ahead, your lines open
jason mills -- canaccord -- analyst
i'm sorry i was on mute. adam can you hear me ok?
adam elsesser -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes i can jason.
jason mills -- canaccord -- analyst
congratulation on a great quarter. i wanted to start outside of the u.s. adam. you mentioned some of the opportunities and challenges there. and you mentioned the distributor relationships and going through distributors can be different than the direct markets that you're going after here in united states. can you talk about how over the next two to four years you see your international business commercial progress taking place? in other words will you go direct in more markets over time? or do you see the result being expansion of these distributor relationships as you grow?
adam elsesser -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes. i think it's a great question. and i'd love to sort of give some sort of detail and context to it. first of all the larger point is the diseases that we're treating are global in nature. and that's -- we spent a lot of time talking and have as a company about the u.s. stroke market or even now a lot more about the indigo stroke market our indigo market in the u.s. but the opportunity to help a lot more patients is global. but we got to sort of know that we can be successful. so the u.s. market has proven very valuable to really hone our skills and innovate our products. as we go into some of these larger markets you start in many of them with a distributor model for a company that was at our size just four years ago. but at some point you outgrow that if you're successful because your interests are not always aligned as you get bigger and have the opportunity to invest in the growth of those markets.
those interest are not typically aligned with the financial model of a distributor relationships. that doesn't mean that our distributors aren't extraordinarily talented and do really great work in these markets. it's just that the financial model doesn't necessarily lineup. so we're not announcing on this call any specific new model or relationships. but really the opportunity to realign our interest with partners or alone to do that kind of work. and we will -- as those relationships get sorted out we will be certainly extremely proud and happy to sort of announce them. but they really fundamentally involve the opportunity to invest in the kind of work you need to both regulatorily clinically and commercially to penetrate markets that are not always obvious like peripheral thrombectomy and others and that need that kind of alignment.
jason mills -- canaccord -- analyst
it's great color. and as a follow-up on the vascular side obviously great growth. it wasn't lost on me that you commented about 2 of the larger segments of the thrombectomy market. the clinical study data which i wanted to ask you about in pe and the case study which was in dvt. could you talk about [indecipherable] really strong growth on the same [technical issues]
adam elsesser -- chairman and chief executive officer
jason? jason we're losing you. so i am...
jason mills -- canaccord -- analyst
[indecipherable].
adam elsesser -- chairman and chief executive officer
jason i don't know if you can hear us but we lost a lot of that question. it sort of went into a cellphone dead hole. but i picked up a few little things. so i may not be addressing your specific question but i think i'm getting some of the gist. so you initially talked about the 2 areas pe with our new clinical data. i think you may be misunderstood i didn't specifically call out whether it was a dvt or an arterial case that i highlighted. that case happened to be arterial as opposed to a dvt. as some folks have known following us we've had an extraordinary success on the arterial side with our product and that particular case happened to be arterial. but it really to again guess on your question because i couldn't hear all of it the combination of using clinical data where necessary and appropriate like in pe and using experience or constant work with physicians to get them to continue to have the experience of using our product in situations where it can be helpful you really need both of those to continue to grow the market. and i think this -- the story outlined that. this is a team -- our commercial team sort of never gap up on these physician's desire to continue to treat his patients well and are now going to see some additional success and the physician will see some additional success because of his experience.
on the clinical side particularly in areas like pe clinical evidence is going to -- is necessary even just to get the formal indication to be able to do it. and i think more importantly to access the larger patients beyond the 20000 in order to prove that we really should be intervening or helping patients in a more direct way. there is a lot of parallels to the stroke market some years ago the numbers of patients are actually similar in that regard as well. and these are patients that are not well. they're not everybody with a pe but patients who have a sub-massive or massive pe they can convert to a massive their life can be in jeopardy. but at a very minimum if they go on anticoagulants they don't feel well. they can't breathe. they have a very uncomfortable and risky time for a fairly long period of time as it resolves. and we're offering and hope to continue to prove a safe and much more appropriate alternative. so that's a new opportunity that requires both technology and clinical data. on the other side i did allude to the fact that there will be additional technology coming. we will talk a little bit more about that in our investor day both on the arterial dvt and pe side. and for that i think we will allow us to continue to have better and better experiences that will grow the market. so i apologize for not hearing your whole question but i hope i tried to answer as best as i could.
jason mills -- canaccord -- analyst
thank you.

your next question will come from robbie marcus of jp morgan. please go ahead. your line is open.
robbie marcus -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
thanks for taking the question and nice quarter. sri or adam i'm wondering could be for both of you. a lot of us have done doc calls on xtra flex and they've come at good and better and best and talked to docs that have switched from competitor products talked to docs that were trialing medtronic and stopped after using xtra flex and every variation in between. so i was hoping given all the positive feedback that me and a lot of investors have heard how do you want us to think about the growth trajectory of this product into 2020? we do have some easier comps with some trialing for medtronic against jet 7 offset by what may be a little downtick in market growth here. just any commentary you could help to think about growth into 2020 will be appreciated.
sri kosaraju -- president and chief financial officer
great robbie it's sri. i'll start with this. and i think your feedback is exactly consistent with what we have been gathering since we launched in late july. the product has gotten phenomenal feedback from physicians. and i think adam even commented in his prepared remarks it's one of the best launches we have had of our stroke technologies. what is around that? we obviously feel very very strongly about the technology and that obviously is something we can control within our innovation. but what's around that is the market and the environment. and we tried to shed some light on this. i think as we went through the quarter i think we've recognized some of the dynamics around launching and we shared that with investors. i think we have now gathered that the market maybe as we said in our commentary growing a little less robust. it's -- the obvious question is what is the market growing at? the beginning of the year we said the u.s. market was growing about 6500 patients that's about 17%. it's hard to measure on a monthly or quarterly basis.
but i think what we can say just to provide a little more visibility for investors i'll provide it just as we head to the end of this year and for 2020 we'll wait to provide that guidance on our fourth quarter call. but as we head to the end of this year i think there are 2 big components to think about for the overall company. stroke and our vascular business which happens to be about the same size as our stroke business if you look at the revenue numbers that most of you model. the stroke business we feel will grow into the end of the year for the full year at about 15% 16% and that is a combination of all of these dynamics that we take into account when we say that. and on the vascular business we feel like that will grow into the end of the year year-over-year at sort of the low 40% range. so i think those 2 data points should help people with a little bit more visibility as we head through the end of the year. and like i said for 2020 we will wait like we typically do to provide that on our q4 call.
robbie marcus -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
that's really helpful. i appreciate that sri. and then just as a follow-up. we saw the extract data yesterday. we've seen you over the course of the years raise the procedure targets that you're moving into in peripheral up to 350 and that's excluding pulmonary embolism. by my math you are still in the single-digit penetration into that market. maybe you could just talk to pulmonary embolism what does that add? and as you launch your new product family do we view this as a slow steady grind over time with strong double-digit growth there? is this something where we could see more of an inflection point?
adam elsesser -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks robert for the question. so let me address the first part of the question around pe. the -- there's no question that there's an immediate -- once we get our indication which we haven't gotten yet this data is the step in getting that. but with that indication we can go after sort of that first 20000 patients that we identified in the u.s. again globally it's a different thing. but in the u.s. market that are currently getting some form of intervention today whether that's a competitive device or just sort of a catheter-directed lysis. and given our data i think one can assume that we will do pretty well in that marketplace with that set of patients. the next step of course is to go after the other patients that we think we can help that we outlined today on the call as being about 150000 again similar size just slightly smaller than our estimate for the u.s. stroke market. those are patients that in order to go after them we would wait till our next-generation products likely but also do some more serious clinical work around proving our clinical outcome.
we don't have an announcement to make on this call about that study or that trial. but that has certainly been our ambition really since we started doing this some years ago with our peripheral business. that's an important group of patients. there -- they can be quite sick and we really owe it to them to do this kind of work and open up this treatment modality. as it relates to sort of the overall business which is how i read the question is i think you called it a sort of slow and steady i think you said grind 50-some-odd percent growth or over 45% growth for 6 quarters. and maybe your definition of slow and steady is different than mine but i think it's pretty appropriate growth rate. and i think what we have indicated on this call is that we have a lot of room to continue to grow into our vascular business for a number of years ahead of us. and if i can sort of step back for a second this is exactly what we talked about four years ago when we went public. we talked about the opportunity to develop new areas like stroke and other new areas. and then as people caught up as innovation continued though and people competed we would also have new areas that we can open this up for. and i just kind of want to maybe highlight one way of thinking about the 2 markets the 2 big markets we're in.
if we think about our stroke business in the u.s. which no one will ever say we don't care about in our competitive if you look at 1 percentage point of market share that's what we control. in the stroke business we don't really control market growth. we have funded efforts around get ahead of stroke and in state legislatures and all. but we don't really control the local efforts that drive that market growth. but we do have some role and ability to execute in market share questions. so 1 percentage point of market share in the u.s. stroke business equals about $2 million a year in revenue. if you switch to our vascular business and let me comment we are obviously going to fight for every point of market share. and i think we've proven that we're pretty adept at that. and i think with jet 7 xtra flex we and your calls have shown that we have that ability going forward. at the same time one point of market penetration or market share really they are the same thing in our vascular business because those patients are already being treated by some other modality but they are still being treated.
we don't have to get them there to be treated. so one percentage there in those markets for us today is about $15 million a year. so we're going to do that too. we can do both things. there are separate commercial teams and we can do both. but if we're successful with both one will obviously have a larger impact on our business going forward than the other just by the sheer different number sizes. and that's just sort of worth pointing out. as we think about the business going forward and do not misunderstand that that comment is meant to say we care about both businesses the same and we are going to execute as well as we can in both businesses. but by definition one will have an outgrowth -- outgrow -- outsized impact on our performance.
robbie marcus -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
may be consistent was the better word choice not slow and steady.
adam elsesser -- chairman and chief executive officer
i didn't mean to call you.
robbie marcus -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
thank you.
adam elsesser -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks.
operator
your next question will come from the line of bob hopkins with bank of america. please go ahead. your line is open.
bob hopkins -- bank of america -- analyst
so great. thanks. and good afternoon.just wanted to see if i can clarify some of the comments you made earlier. i just want to make sure i heard you on the u.s. stroke market you kind of earlier in the year thought the market would grow 17% and now you're seeing more like 15% to 16%. is that what you're saying? it seems like a pretty subtle difference.
sri kosaraju -- president and chief financial officer
no. i think just to clarify we said a few things on this call. and i'm glad you asked the question so that we can clarify it. what we said bob is at the beginning of the year when we introduced guidance we talked about the u.s. stroke market growing 6500 patients which translates to about 17% growth. the comments about q3 specifically were that we saw less robust growth in the stroke market. we didn't quantify what that is. it's incredibly hard to do that standing still on 1 quarter's worth of data but what we did provide is for our global stroke business our sense that the annual growth for 2019 would be in that 15% to 16% area. so just under what we had initially highlighted for u.s. stroke growth which we always used as sort of a proxy for how to think about our stroke business growth. so hopefully that helps clarify what that language was around.
bob hopkins -- bank of america -- analyst
okay. so you're saying you think this year the global stroke market will grow 15% to 16% in procedures?
sri kosaraju -- president and chief financial officer
we are saying that our global business will grow 15% to 16%. and in the answer to robbie's question we also gave a little more clarity around our vascular business growing in the low 40s -- low 40% for 2019 as an annual growth rate as well. so that's regarding our business.
bob hopkins -- bank of america -- analyst
okay. so according to you filings i think in the second quarter your global ischemic stroke business grew about 17%. so it sounds like from your comments that that slowed this quarter. is that fair?
sri kosaraju -- president and chief financial officer
that's correct. less than q2.
bob hopkins -- bank of america -- analyst
okay. and that's primarily a u.s. phenomenon.
sri kosaraju -- president and chief financial officer
yes. i think the 3 things that we mentioned and these are all related to our neuro business bob and i'll sort of again just for the sake of being clear about them there are 3 things in the quarter that are notable to highlight for neuro. we had a international order pulled forward to q3 which we quantified of about $2 million. we had the dynamics around the jet 7 xtra flex launch which i think you recall some of the dynamics that we talked about in some of the september investor meetings and in conversations with you as well about how we saw that taking a little bit longer and different from our prior stroke launches. and the third item is the u.s. stroke market growth being less robust than what we have seen in the first half of the year. so as we think about the combination of those 3 things that's relevant to q3. and as we think about the comment about u.s. stroke growth we have generally seen that not just being one quarter but our careful and cautious expectations that would carry into q4.
bob hopkins -- bank of america -- analyst
okay. and since it -- it's obviously an important part of the company's legacy and future but -- and i know it's only one quarter but can you give us a sense of magnitude as to what you think the u.s. markets slowed? because it's sort of -- the reason i'm asking because i haven't heard it from other players or just in all of our checks. i'm just curious what you're thinking in terms of magnitude just like what you're seeing?
sri kosaraju -- president and chief financial officer
yes. and i want to emphasize that it's hard for us to -- on the market basis to do that. i think we pay attention to the market sources and the reason why we mention it is we see 3 distinct different sources that are showing a slowdown in q3. so without sort of recharacterizing how we see the market growth rate our business is dependent on 2 things: market growth and share change. so what we are providing in lieu of that sort of market growth which is hard to kind of recast is we're providing our review of our growth rate for the year in stroke. so that's another way of us trying to provide a little more visibility about what this all means and what to anticipate. but as we get through q4 we are obviously going to have the benefit of another quarter to understand and to assess not only the whole year but over the course of six months what this dynamic looks like. and we'll provide that like we always do in january about talking about next year's market growth rate.
adam elsesser -- chairman and chief executive officer
and bob if i could add just -- i'm sorry go ahead.
bob hopkins -- bank of america -- analyst
yes. no no no i was just -- i was going to ask one other quick thing.
adam elsesser -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes. go ahead. ask the question.
bob hopkins -- bank of america -- analyst
well it was on a different subject. so if you've got -- go ahead.
adam elsesser -- chairman and chief executive officer
well -- yes let me just add a touch on the difference between determining market growth and market share. there is -- we understand for sure that there is no exact science in a competitive space which is -- we do understand that. we use -- we've seen a number of third-party sources together with our own data that try to triangulate both of those important metrics. and that's really important. so that we're putting the energy and effort in the right place. obviously as it relates to market share our own data and our sort of firsthand knowledge about our accounts is also a really important source. but you can't ever be certain around market growth. there is no one magic source. but we do looking at all these other sources have pretty high degree of confidence that the robust growth rate we've seen for the last 6 quarter slowed a bit in the back half of the third quarter. and if you just sort of look at historical patterns this is not new we have seen it several times before in the four years we've been public and common sense tells us that that will likely continue a little into the first part of the fourth quarter.
so that's where we sort of put that out there. but it doesn't really give us cause for any kind of long-term concern. let me address market share or competition sort of directly as it is different than the market growth issues. within the market share competition there are really 2 distinct dynamics at work. and i think it's important to not lose sight of this. it's different than in other areas with competition where it's a direct either/or you either use our product or use someone else's product. in this field because of the nature of the use of stentrievers and aspiration catheters or just one of them it's a little different. and one dynamic there's really 2 distinct competition or competitive dynamics. the first one is where customers don't use any of our stroke products at all. and they then decide because of aspirations gain as a mechanism to use a competitor's aspiration catheter maybe either with a competitor's stent retriever or without a stentriever just alone. in that dynamic a competitor certainly gains business and share for their catheter.
they may lose share in their stent retriever or they may just gain a catheter and keep the stentriever business. but that doesn't really have any negative impact on us. we don't lose any business in that share -- in that dynamic. in the other thing dynamic where a customer was using our aspiration and switches to someone else's that's a different dynamic. and we saw that dynamic play out a little bit at the beginning of the year and really the first 2 quarters. and we talked about it. but since the launch of penumbra jet 7 xtra flex we haven't seen that dynamic as much. in fact we have started to see signs that our team is beginning to take back share from those customers that we might have lost. so there's some nuance around both market growth which i think we try to be very open about and the competitive issues which sometimes get a little confusing because of the fact that you can have somebody gaining use of their product and it doesn't have an impact on us. but it frankly sets us up for future success at potentially taking that business back or away from them.
bob hopkins -- bank of america -- analyst
okay. that's helpful. and then just lastly to finish up and sorry for taking so long. i have just 2 other quick things. you're mentioning the evolving structures in europe. are there financial implications of those evolving structures that are worth calling out? could that be short-term disruptive long-term productive? just curious if there's any financial implications to those evolving structures? and then sri back at -- in various conferences you offered some commentary on 2020 as like kind of that 17% to 19% is being a good starting point to think about 2020. do those comments still apply? or given some of these moving pieces should we just wait till the analyst day?
sri kosaraju -- president and chief financial officer
yes. so let me hit the first one first bob the goal of the structure is -- i think is around the fact that we see that there's pretty robust opportunity outside the u.s. in both markets. and the structure is -- the goal of the structure is to be able to invest and to see the growth that we think we can have. and i think that's the point of making the comment. people haven't heard the number talk a lot about outside the u.s. markets we're starting to have good success in a lot of markets outside the u.s. and i think it's pretty natural that he would think of the structures that can allow us to have the best long-term sustainable growth. so that's where that thought process and strategic thinking is coming from. and those things don't happen overnight.
they take a while to develop. and so we want to put that on radar so that we can have that conversation with the market and our investors. and the second point on the growth rate we're not going to comment on that today. i think -- we generally try to talk about everything we're seeing in our business and now we're in 2 big markets 6 product franchises many many countries. in every given quarter there are going to be dynamics that go on. i think we try very hard to kind of point those out. but if you think about bubbling all that up to the whole company this quarter we grew constant currency 25% for the first nine months out of the year we're growing 25%. we feel really confident in sort of the overall growth of the company and the set up of growth drivers into 2020. i think we'd like to take the opportunity to talk about some of that on december 3 at our investor day and use our fourth quarter call to introduce guidance. so maybe i'll just leave it there.
bob hopkins -- bank of america -- analyst
okay, great. thanks so much for taking the questions.
operator
[operator instructions] your next question will come from the line of margaret kaczor with william blair. please go ahead. your line is open.
margaret kaczor -- william blair -- analyst
hey, good afternoon, guys. thanks for taking the questions. so the first one i wanted to follow-up on is just vascular. i mean i get all the conversations about stroke and so on. but just quarter-after-quarter you guys seem to be delivering on that side of the business. so i guess a couple of questions within that. can you provide any additional metrics that really speak to the value of that business stickiness? and then specific to the quarter can you give us a sense of the drivers of that business? is it existing accounts new accounts? and how does that look like as we go through 2020 indications-wise or otherwise.
sri kosaraju -- president and chief financial officer
yes margaret it's a great question. i'm glad you asked it. i think we've started to spend a lot more time sort of describing the opportunity. we started at sort of the broader market opportunity. we've benefited by having more places where indigo can be used. i think as we've begun to outline and update the market opportunity it's expended because we find indigo is being used in more cases. the other opportunity there is to penetrate that opportunity. as adam mentioned unlike stroke the main difference or the cheap difference here in this market is that the patients are already being treated. these are patients in a hospital being treated. so when he talked about sort of penetration it's replacing another therapy that's happening versus in stroke some of the patients aren't even getting to the hospital for us to have an opportunity to treat.
so how do we go about addressing those patients and penetrating? technology it's clinical evidence we just had great clinical data yesterday with extract that hopefully allows us to move into pe once we're able to hear back from the fda. there are a number of new customers yet to still get to for us. i think we're just in the early innings of being able to get to all the customers we can get to. and then also then addressing all the cases where they can use indigo. so it's also if you think about new customers and also their utilization of the device. so when we say there is a long runway ahead we say that because we see it not only the market opportunity but then tangibly in the customers and new opportunities with customers that we see in the future.
margaret kaczor -- william blair -- analyst
that's helpful. and then i just wanted to follow-up on the analyst day. we're kind of talking a little bit throughout this call about what you will say or won't say but maybe just more bluntly can you provide us a sense of how much clarity or time you're going to spend on kind of the 3 different businesses? and then when you walk through some of the updates will there be new product updates and a sense of market sizes and then as well longer term top or bottom line guidance in addition to the kind of short-term outlook.
sri kosaraju -- president and chief financial officer
yes. i think we've spent a lot of time telling people not to set their expectations on us giving long-range guidance and some of the things that i think people would love to have. i think the intent is -- since the ipo we really haven't had a chance to go deep on the other businesses that are driving our growth. and if you look at what's driving our growth as i mentioned our vascular business is just about the size of our stroke business. i think we want to go deeper with investors to describe what are those markets and what is our strategy against those to drive growth. we also want to go into the other parts of our neuro business stroke yes but other parts too that we think that can drive growth and share with everyone that -- more clarity around the drivers that we feel like will drive not just 2020 growth but also longer term multiyear growth beyond that. and so we like to think about that is the things that help us drive durable growth. so i think the idea is just to go deeper to educate our investors who may not have heard us or had the opportunity to understand those parts of our business and drivers.

2020-Q3,PEN,2020-10-28 16:30:00,"prepared remarks:
operator
good afternoon. my name is chris, and i will be your conference operator today. at this time, i would like to welcome everyone to penumbra's third quarter 2020 conference call. [operator instructions]
i would like to introduce ms. jee hamlyn-harris, investor relations for penumbra. ms. hamlyn-harris, you may begin your conference.
jee hamlyn-harris -- investor relations
thank you operator, and thank you all for joining us on today's call to discuss penumbra's earnings release for the third quarter 2020. a copy of the press release and financial tables, which includes a gaap to non-gaap reconciliation can be viewed under the investors tab on our company website at www.penumbrainc.com.

with that, i would like to turn over the call to adam elsesser.
adam elsesser -- president, chairman and chief executive officer
thank you, jee, and good afternoon, everybody. thank you for joining penumbra's third quarter 2020 conference call. our total revenues for the third quarter were $151.1 million, a year-over-year increase of 8% as reported and 44% sequentially. looking at our largest market, the united states revenue grew 22% year-over-year. both neuro and vascular franchises outperformed our expectations. vascular revenue of $75.2 million grew 34% year-over-year and 62% sequentially. our neuro revenue of $75.9 million declined 9% year-over-year, but increased 29% sequentially.
looking forward, both of these franchises are strong, our innovation accelerating and opportunities for growth in each are significant over the next several years. during my prepared remarks this quarter, i will focus on five topics. i will address the impact that covid-19 has had on penumbra this quarter and its potential future impact, then i will address the four growth engines at penumbra vascular, neuro, international expansion and the real system.
first, let me spend a few minutes discussing our latest thoughts on the pandemic. we returned to revenue growth this quarter, despite the continued pressures from covid-19. our efforts to deal with the pandemic this quarter were primarily focused on keeping our employees safe, while significantly increasing our manufacturing capacity to meet growing demand, a challenge our team took on successfully. we are not aware of any employee-to-employee transmission of the covid-19 virus at penumbra. we kept our workforce intact indeed growing its size materially during the quarter and we made sure that at risk employees would be paid even if they were unable to work on normal schedule. this work obviously has had an impact on our margins in the short-term, which maggie will discuss in her commentary.
we are all aware of the rising case numbers and increase in covid-related hospitalizations in many regions in the united states and abroad. it is impossible not to be cautious about these covid-related risks that may lie ahead, especially in the near-term. in addition to our effort to safely keep up with product demand, the pandemic could impact some suppliers' ability to supply materials to keep up with our strong growth in certain products.
and lastly, while hospitals have done an extraordinary job figuring out how to accommodate an increasing procedure schedule, while meeting the needs of its covid patients, we recognize that any further acceleration in covid infections and hospitalizations could put a strain not only on our hospital customers, but also could impact patient's attitude about scheduling procedures.
i'll now focus on our four growth drivers that we presented at penumbra's investor day last december, and have continue to discuss throughout this year. let's start with our vascular franchise, which we have said, will drive both near and mid-term growth. our vascular results this quarter are clear evidence of the enormous opportunity we have in front of us to help a large number of patients. the vascular thrombectomy market is larger and less penetrated than our stroke business and ready for a paradigm change, so we are not at all surprised -- we are not surprised at all that our vascular franchise is now equal in revenue to our neuro franchise and will likely grow to become the company's largest business in the fourth quarter.
while our neuro business is on very solid footing, the vascular opportunity is simply larger and easier to access. indeed, the number of peripheral thrombectomy patients in the united states each year on the arterial and the venous side it is more than double the number of treatable stroke patients. what's more, vascular patients are already being treated in hospitals by our current customers with either lytics or surgical intervention. the innovation penumbra is bringing to this market is already making a huge difference in patients' lives and could ultimately change the way the majority of these vascular patients are treated in the future.
i stated on our last earnings call that our launch of the new lightning 12 system in mid-july was the best product launch in penumbra's history, and i believe, our vascular growth is proving this out. we're even more motivated by the positive impact lightning is having on patients. the anecdotal reports from physicians on the performance of lightning 12 has been exceptional. we believe that lightning, together with our larger, highly torqueable catheter has so far proven to be the right combination of size and power to address the vast majority of target venous cases in the united states.
now the hard work starts. over the next several quarters, our team will be busy navigating through the value analysis committees at hospitals to make lightning available to a broad group of customers in the united states. we then look forward to introducing lightning 12 into key international markets in the second half of 2021. we are just scratching the market surface with lightning 12, and its impact on our vascular business is nascent, but we are also excited about investments we're making in additional innovation and clinical evidence, both of which we think will drive the indigo power aspiration paradigm forward globally.
of note, we recently received fda clearance of the lightning -- for lightning 7 system and will commence our launch in the united states in early 2021, when we have appropriate inventory. like lightening 12, lightening 7 utilizes our next-generation hypotube-based torqueable catheter technology and we think lightning 7 could be a very important tool to help physicians remove arterial clot.
finally, our vascular embolization business also had its best quarter ever. notwithstanding incremental benefit from catch up in some elective cases pushed back from q2 to q3. while it's impossible to know definitively we estimate this benefit could have been as much as $2.5 million in the quarter and it is a testament to our vascular team and our unique products that we had a record quarter in vascular embolization even excluding this estimated benefit.
let's turn to our neuro franchise, where we were pleased with the improvement in our business coming out of the second quarter. we posted double-digit growth sequentially in ischemic stroke, neuro embolization and access. before getting to our neuro pipeline, let me talk about jet 7 xtra flex. we received a great number of questions from the investment community over the past few months regarding this product and the notification letter we sent to physicians at the end of july.
first, it is important to state that jet 7 xtra flex is the most advanced, trackable, reperfusion catheter we have ever launched. and its strong contribution to our q3 results, which i'll touch on in a moment supports this statement. second, we are proud of our physician customers, working together with the penumbra team to take the time to refamiliarize and put into practice the important instructions on how to use jet 7 xtra flex to safely and successfully treat their stroke patients.
given the questions this quarter, we think it's important to share more detail on two fronts. first, jet 7 xtra flex revenue in u.s. in the third quarter was within $400,000 of the product's highest sales quarter ever. secondly and more importantly, we are not aware of any new reports, either is reported to the company or the maude database that was the subject of the notification and were related to events that occurred after the date of the notification. it is important to remember competition in the neurovascular space has always been and will likely continue to be significant and aggressive.
as i stated publicly at investor conferences in september, other manufacturers are using our updated instructions for use in a competitive manner to get physicians to try their products and this targeted effort drove trialing by some customers. due to the exceptional performance of jet 7 xtra flex, the vast majority of these customers have come back to using jet 7 xtra flex.
that said, as we have regularly stated in the past, we expect competition to continue to be aggressive in the neurovascular space and our world-class commercial team will continue to make sure our customers know the value of our products.
looking forward, penumbra continues to design and innovate products to treat patients who suffer strokes. we recently completed our initial cases for bmx96 catheter, which payers with jet 7 xtra flex as well as future products to enable a quicker and more advanced stroke procedure. we are very optimistic about the benefit bmx96 will offer physicians and their stroke patients in the quarters ahead. we are confident in our current portfolio of market-leading products in neuro, led by jet 7 xtra flex and we are very excited to deliver another new paradigm to physicians treating stroke in 2021.
now, let me focus on our international business. during the third quarter, our international business recovered well, getting all the way back to q1 2020 levels in most geographies. excluding japan, our total international revenues grew 2% year-over-year and 58% sequentially. japan was obviously impacted this quarter by the pause in the launch of jet 7 xtra flex, that i shared publicly in early september at an investor conference.
we have been told that our distributor partner plans on restarting that launch later this quarter following japanese approval of the changes to the ifu. japan is a potentially large, future growth engine for penumbra, on both an absolute and relative basis, as we launched new products, both neuro and vascular into japan and build from the relatively small revenue run rate we currently have in the region.
let me take a minute to talk about our strategy to increase our growth profile in the international markets. the overall growth of our business continues to shift toward vascular. we are evolving our international sales capacity as well. for example, we are creating dedicated commercial teams in both vascular and neuro in europe, as we look to accelerate the pace with which we can reach patients with our innovative products in both franchises. in addition, we continue to evaluate creative commercial strategies in certain key geographies, as we seek to improve our ability to supply those areas with our newest products.
now, let me turn to the real system. as we previously indicated, we were forced to delay the initial roll-out of the real system due to the pandemic. and we are just now starting to introduce the first systems to rehab clinics. the initial feedback we've been getting from patients justifies the commitment to and the material investments we are making in this product. one example is a patient in the southeast, who had a stroke over a year ago and went to traditional rehab for an entire year. her improvement using traditional rehab plateaued quickly with her arm only regaining limited functionality. following this difficult year, she started using the real system. and in only about a month of use, she has regained functional mobility in her arm.
this and many other stories are so inspiring and they motivate the entire team to push hard for the next phases of the real system, namely tele-rehab and home use as well as additional applications targeting other large serious medical conditions. the myriad medical conditions to which our real system is applicable represents by far the largest total market opportunity that the number has ever taken on. and we are incredibly enthusiastic about the number of people we can help. we will publicly present the advancements we're making in both the real product portfolio and business models in the first half of 2021.
finally, 2020 has proven to be a challenging year for our country and the world at large as we have faced a pandemic as well as unease and uncertainty in our society. throughout these challenging times, the penumbra team has risen to the occasion and helped the company achieved our current success, while also putting us in the strongest position we have been for continued growth in the future.
it is the measure of people on how they perform and act during challenging times. and i am extremely honored to work with this team that has shown its character, professionalism and humanity. i am proud to say the penumbra team has measured up and met the challenge.
i'll now turn the call over to maggie.
maggie yuen -- chief financial officer
thank you, adam. good afternoon, everyone. today, i will discuss financial results for the third quarter 2020. additional details will be contained within our quarterly reports on top -- on form 10-q to be filed on november 2, 2020 with the sec.
for the third quarter ended september 30, 2020, our total revenues were $151.1 million, an increase of 8.3% reported and 7.7% in constant currency compared to the third quarter of 2019. our geographic mix of sales in the quarter were 73% u.s. and 27% international. u.s. and international reported sequential growth of 41% and 53% respectively compared to q2 2020.
revenues from our vascular business were $75.2 million in the third quarter of 2020, an increase of 34% reported and 33% in constant currency. in the quarter, our vascular performance was driven by growth from both our thrombectomy and embolization franchises, augmented by the lightning 12 product launch and recovery in embolization cases from the prior quarter. revenues from our neuro business were $75.9 million in the third quarter of 2020, a decrease of 9% reported and 10% in constant currency compared to the same period a year ago.
our u.s. neuro business increased 15% reported on a sequential basis, driven by growth across all neuro businesses. in addition, our international neuro franchise saw improvement in distributor orders. and total neuro international revenue increased 57% on a sequential basis and decreased 18% compared to q3 2019, driven by timing of jet 7 xtra flex launch in japan.
our gross margin in the quarter was 60% of revenue compared to 69% of revenue for the same quarter last year. the decrease compared to q3 2019 is driven by three component. keeping our employees safe and meeting demand are top priorities for us. in doing so, we have made incremental investment on covid-19 related safety measures, which include trade-offs made in productivity and capacity. second, to support new product launches and meet increasing demand in a less efficient manufacturing environment we have accelerated investment in direct labor hires and production support to enable production scale up in both our alameda and roseville manufacturing facilities.
and finally unabsorbed manufacturing variances from q2 also negatively impacted our gross margin, as inventory sold through in the third quarter. we expect our gross margin to improve gradually in coming quarters with current demand trends and we think the investment in product resources and infrastructure will drive margin expansion further in the future. in the quarter, we had one-time non-recurring personnel-related expenditures of $20.7 million associated with the launch of lightning 12.
the following financial metrics will represent non-gaap financial results. excluding these non-recurring expenditures, in the quarter our adjusted operating expenses were $90.4 million or 60% of revenue compared to $83 million or 60% of revenue a year ago, representing 9.5% sequential growth compared to the second quarter of 2020. as revenue momentum improved, we rebalanced some temporary cost control measures that we've had put in place in the wake of covid. we also increased volume-related hiring and related activities in the quarter and we continue to make strategic investment in a number of new product development opportunities at a similar level to second quarter of 2020. we achieved adjusted operating income of $0.5 million in the quarter compared to an operating income of $13 million for the same period last year.
turning to cash flow and balance sheet, accounts receivable increased by $15 million and net inventory increased about $8 million compared to second quarter of 2020. working capital levels were consistent with volume trends. we ended third quarter 2020 with $269 million in cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities and no debt.
finally, in early april, we withdrew guidance for 2020 in the outset of covid-19 pandemic. we are not formally reinstating guidance at this time because of the uncertainty caused by current increase in covid-19 cases and hospitalizations. however, we do want to state that if there were no new negative covid impacts in the medical device industry from this point forward, we would be comfortable with our fourth quarter revenue at or slightly above our record third quarter levels.
and now, i'd like to turn the call back to adam for closing remarks.
adam elsesser -- president, chairman and chief executive officer
thank you, maggie. in the third quarter penumbra achieved the highest quarterly revenue in the company's history. this is a testament to our people and our culture, our products an incredible capacity for constant innovation, and most importantly, our customers. i applaud physicians, nurses and healthcare professionals whose extraordinary dedication is on display every day, but has been especially evident over the past several months.
these heroes redouble their efforts to treat more patients suffering from neurovascular and peripheral vascular disease, as they continued to face enormous challenges fighting covid-19. thank you all for your extraordinary work.
and now we'd like to open the call to questions. operator, please go ahead.

[operator instructions] our first question comes from the line of larry biegelsen with wells fargo. your line is open.
larry biegelsen -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
good afternoon, guys. thanks for taking the question, and congratulations on a really nice quarter here. adam you weren't kidding when you said on the last call that lightning 12 would be the most successful launch in the company's history. so i wanted to start there. with u.s. vascular was there anything one-time in q3? can you talk a little bit about the mix versus the volume benefit? and how do we -- how should we think about this level of sales going forward?
adam elsesser -- president, chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. first of all, larry, thanks for the question. so the vast -- as you remember we started the launch of this product, the introduction of it sort of two weeks into the quarter so we really had 10 weeks in the quarter to do this. so the vast majority of this is just cases being done. there is very little sort of in stocking and other things, as you know, that takes a lot of time and particularly now it seems to be taking even longer. so the vast majority of this is really the increase for lightning is really just case usage.
and as i said on the last quarter the response to this just very easily and quickly really after one case we've seen over and over again it's been just that remarkable. it just works, it's just sort of the right balance of size and power as i've alluded to sort of safely be able to get clot out a dvt and a host of other cases.
so we're really optimistic. we had high expectations for this product and so far the market has responded favorably to it. but as i alluded to in my prepared remarks, the hard work starts now. we have to go through the value analysis committee is on that seems to be taking a little longer than it used to be so that's going to take a number of quarters to do. but in the long run we think we're on a great pathway with this product for being able to help a significant number of people.
larry biegelsen -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
that's great. and adam on international, you talked about international upfront in your prepared remarks, should we expect to see that improve sequentially in q4? and i wanted to sneak one more in here, adam, you gave a goal of $1 billion in sales in 2023 at the analyst meeting in december, is that still intact or should we think about that being maybe pushed out a year because of covid? thanks for taking the questions.
adam elsesser -- president, chairman and chief executive officer
sure. to the -- answer the first question barring new changes in covid. and i just -- i want to -- i know nothing specific that is not foreshadowing our october has started out in relationship to every other october and in the quarter before in a typical manner, so don't read anything into this, but you wake up today and read the headlines that france and germany and italy and spain are all going on lockdown and your question was international. so we don't know, but barring those issues, if we don't have those new impacts, yes, we do expect international to continue to recover as you suggested.
as it relates to the question, we are absolutely confident that we will continue to grow and reach that goal the exact timing of it in quarter, again, given the fact that today we're facing headline after headline around covid, particularly gives me just slight pause to commit to a exact moment in time. but i think this quarter shows you that our business is as strong as ever and that we have a lot of confidence that we will not only get to the $1 billion, but get into the plus world in a timeframe that is appropriate.
larry biegelsen -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
thanks for taking the questions, guys.
adam elsesser -- president, chairman and chief executive officer
of course.
operator
your next question is from bill plovanic with canaccord. your lines is open.
bill plovanic -- canaccord genuity, global capital markets -- analyst
great, thanks. good evening. can you hear me ok?
adam elsesser -- president, chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. hi, bill.
bill plovanic -- canaccord genuity, global capital markets -- analyst
hey. hi, adam. so to drill down into larry's questions a little further, just in the peripheral market, is there anything specific or any areas you mentioned dvt, but dvt versus pe versus other areas that you're seeing the bulk of the growth come from? and then also piggyback on the international question, in the opening remarks you discussed some changes to the international structure if really splitting the sales forces, is that something that could be accomplished rather quickly, where it's in place by year-end this year and then you're kind of '21 hitting the ground running or is this kind of a rolling adjustment we'll see over time to that channel?
adam elsesser -- president, chairman and chief executive officer
yeah, so good questions, bill. on the question of mix, it's really been all across the board. there is absolutely no one area that we can pin to, which really is not surprising, but gives us a great deal of confidence between those areas that we've really found sort of just the -- the just right spot or the sweet spot. so we feel particularly good about it.
and don't forget this is -- we're talking about lightning 12 is the new product, but the rest of our portfolio on the arterial side and coronary side have also been quite successful with and continue to grow independent of this product launch, albeit i assume. i don't want to take anything away from this great product launch. as it relates to the structure in europe, those initial changes were just made in the last short period of time to see the effects of those and will take a little longer. we created sort of the management structure and now we have some hiring to do, not a lot, but a little in. and also, we have -- lightning is not yet approved in or cleared in europe or ce mark. so once we get that, that will also drive growth and i alluded to that in my prepared remarks.
bill plovanic -- canaccord genuity, global capital markets -- analyst
okay. and if i could ask a follow-up, just on the $20.7 million in one-time charges with lightning, can you give a little granularity on what specifically that would be for?
adam elsesser -- president, chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. without sort of getting into an area where it could be competitive against us, there was -- the primary bulk of that was related to work on the development side that was part of an understanding that allowed lightning to exist in the first place and that's why it's a one-time charge.
bill plovanic -- canaccord genuity, global capital markets -- analyst
okay, thank you very much.
adam elsesser -- president, chairman and chief executive officer
yeah, my pleasure.
operator
your next question is from robbie marcus with jp morgan. your line is open.
robert marcus -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
yeah. thanks for taking the question and congrats on a nice quarter. adam, i know you don't get asked a lot on real vr, but there has been reimbursement changes and you highlighted in the script. i was wondering how people should think about that over, let's say, the next two to four years here? is this something that can start to contribute to revenue at the closer end of that time range or is this really still some opportunity that's exciting or -- and -- but further out?
adam elsesser -- president, chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. thanks for asking about real. real, the exact timeframe of sort of the launch in the business model and all that will, again, i do more publicly as i alluded to in the first half of next year. but i do think if you're defining the near-term or mid-term as the first two years versus four years later from that, and the answer is definitely it can start to contribute.
the most important thing is for -- that we want to have everyone understand is that as we have evolved the product and moved into more tele-rehab and other medical conditions besides more traditional neuro rehab. the tam, if you will, has really dramatically increased. and again, we'll lay that out in more detail when we unveil this publicly, but it really has made this a huge opportunity.
so we're going to be careful, we're going to be sort of do it right. and when we have everything organized and the product ready to go, we can't wait to share with everyone.
robert marcus -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
great, thanks. and maybe a quick follow-up, your competitor in peripheral aspiration has a higher price point than you based on, i believe, your comments and some of the checks we've done. how should we think about the third quarter u.s. peripheral performance in terms of price versus volume? if you don't want to tell us exactly, any qualitative measures would be really helpful getting us in the right direction? thanks.
adam elsesser -- president, chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. i think it's a totally fair question. the vast majority of this is volume and as opposed to price. as you know, there is a small uptick in price, that is also balanced out a little by the less use of the separator in the case. so there is a little bit of price, but i would absolutely attribute the vast majority of these cases as new cases that we would not have necessarily gotten, primarily. i mean, this field is large, as i've said, there -- the vast, the biggest competitor is physicians using catheter directed license or tpa and that's where we focused our energies and time.
and as i said in my prepared remarks that, this moment in time this area is right for a paradigm change. and we found a very willing group of physicians, if you will, a large group, who are willing to try it and realize the value of it immediately.
so to answer the question, it's mostly volume and mostly patients that we weren't treating before.
robert marcus -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
well, that's great to hear. thanks, adam.
adam elsesser -- president, chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. thank you, robbie.
operator
your next question is from bob hopkins with bank of america. your line is open.
bob hopkins -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
hi. great. good afternoon.
adam elsesser -- president, chairman and chief executive officer
hi, bob.
bob hopkins -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
hey, adam. thanks for the call and the results. just a couple of follow-ups, one quick one, in the second quarter, you talked about international destocking, was that a factor this quarter and is that pretty much done at this point?
adam elsesser -- president, chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. i think you -- most of that is back. we didn't really see that as an effect so we didn't call that out specifically this quarter. so i would agree with it, the assessment, yes.
bob hopkins -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
okay. and then, i'm just curious in the quarter, thank you for giving the u.s. neuro number. i was curious when it comes to your u.s. ischemic stroke revenues, do you think what you experienced in the quarter was fairly representative of what went on with the broader market?
adam elsesser -- president, chairman and chief executive officer
well, i don't know. there's a lot of the competitors haven't -- manufacturers haven't reported. i would assume and i think i went out of my way to say that it might be a little less than the broader market, because we had all the competitive trialing that was going on. i don't know that. as you know, this was a noisy quarter for our neuro franchise and lots of competitive behavior, not something again that we aren't used to, but i wouldn't -- i can't answer that until we know those numbers.
what it tells me though in the long run and where -- how we performed and the reaction of our customers in the long run is really heartening, notwithstanding all the noise and effort, the vast majority of our customers have shown that they appreciate the value of this product. and i think our business is pretty solid for going forward.
bob hopkins -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
and then, last thing i want you to touch on really quickly because is this question of competition more broadly across the business because three or four years ago, people really started to get nervous on the neuro side with competition and there were a lot of false starts there. and you guys basically have remained very competitive all the way throughout that. so people got worried about competition much too early on the neuro side. i was wondering if you could just kind of compare and contrast competition that you see coming on the vascular side from several companies that are announcing new products versus the neuro. would you characterize as kind of a similar dynamic or are there differences you think we should be aware of as we evaluate competition on the vascular side compared to the neuro side?
adam elsesser -- president, chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. i really -- not to be disrespectful to any of the people who are in the space. they're great manufacturers, really altogether trying to do the right thing, which is to move the field to a place where removing clot in the body is a much more logical and better procedure than where we are and i have a lot of respect for them.
but that being said, i don't think, we think about competition in this field much the way we've always thought about it in neuro. it's always been acute in neuro, we entered the field after those companies, here it's a little different for most of them. and it's just so large, and we're all -- our mechanisms are although different, we have different thoughts. so we don't really see competition at all in the same framework. in fact, i'd be surprised if the other companies don't say the same thing.
it doesn't have the same type of reaction and thing that neuro does. and it's just so much larger. if you look at neuro, there is how many, 10 companies now in neurovascular all facing a relatively small group of cases. that's great. and we're really proud of our work and proud of what we'll do in the future going forward, as we think we can continue to compete very well. but it's just not the same as the vascular opportunity.
if you think about it bob, it took us 13 years to build our stroke business to where it is today, and it's taken five years to build our neuro -- our vascular business to be the same size. i think that tells you what you need to know about how we see the future of this field.
bob hopkins -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
yeah, thank you. i appreciate the answer.
adam elsesser -- president, chairman and chief executive officer
yeah.
operator
your next question is from joanne wuensch with citi. your line is open.
joanne wuensch -- citigroup -- analyst
good afternoon. thank you for taking the question. i actually have two and i'll ask them upfront. the first one has to deal with research and development expenses, this number has risen significantly in the last two quarters and i'm just wondering, if you think about this as a go-forward rate or whether or not given some of the launches what you've been able to get out the door successfully, it comes down to a more normalized level on a dollar basis?
and then the second question is a little bit more big picture in terms of the neuro market. when we talk to physicians we're still hearing stories about how the number of ischemic stroke patients are lower than they -- what they were last year in a pre-covid environment, are you seeing that or is it just the fact that happen to be picking? and if so why do you think that is? thanks.
adam elsesser -- president, chairman and chief executive officer
thanks, joanne. maggie will answer the first question, and i'll do the second one.
maggie yuen -- chief financial officer
yeah. hi, joanne, thanks for the question. in terms of the operating expense, i think that after we exclude that one-time non-recurring expense that we highlighted, the baseline $90 million expense is a reasonable baseline for understand looking forward how our base operating expense trend with volume going forward. if you remember, starting from last quarter we have a step-up in r&d investment specifically related to a few new development programs and that likely will continue for near short-term quarters.
adam elsesser -- president, chairman and chief executive officer
and then, as it relates to neuro question, it really is -- i mean, it's a really insightful question and it's kind of mixed. we certainly have some customers that are seeing a significant increase in stroke patients, at least sort of in the near-term from sort of the end of q1 and into q2. and then there are some customers who are available who can treat patients and i have seen a small decrease. i don't really know how to describe that other than the change -- the real challenge of the stroke field that we've been talking about for in the last five and half years of getting patients to the right place.
and obviously, there is no evidence whatsoever that people are having less strokes. and so the question is, is this patient flow question. and is something about the moment in time and covid changing that flow where patients are not getting transferred the way they used to get transferred. and the answer may be true in those circumstances. it certainly not across the board and other hospitals have seen an increase, but in those that maybe you talk to and that we know of, it just -- it i think highlights that challenge.
it also -- it's worth pointing out that challenge doesn't exist in the vascular business, which is probably why we're seeing that continue to grow and will because those patients are always already where they should be. and so we're not giving up obviously, we've come a long way in stroke and we have a incredibly optimistic view of our future stroke business. but i think that challenge is always going to be there about getting the patients to the right place. and there must be something about this moment in time with covid that's making that challenging at least for the hospitals that i know of and the ones you're talking to.
joanne wuensch -- citigroup -- analyst
thank you.
adam elsesser -- president, chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. my pleasure.
operator
[operator instructions] our next question is from margaret kaczor with william blair. your line is open.
margaret kaczor -- william blair -- analyst
hey, guys. good afternoon. thanks for taking the questions. maybe the first one for me is just following up on your commentary around the vacs for lightning 12. obviously, despite the delay you're still growing really, really quickly, but what impact could this have around adoption over the next three to five quarters relative to your prior expectations? and really can it catch up pretty quickly or not?
adam elsesser -- president, chairman and chief executive officer
so the way we see -- i mean, this product, as i said, i said it last quarter a few weeks into the launches, it's the best product we've ever launched. it's -- the uptick is really extraordinary. and we -- it's really on us and the hospital systems to get this now into the process. and that process is never easy, as you know, to go through the value analysis committee at hospitals. there are some hospitals that have made that even harder by -- because of the financial strain on hospital system this year have put outright bans on new products. there is one system that did that, but we were able to get a quick waiver because of the value that this product brought. so really it's just that work come hard to predict the timing of that other than to acknowledge that it's ahead of us and it won't be linear or simple.
that being said, the product itself i think is performing in a way that really can -- really capture so many of these patients that are not getting catheter-directed license instead of mechanical thrombectomy. and that i think really gives us a lot of confidence in this.
margaret kaczor -- william blair -- analyst
okay. so that seems kind of out of your control, but obviously you're trying to do your best to manage the situation hopefully it gets better and '21.
adam elsesser -- president, chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. yeah.
margaret kaczor -- william blair -- analyst
and then i wanted to follow-up a little bit on the commentary around q4 performance. and i know there's a lot of uncertainty here is that, but i think you gave some guidance around not assuming covid continues. for example, no surprise that you wouldn't see further acceleration sequentially, we saw that in the year ago period and before that. so maybe walk us through those dynamics. how did you guys come up with those numbers? and anything you can give us in terms of european shutdowns, did they've had any impact at this point as well? thanks.
adam elsesser -- president, chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. it's totally a fair question. so first of all to remind everyone, we did not give formal guidance, we were very clear about that. what we wanted to do is give you sort of a qualitative framework to sort of think about our business in the fourth quarter. we're pretty careful to look at what happened this quarter, last quarter and what are the sort of fundamental trends, which are positive. that being said, we did call out some carryover, couple of million dollars or little more on our peripheral embolization business that obviously doesn't repeat in the fourth quarter. so that can gave us the numbers.
again, if things don't get worse we think that that's attainable. if things get worse, we don't know. and it's escalating obviously this morning alone, we all woke up to news and the market reacted to it. so we don't know that. but let me make sure everyone understands beyond fourth quarter, we are in the strongest position as a company we've ever been in. i made -- i hope you heard me say that. and we feel that, as we navigate covid on top of that we also have the strongest portfolio we've had our products and we think we're going to have significant growth when the uncertainty of covid is out, we're in really good shape. we're proving it even with covid, we can do pretty well, but we're being cautious around those numbers because of that.
margaret kaczor -- william blair -- analyst
got it. thanks guys and congrats on the quarter.
adam elsesser -- president, chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. thank you.
operator
our next question is from ryan zimmerman with btig. your line is open.
ryan zimmerman -- btig -- analyst
thank you. so, adam, we've seen some preliminary clinical data noting increased clotting as a result of covid and it's being with some of the vascular surgeon that certainly confirmed that they are seeing a higher number of patients as a result. and i just wondered if you could speak to what you've seen in the business that would support or refute this trend? and whether that can be an incremental tailwind over the coming quarters, as physicians treat those increased cases. is it fair to assume that these patients would be above and beyond, kind of that 400,000 that you've previously outlined?
adam elsesser -- president, chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. ryan, that's a very good question and the answer is, yes. the numbers that we've been giving around arterial and venous cases of 430,000 that are treated by some means either surgical intervention or catheter-directed license or just through analytics. it's just before covid. so there is no question that that number in the short-term could go higher. what we don't think is that, that these covid patients are uniquely the ones that we're treating right now where they are all just increasing that pool for the short-term.
and one of the things that i think is really making us optimistic about this is that as people who have used, particularly catheter-directed license in the past and have tried the lightning 12 their reaction to with this product we might just convert. and so in that case to the extent that there are more patients in the short-term that they can treat that's great, but it really goes to the larger market that we're just tapping into.
so, i mean, you got a long way to go before we're treating 430,000 patients in u.s., we're still single-digit penetrated. so we got a lot of work ahead of us, but, yes right, it does add to the pool a little bit in the short-term.
ryan zimmerman -- btig -- analyst
okay. i appreciate that answer. and then just one for maggie, we've talked a lot about lightning this quarter. and given the price premium you are getting with lightning, i guess, measured against less utilization of separators. and again, i was wondering if you could comment on kind of the margin impact, this may or may not have for the company as lightening continues to really be one of the key drivers in the vascular business?
maggie yuen -- chief financial officer
yeah. in terms of a margin -- gross margin impact, lightning could have a very light accretive impact to our margins. but as you -- as i discussed about our margin performance is definitely not a material impact in our gross margin this quarter that is related to specifically price and mix.
ryan zimmerman -- btig -- analyst
understood. okay, thank you for taking the questions.
maggie yuen -- chief financial officer
yeah. thanks.
adam elsesser -- president, chairman and chief executive officer

with that, i would like to turn over the call to adam elsesser.
adam elsesser -- president, chairman and chief executive officer
thank you, jee, and good afternoon, everybody. thank you for joining penumbra's fourth quarter and year-end 2020 conference call. our total revenues for the fourth quarter were $166.9 million, a year-over-year increase of 14.9% as reported and 13.7% in constant currency, which marks the second consecutive record quarter for penumbra.
this also included a reduction of $5.8 million in revenue due to the recall of jet seven xtra flex in mid-december. excluding this onetime impact, total q4 non-gaap revenue grew 18.9% to $172.7 million. for the full year 2020, our total annual revenues were $560.4 million, which represented growth of 2.4% over full year 2019. excluding the onetime recall impact, total annual non-gaap revenue grew 3.4% over 2019 to $566.2 million.
maggie will further review the financials as well as details on our balance sheet in her commentary. during my prepared remarks this quarter, i will focus on three topics. first, i will briefly discuss our culture of innovation that is responsible for the development of our broad portfolio of products. i will then update you on our specific developments in vascular, neuro and virtual reality. second, i'll talk about the progress we've made in international markets since our last call, including china. and third, i will address the challenges we all faced in 2020 and early 2021 from the pandemic and our thoughts on its impact.
we have built a purposeful structure and culture at penumbra that allows us to develop and continue to innovate products that really matter, even as the company gets larger. this ability to continuously innovate has been led for almost 17 years by a large team of highly skilled and motivated people, including our pengineers, who share a commitment to solving hard problems in healthcare, and it has been instrumental in the development of our broad portfolio of products. our results this quarter show that our products are positively impacting more patients than ever before, yet we continue to be driven every day by the number of patients we can still help.
we estimate in the united states alone that nearly 80% of neurovascular thrombectomy patients, over 90% of vascular thrombectomy patients and essentially 100% of patients to whom our real vr technology is applicable can be added in the future to the patients we can help with our current portfolio of products. let's start with our vascular franchise, which became our largest business for the first time in the fourth quarter. our lightning products once again drove strong growth in vascular.
in fact, our proprietary lightning technology is now embedded in products used to treat patients in both the venous and arterial segments with lightning 12 and now lightning seven, which i will discuss shortly. lightning 12 continues to be incredibly successful at removing blood clot in single sessions from the veins and pulmonary arteries. during the fourth quarter, lightning 12 received an indication from the fda for the treatment of pulmonary embolism, or pe.
in addition, we announced our partnership with rapidai to bring their cutting-edge artificial intelligence platform from stroke to pe. from early conversations with pulmonary embolism response teams, also known as per teams at hospitals, there is a lot of interest and need to streamline the communication flow and decision-making in pe cases to help more patients and help them faster. lightning 12 is just scratching the surface in venous and pulmonary thrombectomy, even though adoption and physician feedback since its third quarter launch has been extraordinary. during the last month, we started the initial evaluation cases for lightning seven, which have gone very well, and we expect a full launch in late march.
we think lightning seven can offer significant improvements to divisions treating patients with clot in their arteries and provide benefits that are similar to those of lightning 12 and provide -- lightning 12 is providing on the venous side. in addition, cat rx, our coronary product, continues to help more and more patients who have coronary clot, a u.s. population that we estimate is approximately the same size as the number of u.s. ischemic stroke patients eligible for mechanical thrombectomy each year. taking stock of our entire vascular business, including peripheral embolization, which also had a record quarter, we are poised for durable growth for many years to come.
now let me turn to our neuro business. in the fourth quarter, we launched bmx96, one of our most innovative access products. bmx96 has a slightly smaller outer diameter compared to our neuron max guide catheter, but our novel technology has allowed us to make the inner diameter even bigger, going from 0.088 to 0.096 inches. this allows for greater room inside the guide catheter to maneuver the other catheters being used in the case. it has been very well received by physicians, not just in stroke cases, but in all types of neurovascular cases.
on the stroke side of the business, following the recall of jet seven xtra flex, some of our stroke physicians switched directly to our ace68 or jet seven standard tip, whereas others took this opportunity to try other reperfusion catheters. following that trialing, some of those physicians are coming back to using either ace68 or jet seven standard tip as their primary reperfusion catheter. in fact, based on both the demand for exchanges as part of the recall and current demand, we are working through a back-order situation for the jet seven standard tip which we expect to resolve in the next month.
these products, together with the rest of our portfolio, will continue to play an important role in many stroke cases until later this year when we update our catheters. in addition, we remain very optimistic about our future innovation that we hope will bring even better solutions to our physician customers. 2020 was clearly a challenging year for the growth of u.s. stroke procedures, in general, due primarily to covid, but this motivates us to work even harder to successfully treat more stroke patients. we constantly remind ourselves of the enormous cost of the resultant disability of stroke that is devastating to patients and put such a huge financial burden on our healthcare system, billions and billions of dollars.
it will take some time, but we believe for these reasons, the market will get back to growth over time. now let's now move to our newest product area, virtual reality, or vr. vr is the area in which we think we can help the most patients over the long term. our real immersive vr system is proprietary technology designed specifically as a platform for healthcare applications, built from the ground up to deliver creative applications that are purpose-built for medical conditions that impact millions of patients. our vision for real has actually expanded over the past year.
first, there is a large opportunity for us to serve many patients who need some form of rehabilitation with applications that are tailor-made for patients interacting with their physical or occupational therapists, not only in the clinic, but also virtually while the patient is in their own home. this rehabilitation opportunity for real includes patients recovering from stroke, cardiac rehab, orthopedic rehab, movement disorders, traumatic brain injury and other conditions. we also believe that it is important to offer a broad portfolio of applications dedicated to helping patients suffering from chronic pain, mental health, stress and anxiety and memory loss, among others.
the clinical evidence around the benefits provided by virtual reality for both rehabilitation and mental health applications is significant already, and we plan to build on these data, working with some of the world's foremost vr experts in healthcare to develop applications and clinical evidence for the real platform. we fully recognize that many uncertainties remain, and we have a lot to prove regarding the real platform, but we strongly believe that what we are doing with the real platform truly matters and can help a great number of people.
now let me update you on our international business, which performed well in the quarter. first, i'd like to share company updates related to china. during the fourth quarter, we signed a new multifaceted agreement with genesis medtech group, which merged with hua medtech, our former partner, making it, we believe, the largest domestic company in china's neurovascular space. our initial collaboration is a multiyear, fixed-term, strategic partnership for five products: ace68, ace60, 3max, neuron max, 088 and jet d. and each product produces three distinct revenue streams: licensing, royalties and product distribution, for which we have a good visibility.
we are excited to be working in partnership with genesis as they share our commitment to patients, and we believe they have the capacity and expertise to bring these important technologies to patients in china. we're also excited about future opportunities for penumbra in japan. while 2020 was a challenging year for us in japan, owing to covid reimbursement changes and ultimately the jet seven xtra flex recall, we see many opportunities for growth in the region, not only in our current stroke and vascular embolization business, but in vascular thrombectomy and virtual reality over the long term as well.
looking forward, we expect solid growth in japan in 2021 and beyond. we also made solid progress in europe, latin america and asia pacific in 2020 and expect to see continued growth in 2021. finally, i'd like to discuss the pandemic and its effect on our business. the surge in cases around the holidays and our team's continued focus to maintain a safe, working environment for employees had a small impact on our production. however, assuming the virus variants do not change the current status, we believe we will be able to navigate our production capacity during this time and keep up with demand.
as for the impact on our revenue, like most of our peers, we did see some impact in the first part of the quarter around elective cases in the united states and in some international locations which will have a minor impact on this quarter. that said, assuming the current trajectory continues, we do not think it will have a major impact on our annual growth for 2021.
i'll turn the call over to maggie to go over our financial results for the quarter and the full year.
maggie yuen -- chief financial officer
thank you, adam. good afternoon. i will begin with a discussion of the financial impact of the recent jet seven xtra flex voluntary recall, then i will go into the results for the fourth quarter and full year 2020. with the. announcement of the voluntary recall of jet seven xtra flex on december 15, 2020, the financial impact in the fourth quarter was a reduction of $5.8 million in revenue due to refunds for product returns as well as $12.6 million in charges to cost of sales, primarily related to inventory write-offs and cost for product exchanges. this voluntary recall had an impact of approximately 900 basis points to our gross margin.
these figures represent the total expected financial statement impact from the voluntary recall as we have accounted for or estimated any future returns or exchanges as required by the accounting rules. we do not expect to see any material changes to our financial statement in either a further reduction in revenue or increase in cost-of-sales expense in 2021 due to any lingering impact of the recall. the following fourth quarter financial metrics will represent non-gaap financial results, which exclude the impact of the voluntary recall, as previously described.
as a reminder, fourth quarter gaap figures and a reconciliation from gaap to non-gaap measures are provided. for the fourth quarter ended december 31, 2020, our total non-gaap revenues were $172.7 million, an increase of 18.9% reported and 17.7% in constant currency compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. our geographic mix of sales in the quarter were 70%, u.s.; and 30%, international. u.s. and international reported sequential growth of 10.5% and 24.4%, respectively, compared to q3 2020 or 44.7% the same period last year.
our year-over-year performance is driven by growth across vascular thrombectomy and embolization products, and we also saw a strong sequential growth from lightning 12. revenue from our neuro business was $85.6 million in the fourth quarter, an increase of 0.2% reported and decrease of 1.2% in constant currency compared to the same period a year ago. revenue for jet seven xtra flex through december 15 was $9 million or 5.2% of total non-gaap revenue, excluding the impact of the recall. our u.s. neuro business declined by 0.3% reported on a sequential basis. our international neuro business increased by 30.3% sequentially and 5% reported compared to the same quarter a year ago.
these results were driven by strong performance across europe, china and asia-pacific regions. our non-gaap gross margin in the quarter was 65.2% compared to 67.6% a year ago and sequentially improved from 60.2% in q3 2020. our gradual improvement in gross margin is driven by fixed cost leverage with increased demand and favorable product mix. we continue to invest in direct labor and overhead spending on covid-19-related safety measures and have made trade-offs in efficiency to ensure employee safety and to support product demand. looking forward, we expect gross margin performance to continue at current level, but it could slightly fluctuate with price and product mix.
total operating expense for the quarter was $96.1 million or 55.6% of non-gaap revenue compared to $87.5 million or 60.3% of revenue for the same quarter a year ago. our research and development expenses for q4 2020 were $19.5 million compared to $12.9 million for q4 2019 as we continue to invest in product development programs. sg&a expenses for q4 2020 were $76.6 million compared to $74.7 million for q4 2019. our spend increased primarily due to increase in headcount and related compensation expense, while we continue to have slower spending in activities, such as travel and conferences.
we had non-gaap operating income in the quarter of $16.6 million compared to operating income of $10.6 million for the same period last year. i will now summarize our full year gaap performance. for full year 2020, our total revenue for the year were $560.4 million, which represent an increase of 2.4% reported and 2.1% in constant currency compared to full year 2019. revenue from our vascular business for the full year 2020 was $267.8 million, an increase of 24.1% reported and 23.9% in constant currency.
revenue from our neuro business for the full year 2020 was $292.6 million, a decline of 11.8% reported and 12% in constant currency. our gross profit for the year was 60.3% of revenues compared to 68% of revenue for full year 2019. we had operating loss for the year of $38.9 million compared to a comparable operating income of $47.5 million for 2019.
turning to cash flow and balance sheet. in 2020, we increased our inventory balance by $67 million, which primarily consisted of $24 million of investment in stocking of real system and $43 million in consignment raw material and finishes to support new product launches and growth in demand. in the fourth quarter, $18 million of real stocking was reclassified on the balance sheet from property and equipment to inventory due to changes in our go-to-market model. we ended the year with $265 million in cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities and no debt.
and now i'd like to turn the call over to jason to discuss our 2021 guidance.
jason mills -- executive vice president, strategy
thank you, maggie, and good afternoon, everybody. we entered 2021 with strong momentum in our business. the markets we target are large. the products we bring to physicians are unique, and our dedication to patients remains paramount to our culture. we are introducing revenue guidance for full year 2021 in the range of $675 million to $685 million, which represents 20% to 22% growth over full year 2020 revenue of $560.4 million.
regarding revenue trends. we anticipate revenue in the first quarter to be lower than our record q4 results then increasing sequentially throughout the subsequent quarters of the year. we highlight two factors to consider with this guidance. first, we saw an impact to elective procedures in january from the resurgence in covid cases in the u.s. and other geographies. we expect this to be a minor factor in our first quarter results. second, our guidance takes into account the near-term dynamics in our neuro thrombectomy business after the mid-december recall of jet seven xtra flex.
that said, we are optimistic about our current portfolio of stroke products as well as our pipeline of new products, including the potential to usher in a new paradigm in stroke intervention. overall, consistent with our approach to setting guidance in the past, our 2021 revenue guidance represents our current views on our markets, timing of new product launches and other relevant inputs.
i will now turn the call back to adam for closing remarks.
adam elsesser -- president, chairman and chief executive officer
thank you, jason. i'd like to end our prepared remarks by first acknowledging the incredible work of the penumbra team during this challenging time to continue to ensure our products were available to help so many patients in need. your dedication is extraordinary, and i am proud to work with all of you.
and finally, i know everyone at penumbra would like to thank our physician customers and their entire teams for the work they have done over the past year, sometimes in extremely challenging circumstances to treat their patients. your heroic work motivates us to continue innovating to make better and better products and has meant so much to us this year.
thank you. and now we'd like to open the call to questions. operator, please go ahead.

[operator instructions] our first question is from bill plovanic with canaccord. your line is open.
bill plovanic -- canaccord -- analyst
great, thanks. good evening. the first question that we -- just on the -- you gave us some color on cadence and guidance. considering the quarter and if you back out the onetime charges, your annual 2021 guidance is below just fourth quarter 2020 annualized. and i'm trying to understand the puts and takes. i understand with the neuro and some of the comments and maybe that's not a growth business, but just trying to understand is that -- do you expect that to go back significantly? i'm just trying to put all this together, and it just seems a little lower than what we would have expected.
jason mills -- executive vice president, strategy
thanks, bill, for the question. this is jason. i'll start, and then adam can add on. so as we said in the prepared remarks, we did see, in january, a bit of an impact as our peer group has seen in covid, and we also are just taking into account the dynamics associated with the neuro thrombectomy business and the recall. that having been said, we're very optimistic and confident about our business. and as we mentioned, we expect to see sequential increases as the year progresses. adam?
adam elsesser -- president, chairman and chief executive officer
yes. as you know, bill, when you set guidance at the beginning of the year, looking out, we try to be as accurate and careful as possible. that said, i think the guidance represents a pretty strong growth for the company as we look at 2021 and of course beyond. but we obviously -- or i think jason's point about the first quarter is fair and obvious. but going forward, i think the numbers represent pretty strong growth.
bill plovanic -- canaccord -- analyst
and then just a follow-up on that. in terms of the neurovascular, you've talked, i think, last year a bit now this -- some of the commentary in the prepared remarks just the kind of new platform to replace the jet seven in this neuro area. i was just wondering if we could get a little more color on what those -- the features benefits may be, and if not on that granularity, at least maybe some timing associated we should think about?
adam elsesser -- president, chairman and chief executive officer
yes. it's a very fair question. i'm going to not on this call with this question break new news, so i'll prepare you for that. but i will share, there are two separate things. one is, and we said that on this call, the update to reperfusion catheters, and then separate from that, what we're calling this new technology with a paradigm change. the update on the catheters is just to continue to make them better and more trackable. the -- which is not new news.
the paradigm shift, we've talked about this more in generalities, where the goal of what we're trying to do with all of our thrombectomy product lines, in stroke, particularly, is to try to get all the clot out, not part of the clot out, but all the clot out as fast as possible in all the cases and no matter where the clot is located. and we think we can make an impact on that with our new technology. we'll wait and see, but i'm not yet able to go beyond describing that technology, but we're pretty excited about it and want to bring it as soon as we can.
bill plovanic -- canaccord -- analyst
great. thank you for taking my question.
adam elsesser -- president, chairman and chief executive officer
of course. thank you.
jason mills -- executive vice president, strategy
thanks, bill.

our next question is from robbie marcus with jpmorgan. your line is now open.
allen gong -- jpmorgan -- analyst
hi, guys. this is actually allen on for robbie. i want to start off with a quick question on lightning. obviously, the peripheral side of the thrombectomy business is going to continue to do very well, even with covid-19 headwinds. so when we look at lightning seven and the kind of growth that lightning 12 has given you, given it is moving into an area that you already had a very strong presence in arterial, should we think of that as a more kind of like a modest benefit to the business? since it's not like you're moving into an area that you didn't have a strong presence in already? or can we think of that as being as big of an impact as lightning 12 was for the broader franchise?
adam elsesser -- president, chairman and chief executive officer
yes. it's a really good question. i think the way we look at it really is in just total numbers. if you look at the arterial side, there are a lot more patients that are being intervened on with -- or surgically treated for arterial clot than there are patients who are being intervened on for venous or pe, and we've gone through those numbers in the past. there are 250,000, and these are u.s. numbers, patients who have arterial clot that is being treated through intervention or surgery. and that's compared to a little over 100,000 on the venous and pe side.
so the opportunity is just bigger. and so that -- and the impact on those patients is pretty extreme. you're, in many cases, not all, intervening or doing this in order to make sure you can save a leg or and a limb. and so by definition, we think, in the long run, that, that will have a significant positive impact on the business but of course on those patients. so the uptick on that, how fast do people convert to lightning seven? that's an open question. right now, many of our customers are having great success with our current technology. the barrier for many people to have converted -- because, again, we're not even treating 10% of these patients.
the barrier for the other 90%, in many cases, what we've heard doctors say is they don't want to use as large a catheter as our cat eight, which is an eight-french system. and so we're offering now a slightly smaller french size, a seven, but with almost all the benefits of a bigger catheter. it's just smaller enough, and that's using our new novel technology to maximize the inner diameter. so it's almost the size of cat eight on the inner diameter. but then we add to it lightning, which allows for a case in which you don't have to worry about blood loss or -- and you have sort of the auditorial signals that you're in clot. and those are the things that i think will help bring folks who have not yet tried our system over to try single session.
and again, a lot of the discussion around single-session treatment versus multiple-day lytic treatment is in the forefront of the medical discussion with these doctors because of covid and icu beds and all that. so i think we'll have some real success with it. will some of the physicians who were using cat eight go back to -- down a size? maybe, in certain cases, but i think some of them might stay with cat eight.
operator
our next question is from bob hopkins with bank of america. your line is open.
bob hopkins -- bank of america -- analyst
great, and good afternoon. can you hear me ok?
adam elsesser -- president, chairman and chief executive officer
yes. hi, bob.
jason mills -- executive vice president, strategy
hi, bob.
bob hopkins -- bank of america -- analyst
great. good afternoon, adam. so a couple of things. you guys had previously said that you might be getting into the weeds a little bit more on real this year with either maybe an analyst day or some sort of event to kind of put a little bit more meat on the bone. is that still going to happen at some point this year? and i think you had also previously said that the new stroke system would definitely launch sometime in 2021. i just wanted to confirm that was still the case.
adam elsesser -- president, chairman and chief executive officer
so let's start on the stroke side. we are fairly confident. again, we don't control every regulatory decision that our catheters will come out. we will wait and give a little more definitive update on timing of the sort of new paradigm shift, again, as i get more confidence and clarity around specific dates on the regulatory front. so i don't want to give you time frames that are specific on this call until i have that certainty. that being said, on the real side, we definitely will share the new technology, the models.
the timing of that, as we look at it, it would be so more helpful and impactful if that was done in person, so people can experience and see virtual reality. so if that's possible in the first half, we'll do that. if we have to wait a little bit so we can have that, we'll find a way to share what we can virtually and then have the in-person follow and just give us a little time to sort that out. but there's no question we will be sharing a lot more that in the near term as we approach because, as you can tell, we're pretty excited about it.
bob hopkins -- bank of america -- analyst
yes. and along those lines, adam, how big a push is this product going to be in 2021? i mean, in your -- maybe a way to ask it is implicit in the guidance that you gave, what kind of contribution do you have from real? are you making a big push on the launch front this year? just maybe a little bit more color on what we might expect this year from that technology.
adam elsesser -- president, chairman and chief executive officer
yes. i think it's a really good question. 2021 is not the year that we're counting on a huge revenue contribution from this product. rather, it's a year in which there's a lot of work that we want to do to lay the base and the groundwork for that future revenue growth. but a lot of that, i think, will become even clearer when we talk about this in the future when we sort of explain both the go-to-market model and where our thoughts have evolved on this product. but again, the possibility to help a huge number of people has just gotten clearer, and we remain pretty excited. but most of our revenue guidance revolves around our interventional products.
bob hopkins -- bank of america -- analyst
and then just one real last quick one on the guidance, on the neuro piece of the guidance. do you have neuro growing over 10% implicit in that guidance? or i'm just trying to get a sense for a rough breakdown of how much you think neuro will grow and how much that contributes to that 20% to 22% overall growth you're forecasting?
jason mills -- executive vice president, strategy
yes. hey, bob, it's jason. thanks for the question. it's a really fair question. as you know, we don't break out our guidance to that level of detail, and so we're not going to do that here. but that having been said, if you look at the businesses in total, we're really optimistic about the products we have in the current portfolios for both neuro and vascular as well as the new products that are contributing in both. and we've talked about both the current and the new on this call. so i'm not going to give any ranges for you for the two businesses, but we're confident in both that both can contribute to growth over time.
bob hopkins -- bank of america -- analyst
okay. thank you very much.
jason mills -- executive vice president, strategy
thanks, bob.

our next question is from larry biegelsen with wells fargo. your line is open.
lei huang -- wells fargo -- analyst
hi. it's larry -- it's lei calling in for larry. thanks for taking my question. can you talk a little bit more about the xtra flex recall and really -- and specifically the capture rate? you've made a comment about physicians moving to other pen devices versus competing devices and coming back to pen. is there anything you can quantify or give a little more color to that?
adam elsesser -- president, chairman and chief executive officer
yes. no. that's a great question, and it's a very -- it had been and still, i think, remains a bit of a fluid process. so i think quantifying it at this stage is challenging because it's changing. one of the things that i think we had some instinct around, our ace68 and our jet seven standard tip were, at the time, great catheters when they were dominant in the market. and just because we launched jet seven xtra flex did not make them less good catheters.
and when you take away jet seven xtra flex and its tractability and just compare ace60 to jet seven standard tip to many of the market -- other products on the market, they hold up really well. they perform really, really well. and so i think the nature of this -- many of our physician is to try new things and to make sure that they're testing them out, but it has not surprised us and certainly been heartening for our team to see many people coming back to using the catheters that have done so well and have huge amounts of clinical data to support their use and are really independently great products.
so i think we're in a pretty good spot, i mean, as i called out in such a way that we went on a small back order on jet seven standard tip, which will resolve shortly here. so i think we're doing ok. that being said, i think everyone knows us. we never rest on our laurels, and we're going to keep innovating and can't wait to the new -- some new catheters come out later this year.
lei huang -- wells fargo -- analyst
great. and if i can have another question, just on what you talked about reaching $1 billion-plus revenue in 2023, adam. given the pandemic and the recall, what gives you the confidence at this point to kind of get to that?
adam elsesser -- president, chairman and chief executive officer
well, i think the confidence -- i mean, it's a great question, and the confidence comes from the success we've had the last couple of quarters, the growth of our -- all of our businesses but particularly the lightning series, which, really, is in the earliest innings and the reaction to that. you add in some of the other products that we've talked about and called out, even today on today's call and what we have coming, i think that innovation and that sort of constant improving from our baseline is what gives us that confidence that we're on the right track.
but let's -- it's a couple of years away. let's see how it goes. but as you can tell, i think from our prepared remarks and some of our answers, the products we have now are performing really well and solve so many of the issues that physicians wanted solved. i went to a long answer on the lightning seven question, in part, so people understood that, that product, it's sort of unusual, right?
you're going slightly smaller, albeit that's in the inner diameter, almost the same size as the cat eight or bigger. but you're doing exactly what the doctors wanted without taking away any of the power, in fact adding capacity with lightning. so i think those are the kinds of things where we listen to our customers. we iterate and innovate as fast as possible give us the confidence that we can hit that target.
jason mills -- executive vice president, strategy
and the only thing i would add to that, as adam mentioned in his prepared remarks, is sort of the market backdrop to all of that. so on the product side, i talked about our confidence and optimism. the market backdrop in each one of the segments that we are focused on is really positive, positive from the standpoint of those patients we've already helped but even more patients, 80% in stroke, over 90% in peripheral thrombectomy, and then we've got the whole market in front of us in virtual reality. so that provides a backdrop about which we're excited.
lei huang -- wells fargo -- analyst
great. thanks so much.
jason mills -- executive vice president, strategy
thank you.

ryan zimmerman -- btig -- analyst
thanks. thanks for taking the question. so adam, i just want to ask one. hey, guys. so i just want to ask one. first on jet seven and jet seven xtra flex, this paradigm shift you're talking about, adam. i'll ask it in a different way. but what is it that you feel like you're trying to build upon from jet seven xtra flex that you're solving for, maybe just beyond the design challenges you ran into with the agency? what is it that needs improvement at this point in ischemic stroke? and not to steal thunder from maybe what you're going to debut later on this year when you do debut it, but what were some of the issues beyond what we saw maybe with some of the reports in the maude database?
adam elsesser -- president, chairman and chief executive officer
yes. thank you, ryan, for the question. i think the two things are unrelated, and i think i -- it's really important that i make sure you understand that. so the paradigm -- the current paradigm is to make catheters as big as possible to, therefore, suck out as much clot as possible. as you make catheters bigger, making them big and trackable becomes the design challenge, which jet seven xtra flex did a really good job of, again, follow -- if instructions and all were followed.
that paradigm that every company is now trying to make bigger catheters that track well is the paradigm that we're saying is going to -- might change where that race is no longer as necessary because you think about a different way to think about removing all the clot as fast as possible. so we're not really -- the challenges or the design considerations, i should say, for this new product or new technology is really unrelated to jet seven xtra flex or ace68 or any of the other catheters. it's trying to deal with the underlying issue, which is how do i sort of democratize and make the success of cases broader.
right now, some physicians can -- with certain patients, have great success quickly. other patients don't have that kind of success. what we're trying to do is create a product that can have the ability to remove all the clot out as fast as possible in everybody. and so that's sort of the point. so it's sort of unrelated to jet seven. when you update our catheters, our key is to make big catheters track as fast as possible -- as well as possible. that's today's paradigm. and we'll continue to do that until the new technology is out there.
ryan zimmerman -- btig -- analyst
okay. thank you for taking that. and then just a follow-up to bob's earlier question, and i don't know if we'll get color on this or not, but maggie, i think, alluded to a change in business strategy related to real. and so contrasting that with what you laid out maybe in '19 at the analyst day, what can we take to mean from that -- those comments in terms of business strategy on real? thank you.
adam elsesser -- president, chairman and chief executive officer
yes. no. ryan, that's a good question, and that's one of the things that we'll share as soon as we can. as maggie said, it's really about our go-to-market strategy. one of the more interesting things about a lot of the things we've ever done, whether it was stroke or the vascular thrombectomy and now real, is they haven't been done before. when we started out in stroke, the idea of taking a catheter, a large catheter up deep into the brain and sucking out clot no one had done, and so they were lots of things to figure out and learn and get better at.
and real is no different. and as we do more work, get more experience, get more feedback, we're constantly -- i think part of our strength is being able to evolve and adjust. and we've looked at our go-to-market model and the way that should go, and i think we're evolving our ambitions in a very strong and positive way. we're really sitting on something that can be a platform for the entire healthcare field, and that's pretty powerful.
ryan zimmerman -- btig -- analyst
thanks for taking the question.
operator
our next question is from margaret kaczor with william blair. your line is open.
brandon vazquez -- william blair -- analyst
hi, everyone. this is brandon on for margaret. thanks for taking the question. first, can i just ask a question on the vascular side? is there any way you can quantify how impactful covid might have been in vascular in 2020? and i ask because it was actually a very strong year for vascular despite kind of a higher mix to elective procedures. so i'm trying to understand, as patients come back into the funnel, potentially, there's some backlog in vascular patients and you continue the momentum you're seeing with lightning seven and lightning 12. is there a potential for vascular to even accelerate as we move through 2021?
adam elsesser -- president, chairman and chief executive officer
yes. it's a really, really good question. so one of -- there are really two parts to that. the first part is, are we seeing more patients, if you will, that have clots because of covid? we certainly saw that in sort of the april-may time frame when it was a new phenomenon, and the healthcare professionals weren't yet aware of it enough and were trying to catch up. i think a lot of that has -- medical management of a lot of covid patients has gotten up to speed pretty quickly, and so i don't think we're seeing any sort of quantifiable numbers, massively large numbers of more patients because of covid.
that being said, and i alluded to it already today, one of the benefits of covid and i -- the moment i said that, i realized that came out wrong. i don't mean that as a benefit of covid. but one of the five products of covid, was the word i was looking for, is people needed to think about treating a lot of these patients in single sessions, and that plays directly into our technology. and that's different than sessions that take multiple days or require sort of a longer recovery period.
and so that, i think, is opening many physicians' minds to the technology that we've brought, and then you add in it the ease of use around lightning. i think that has been certainly helpful to sort of move physicians toward our technology, and i think that phenomenon is here to stay for a while. i think that will continue because it's sort of top of mind of many people as they think about the idea of single-session treatment.
brandon vazquez -- william blair -- analyst
got it. thanks. and then in terms of gross margins, if i heard maggie correctly, i think she had said that you're broadly expecting gross margins to remain somewhat in line or flat as we move through 2021. i was just curious, one, did i hear that correctly? and two, with a premium on lightning 12 and presumably a slight premium on lightning seven as well and then as we move past covid, maybe some of the manufacturing efficiencies can start to die off a little bit. why -- can we start to see gross margin expansion in the back half of 2021 maybe approaching the pre-covid 2019 levels?
maggie yuen -- chief financial officer
yes. hey, thanks for the question. yes. i did mention that, for 2021, gross margin is likely continue to stay at the current level and not return that quickly to the pre-covid gross margin level. at least not until we are completely out of the pandemic manufacturing environment and cost structure, it is not something that will switch overnight. we can probably until the end of 2021 to see if the manufacturing environment changes. we did see slight accretive impact to our gross margin as a result of lightning, and we're going to assume similar trend going forward.
brandon vazquez -- william blair -- analyst
got it. thank you.
adam elsesser -- president, chairman and chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
[operator instructions] our next question is from joanne wuensch with citi. your line is open.
matt henriksson -- citi -- analyst
yeah, hi. this is matt henriksson in for joanne. our first question is related to stroke. we've talked a lot about the new products that are coming out. but with stroke protocol, 2020 was obviously a quiet year. but how do you look at 2021 with kind of new states and legislation adding new protocols? and especially with this new paradigm shift, will that help accelerate that process?
adam elsesser -- president, chairman and chief executive officer
yes. let me answer the last question first. unfortunately, i don't think those two are tied. the way one is treated versus the energy needed to get patients to the right hospital, i think they're sort of unfortunately de-linked. it'd be nice to link them. i really don't have the kind of visibility on the question around the state legislation that i did before covid, in part, state legislators are very busy doing lots of other things. as you know, their hands are full with crises. i do get -- we obviously get updates from the get ahead of stroke campaign that is run by the physician society.
there's been some movement in some of the states, but it hasn't been incredibly fast. there's some moving into 2020, so i expect 2021 to have some progress. but i do think what will drive this in the short term is the kind of work that drove it before the state legislature work, and that is people being able to go back out into their community, make sure these patients are treated. and as we get a little closer to normalcy and having a lot of the healthcare workers vaccinated already, we're sensing that they're anxious to get back in to build their practice and go into the community to do that.
so i'm cautiously optimistic. but again, i want to be realistic that when you're in a dynamic like this, the work that's necessary to drive that doesn't become first priority. and i think that's what -- i said that during my prepared remarks that 2021 saw that -- 2020, saw that. but i do think, and this is the part that, that, that is really important, we have too much evidence that we should treat these people. the cost of not treating on both to their health but also financially is so significant that this isn't how the story ends. we're going to keep at this, and we're going to -- there are a lot of people that will stay motivated to drive this growth. it just might not be in this quarter or next quarter, but i do think it will continue.
i think that's just -- we know too much, and i think it will happen. from the company standpoint, and again, this is -- i think everyone knows this now, we will continue to grow because we have such a broad portfolio of products that cover a lot of different areas. and stroke is obviously not the single thing driving our growth. but obviously, we've taken a lot of questions on it. we remain incredibly committed to being -- innovating in there. i do think it's going to take a little longer, though.
matt henriksson -- citi -- analyst
that makes sense. and then just looking at the r&d line, we noticed there was a dropoff in both the absolute spending and the percentage of revenue between the third quarter and the fourth quarter. what's the strategy behind kind of, first, the fourth quarter spending? and then how should we look at 2021? is this something where we're looking more back toward the 20% of revenue? or is it kind of 11% to 12% kind of the rate going forward?
maggie yuen -- chief financial officer
yes. i'll take that. first of all, if you remember in our last quarter earnings call, we talk about a $20 million of r&d onetime expenditures related to lightning 12 that we reported as a non-gaap expenditure. so going forward, our q4 spending as a percent of revenue is likely going to be the trend going forward.

with that, i would like to turn over the call to adam elsesser.
adam elsesser -- president, chairman and chief executive officer
thank you, stephen, and i appreciate you filling in for jee while she is on maternity leave. good afternoon, everybody. thank you for joining penumbra's first quarter 2021 conference call. our total revenues for the first quarter were $169.2 million, a year-over-year increase of 23.2% as reported and 21.5% in constant currency. for the first quarter of 2021, we recorded operating income of $13.5 million or 8% of revenue, compared to operating income of $0.6 million during the same period last year. our vascular business produced outstanding growth again this quarter, with revenue expanding 50.5% year-over-year to $89.2 million, and we believe we are just getting started in vascular. our neuro business exceeded our expectations in the first quarter, posting total revenue of $80 million, up 2.5% year-over-year. our neuro team's extraordinary work following the jet seven xtra flex recall in mid-december, sets us up well throughout 2021 and beyond as we prepare to launch important new products. further, we continue to make progress with our real immersive therapeutic platform and we are increasingly excited about the growing opportunities to help patients. and lastly, we saw solid trends in our international business, especially in china. our first quarter results show that our products are positively impacting more patients than ever before, yet we are driven every day by the number of patients we can still help. we have been purposeful in building a true portfolio of innovative products that has provided us the base to produce durable growth. now i'd like to briefly discuss our innovation and portfolio breadth across each of these franchises. let's start with our vascular franchise.
our proprietary lightning technology coupled with our latest catheter innovation cat7 and cat12 once again drove strong growth in our peripheral thrombectomy franchise this quarter. the effectiveness speed and value of our technology in both these vascular beds is resonating with our physician customers driving increasing adoption of these tools to help patients suffering from clots in their bodies. lightning 12 continues to be incredibly successful at removing blood clot in single sessions from the veins and pulmonary arteries. and with the recent pe indication cleared by the fda and the upcoming launch of rapid ai's artificial intelligence pe platform, we continue to think our lightning franchise will drive strong growth for penumbra in the venous space going forward. on the arterial side, we launched lightning seven to our customers toward the end of the first quarter. the feedback has been extremely positive. cat7 utilizes our proprietary hypotube lumen maximizing technology which provides to physicians treating arterial clot, a catheter with a smaller outer diameter without materially compromising on the inner diameter, plus it incorporates the significant benefits of our proprietary lightning technology for blood saving and ease of use. with both lightning 12 and lightning seven, we now have the opportunity to help a significant number of arterial and venous clot patients among both current and new customers. bringing this technology to all interventional radiologists, vascular surgeons and interventional cardiologists will not happen in one or two quarters. it will take time but we understand the benefits for patients and our team is committed to this mission. turning to our coronary thrombectomy system cat rx again posted record results. and it still has a very long runway in a market we estimate is approximately the same size as the us stroke market.
the society of cardiovascular angiography and interventions updated their guidance late last year to include cat rx as a viable option for treating large thrombus burden in saphenous vein grafts. and we are investing in further clinical work to expand cat rx's presence in this relatively large field. our peripheral embolization business also had another record quarter in the us growing nearly 20% year-over-year. not only do we have a unique portfolio of products in this area, but we continue to invest in innovation here as well. for instance, one of our newest products ruby low profile or lp once again contributed meaningfully to our peripheral embolization growth this quarter. overall, within this franchise we are seeing both new physicians gravitate to our products and increasing utilization by our existing customers. in sum, the continued strong performance from both peripheral thrombectomy and peripheral embolization highlight the extraordinary important work our vascular team is doing in this field. now let me turn to our neuro business starting with our neuro access franchise, which had its best quarter ever. we are seeing increasing adoption of bmx96 as nearly double the number of our neuro physician customers used bmx96 during the first quarter as compared to the fourth quarter when it was initially launched. bmx96 is being used not only in stroke cases, but across all neurovascular cases. indeed our access franchise produced double-digit growth in the us alone. we still have a long way to go with this product in the us and also internationally where we have not yet launched it. bmx96's early success is a good example of why we put so much emphasis on both innovation and portfolio. products within our vascular and neuro franchises are not only unique, but are also interconnected with other products within each respective portfolio giving physicians a comprehensive solution set to help as many patients as possible.
looking forward and with a continued focus on both innovation and portfolio we believe we are very well positioned for future growth across all of our neuro franchises stroke, access, embolization within which our smart coil line had its best quarter ever and also neurosurgical. speaking of our neurosurgical business, which we don't talk about as much, we had one of our best quarters ever with the artemis system. it is worth noting that we are investing in the development of important clinical evidence that we believe is necessary to open up this therapy to many more ich patients in future. turning to our stroke franchise. our business in the us exceeded our expectations. our neuro team did extraordinary work demonstrating strength, resilience and expertise in the field we were instrumental in helping create over a decade ago. we focus on a few things we think are critical in this field. the importance of offering stroke physicians a full portfolio of innovative products, commitment and service to our customers, and most importantly, the best end-to-end solutions to treat stroke in both large and distal anatomy. looking forward, we are excited to bring to customers our newest stroke catheters, the red series. in the next several months we hope to introduce red62, which will be an extraordinary step forward in stroke, intervention for the distal anatomy optimizing trackability and maximizing thrombus removal. we believe that there are still a disproportionate percentage of treatable strokes in the distal anatomy that are not treated because of limitations on technology. we think red62 will be a cornerstone product helping physicians treat more stroke patients going forward. further we look forward to launching additional catheters within the red series soon thereafter. and we are also excited by the work we are doing to introduce a new paradigm in stroke intervention as well. i'd like to now focus on the real platform.
our vision for real continues to expand, as we learn more and identify additional opportunities to help patients within the realms of both physical rehabilitation as well as mental and cognitive wellness. we are fully aware of the unique opportunity we have to do something groundbreaking in virtual reality for healthcare. we will leverage our proprietary technology for fully immersive mobile experiences to make the real immersive therapeutic platform available in all settings in which we believe patients can benefit from virtual reality therapy. there is already a significant amount of clinical evidence showing the benefits, provided by virtual reality for both, rehabilitation and mental health applications. and we have plans to build on these data, working with some of the world's foremost vr experts in healthcare. we have a lot of work to do and a lot to prove with real in the vr field. but each day we see the potential, to help a great number of people. later this year, when it is safe to congregate physically, we plan to host an investor meeting focused on our real platform. we will update everyone, over the coming months. now, let's turn to our international markets. our business in china, augmented by the new multifaceted agreement we signed with genesis medtech group, last quarter performed very well again in the first quarter. and we are optimistic about additional growth opportunities going forward. in japan, we continue to expect solid growth in 2021, and beyond. we also made solid progress in europe, latin america and asia pacific notwithstanding, some impact from the pandemic. and we expect to see growth in these regions going forward.
i'll now turn the call over to maggie, to go over our financial results for the quarter.
maggie yuen -- chief financial officer
thank you, adam. good afternoon everyone. today i will discuss the financial results for the first quarter 2021. additional details will be contained within our quarterly reports on form 10-q. for the first quarter ended march 31st 2021, our total revenues were $169.2 million, an increase of 23.2% reported and 21.5% in constant currency, compared to the first quarter of 2020. our geographic mix of sales in the quarter, were 71% u.s. and 29% international. u.s. and international reported growth of 25.4% and 18.2% respectively, compared to the same period in 2020. revenue from our, vascular business, grew to $89.2 million in the first quarter of 2021, an increase of 50.5% reported of 49.1% in constant currency compared to the same period last year. in the quarter, our vascular performance were driven by growth in both, thrombectomy and embolization franchises with growth across the europe and u.s. revenue from our neuro business was $80 million in the first quarter of 2021, an increase of 2.5% reported and 0.6% in constant currency, compared to the same period a year ago, driven by growth in our access franchise across all regions. our neuro business increased 0.3% sequentially, driven by growth in the u.s. japan and china, partially offset by decline in europe and latin america with the resurgence of covid impact.
gross margin in the first quarter was 65.8%, compared to 64.1% in the same quarter last year, and compared to q4 2020 gross margin of 56.5% and non-gaap gross margin of 65.2% excluding the product recall impact. we have implemented additional safety protocols in our manufacturing facilities with the resurgence of covid cases in california in the beginning of the year. and i'm proud of our ability to continue to scale production capacity to support our expanding portfolio of products. looking forward, our gross margin could fluctuate slightly due to price and product mix. total operating expense for the quarter was $97.9 million, or 57.8% of revenue, compared to $87.4 million or 63.6% of revenue for the same quarter last year. our research and development expense for q1 2021 were $18.1 million, compared to $12.9 million for q1 2020. we will continue to invest in product development and platform capabilities. sg&a expenses for q1 2021 were $79.8 million compared to $74.5 million for q1 2020. the increase is mainly attributable to investment in commercial resources, and we have also seen domestic travels and other in-person activities gradually increase over the last few quarters. for the first quarter 2021, we recorded operating income of $13.5 million, or 8% of revenue compared to operating income of $0.6 million for the same period last year. we ended the first quarter with cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balance of $242.6 million. usage of cash in the quarter is attributable to the product recall and raw material purchases for new product launches.
and now, i'd like to turn the call over to jason to discuss our 2021 guidance.
jason mills -- executive vice president, strategy
thank you, maggie, and good afternoon, everybody. with the update of our first quarter results, we are formally increasing our 2021 revenue guidance range to $695 million to $705 million, which would represent 24% to 26% growth over 2020 revenue of $560.4 million, illustrating continued momentum expected in our business. this updated guidance compares to our original 2021 guidance range of $675 million to $685 million, given on our fourth quarter call in february. we see multiple drivers of growth and continue to expect our revenue to increase throughout the year. from a year-over-year standpoint, we expect our second quarter growth rate to be higher given the outsized impact of the covid pandemic during the second quarter of 2020. on a quarter-over-quarter basis, we expect growth to be higher in the second half of the year as we expand the rollout of new products including lightning seven and the red series of stroke catheters as hospital value analysis committee's work through several products introduced during the pandemic. overall consistent with our approach to setting guidance in the past, our updated 2021 revenue guidance represents current views on our markets, timing of new product launches and other relevant inputs.
i will now turn the call back to adam for closing remarks.
adam elsesser -- president, chairman and chief executive officer
thank you, jason. in the last several earnings calls, i have acknowledged the amazing work our customers have done, the dedication of our production workers and the entire team that has supported their work, during the heart of the pandemic and the extraordinary innovation from our engineers. today, i would like to specifically call out our field-based sales and clinical teams throughout the world. you all have stayed so focused and passionate on being available for your customers and through them the patients they treat. your work has always been best-in-class. but during the past 12 months, watching your engagement and dedication has been inspiring. i also want to say that this past quarter we lost a valued member of our sales team to an untimely passing. i know the entire team will join me in acknowledging his character and his extraordinary contribution as well as our deepest condolences to his wife and children. we love and we'll miss you.
thank you. and now we'd like to open the call to questions. operator, please go ahead.

[operator instructions] your first question comes from the line of robbie marcus from jpmorgan. your line is open.
robbie marcus -- jpmorgan -- analyst
great. first off, congratulations on a really nice quarter.
adam elsesser -- president, chairman and chief executive officer
thanks.
robbie marcus -- jpmorgan -- analyst
so adam it'd be great -- really got two questions. i'll just ask them upfront here. one it seems like you have some really good momentum coming out of first quarter. it'd be great to get a sense of how it progressed and really importantly how you exited and the trends into second quarter here so far? and then maybe just probably part of that is a lot of people after xtra flex was pulled in fourth quarter were concerned that you'd lose a good chunk of those sales. maybe just speak to what you've seen within stroke in -- around the world and have users migrated and stayed within the penumbra platform? thanks.
adam elsesser -- president, chairman and chief executive officer
yes. thanks, robbie. those are great questions. so i'll start with the first and sort of the trends. there's no question that some of our business in the early weeks of the quarter in january when things were looking a little more difficult or feeling a little more difficult with the pandemic were a little lighter. but as you know a lot of our business is more sort of emergent and therefore wasn't as impacted maybe as others. but there's no question we saw that improve throughout the quarter. hard to tell again given the nature of our business how much of that was the normal sort of quarterly sort of rhythm versus the pandemic. but obviously, we're feeling confident about where we sit right now and the business going forward. as it relates to stroke and that business we've been very fortunate. there's no question that the -- there's been a lot of sort of trialing and moving around. we commented on that earlier and in the fourth quarter call around that business. but the success of our product line in stroke the whole product line the jet seven standard tip as well as the ace68 in markets where that is have continued to perform really well. and we have seen doctors who have tried other products and other companies aspiration catheters come back to us. we think there's more room to go there and we think we're really positioned quite well as both the red62 comes out but also the other catheters in that series in the back half of the year. so we're feeling optimistic.
robbie marcus -- jpmorgan -- analyst
great. thanks, adam.
adam elsesser -- president, chairman and chief executive officer
thank you, robbie.
operator
your next question is from the line of larry biegelsen from wells fargo. your line is open. once again, larry biegelsen from wells fargo. your line is open.
larry biegelsen -- wells fargo -- analyst
hi, adam. can you hear me?
adam elsesser -- president, chairman and chief executive officer
yes, larry.
larry biegelsen -- wells fargo -- analyst
okay. there was a problem with i think my phone. apologies for that. and i missed the last part. i did want to ask about red62. can you comment on the timing? is this the next-generation workhorse kind of aspiration catheter which will kind of replace ace68, jet seven? and kind of what are the benefits of this catheter over current catheters? and i did have one follow-up.
adam elsesser -- president, chairman and chief executive officer
yes. thanks, larry. so we -- in the prepared remarks and i realize everyone's got a busy day and other companies. so in my prepared remarks, i commented that we're hoping to be able to have that product in a couple of months red62. so red62 is obviously a little smaller than the other catheters and we think it will play a big role in the sort of growing interest in discussions around treating more distal strokes. right now there's some limitation on some of the technologies to do that and we think red62 will play a pretty important role in helping to treat more and more of those strokes that are -- that may not be treated now because of technology limitation. as it relates to other sizes in the red series we did -- i did comment that we will have additional catheters in the red series that will follow the introduction of red62, but i didn't give a more specific time frame. but it will follow that time frame that i outlined for 62. so yes we think 62 will matter, but it won't -- it's not meant to replace the larger catheters that will be coming after that.
larry biegelsen -- wells fargo -- analyst
that's very helpful. and then one on lightning seven. indigo has historically been stronger i think on the arterial side than the venous side. in the past it was about two-thirds to one-third in favor of arterial. how do you see that changing in 2021 and beyond? and can you put the launch of lightning seven at the end of q1 in context for us? thanks for taking the questions.
adam elsesser -- president, chairman and chief executive officer
yes. no, that's a really good question. and if i had different sales teams selling the -- lightning seven versus lightning 12, i would absolutely use your question to challenge both of them to outdo each other. but since it's the same team, i can't get away with that. we look at those two products really as complementary. and the scale of work to be done both on the venous pe versus arterial is so open. there are so many pe patients that we can still help. so we don't really look at it as, which will grow faster per se. i think it will depend obviously on each physician and region and so on. but the opportunity now that, we have brought lightning technology to both sides of that, and really updated the catheter technology with sort of cat7, cat12 with the new -- sorry, hypotube technology that we're finding really, really successful, i think we're going to have some real success in both of those areas. which will outgrow the other? it's hard to know right now. and let's hope they're pretty -- they're both successful. i think patients will benefit.
larry biegelsen -- wells fargo -- analyst
all right. thanks for taking the questions.
adam elsesser -- president, chairman and chief executive officer

[operator instructions] next question is from margaret kaczor from william blair. your line is open.
brandon vazquez -- william blair -- analyst
hi, everyone. this is brandon on for margaret. first, just a question on guidance. if i'm assuming kind of, relatively small sequential increases in the vascular segment, maybe that's arguably a little conservative given the strength in the product launches coming up. it kind of -- it seems like it implies a low double-digit growth rate is implied in guidance for the neuro portfolio. is that math fair? and is that kind of how you all are internally thinking of the split between the peripheral and neuro growth through the year?
jason mills -- executive vice president, strategy
hey, brandon good to hear your voice. it's jason. so i'll take that one, and then maybe adam can add on, if he wants to. so we don't obviously break out the growth expectations between vascular and neuro. and so the commentary was meant to help sort of on a -- both a year-over-year and a quarter-over-quarter basis. i think it sounds like you heard and understood that guidance from an overall perspective pretty well. we also commented that, the back half of the year we expected sequential growth to be larger. and we highlighted products on both the vascular and the neuro side. and so i think those comments about the overall business, obviously, given we were highlighting products in both franchises apply respectively.
brandon vazquez -- william blair -- analyst
okay. that's helpful. and on the vascular side, this business just continues to perform really well. i was curious, if you could kind of give us on the -- in the field what's kind of different than a year ago? a year ago, the business was growing really well on both a year-over-year basis and a sequential basis. and it seems like in the last maybe two quarters, it's really inflected to the positive side, and it's gotten even better. what's kind of changed out in the field in the last couple of quarters? and i guess, part of the question is trying to understand, what's changed and how durable is that change?
adam elsesser -- president, chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. brandon thanks. it's a great question. a couple of things have changed and maybe it's sort of a combination of all of this. the first and most obvious, of course is, the launch of our new catheters in lightning. the combination of those really with the technology in those catheters to allow them to perform the way, they do track as well as have sort of the larger lumen with the smaller outer diameter has been hugely valuable. and then combine that with lightning, which both, for blood saving, but most -- as important ease of use for the customers, the feedback has just been extraordinary. so the product has really evolved. as you know, we take on these areas like, blood clot in the body. and we just keep innovating and innovating, until the cases become easier-and-easier. and this is a big step forward in that technology. you combine that with the focus around a need for single-session treatment, where the patient wouldn't have to go to an icu or a monitored bed for a period of time like, when they are treated with lysis. and the need for that during the pandemic last year, i think gave -- a more attention to the need to remove blood clot in single-sessions. so i think it's a combination of those things. i also -- there's other companies who are doing the same thing with different technology that is bringing more-and-more awareness. when you add it all up, i think people are just now focused on the idea that, there are a lot of folks who have blood clots in their body. and what we were doing is not as good as what we can do. and so we have a lot of optimism. as it relates to how durable, i think it's quite durable, and as you know, from our history where even though lightning and cat7 and 12 are really a huge step-up, we're not done innovating. and so we want to keep pushing this, and pushing this to the point where removing blood clot becomes a relatively straightforward and not a significant procedure. and we think we can get there. so yes, i do think this is going to be durable for quite some time.
brandon vazquez -- william blair -- analyst
got it. thank you.
jason mills -- executive vice president, strategy
yeah. thank you.
adam elsesser -- president, chairman and chief executive officer
thanks, brandon.

next question, we have bob hopkins from bank of america. your line is open.
bob hopkins -- bank of america -- analyst
hello. thank you and good afternoon. just want to follow-up on, two things, if ok. the first one is on china, and you guys had put in some disclosures of a pretty robust amount of revenue from china in the fourth quarter. i'm just curious, as to kind of how that played out in the first quarter? did you see sort of the same level of revenue? and then maybe, if you could just talk about the outlook for china broadly this year would be great.
adam elsesser -- president, chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. thanks bob. it's a great question. as we announced -- when we had that announced quarter the deal we signed with genesis is really a multifaceted deal that -- around five of our neuro products. and we think it has a great potential for us over the next number of years. but we also -- as i said in the prepared remarks today, it's the beginning. it's -- we think there's more we can do even than that in china. so yes, we had another good quarter with china. and we think going forward we will continue to see that playing an important role for us. and we're excited about it to bring this technology first with these products in neuro and then across our larger portfolio to that country.
bob hopkins -- bank of america -- analyst
so, two other things on that. one is just going back to the 2019 analyst day, you guys highlighted a lot of new opportunities. i mean, china i realized as something that was going to be over many, many years, but you did highlight it as a multi-billion-dollar opportunity. and that's what i'm trying to dig here a little bit and understand when that could become a more important part of the story? so i guess, just to drill down a little bit more to the degree, you're willing to disclose do you think you'll see continued improvement off of that q4 base? i mean, did you see that in q1? would you expect that for the rest of the year? and then the other thing i'd love to hear your thoughts around this. on the stroke side you had talked about a couple of things this year, some new product launches and then a paradigm shift. i assume we have yet to hear about the paradigm shift.
adam elsesser -- president, chairman and chief executive officer
yes. so, great questions. so we're not going to start calling out specific numbers in our markets, but the business needless to say for us in china, we think is quite substantial. and again, quarter-by-quarter we're not going to call out those specific numbers, but it performed again this quarter. we called that out in the prepared remarks and was not insignificant benefit, but not dominant. the rest of the business also performed. so i don't want it to be considered either/or. as it relates to stroke we -- as soon as we can, as soon as it's sort of appropriate from a competitive landscape, i cannot wait to share the products that -- the product that i have alluded to as part of a paradigm shift. but for obvious competitive reasons, which i think everyone would understand as you know we have something like 15 companies now competing in stroke. we're going to wait to share that until the last possible moment, but it's coming. and i feel as confident as ever about it. and i think it will be really, really important for patients.
bob hopkins -- bank of america -- analyst
perfect. thanks for taking the questions.
adam elsesser -- president, chairman and chief executive officer
yes. thanks, bob.

adam elsesser -- president, chairman and chief executive officer
thank you, jee. and welcome back from your maternity leave. good afternoon, everybody. thank you for joining penumbra's second quarter 2021 conference call.
our total revenues for the second quarter were $184.3 million, a year-over-year increase of 75.3% as reported and 72.7% in constant currency and a 9% sequential increase from the prior quarter. for the second quarter of 2021, we recorded operating income of $10.3 million or 6% of revenue compared to an operating loss of $18 million during the same period last year.
our vascular and neuro businesses performed well in the quarter, driven by the breadth and robustness of our product portfolios, diligent work by our outstanding sales teams as well as an uptick in elective procedures likely caused both by the fact that covid vaccination rates increased in some locations and the backlog of elective cases. we obviously are paying close attention to the current news about the spread of the delta variant. however, we are not seeing a negative impact on our overall business and believe any future impact will not be different than any of our peers in this industry.
overall, notwithstanding the news, we are optimistic about our ability to help more and more patients and continue to see a lot of opportunities in our target markets to drive strong durable growth over the coming years. and we continue to see a strong symbiosis between our thrombectomy and embolization franchises in both neuro and vascular through which purposeful innovation in one area augments our presence in both.
we also are adding great new people to the penumbra team both in our commercial organization as well as in our senior leadership team.
starting first with our vascular business. we reported growth of 117.6% year-over-year to $100.7 million in the second quarter. we are doing important work in four large areas of patient need: arterial, venous, coronary and embolization. our growth is a function of strong adoption of our products in each of these areas as more physicians begin to learn the benefits of our advanced therapies to treat their patients.
the recent launch of lightning 7 targeting the arterial anatomy has gone extremely well following on the success we are having with lightning 12 for the venous anatomy since its launch last year. we saw strong growth in both existing and new physician customers using our catheters for arterial thrombectomy in large part due to the early success of lightning 7.
in total, there is still a huge opportunity to expand our presence in both arterial and venous going forward. the lightning technology, which is now a critical component to both arterial and venous, is being very well received by physicians, an increasing number of whom are adopting single session therapy owing to the benefits that accrue in patient outcomes as well as lower cost to the healthcare system. as many of you know, we are running clinical trials in pe, the venous and arterial vasculature with lightning, to further learn and help educate our customers on its benefit.
we still have a lot of work in front of us to bring lightning to all the patients who could benefit. we estimate approximately 90% of applicable patients who have venous arterial clot are not -- are still not being treated with single session therapy. we continue to invest in therapy development initiatives and clinical evidence to expand the reach of these important products.
staying in the vascular franchise, both our coronary thrombectomy and peripheral embolization franchises also had record quarters in q2. with cat rx, we are growing our presence within the coronary thrombectomy market and we continue to invest in important clinical work to expand the use of this unique product. for instance, new data was presented at acc 2021 in may, highlighting the safety and efficacy of cat rx in patients with high thrombus burden in the coronaries. this work is helping us increase momentum with cat rx in both academic and high volume institutions.
on the embolization side, we saw an increase in elective procedures during the second quarter as covid-19 vaccinations increased in the us during the spring and likely enabled hospitals to ramp up procedure volumes. given the current state of vaccinations and the spread of new variants of the virus, it is possible that this increase in elective cases normalizes a bit in the third quarter. that said, we expect growth trends to continue in this business, not just in the united states but within international markets as well over the long-term.
in sum, all four of our vascular franchises are contributing to strong growth in our vascular business, guided by portfolio breadth and purposeful innovation. we continue to see many attractive opportunities for continued growth and investment in our people, products, clinical studies and markets going forward.
let me turn to our neuro business, which also performed well in the second quarter. we reported neuro revenue of $83.6 million worldwide, up 42% year-over-year. i am so proud of our neuro team for the great work they have done in recent quarters in the face of a product recall and competitive market dynamics. but now, we can look forward to a very exciting future for our stroke, access, embolization and neurosurgical franchises.
the early cases with our new red 62 distal stroke catheter have gone very well. being able to more easily track a robust catheter into the distal anatomy is being well-received by our physician customers. as we continue to expand red 62's presence, over the coming months, we are excited to also introduce red 68 catheter, which recently received fda clearance and the third catheter in the red series for which we expect clearance later this quarter. we look forward to having all three of these new products for our physician customers to treat their stroke patients.
further, the [technical issues]
operator
[operator instructions] thank you for your patience. we will now resume the call.
adam elsesser -- president, chairman and chief executive officer
all right. sorry, guys. i really apologize. we had a malfunction with our phone here and i apologize.
i'm going to start where i think we left off, which is further the breadth of our neuro portfolio shine through again this quarter. both our embolization and neuro access portfolio has had record quarters. bmx96, which launched late last year, continues to see increased adoption and utilization across the neuro interventional field. in sum, our neuro business continues to build back significant momentum thanks to the same foundational elements that have made this team and franchise the best of its kind in the world for many years.
our focus on innovation that delivers better outcomes for patients and a broad portfolio of unique products that help our physician customers treat more patients successfully. our neuro team is energized, engaged and prepared to deliver. and our innovation engine is running extraordinarily well. in the near future, we look forward to discussing our new paradigm in stroke intervention, thunderbolt.
moving to our virtual reality business. we have made enormous progress with our real vr platform and are increasingly optimistic. this proprietary platform can help millions of patients across many different clinical and cognitive healthcare conditions. in order to help many distinct patient groups throughout the variety of healthcare settings, a few things are very important. first, proprietary vr technology that can deliver a fully immersive mobile experience for patients. second, a platform that is adaptable, thus applicable to many distinct healthcare settings. third, a vr experience that can be customized for the needs of patients within each setting. and fourth, a purposeful engaging rich content library that meets the needs of patients in different settings with different healthcare needs.
with this in mind, we'll be offering three hardware configurations in the real system, the i-series, the t-series and the y-series. the y-series being a subsequent model of our current product. we will be showing the i-series publicly for the first time at the himss meeting this week.
we are very excited about the progress we've made across each of these areas, particularly with the help of our extraordinary partners, sixense. and we're looking forward to working closely with a robust vr community and therapeutic healthcare to leverage the real vr platform to help many patients over the coming months and years. we plan to host an investor meeting at penumbra's campus in alameda, california on tuesday, september 21, focused exclusively on our real vr franchise. specific details will follow shortly and we'll of course be subject to local rules that may change regarding in-person events. we hope you all can join us.
turning to an update on our international business. we are pleased with continued growth on several fronts during the second quarter. we made solid progress in china, japan, europe and canada and continue to see additional opportunities to grow our business in these and other geographies, including latin america and asia-pacific over the next several years. we plan to expand our product offerings in both neural and vascular within many international markets, while real vr represents a longer-term attractive opportunity for future growth outside the us as well.
i'll now turn the call over to maggie to go over our financial results for the quarter.
maggie yuen -- chief financial officer
thank you, adam. good afternoon, everyone. today, i will discuss the financial results for the second quarter 2021. additional details will be contained within our quarterly report on form 10-q.
for the second quarter ended june 30, 2021, our total revenues were $184.3 million, an increase of 75.3% reported and 72.7% in constant currency compared to the second quarter of 2020. our geographic mix of sales in the quarter were 69.7% us and 30.3% international. us and international reported growth of 64.5% and 106.4% respectively compared to the same period in 2020.
moving to revenue by franchise. revenue from our vascular business grew to $100.7 million in the second quarter of 2021, an increase of 117.6% reported and 115.8% in constant currency compared to the same period last year. compared to prior quarter, revenue from our vascular business grew by 12.9%, driven by strong performance in peripheral thrombectomy and increases in embolization procedure volume in the us.
revenue from our neuro business was $83.6 million in the second quarter of 2021, an increase of 42% reported and 38.8% in constant currency compared to the same period a year ago. compared to our performance in this period last year with this covid-19 impact, we see material growth across neuro access, embolization and neurothrombectomy businesses, and growth in all regions. i'm pleased to report all international regions grew sequentially compared to the prior quarter.
gross margin in the second quarter was 64.4% compared to 61.8% in the same quarter last year due to volume leverage and we continue to invest in resources to meet demand and new product launches in the second half of 2021. looking forward to the balance of this year, we expect our gross margin will normalize to around the same levels as the first six months of the year.
total operating expense for the quarter was $108.4 million or 59% of revenue compared to $82.6 million or 79% of revenue for the same quarter last year. our research and development expenses for q2 2021 were $17.7 million compared to $22.7 million for q2 2020. we expect r&d investment to accelerate in the second half of 2021 for new product launches and thunderbolt.
sg&a expenses for q2 2021 were $90.6 million compared to $59.9 million for q2 2020. we had temporary cost reduction measures during this quarter in the prior year such as executive salary reduction, while we continue to invest in commercial resources to support increasing demand for our products. in addition, most domestic travel and other in-person activities are returning to 2019 levels.
for the second quarter of 2021, we've recorded operating income of $10.3 million or 6% of revenue compared to an operating loss of $17.6 million for the same period last year. we ended the second quarter with a cash, cash equivalents and marketable security balance of $239 million, a steady working capital.
and now, i'd like to turn the call over to jason to discuss our 2021 guidance.
jason mills -- executive vice president, strategy
thank you, maggie. and good afternoon, everybody. with the update of our second quarter results, we are formally increasing our 2021 revenue guidance range to $720 million to $730 million, which would represent 28% to 30% growth over 2020 revenue of $560.4 million. this updated guidance compares to our previous 2021 guidance range of $695 million to $705 million, given on our first quarter call in may. we see multiple drivers of growth going forward and thus expect our total revenue to increase in the second half of the year as compared to the first half. we anticipate strong growth in the third quarter compared to the year-ago period, during which we had one of our best product launches ever in lightning 12.
on a sequential basis, we expect our revenue in the third quarter to approach our strong second quarter results, as we account for the mixed dynamics of the current environment. thinking further ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect solid sequential growth via continued strong trends within our vascular business as well as increasing contribution from new products in neuro, namely the red series of catheters for stroke intervention.
overall, consistent with our approach to setting guidance in the past, our updated 2021 revenue guidance represents our current views on our markets, timing of new product launches and other relevant inputs.
i will now turn the call back to adam for closing remarks.
adam elsesser -- president, chairman and chief executive officer
thank you, jason and maggie and jee. this past year-and-a-half has brought huge challenges and unspeakable loss throughout the world. however, it has also shown how resilient we all are, especially with the continuous wave of changing news. it is with these ideas in mind that the extraordinary team at penumbra continuously year-after-year looks at areas where people are suffering from medical conditions and works to find new solutions to make them better. this drive has been -- has not been more visible -- has been more visible during this past year-and-a-half than ever before. and it is the reason we are so well-positioned to help more and more people in the months and years ahead.
i want to thank everyone on the penumbra team for doing so much to help so many. thank you for your attention. and now, i would like to open the call to questions. operator, please go ahead.
",":
operator
thank you. [operator instructions] your first question comes from the line of bob hopkins with bank of america. your line is open.
bob hopkins -- bank of america -- analyst
great. and congratulations on a fantastic quarter. i just have two quick questions. first on the pipeline side, and those were some nice updates, thank you for that. just curious on thunderbolt, can you give us a sense as when we'll learn more about that product? and then, on real, appreciate that it's been shown at a meeting this week, but maybe you can give us a sense for when that will be -- this latest version will be in full launch. thank you.
adam elsesser -- president, chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. bob, great questions and thanks for your comments. as it relates to thunderbolt, i promise you, we will tell you as soon as we can. obviously we don't always control the full side of that timing, but we will as soon as we can. and obviously, i'm anxious to share what i can with you when it's possible. so, stay tuned. we will let you guys know as soon as possible.
as it relates to real, we're getting it out there in the earliest stages and showing it at this obviously important conference, the himss conference with the healthcare community. we'll update you all at the investor day on september 21 with much more detail on timing and sort of what does that whole look -- business look like. i mean, i think it will make a lot more sense after the investor day.
bob hopkins -- bank of america -- analyst
okay. so stay tuned basically.
adam elsesser -- president, chairman and chief executive officer
but i said it nicely.
bob hopkins -- bank of america -- analyst
you did. you always do. so, on the vascular side of things, specifically on mechanical thrombectomy, so i'm just wondering if you can give us or just a little more detail on the phenomenal results here. so, you've got arterial venous and coronary here, can you just give us a sense, is arterial still over 50% of that business and are all these different indications growing at a higher rate or is there a real divergence in the growth rates among those three? and i'll get back in queue. thank you.
adam elsesser -- president, chairman and chief executive officer
yeah, it's a great question. the growth rates are all strong. do they change a little bit based on our product launch? of course, they do. we obviously saw lightning 12 have a significant trajectory when we launched it. lightning 7 has done well. but all of the franchises are doing well. and i'm very, very optimistic about how they will all contribute to our growth as we continue on
bob hopkins -- bank of america -- analyst
is arterial still over 50%?
adam elsesser -- president, chairman and chief executive officer
i don't think we've broken down those numbers, but...
jason mills -- executive vice president, strategy
yeah, bob. it's jason. we have not broke down those numbers specifically. what we've said in the past is that the venous mix has obviously increased significantly since we launched lightning 12. and that continues to the venous and arterial, besides the businesses are now both growing quite well. so we're not going to break it out specifically.
the numbers i will talk to though that are very similar with those two genres are the penetration rates. obviously we have -- we think -- somewhere around 90% of the applicable patient populations that can be helped by both products and both genres to go here with single session therapy. i know you've heard us say that in the past, but i think it's worth reminding everybody.
bob hopkins -- bank of america -- analyst
thank you.
adam elsesser -- president, chairman and chief executive officer
thanks, bob.
operator
your next question comes from the line of larry biegelsen with wells fargo. your line is open.
larry biegelsen -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
good afternoon. thanks for taking the question. and like bob said, congratulations. one just, adam, on the covid trends and the second half guidance and one on vascular embolization, which was quite strong this quarter. so, first, on the recovery, i heard your prepared remarks. it sounds like so far so good, adam, in terms of trends through july and august. and when i look at the second half guidance, third quarter sales approaching q2, that's a little bit lower than we've seen sequentially and even looking at the guidance what it implies for q4, it's a little bit lower than what we saw in 2018 and '19. so, my question is, is there some conservatism built into the guidance from a potential impact from covid? and i had one follow-up.
adam elsesser -- president, chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. let me sort of just give a quick general sort of trend answer and then jason maybe can pick up on the specific guidance question and why -- what our sort of quarter by quarter implication was versus the actual guidance number. overall, we feel extraordinarily comfortable and confident about the business. obviously, the guidance -- the number itself is not an insignificant raise and that gives us a lot of confidence. the news, and we put that in the prepared remarks, that's going on and what is happening, you do have to sort of just catch your breath for a second. there are a few other specifics that jason can cover. but i would look at the full range of the back half of the year as the relevant question and that we feel incredibly strongly about.
but, jason, if you want to add a few things?
jason mills -- executive vice president, strategy
yeah. just a few things to point out. the guidance increase, obviously, we feel -- obviously feel good about and the increase is a healthy step above the number in the quarter relative to the expectations. and so, i think, as you look at sort of the preponderance of the year, what's transpired is fairly positive across our business in both nuero and vascular driving stronger growth than expected.
as it relates to the sequential comments or questions that you had, we made comment in the prepared remarks obviously about elective procedures in the second quarter. thankfully, we saw during the quarter vaccinations increase throughout the country. that obviously gave the ability for hospitals to do more elective cases. and we think that that probably helped get into the elective cases or the volume on the embolization side, specifically in peripheral embolization, around $3.5 million to $4 million. so, we benefited from that during the quarter and we're hoping that continues. but we have to be cognizant of the current environment with respect to the delta variant.
larry biegelsen -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
that's very helpful. thank you. and on the peripheral embolization, even taking into account, i guess, a $3 million to $4 million maybe catch up, jason, if that's what you were referring to a second ago, still had a quite a good quarter, adam. so i'm just curious, by our math, over $40 million in the quarter a new high. so, how do you see that playing out and what are the growth drivers because you know that's probably the least understood of your businesses? thanks, guys.
adam elsesser -- president, chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. thank you, larry, for that question. we are continually pleased and thrilled to watch and be part of that business. we continue to innovate in the embolization on the peripheral side for a while. we've added a number of new products over the past couple of years and including -- there would be lp line last year. and the benefit of that technology is really extraordinary. and we've seen it over and over again. as people start to try it, they migrate to it. the success we're having, it's not -- the field is not as sort of established, if you will, as one might have thought. and there's a lot of room for innovation and a lot of sort of conditions that can use coil technology that might not be in using other things that they can now move to coils because the, sort of, unique nature of our coil technology which, as you know, they tend to be bigger, softer, easier to deploy in many cases. and we're really finding that is starting to continue to win over new converts.
so, i think there's a lot of continued room to grow that business both here in the us as we said but also internationally in the years ahead.
larry biegelsen -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
thank you.
adam elsesser -- president, chairman and chief executive officer
thanks.
operator
your next question comes from bill plovanic with canaccord. your line is open.
bill plovanic -- canaccord -- analyst
great. thanks. good evening. thanks for taking my questions. first, i'd just like to start off, with the neurovascular business, i mean that's a number that we haven't seen since 2019 there, almost reaching new highs. and i'm just kind of curious, the impact to the jet 7 xtra flex recall, i hate to bring up the past, but just making sure where are we in terms of moving through that? how many accounts did you think you lost or ended up coming back and kind of are we done seeing any impact from that and it's kind of base move forward from here?
adam elsesser -- president, chairman and chief executive officer
bill, that's a really good question. i think, the impact of that obviously, there was a lot of competitive trialing. and as people were looking to find a replacement for the xtra flex catheter, i think -- we think and our commentary supports this, with the new red series, both the really great success we're seeing right out of the box with red 62 but also with red 68 coming in the subsequent red catheter coming sort of later in the quarter. i think we look at the back half, particularly in the fourth quarter as an opportunity to really reestablish ourselves in the stroke field and we're looking forward to it. so, there is a real need for continued innovation in this field. that's obvious talking to customers.
we just had a really successful snis meeting. it's the first in-person medical meeting i've been to in a long time since the pandemic. and the support we heard from physicians, the excitement around the fact that we are continually innovating, notwithstanding the recall and everything, it was as strong as i've heard it, in a long, long time. and it gave me a huge amount of confidence that we're doing the right thing, we're on the right track, and we're getting a lot of encouragement from our physician customers. so, i'm pretty excited about how our stroke business will unfold over the next sort of two to three to four quarters.
bill plovanic -- canaccord -- analyst
okay. and then, if i could, follow-up with your sg&a spend was up about $10 million on about $15 million of revenue. so, it seems like you're investing forward pretty significantly. is that in people? is that us, ous? any color would be greatly appreciated. thanks.
maggie yuen -- chief financial officer
yeah. previously we did continue to invest in commercial resources in terms of human resources. but at the same time, a lot of the domestic travel and in-person activities, we also see it rapidly come back to pretty much pre-covid level. and then at the third leg will be we continue to invest in g&a infrastructure to prepare us to scale.
bill plovanic -- canaccord -- analyst

your next question comes from the line of robbie marcus with jpmorgan. your line is open.
robbie marcus -- jpmorgan -- analyst
oh, great. congrats on a great quarter.
adam elsesser -- president, chairman and chief executive officer
thanks, robert.
robbie marcus -- jpmorgan -- analyst
maybe another financial question here. there's not much to nitpick at the quarter. but one thing, gross margin came in a little bit below where the street was thinking. anything one-time in nature or anything we should know and how should we think about maybe the balance of third and fourth quarter?
maggie yuen -- chief financial officer
yeah. thanks for the question, robbie. there is no major one-time cost charges in the gross margin. i think, in the last quarter, we did mention that the gross margin can often slightly fluctuate with product mix [phonetic]. this quarter, it's just slight fluctuation of some product mix. we have no plan to remove any of the covid safety measure and cost structure that we have put in place, given the current delta variant cautions that we have. but meanwhile, we continue to maintain strong productivity and we continue to invest in our capacity as well. so, we do expect the second half of 2021 the gross margin will be continued at similar level as the first half of the year.
robbie marcus -- jpmorgan -- analyst
okay. great. maybe just a quick follow-up. real vr looks like four or three versions you're spreading out. can you give us any sense of what each are tailored for? what the market receptivity has been like so far? and what you think the demand is in the field now that there's better reimbursement that allows for remote usage of this? thanks.
adam elsesser -- president, chairman and chief executive officer
yeah, it's a great question. and without solely saying, please come to our investor day on september 21. i'll try to just give a little bit of very general color, because i really don't want to steal the thunder of the team presenting really in great detail. the key here, as you know, we initially worked on a product solely tailored for a very specific group of patients. those were folks who had some form of neurological damage in the brain, typically from ischemic stroke could have been a different type of damage and they needed to recover some physical movement. and the real system was the first application which you all saw at our first investor day was called happy valley that focused on that.
we are clearly aware of the huge just extraordinary sort of body of clinical data that supports the use of vr in a host of other conditions. and we'll go through this again at the investor day, but not just that relatively obvious use case but into mental health, in memory and depression and anxiety and a number of other things that people really suffer from and the benefits of br. so the hardware configurations are really geared toward being appropriate for the variety of settings and types of needs that we're tackling. and we'll go through that in greater detail.
we're not yet sort of commercializing all of these. as i said, the i-series is simply being shown this weekend at the himss meeting. we'll go through the timetable of -- and the plan around commercializing at the investor day in a month as well.
robbie marcus -- jpmorgan -- analyst
great. thanks a lot.
adam elsesser -- president, chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. thanks, robbie.

your next question comes from the line of joanne wuensch with citibank. your line is open.
joanne wuensch -- citigroup -- analyst
thank you for taking the question and nice quarter. two things i want to talk about or ask about. one was, you used the word called symbiosis at the beginning of this call. and i'd like you to expand on that a little bit, and maybe it's a portfolio management term but that would be helpful. and then my second question has to do with the red series. i'd like to get a better understanding of which or what is the difference between each one of these aspiration catheters and what we can look forward to in the third iteration of the series? thank you.
adam elsesser -- president, chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. great question. the word -- i like the word symbiosis. it is really how the two distinct -- at least how we're interpreting the meaning and if we got it wrong, i apologize, but really the two distinct parts of our business in both neuro and vascular, the coil business and the thrombectomy business which are treating different diseases, how those franchises -- those product lines have worked sort of in the field with our customers? how one success in one area has sort of opened up opportunities in the other? how innovation in one has been led to sort of an interest in the rest of our portfolio from physicians?
and it's really been remarkable. and it's something that to me is kind of as pure as it can be, which is the -- as we enter new -- the company and our products to new physicians, who don't know us, the performance of just a pure clinical performance and utility of our products, on one side, is allowing interest and access to the rest of our business. so that's what we meant by that.
as it relates to the red series, red 62, as we've talked about, is a brand-new catheter particularly sized to treat typically more distal clots, an area that we think can have more innovation, need more innovation. the reaction to that product has been really, really strong so far. first of all, its trackability is really doing really well. we're also hearing some people using it in more proximal locations like the m1, which to me is a testament to its trackability and ability to hold its shape when you're aspirating through it.
red 68, obviously the size of red 68 mirrors the workhorse product for many years, the ace68. we've just improved the trackability of that catheter in a nice way. and then the next one that's coming, we haven't really announced or talked about, but we will certainly clear and looking forward to having that on the market as well. so really the goal of all these catheters is what it's always been is tractability first. you can't do much until you can easily get it there and then it's ability to hold its shape and effectively and safely aspirate out clot.
joanne wuensch -- citigroup -- analyst
thank you.
adam elsesser -- president, chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. thank you.
jason mills -- executive vice president, strategy

[operator instructions] your next question comes from the line of margaret kaczor with william blair. your line is open.
margaret kaczor -- william blair -- analyst
hey, guys. thanks for taking the question.
adam elsesser -- president, chairman and chief executive officer
hi.
margaret kaczor -- william blair -- analyst
just wanted to follow up on vascular a bit. i think you guys had referenced physicians are increasingly adopting single session therapy. so, i was curious if you're sensing that that's a broader market trend. is that being driven by something that you're doing or specific to you all? and what i'm trying to get is, are clinicians just broadly saying, i get this, i'm here, i'm ready to go and so this is just true market penetration or is it still kind of early stage where they'd better see a few cases and increasingly move more patients on?
adam elsesser -- president, chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. i think it's a really, really good question. i would still put us in the early stages. it's starting to happen. that term for example is out there. a year ago, year-and-a-half ago, no one would have talked about it as the goal is to do single session thrombectomy. so, the very fact that we use that term, you use that term it become very obviously that is a purposeful goal. that is not, that is good. and so that for me is a great sign to the field. and i think, there are lots of other companies pursuing this. i think that's been very, very valuable to the field. unlike in some areas where the field is crowded and competitive in a negative way in other markets this is -- it's so large and so under tapped that i think it's been very beneficial to have companies all sort of in sync on the goal.
and then, doctors start to move in that direction. the best technology will ultimately win out. and obviously we feel very confident that between this current version and future versions, we're going to stay in a really good spot. but i still think we're in the early stages. we're still -- the vast, vast majority of applicable patients or eligible patients are still not getting single session therapy. they're getting multiple day dripping of tpa and that means we have a lot of work in the years ahead.
but it feels like the conversation from hearing what the field saying, you can now have it. there's some open mindedness at least in the beginning. so, i think there's the beginning of momentum. how long will it take? how much effort it will be? i think we're looking at you know years of work, not months of work. but it feels like we've turned a little bit of a corner here.
margaret kaczor -- william blair -- analyst
okay. so, maybe let's take that a little bit further. in some of those existing accounts where you guys are in already, are you seeing clinicians maybe self-selecting certain patients either by risk profile or indication and that's how you're seeing kind of adoption in the field?
adam elsesser -- president, chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. i don't know if i can be -- answer that with the kind of specificity that the question warrants. i'm sure there are physicians who are -- who still do a little of each. i don't know of those people, but i don't want to say they're not -- it's not true. that doesn't sound impossible to me. certainly, the customers that are making up the bulk of our current business are mostly people who have sort of turned that corner and believe in it and believe in the benefits of the technology and so therefore are using it in all or almost all of their cases.
margaret kaczor -- william blair -- analyst
okay. fantastic. thanks, guys.

with that, i would like to turn over the call to adam elsesser.
adam elsesser -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
thank you, dan. good afternoon and thank you for joining penumbra's fourth quarter and year-end 2018 conference call. penumbra had a strong fourth quarter which capped a tremendous year of exceptional growth and patient impact. equally important, we made great progress in 2018 toward positioning our company for future leadership and success. our total revenues for the fourth quarter of 2018 were $120.8 million, an increase of 25.8% as reported from the fourth quarter of 2017. we had operating income in the quarter of $6.7 million compared to $3.9 million for the same period last year.
in the fourth quarter, we saw our strongest sequential revenue growth of the year, which resulted in strong year-over-year growth against difficult fourth quarter comparisons, particularly in our neuro international markets. in neuro our ischemic stroke business in the united states saw (ph) exceptional double-digit sequential growth due to strong procedural volumes.
in addition, penumbra jet engine has been an important step forward for our franchise. since our launch in september, overall physician feedback has continued to be very positive and has met our high expectations. in our vascular business, we are seeing meaningful growth which is followed our view that this market could be as large if not larger an opportunity for penumbra the neuro. as you may recall in our last two quarterly calls we discussed bringing our technology to new specialist physicians and adding new technology to approach new patient markets both of these efforts have continued to contribute to our exceptional momentum and growth.
we are seeing growing adoption of our indigo system as a powerful tool to remove blood clots and we're also seeing growing use of our embolization system as a platform across a number of the embolization procedures. this quarter we expanded geographically with the introduction of our peripheral embolization products in japan. while this is a strategic step forward in establishing this new franchise in japan initially, this will not impact our overall growth, but will result in a shift in revenue between our neuro and vascular divisions. sri will cover this further in his remarks.
now i would like to look at the full year 2018 and review our business and what led to our growth in my commentary, i will also share what we believe will lead to our continued success in 2019 and beyond. for the full year 2018, our total revenues were $444.9 million -- $444.9 million, an increase of 33.3% as reported from the full year, 2017. we had full year non-gaap operating income of $30 million compared to gaap operating income of $1.2 million for the full year 2017. the numbers impact with physicians and patients is growing. in the united states, we estimate the penumbra stroke products are used in a majority of all stroke interventions performed. throughout 2018, we also steadily grew our reach beyond the brain to address patients with clot in their arms and legs. diseases involving clot in the body can be serious and can often lead to major complications, including mortality.
late last year, we introduced new technology they expanded our reach even further to help physicians more effectively remove clot in the coronary arteries. we are proud of our growing patient impact it motivates us to continue to work hard and to focus on meaningful areas. there are three critical elements that allowed our business to accelerate in 2018. our strong patient and markets, our innovation and our ability to develop new areas. as we move into 2019 and beyond, we will continue to invest in these opportunities.
looking at the first critical element, our patient end markets, we saw rapid growth in ischemic stroke market last year. in the united states, we estimate that between 36,000 to 38,000 patients were treated with mechanical thrombectomy in 2018, which we estimate to be about 10,000 more patients than in 2017. we are encouraged to see the rapid uptake in interventional stroke treatment. but more important, we see the foundation for future growth being stronger than it has ever been before. the clinical evidence continues to mount earlier last year studies added evidence showing that patients treated within 24 hours of a stroke and also have favorable outcomes. we believe this expanded the addressable market of the roughly 800,000 strokes, a year in the united states, we now estimate that about 200,000 of those patients can potentially be treated with mechanical thrombectomy.
the field continues to actively explore greater application of mechanical thrombectomy as well. at the international stroke conference, which was held earlier this month, podium presentations discussed potential treatment benefit for further patient groups, such as those with larger area of tissue damage or large core strokes. we are seeing physicians and their hospital systems increasingly encouraged about how compelling the procedure is for patients and their communities. they're gaining momentum in their efforts and making investments in infrastructure and technology to ensure that all patients can be brought to the right place to be treated as quickly as possible.
what is most impactful? the tireless efforts of the many 1000s of people that make this happen every day. we commend each one of those individuals from ems personnel to nurses stroke coordinators and stroke surgeons. they are the difference makers of continue to be the core driver of this remarkable transformation in stroke treatment. while we would expect to see more normalized levels of procedure growth in 2019. we believe it is possible to see greater growth in treatment as we did last year. over the past year, there is also been meaningful progress in the longer term initiative to improve stroke care pathways.
efforts like to get ahead of stroke campaign have served to increase awareness and help effect legislative change. colorado, arizona, tennessee, and just last week, virginia at each past or issued resolutions, protocols or log with the intent of getting patients to the right center to be treated. massachusetts, florida, ohio and new york are considering similar actions. and many more states were showing interest in these types of initiatives.
i would like to take a moment and turn our attention to another patient market, where we see tremendous ability for penumbra have a meaningful impact. vascular thrombectomy is a similar, but also very different challenge than stroke thrombectomy. diseases that are related to clot in the body are generally recognized, but their treatments are not well developed or effective. in the united states over one million people a year have some form of clot in their bodies. many of these people suffer from pain and for many it leads to serious complications. about 100,000 people die each year from clot in their bodies. we estimate that around 150,000 people a year are being treated in hospitals with either tpa or some form of clot master ration or clot dissolution.
we have dedicated the last five years to developing our business in this area, we have started to see growing patient impact and contribution to our company. i'd like to share a brief patient story that demonstrates the huge benefit of removing clot with the indigo system. this patient who just had unrelated surgery and was still recovering in the hospital, when both our legs became very swollen, due to deep vein thrombosis or dvt. she cannot be given tpa because of recent surgery.her son is a technician and interventional radiology suite of the hospital.
in order to relieve the swelling and avoid additional complications dr. nauman decided to treat her worse leg with the indigo system using one of our advanced clot removal techniques for dvt. the procedure was extremely successful dr. nauman removed the large amount of the clot causing the dvt. right after the procedure, the patient asked if it be done on other leg as well.
as it turned out several days later, treating the second leg was not necessary. as it becomes more and more routine, this type of clot removal treat with the indigo system will have a significant ability to help a great number of patients suffering from clot in all parts of the body.
the second critical element that has allowed our business to accelerate is innovation. 2018, we designed, developed and launched several significant products that have advanced our neuro and vascular franchises. we have continued to innovate at a rapid pace, even as we have scaled our business. we have a great deal of confidence at penumbra, that we can continue to provide more and more innovative products in the future across all of our patient markets. i believe our development team known affectionately at penumbra as pengineers are the most talented, prolific and dedicated development professionals in the business.
their work now and in the future will enable significant advances for patients for many years. the third critical element that has contributed to our business is our ability to develop new areas. over the last year, we have added additional drivers to our business by expanding into new patient markets and new geographies. we have strengthened our core business and built the foundation for new business areas to grow into 2019 and beyond. finally, the most profound part of 2018 for me personally has been the people of the number.
i have had the immense pleasure to work with, visit with and travel with employees throughout the company of all ages and backgrounds. over the past year, i've watched our team contribute in extraordinary ways, and this gives me deep confidence that we will continue to execute and achieve anything we set our sights on.
i remain confident that we can help a great number of people suffering from serious medical conditions well into the future. i'll now turn the call over to sri to review the financials.
sridhar kosaraju -- analyst
thank you, adam. for the fourth quarter ended december 31, 2018, our total revenues were $120.8 million, an increase of 25.8% reported compared to the 4th quarter of 2017. our geographic mix of sales in the quarter were 67% us, and 33% international. neuro and vascular represented 61% and 39% of sales, respectively. we ended the year -- we ended 2018 with very strong overall momentum in our business, particularly in the us.
before we review our results, i would like to share two items to note, as we discuss our reported growth rates within neuro and vascular. first, as discussed previously, beginning in the fourth quarter, we faced challenging year-over year comparisons, given the acceleration in the stroke market as well as international launches in the prior year. second as adam mentioned in the fourth quarter, we launched our peripheral embolization business into japan with our long-term distributor partner. with the launch of our peripheral embolization products physicians are expected to move to our branded peripheral coils from our neuro embolization coils, which are also indicated for peripheral use. the primary financial implication of this change -- in this change in revenue classification from our neuro division to our vascular division. revenue from our neuro business grew to $74 million in the fourth quarter of 2018, an increase of 9.9% reported compared to the same period a year ago.
our neuro growth was primarily driven by sales of our penumbra system for a scheme stroke, which benefited from continued strong procedural volumes and the strength of our differentiated portfolio. in the united states, we saw exceptional double-digit sequential growth in a scheme stroke which was driven by procedure volumes and the launch of penumbra jet engine. we see our international opportunity in ischemic stroke is extremely robust. however, we expect to see some quarterly unevenness due to launches in new geographies and launches of new technology in existing geographies.
outside of ischemic stroke as we look forward in our neuro embolization business we expect the brain aneurysm market to continue its historic growth in the low single digits. revenue from our vascular business grew to $46.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2018, an increase of 62.8% reported compared to the same period last year. our vascular growth was driven by strong results from our thrombectomy and embolization businesses. we saw greater than typical growth internationally this quarter due to the previously discussed launch of our peripheral embolization products in japan.
our gross profit in the quarter was $78.7 million or 65.2% of revenues compared to $63.7 million or 66.3% of revenues for the same quarter last year. our gross margin follows our prior commentary around product mix as well as new product launches and investments in capacity expansion. total operating expense for the quarter was $72 million or 59.6% of revenue compared to $59.9 million or 62.3% of revenue for the same quarter a year ago.
this is the first full quarter where we consolidate the results of mvi which will result in a slight uptick in our expenses going forward. our research and development expenses were $10.9 million for q4, 2018, compared to $8.4 million for q4, 2017. sg&a expenses were $61.2 million for q4, '18 compared to $51.5 million for q4, 2017. our spend increased primarily due to increases in headcount and related compensation expense. we had operating income in the quarter of $6.7 million compared to operating income of $3.9 million for the same period last year. we continue to expect to invest in the growth of our current business and also in the development of potential new areas. we ended the quarter with a strong balance sheet with approximately $201 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. i will end with a quick recap of our full year 2018 results.
our total revenues for the year were $444.9 million, which represents an increase of 33.3% reported compared to our full-year of 2017. revenue from our neuro business was $294.3 million for the full year 2018, an increase of 26.6% reported. revenue from our vascular business with 150.6 million for the full year 2018, an increase of 48.6% reported.
our gross profit for the year was 65.7% of revenues compared to 65.1% of revenue for the full year, 2017. we had non-gaap operating income for the full year of $30 million compared to a gaap operating income of $1.2 million for 2017. today, we are introducing revenue guidance for full year 2019 in the range of $525 million to $535 million. this guidance represents our current views and takes into account components of our business, including our markets, product introductions, competition in currency.
we believe we have more potential drivers of growth in our business than prior years. regarding the progression of the year. historically, we have seen q1 revenue to be sequentially flat, however, last year we saw a strong sequential increase due to an accelerating stroke market and international launches. we expect our first quarter revenue this year to be slightly above our fourth quarter and we remind you of the difficult year-over-year comparison. additionally, we expect to see summer seasonality in q3 as we have historically experienced.
and now i'd like to turn the call back to adam for closing remarks.
adam elsesser -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
thank you, sri. as we look, as we now look to 2019. we are excited to continue our important work. we remained steady and focused on what has always driven us and that is making better and better products to help more and more people. we have begun several major initiatives to invest in our people and infrastructure to support these efforts. last year, we added more talent and depth to our team and secured additional space. we also continue to evolve the structure of our team to support our growth, recently, we announced the addition of two new outstanding individuals who will be invaluable additions to our board structure.
as we look forward, we believe we can contribute as a healthcare company in even more significant and pro found ways. thank you for your attention and time today. we'd now like to open the call for questions. thank you.

(operator instructions) your first question comes from the line of jason mills with canaccord genuity. your line is open.
jason mills -- canaccord genuity -- analyst
great. thank you. hi, adam, sri and dan. can you hear me ok?
dan wilson -- head of business development
yeah, hi, jason.
jason mills -- canaccord genuity -- analyst
great good morning or good afternoon. there are several notable areas on which i could clear you, adam. i'm going to focus on to hope that others fill in the rest stroke and one area we don't talk a ton about what was discussed quite prevalently at the recent aans/cns and ise meetings with respect to intracerebral hemorrhage evacuation with this topically. so on the stroke side, just a couple of ones i'll kick off and then ich, i just wanted to get your thoughts on the two trials you're sponsoring and you're sort of overall thoughts on the eventual commercialization of products there and the opportunity long term for revenue contributions from ich.
on the stroke side, the sequential growth that you mentioned in the us specifically deemed to be the strongest of the year, not only for the whole business. but for our us stroke, specifically in our like for you to confirm that. and then secondly more macro question, adam the 10,000 incremental procedures that the market saw in the us this year over last. is that sort of the capacity of the market in terms of year-over-year increases in your view, or do you see some of these programs, increasing investments across the country, stroke centers, allowing for the market to sustain even more year-over-year nominal procedure growth during that potentially. and then the last stroke question is china. i think your competitors derive a lot from china and stroke and you just signed the distribution relationship with a new distributor there, wondering what your thoughts would be with respect to the numbers opportunity in china.
dan wilson -- head of business development
thank you for taking all those questions.
adam elsesser -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
thank you, jason. i hope i can remember them all. so let's start with stroke. and before i sort of get into some of the new ones question-and-answers around capacity and all, maybe i'll let sri, confirm the numbers specifically in terms of the sequential growth numbers and then i'll pick it up from there.
sridhar kosaraju -- analyst
yes, well the business and the momentum across both businesses, but particularly stroke continues at a very strong pace for us, jason and just to dig into the neuro number if you parse through the commentary we had there was some classification movement between neuro and peripheral because of the launch in japan. but one thing we didn't comment on which you picked up on was that, in the u.s., our stroke business grew sequentially double digits, which is a pretty big rate of growth for us. that just to expand on that translates to over 30% year-over-year growth. we don't typically talk about those numbers, but given the sort of some of the new ones in neuro. it was important to point out our stroke business continues to be very well, but i'll let adam touched on the other questions.
jason mills -- canaccord genuity -- analyst
thanks, sri.
adam elsesser -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
yes. so building on that specific growth. we are as confident as we've been around our stroke business and the tools that we're adding to physicians to be able to attack this as the launch of jet engine has been very successful, not just in the catheter part of it, but in the engine part of it. we are really seeing an understanding of the importance of the power of the aspiration source and what that can do for physicians in the way they treat these patients. so that has gone extraordinarily well.
as it relates to the capacity of the market, let me just sort of remind you our comments around the growth last year and what we expect this year, we -- we don't know and do not have the ability to sort of look out in with certainty and say that we are going to have another sort of 10,000 patients that could happen and i said that in my prepared remarks, but it really is that we're still relying on all these local efforts to drive most of that growth. and as we saw last year, it was not even by quarter-to-quarter. the fourth quarter of 2016 and the first quarter of 2017 were particularly strong. and then we saw sort of a more normalized growth. so we don't know for sure.
i believe that the growth, the ability of our market in the u.s., particularly to absorb growth is quite high. i don't think that's the limiting factor. i think the limiting factor is really getting the patients through the hospital. i think we. and i've said this before a lot. i think we have enough positions, we have enough capacity that may not be true at every single center that is doing this. but across the board as a whole i think the market can handle whatever growth is delivered to it by the work that's being done.
so i think that is not the biggest worry, it's just getting the patients to the right place. briefly on china, it's very early obviously that is a market that we think we can be very helpful. there are some, we're early on and just getting started and so it's a little too soon to start predicting specific numbers and success there, but obviously we can help bring that into it. that would be very helpful.
i think i misspoke just to go back when i was talking about the growth exceptional growth i think i said q4, '16 and q1, '17 obviously meant q4, '17 and q1 of '18, i apologize. i mean you're moving to ich briefly and our artemis device. i think it's, it was really exciting to see the level of interest in dialog and conversation at the international stroke meeting joined section before, that's really the first time we've seen that level of engagement and discussion.
i think seeing the results of the misty trial which was were presented which that showed that they mr. endpoint. the real benefit there. since it was a different procedure. then what we do is it validated the need to get most of the clot out. and i think that really becomes the most important thing it's our thesis. it's how our product is designed and is being used in the field and it's quite successful. so and it does it in a way, and in a manner that is -- is a dramatic and on the brain as possible.
so i think all of that was good news for us. and i think it provides us with a potential success story going forward. as i've said in the past there, this is going to take some time some education. we are running as you mentioned two trials the mine trial being so the premier randomized trial on that one as that takes time to enroll. we are very optimistic, but i still think we're several years off from seeing a significant commercial impact, but for those patients who are being treated today as i think we're pretty confident. and we think this is some, some beginning of some foundation for some success in the future here.

your next question comes from robbie marcus with jp morgan. your line is open.
robbie marcus -- jp morgan -- analyst
great. and congrats on the good quarter. sri, maybe i can start with you and just try and dig into some of the puts and takes for next year there is a lot of good things, there is a couple of headwinds, but i want to make sure people understand maybe the cadence throughout the year you gave us first quarter. given there are a couple of moving pieces. and if you could just touch on the thoughts about the deceleration in growth rate for next year. and what's really driving that and how much is conservatism with unknown market growth and how much is more appropriateness?
sridhar kosaraju -- analyst
sure. so robbie as we sort of touched on in our comments and even in the first question from jason. the momentum of the business continues to be robust and is moving along the path that i think we've sort of expected and talked about even a year ago today, when we started talking about entering 2018. if we look at the guidance 18% to 20% -- growth over 2018, where we saw an acceleration in stroke, where we saw really robust vascular growth in the back half of the year and where we saw currency at least for the first half of the year be beneficial to us will that headwind in the first half of '19. but those are the things that we go up against, but as we've always said in our if we break up between neuro and vascular, neuro we're very tied to the market growth in stroke. and as you heard the market accelerated in 2018. we've got about a more normalized growth, we think the last three years that's an average of 6,000 to 7,000 patients. so that gets you sort of a high-teens market growth in the u.s. that gives you a good benchmark for our business.
we also talked about the aneurysm business growing in the low single digits. so that will, gives you a pretty good guide for how we think about our neuro business and you can obviously sort of back into how we see vascular to get back to the 18% to 20% growth. but i also just to add one more thing. i mentioned that we see more potential drivers in the business and that's just the current business more areas that can contribute to growth gives us more confidence that we can keep that sustainable growth going into '19 and beyond.
robbie marcus -- jp morgan -- analyst
great. and sri and adam, maybe if i can just ask the topic (inaudible) coming out of the jpmorgan conference, it sounded like you haven't really seen much in way of competition from medtronic and stryker on the aspiration side. and any updated thoughts and what you're seeing there and i'm assuming you still feel very confident in being able to counter any competition that comes your way?
adam elsesser -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
yes, robbie it's adam. i -- let me maybe serve frame how we see competition, maybe a little differently from the specific comments that we haven't seen competition yet. first of all, obviously we have -- we respect and have a great deal of respect for our competitors, they have help push this build and grow this field and certainly pushed us to make better and better products and we never take them for granted or lightly. but we've always had competition. so we were on this call. at this exact time last year we were talking a lot about competition, we've just had a bunch of companies get on labels having sold out off label for a bit and we are still facing that same competition, i think what has happened is it's validated more and more debt aspiration first is critical and i think that's been helpful. but to say we haven't faced that we face it every day. and we're going to face it every day going forward.
the companies will continue to launch new products, there'll be new companies coming and we have remained very confident that between our extraordinary work and i specifically called out our engineering team for doing extraordinary work they deserve another shout out, and they've done really amazing things and what we have done in the past. and what we have coming gives us a lot of confidence together with our really first class, world-class commercial team i think puts us in a position to continue to be in the leadership position, particularly as the field moves toward aspiration first.
robbie marcus -- jp morgan -- analyst
that was much more elegantly put, appreciate the thoughts.
sridhar kosaraju -- analyst
thanks, robbie.

your next question comes from the line of bob hopkins with bank of america merrill lynch. your line is open.
bob hopkins -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
hey, thanks, and good afternoon. first question sri, just for you. i'm just curious in the fourth quarter. could you quantify the -- the amount of revenue that was reclassified between neuro and peripheral and then maybe just give a sense as to what the neuro growth rate would have been if the reclass didn't happen.
sridhar kosaraju -- analyst
yeah. that's it. i think a very, very good question and to try to help on that a little bit just to give context that market the peripheral embolization market in japan is not a huge one we would characterize that end patient market opportunity to be sort of sub $50 million. just to give you some order of magnitude. we had a share in a position there obviously utilizing our neuro coils, which were indicated for peripheral use that obviously the reason and rationale to go with our branded peripheral products is to make additional headway and progress in penetrating that market.
but just to give you a sense of sort of the size of the market. if we were to sort of think about normalizing for that effect we would have seen our neuro business have sequential -- sequentially up quarter over q3 and we would have seen our vascular business, have a year-over-year growth consistent with the last few quarters. so i think with that you can have some those several comments around the market and sort of the effect sequentially and year-over-year, some sort of context for what that might be worth.
bob hopkins -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
okay. i'm just going to get its sure i get a sense for, relative to that 11% on a constant currency basis how much higher that would have been in neuro overall is that a number you are willing to give.
sridhar kosaraju -- analyst
yeah, i think with the comments i gave. i think you could easily back in the math, that would put you in the high teens. that's just for sort of the actual results in the quarter and i'll sort of remind you we mentioned two things we mentioned that with the sort of a classification between neuro peripheral, but also the comps, we had a pickup starting in q4. our neuro business in q4 grew 31% and you remember accelerated to 42% in the first quarter. so we're going up against some challenging comps in q4 and then particularly also in q1.
bob hopkins -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
yeah, no i definitely recall that and see it big, big difference in comps in terms of q2 and q3 versus q4 for '18 given what happened last year. so that's helpful color though and but just also just one other clarification, looking at your public disclosures in the last two quarters, it seems like the stroke business was growing in the 40% range globally, and obviously much tougher comp this quarter, but it is curious if there's any kind of help on what the stroke business grew this particular quarter. and again, i realize there was a tough comp. it sounded like most of the change, if you will, was outside the united states.
adam elsesser -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
yeah, yeah, you nailed it, bob, i think you got it spot on. and that's why we thought to help if we were to sort of dissect that for you geographically in stroke and in neuro in stroke. we said in the us we grew year-over-year, albeit, against the tough q4 comps over 30% this quarter and internationally, because of a couple of things. the one that we just talked about with moving some of that focus into the peripheral embolization launch in japan, but we also we're launching in q4 and q1 of last year, a68 in japan. so you have a few things that all sort of lead up to the difficult comps within neuro and international specifically, but i hope some of those comments help give a flavor, not just in stroke in the us, but overall neuro if you sort of adjusted for that we would be in a comparably strong position.
bob hopkins -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
okay. so just to be clear that 30% was u.s. ischemic stroke year-over-year?
adam elsesser -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
that's correct.
bob hopkins -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
okay. okay and then lastly, just real quickly, you made this comment about more growth drivers in 2019 versus 2018 and i just want to, what exactly are you referencing referencing there?
sridhar kosaraju -- analyst
when we, if we just turn back the clock in -- think about our commentary going into '18 a lot of it was around stroke market and we talked about the anticipation of new products in the stroke portfolio and to a lesser degree on the vascular side, i think what's clear is within stroke you again, you have the markets, i think we feel like there's a lot more foundation set for us to see longer-term growth. adam touched on some of the additional states that have made announcements including virginia just last week. and on the product side, the continuation of sort of expanding and building our robust portfolio there outside of stroke. we continue to work on things in neuro outside of stroke as well on the vascular side, i think it's, i think now pretty clear we've been talking about vascular for a little while, but the results are now really starting to show why we've been so enthusiastic and optimistic about this area.
we went so far as to say we think it could be a larger opportunity potentially then neuro for us. there are --there's a lot of commercial progress there is also product development on clinical clinically. we have the xtrac trial that could help us move into pe pulmonary embolism market and then you go into geography there was a question earlier about china and japan. we just talked about expanding our peripheral business and by the way our vascular business outside the us is very small, there is a great long-term opportunity there and all that is just what we would consider our existing business, new areas that we're continuing to work on that many things we have yet to discuss. so think you can even tell them out answer , how much there is and how enthusiastic. we are about it.
bob hopkins -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
that's great. thanks for the color.
operator
your next question comes from larry biegelsen with wells fargo. your line is open.
larry biegelsen -- wells fargo -- analyst
hey, guys. thanks for taking the question. just a couple, kind of new opportunities for me. so first, adam. can you talk about the contribution you're seeing from cat coronary opportunity in your expectations for 2019 along that vein, i'll just ask my follow-up question on mvi you assume controlling interest last year, could we start to see some clearances in 2019 from that technology. and just along the same lines, you talked about investing in new areas, other new product launches, can we expect in 2019, i didn't hear anything about that on this call. so, thanks for taking the questions.
sridhar kosaraju -- analyst
sure, thanks, larry. let's start it's beginning cataracts is definitely, as i said on some of the prior calls, the product is working we're gaining a lot of confidence in its value to interventional cardiologists in those particular procedures. it did have some value, i wouldn't say it's sort of notable or material at this point. but i do think that will continue to have and we'll see some of that success play in '19 and hopefully beyond. so we'll start to you don't talk about that, maybe a little more as we progress in the year. mvi it's i am really not prepared to go into a lot of details at this moment on this call, but let's just sort of sum it up, as i think, for those who know us, we wouldn't have likely bought controlling interest in that enterprise if we did not feel that we were -- we have a lot more certainty around that, then we used to. and so we're pretty -- we're pretty excited in the progress we've made. and then beyond that, we're certainly i'm not prepared on this call to go into any more details.
larry biegelsen -- wells fargo -- analyst
got it. all right. one last question adam, on the international, it's clear that us scheming stroke was strong in q4 the above 30% growth, but international seems to be way down a little bit by some of these issues. can you tease out as how temporary those issues are if you expect kind of a bounce back in international ischemic stroke in q1? or if some of these things kind of or take a few quarters to play out? thanks for taking the questions.
adam elsesser -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
yeah, thanks, larry for the question and that clarification. look our international stroke business is very strong. we spent a lot of time last year, talking about the nuances and 68 launch and all of that. and so what we said then is now turning out to be good, and i think really for the most parts, those are the nuances that created this sort of moment there's nothing about our international stroke business is different than the u.s., the products were one generation behind in a lot of those markets. but beyond that we're moving quickly the same issues apply where aspiration is gaining ground in many of these markets and we feel extraordinarily well positioned to benefit and help those markets and their patients. so i don't think there's anything to read into it other than the nuance of this particular quarter and potentially next.
larry biegelsen -- wells fargo -- analyst
thanks for taking the questions.
adam elsesser -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
thanks, larry.

your next question comes from the line of joanne wuensch with bmo capital markets. your line is open.
joanne wuensch -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
good afternoon, everybody. can you hear me ok?
adam elsesser -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
yeah, hi, joanne.
joanne wuensch -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
hi, a couple of things, you mentioned that virginia systems of care come online and you mentioned a couple of other states. can you walk us through once these guidelines are established in these states, how long it takes to sort of transition those patients in europe more productive continue or cycle of care?
adam elsesser -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
yeah, it's a great question and let me clarify. we sort of lumped all those states in with a list of things that they had done from protocol risks, as well as laws. virginia pass the resolution, which really is the first step it's not necessarily going to see a major change, by law yet. it's really a resolution of sort of -- for lack of a better way of describing it support that they want these patients to be treated, and that will, i think it's really the first step in moving toward the next phase of the legislative process.
what we wanted to demonstrate is the growing support, we're now getting some bigger states added to the list, they're reaching out to this -- to the get ahead of stroke teaming and we're really i think seeing some of that momentum. to answer this specific question, how long does it take to start seeing that benefit, we really only have a few states that we can sort of look at, and i think it depends on the state and the size of the state and some of the complexities smaller states arizona. we have had over year of that benefit, and it's we've got notable change in the number of patients being treated. our tennessee is still in the first sort of six months of that. so it's a little premature to sort of report on some of those numbers, but i do think it will take a while, but the overall point of this was there is real momentum. the conversations, the energy around this in the various states the list of states are growing. so we are very heartened by and we think over the next three, four years we are going to see a big transformational change.
joanne wuensch -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
thank you. as my second question, one of the things reached haven't heard yet on this conference call is about your separator versus 3d. and if there's anything you comment on how that is going and a couple of physicians that we've spoken to have mentioned that other companies are co-packaging their stent retrievers and there catheters if you can think about how to position your products in that environment that would be helpful. thanks.
adam elsesser -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
yeah listen, we -- there are lot of things we obviously don't call out every product by saying our stent retrievers as you know it's sort of new generation stent retrievers where we specifically designed to sort of trap and hold the clot. it's not really sort of the hollow tube design of the older designs that our competitors have. there's been it was a paper out of germany that showed our product working really, really well in comparison to others, and i think that's been worth pointing out and helpful.
but the bottom line is we were not selling sort of individual tools like that we're selling the larger idea that if you start with our aspiration tools, whether you use it in combination or as a bailout you will have a huge success using aspiration as the primary if not sole mechanism in your case. and so that's always been our focus to answer your question around sort of packaging in kits or bundles and whether it's physically packaging them together or pricing them together. we have always competed quite well in this market in the world of packaging and pricing and sort of holistically thinking about it. there's nothing about competitive behavior that has been different or unexpected and not able to be responded to by us. and so we feel perfectly good about where we are are sitting in that regard.
joanne wuensch -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
thank you very much.
adam elsesser -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
yeah, of course. thank you.
operator
your next question comes from isaac ro with goldman sachs. your line is open.
isaac ro -- goldman sachs -- analyst
good afternoon, guys. thank you. adam, i wanted to maybe ask you in three if you could expand a little bit upon the assumptions you're making for your topline guidance this year, specifically with regards to higher dissecting your expectations for patient growth in the core stroke opportunity for the u.s. i know you gave some commentary earlier in the q&a about procedure growth versus treatment growth and just be helpful to get a sense of how you're thinking about the overall market lot of moving parts between competition and what you guys are doing. so maybe that is starting point would be much appreciated.
sridhar kosaraju -- analyst
sure. isaac i'll start and adam can jump in if i don't get all your question. but as you alluded to that we break down neuro and vascular, we are guiding to a top line of 18% to 20% following that roughly 26% reported growth that we had in q4. the market growth drives a lot of our thinking and is the most sensitive to our results, if you look back the last three years, last year we added 10,000 more patients treated in the u.s. and that prior two years before that was around five, there's a lot of different reasons for the acceleration the local efforts some of the state initiatives we feel are more longer-term influencers of growth and obviously we had the data on extended window, which opened up new population and expanded the addressable market in terms of patients we think we can treat. so when we think about 2019, it would be great if we continued at that pace of growth, but i think we are looking at it, given that most of the core drivers are in the local efforts, which have been that way since the last three plus years we think about it a normalized rate is kind of if you were to think of the average of the last three years, you're at sort of 6,000 to 7,000 patients more in 2019, which translates to sort of a high-teens market growth.
the other things, everyone's focused on that sort of moved aspiration, and competition, we obviously feel good about each of those. but i think the market growth is more the key driver. and there are other parts of neuro we talked about the -- the aneurysm market kind of growing in the low single digits. so that gives you a good perspective of neuro and by implication vascular to get to sort of the overall top line number that we're guiding to of 18% to 20%.
isaac ro -- goldman sachs -- analyst
(inaudible). and then maybe sri, just a follow-up on this, adam, wants to chime in on that question. just on gross margin last year, obviously it was in a pretty narrow band, but it will little bit of oscillation quarter-on-quarter and just given the exit run rate there for the end of 2018. can you help us think through key gross margin considerations for this year between all the things you're doing with the mix, the sensuous currency might matter, but the production ramp, you guys have in the new facility it'll be just helpful gross margin line. thanks.
sridhar kosaraju -- analyst
sure. so on gross margin for the year, we were up 60 basis points for the year it as you heard our commentary throughout the year. we've always talked about being in the mid '60s the place that we are in the investments we're making. there are a couple of things, flavors of that will pressure or keep gross margins where they are. the capacity expansion to keep up with this growth we've invested pretty aggressively. and on a prior call we talked about taking more space outside of our campus in alameda for expansion growth. second with new product launches we had a number of them in 2018 and obviously as we start with new products that weighs on us a little bit before we get a little more maturation in some of our production of products post launch.
and geography plays in it to some degree as well this quarter, we launched our peripheral coils in japan and that's we touched on the product mix is being an influencer particularly between last quarter and this quarter. so the expectation is, we'll be in this sort of area, but we also believe, and that's as we look out next year. but we also continue to believe that over a longer period of time we could make some serious progress in gross margins. but right now, there is a whole heck of a lot of growth that we're trying to invest and focus on first.
isaac ro -- goldman sachs -- analyst
thanks for the detail, guys.
sridhar kosaraju -- analyst
yeah, thanks. isaac.

(operator instructions) your next question comes from glenn novarro with rbc capital markets. your line is open.
glenn novarro -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
hi, good afternoon guys. thanks for taking the question. on vascular even after you adjust for the reclassification vascular with still stronger than what we expected. so adam, can you point out or point to -- anything that can help us understand why vascular continues to come in -- come in better is it you opened up some new accounts and some bigger, bigger users have come on board. is it new reps or better rep productivity. any color would be helpful. and then i had a follow-up.
adam elsesser -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
yeah, yeah. thanks glenn for asking that question. i think it's really pretty simple when we went public 3.5 years ago we talked in the little time we have left in all meetings about this opportunity and what we thought we could do. we've been trying again limited time we have to talk about this as a real important opportunity for both patients and the company's benefit. the pathway here is different with neuro all of our energy is now spent beyond continue make better and better products, all of our energy has been trying to get patients to the right hospital. in the us, particularly the patients are already there and there are already being treated.
so our only goal our effort is to convince physicians that removing the clot as opposed to dissolving it our mass rating it or doing something else with it is the most important thing and that helps the patient. and we've just been going at this sort of month-by-month, year-by-year, we started with one set of physicians we're moving into the second, there's a third with interventional cardiologists to do some of this work. and that's the pathway, so everything we sort of said for last bunch of years is now coming to be true. and so we're seeing the benefit and the success that brings. we're really happy to see that. we are excited for the patients that are benefiting and we are not while the surprise we can't predict exact numbers on a quarterly basis, but we're, what we had hoped would happen.
glenn novarro -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
okay. it sounds like it's just really good blocking and tackling. my follow-up is vascular really is starting to look like it's going to be a second leg of growth for the company and i think sri's comments you talked about growth being kind of similar to 2018. my question is why can't growth be stronger given the market so much bigger and your penetration is so low. thanks.
sridhar kosaraju -- analyst
glenn, just to clarify, i think -- last two quarters before this one we were growing year-over-year in the sort of mid 40% our growth really accelerated in the back half of 2018, as we got to new physicians that vascular surgeons as an example and as we launch new technology to get to different areas like -- like we discussed in the q2 and q3 call. so we will face that as we go into '19 unlike stroke. if you think about what drives our growth. we spent a lot of time answering some questions on this call and neuro about how our growth is tied to the market growth, which is getting patients to the right place to be treated is adam mentioned it's a little bit different here. the initial market to target are the 150,000 patients that are in hospital being treated and it's our ability to take those cases and be involved in working with physicians to educate them on all the different avenues and diseases where indigo can be used.
so there's our first generation of tool with very little little clinical data. so this is very much up to the strong commercial efforts of our team that are knocking this down and allowing us to see the growth that we're seeing. so it's hard to be able to sort of forecast that out too far for you, but i think what we can say is, we feel like we're in the very early innings we're starting to see a real acceleration in that business and we're quite excited about it.
glenn novarro -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
okay. great. thanks, sri.
