ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. welcome to the cirrus logic's third quarter fiscal year 2021 financial results q&a session. [operator instructions] i would now like to turn the conference call over to mr. thurman case, chief financial officer. mr. case, you may begin.
thurman k. case -- chief financial officer and vice president, finance
thank you and good afternoon. joining me on today's call is john forsyth, cirrus logic's chief executive officer; and chelsea heffernan, our director of investor relations.
today, we announced our financial results for the third quarter fiscal year 2021 at approximately 4:00 p.m. eastern. the shareholder letter discussing our financial results, the earnings press release, including a reconciliation of non-gaap financial information to the most directly comparable gaap information, along with the webcast of this q&a session are all available on the company's investor relations website at investor.cirrus.com. this call will feature questions from the analysts covering our company, as well as questions submitted to us via email at investor@cirrus.com.
please note that during this session, we may make projections and other forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from projections. by providing this information, the company expressly disclaims any obligation to update or revise any projections or forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new developments or otherwise.
please refer to the press release and the shareholder letter issued today, which are available on the cirrus logic website, and the latest form 10-k and 10-q as well as other corporate filings made with the securities and exchange commission for additional discussion discussion of risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the current expectations.
now i'll turn the call over to john.
john forsyth -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, thurman. cirrus logic delivered q3 fy '21 revenue of $485.8 million, above the high end of guidance as we experienced strong demand for certain products shipping in recently introduced smartphones. during the quarter, we were especially pleased with customer evaluations and design-in activity across our product lines. we expect a variety of new end products utilizing our boosted amplifiers, truly wireless headset smart codecs and haptic solutions to be introduced in the first half of this calendar year.
in reflecting on what is really an incredible set of results for the quarter, i'd like to acknowledge and express our thanks to jason rhode and al schuele, who were, of course, ceo and chair of the board of directors respectively for the period, and whose leadership played such an instrumental role in building the company that we are today.
in the december quarter, the company also completed our annual strategic review and we are truly excited about the three growth vectors that we believe will contribute to our long-term success. first, we anticipate strengthening our position as the leading audio supplier in smartphones. second, we are focused on increasing sales of audio components in certain applications beyond smartphones. and third, we are drawing on our extensive mixed-signal engineering expertise to develop technology in new product areas that we believe will drive diversification beyond the audio domain.
in the last quarter, we took an important step along that path with the introduction of a closed-loop controller product. and in the last two earnings calls, we've also signaled that we are currently investing heavily in a product in another new area relating to power that we are aiming to introduce later this calendar year. while we won't go into details on those products, i will report that our engineering progress continues to be really positive and that we continue to be very excited about the journey we're on with our customer.
with a rich portfolio of products available today and a pipeline of innovative new components in development, we are optimistic about our ability to execute on this strategic plan. and we believe that this will drive both revenue growth opportunities and product diversification in the coming years.
before we begin the q&a, i'd also like to note that while we understand there is intense interest related to our largest customer in accordance with our policy, we do not discuss specifics about our business relationship.
operator, we're now ready to take questions.
",":
operator
thank you. [operator instructions] and your first question comes from the line of tore svanberg from stifel. your line is open.
tore svanberg -- stifel -- analyst
yes, thank you and congratulations on the results. first question, john, could you calibrate a little bit your visibility right now. obviously, your largest customer didn't offer any appropriate guidance. but would you say you have sort of the same visibility right now as you had in previous years, or is it better or worse?
john forsyth -- president and chief executive officer
i think it's always difficult to read across from what we see happening with our own orders to what's happening with our customer products, just given the fact that we ship to contract manufacturers and in some cases, module vendors. what we do see generally is really strong demand. so in the macro sense, what we hear in the very positive and very bullish outlook from our largest customers we see reflected in our own order book. it's obviously a time of -- a lot of capacity constraint in the supply chain, and we certainly see that same pattern of demand exceeding supply. it's definitely a quality problem to have. but yeah, i think the outlook is for continued strength of the market.
tore svanberg -- stifel -- analyst
very good. second question, and you mentioned this a little bit in your prepared remarks, it does sound like the company is probably going to be a bit more aggressive targeting non-smartphone applications. i mean, i know historically the company has always kind of view those as opportunities but perhaps a bit more opportunistic. should we think that this is going to be a more concerted effort to really diversified into wearables, laptops and so on?
john forsyth -- president and chief executive officer
we certainly think there are really good opportunities there, tore. that is something that we've been talking about and gradually turning up the volume on over the past couple of years. in the last year, we felt we passed a lot of meaningful milestones on getting into some key wearable products, some big tablet launches across customers, and we want to keep that momentum going across those product categories.
and as we've indicated, we believe other important product categories hold opportunity as well, you mentioned laptops there. from my perspective, really when it's something that is a battery constraint -- battery-dependent device, really power constrained, where either haptics or audio or some other area of mixed signal expertise is required, then i think it could be a very good fit for us.
so, for sure, as we've been able to grow and scale our engineering capability over the past few years, it's not for one second that we're taking our eye off the ball regarding smartphones. you can see that's kind of mission number one, as i said, to continue to lead the field there. but yes, you will see us, i think, continue to make progress in these other categories.
operator
and your next question comes from the line of ruben roy from benchmark company. your line is open.
ruben roy -- benchmark company -- analyst
great. thank you very much. john, if i could follow-up on the supply chain commentary around constraints, etc. the first question is, would you say some of the constraints that either you're facing or maybe some other supply chain participants are facing are putting a cap on sort of your near-term outlook, which could used later on this year or are you able to supply everything to your customers as their demand dictates as you look to the march quarter?
john forsyth -- president and chief executive officer
well, look as -- when it comes to our largest customers and our largest selling products, obviously, a lot of the work we do there has a very long planning horizon, so we feel in very good shape there. when you step back and look at the kind of boom in demand across the broader category of products that we sell into, there is for sure demand that exceeds our ability and the supply chain's ability to service that right now. that could be because during calendar '20 customers had a -- some customers had a bleak outlook on the market and then kind of got the win back in their sales at the back end of the year, or it could simply be just completely new upside. so, our guidance reflects what we're able to capture of that, we continue to work on supply chain constraints to see how much of it we can grab. but all of that is taken into account in our guidance, ruben.
ruben roy -- benchmark company -- analyst
okay, that's helpful. thank you, john. and then, sort of higher level question around the growth vectors and the strategic planning, etc., that you've done. some of these new products that you've been talking about and are excited about, i think the investor base is pretty excited about appear to be custom products slated for your largest customer. what would you say the roadmap looks like in terms of more general product offerings, both for your traditional smartphone end markets but also some of these other markets that you're excited about as you think about the next 12 to 18 months?
john forsyth -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. we're certainly very excited by the opportunities ahead of us. when it comes to evaluating them, ruben, we look at the opportunity size above all else. we -- if that happens to be with one customer versus another, that's a kind of second order consideration to us. right now, what we're focused on is executing against our current plan and getting these first generation devices in new categories for us locked and loaded, and help our customers ramp successfully with those products. longer term, there may be additional upside, but honestly the opportunity we see ahead of us with our largest customer is sufficiently significant and meaningful that we're very upbeat about the future based on that.
operator
your next question comes from the line of matt ramsay from cowen. your line is open.
matt ramsay -- cowen -- analyst
yes, thank you very much. good afternoon. john, i wanted to -- there was a lot in the shareholder letter and in your script as well about -- the other guys have asked, new domains, and you mentioned laptops and a few other things. i wonder if you might talk a little bit about, is the company investing and is it important for you to consider things in the automotive market just as paring smartphones with audio and that domain is important also that there is tons of opportunities for haptics you would think and the long design-in cycles and whatnot. but i just wonder, if that's a market that your view might be different than it would have been if we did talk about it two, three years ago, given the amount of disruption that's happening in that space? thank you.
john forsyth -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, matt. yeah, it's an interesting area. we have some business in the automotive space and we continue to evaluate that. as a major focus, i would say, we steer toward areas where the power constraints are really much more severe. so, something that needs to be really thin, carried around, worn on the person, those kind of devices where every microamp counts are the ones where i think we can deliver the most leverage from our engineering advantage. there are, as you say, certain areas of the automotive space that are taking off, haptics being one of them, which we continue to look at. it's not a major focus for us right now given all the opportunities in front of us in that more power constrained device space that i mentioned.
matt ramsay -- cowen -- analyst
got it. got it. that makes sense. i guess my second question and i guess it's to thurman or john, obviously, feel free to chime in here. but i guess the question that i've got a few times in the last 45 minutes, hour, or whatever since the numbers came out are, the growth is, i don't know, 30% or so on a year-over-year basis in december. your largest customer launched their flagship device a little bit later this year than it has in the past, just from a calendar perspective. so, to see the march quarter up, i guess, 10% year-over-year, or certainly declining on a relative basis. i just wonder, anything else going on there? or is it mostly just the supply constraints that you talked about? and i guess the second part of it is, are you -- as you informed the guidance, are you guiding to supply you know you've secured and are going to try to do better than that? or is there some sort of formula where you're calculating what you're supply might look like? thanks.
thurman k. case -- chief financial officer and vice president, finance
yeah, look, our guidance takes everything into account that we see internally and externally. so that obviously includes incredibly strong product launches from our largest customers, very strong demand across the board and then also areas of our business that would be going faster if we could secure more capacity than we currently have committed for this quarter. so, we then take a broadly conservative line through that data when we give guidance, while kind of reiterating, i guess, just how optimistic we are on the outlook generally given the strength of demand and what we have in the pipeline. yeah, that's -- it may well be that we can grab more upside, but this is a -- the capacity constraints there are for sure real. but what we're basing our guidance on, i think is a very solid outlook of demand we can service.
operator
your next question comes from the line of blayne curtis from barclays. your line is open.
blayne curtis -- barclays -- analyst
hey guys, thanks for taking my question. i just want ask you on the android side. last quarter, you're enthusiastic about some of the outside, potentially from china. and then it sounds like your korean customer had some earlier launches as well. so, when i look at december quarter, it look little bit flat. i'm just kind of curious december kind of played out as you expected. and then as you look to march, i know you don't like to guide by segment. but any color on what you expect from android? you mentioned in the shareholder letter [indecipherable] haptics and buds? thanks.
john forsyth -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. i think overall for android, we're very positive about what we think we're going to see this year. what we did talk about, i mean, as you said blayne, we don't break it out by segment. but we did talk about design-in momentum, which has been really good. and i think you'll see us in both -- we're showing overall growth in android, but also see us in more devices and more sockets this year in android as a result of that design momentum, which really accelerated over the past quarter.
blayne curtis -- barclays -- analyst
got you. and then maybe just sort of a question for thurman [indecipherable] one of you guys. but on gross margin, the guide of 51%. i know you always are kind of conservative here, but i'm just kind of curious if you're seeing anything? it has come down from the beginning of the fiscal year to the end 160 basis points. i'm just kind of curious, any color as to the moving pieces there, whether it's the android or new products? that would be helpful. thanks.
thurman k. case -- chief financial officer and vice president, finance
yeah. we don't break it out that details on where the margins change. but i mean, we have supply chain efficiencies and product mix, product cycles and launches, all have an effect on margin on any given quarter. we're guiding -- again we're guiding to a range that we think is reasonable for our visibility at this time. but we would note that when we look into fy '22, we would expect that margins will trend slightly up as we move it across that fiscal year.
operator
your next question comes from the line of derek soderberg from colliers securities. your line is open.
derek soderberg -- colliers securities -- analyst
yeah, thanks. so i just wanted to start with john. saw some positive commentary in the shareholder letter around new end products adding content. with the last few months of the fiscal year, last year, i was wondering if you can provide a bird's-eye view of fiscal 2022 as it relates to content increases and how that shapes up for growth for the year? and then maybe some moving parts in there? and then i have a follow-up.
john forsyth -- president and chief executive officer
well, as you know, we don't guide for -- beyond the current quarter. but directionally, i think you can read the tone and body language here is that, we've got so much going on in terms of new content introduction and new stuff in development that we feel very upbeat. and obviously, the strength of demand is a factor in that. but if units were flat, we would still be feeling very upbeat given what we have on the content side.
so, in particular, i think the main headline, as we talked about, is that we have what we previously referred to as a power conversion and control device that we are planning to ramp in the back end of this calendar year. that's something that we are both extremely excited about. in terms of its introduction and the opportunity that that represents for us in landing new content in a new part of the smartphone system, and then being able to add value and incremental benefit to our customers and users over time based on that.
so that's really exciting for us being in a new area of the system, new content with significant value that we've indicated relative to the closed-loop controller, which we've just ramped in the back half of fy -- back half of calendar '20. relatively speaking, the new device will be meaningfully higher than that in terms of value.
beyond that, we have a number of developments ongoing and new product introductions. we're talking the latter about the introduction of devices using new headset smart codec, designed for truly wireless headsets, and delivering anc, which we are -- which is currently shipping. and so far, the response to those, the reception of those products has been really positive. we're excited about the opportunities there.
and then, sort of reading out the whole letter, i'd probably just refer you to the whole range of categories there where i think we're making really good progress. as i said, the android momentum in the smartphone space is great. but looking beyond that wearables, tablets and other categories beyond that represent significant growth opportunity for us where we have great devices.
derek soderberg -- colliers securities -- analyst
great. and then i guess with recent products released in these non-audio adjacencies, the camera controllers and power control ic chip a year after that. should we view this cadence as sort of normal or is this more of an atypical product cadence in the shorter term? i just want to see how you're thinking about the cadence longer term? thanks.
john forsyth -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, that's a fair question. i don't think there is a crisp answer to it. when you look back at the cadence across all kinds of products that we ship into our largest customers, actually it's pretty variable. there are periods when you go through a new introduction on a given device every couple of years, there are periods when it's longer than that. so i wouldn't -- i actually wouldn't [indecipherable] guess on that right now when it comes to the exact timing. what we are sure about is that there is plenty of headroom for bringing more innovation to those categories, and just integrating more functionality, providing -- leveraging the integrated signal processing that we have in those devices and kind of continuing to add smarts and value to our customer. so, if we can execute as we have been doing and continue to make take innovation to our customers, then i'd expect there to be a good frequency of update to those products in time.
operator
your next question comes from the line of rajvindra gill from needham & company. your line is open.
rajvindra gill -- needham & company -- analyst
yes, thank you, and congrats on all the momentum. a question on the non-apple business -- sorry, the new non-top customer. so if you look at the year-over-year growth from december of last year to december of this year, it seems, based on the math, that the -- that non-top customer, the revenue was basically flat year-over-year. so -- which is kind of your strength in kind of mid-range audio amplifier and truly wireless and other products. just wondering how are you think about that -- that part of the business as we kind of ramp throughout the year and going into subsequent years?
john forsyth -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, i think may be drawing too much out of the past quarter on that front, i'd maybe caution against that just given that a lot of the -- when you look at our android business, a lot of the android market was hit pretty badly by covid during calendar '20 for a variety reasons, partly regional, partly the lack of having such a strong direct channel and so on. so, that was fairly -- there was a kind of overhang on that part of the market. i think what we have seen though and this is what we described in the letter is a lot of momentum on the design side. and so the general demand for our products and -- including our kind of state-of-the-art leading-edge latest generation boost and amplifiers within that part of our business is really significant. and so we saw a lot of design momentum in the last quarter on that front. obviously, that stuff that we will see bearing through this calendar year.
rajvindra gill -- needham & company -- analyst
and just for a follow-up. for your top customer, just wondering if you could help me understand kind of the mix of the phone versus the non-phone, without maybe quantifying it, but just qualitatively, the mix of revenue that you're getting outside of the phone and what are your thoughts on that going forward?
john forsyth -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, we don't break that out. obviously, i'm sure you're expecting me to say that. at least on the non-phone side, the story there has been really positive over the past year. we had, like, some very -- as i said earlier in the call, we had some really good milestones that we passed in terms of getting content into great new to us product categories that were launched during calendar '20. but all of that, obviously, honestly, is dwarfed by the amount of momentum on the phone side in the past quarter and with the current generation in particular. but still, the story on both sides is very positive for us, lots of progress.
operator
your next question comes from the line of the vivek arya from bank of america. your line is open.
vivek arya -- bank of america -- analyst
thanks for taking my question. i'm curious, what is the right metric or milestone we should track for cirrus or hold you to on the android side. so if, let's say, android market goes up x percent this year in terms of units, how is your visibility in terms of growing with that market? i think you outlined a number of interesting content opportunities. but when do they actually start to show up in the model?
john forsyth -- president and chief executive officer
well, we're, obviously, shipping today in a whole range of android smartphones. we tend to be focused on the upper half of the market, so the flagship tier and then the upper half of the mid-tier smartphones. historically, there have been -- we've been very strong in some vendors, less well populated in some of the other flagship phone vendors and we're seeking to maximize that over time. so certainly one leading indicator i'd point to is design-in and the sockets -- power amplifiers are in the flagship smartphones from across the android oem community. then obviously, once we get into those sockets, we look to iterate, grow the value and populate other skus and other tiers as appropriate [phonetic].
vivek arya -- bank of america -- analyst
okay. and i'm curious what is the right way to think about the second half of the year that you potentially have camera content perhaps expanding in all models and then the power control content, which i think you described as a meaningful step-up opportunity, that coming only at the high end or do you think that also has a chance to show up in multiple models?
john forsyth -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. look, i think what we've said about that in particular is long term, we regard that as being highly relevant across the tiers and across skus. so that -- i think that latter device is likely to trend toward an attach rate of one. how that looks on the first run out when we ramp in the back half of this year, that remains to be seen.
and then on the closed-loop controller content, yes, i think we previously talked about taking an asp of being roughly equivalent to an amplifier there as your general guideline based on -- that's a blended asp based on a certain attach rates. again, just given the nature of the devices that that shipped in, we'd expect to see that blended asp trend up over time, as well.
operator
your next question comes from the line of christopher rolland from sig. your line is open.
christopher rolland -- sig -- analyst
hey guys, thanks for the question. i guess, first i'll ask kind of a big picture and then drill down a little bit. so, in your letter you talked about the annual strategic review. perhaps, john, if you could talk about the topics that were kind of reviewed there. but also maybe your couple biggest takeaway that you had from that review and in your kind of short tenure ship as ceo thus far?
john forsyth -- president and chief executive officer
i hate to disappoint. i think i'm going to tell you that i've told you everything i'm going to say about the takeaways. but look, yeah, there -- obviously, every company does a strategic review. there are times you do it and -- and it's [phonetic] comparatively painful. there are times you do it, where you're looking -- we ask all the teams to come pitch their ideas and their opportunities, but they've identified for business growth. and this is one of those occasions where you're looking across that list of stuff and scratching your head, wondering how you're going to select between them and staff as many as you can. so, that's what we've gone through over the past few months.
i think, out of that, there are three really clear vectors which i've talked about. we feel that there is really significant opportunity to both continue our leadership in the smartphone space, and then build beyond that and build meaningful revenue beyond audio and continue the trajectory that we believe we are on that.
christopher rolland -- sig -- analyst
awesome, thanks. and, so my second question, in the presentation, there was something that was new that was pretty cool, and that was the hp mixed signal beyond audio break down that you guys gave. and i guess that's the camera controller and haptics. if there's anything else i missed in there, that would be great as well.
but my question is really around this market. would you say that this solidly holds a growth rate that you guys expect above market trend for the next couple of years here? where do you think perhaps five years from now this 19% number could be for the company overall as you look at the various products and opportunity sets you have?
john forsyth -- president and chief executive officer
i'm not going to get drawn on that. obviously, we have a view on it, it continues that trend that we've outlined in that slide. thanks for highlighting that because i think that tells exactly the story that -- i was communicating. we believe that there is still growth in our core audio business around smartphones, there is growth taking those products and that ip into other product categories, into other device categories. and then, there is really meaningful opportunity for us to continue to expand the areas where we are applying our advanced mixed signal expertise. so that you can see in the shareholder presentation, with -- where we illustrate that we see the revenue from that other non-audio set of domains growing significantly over time.
we expect that to be, for sure -- i mean, who knows exactly what's going to happen with the market. but we believe the best way of growing our revenues is growing content. and then growing the content per phone and obviously, any underlying market growth is upside on that.
operator
your next question comes from the line of rick schafer from oppenheimer. your line is open.
andy hummel -- oppenheimer -- analyst
hi. this is andy hummel on for rick. thanks for taking my question. just quickly on the clc product. it sounded like [indecipherable] shareholder letter that [technical issues] back on that technology as a whole in your largest customer. but are you guys capable of -- or have you had kind of any early conversations from other oems, or anybody else that's interested in that product to kind of roll that out to other providers over the course of time. and i'm just trying to get a sense of the potential demand for that product rolling out even beyond your largest customer?
john forsyth -- president and chief executive officer
that's not a focus for us right now. we really being very focused on executing and ramping with our -- our customers with that. we're not in the business of working for years on a custom product for somebody and then [indecipherable] to other customers. we obviously invest lot of engineering expertise and ip in that. and we'll look to leverage that toward our biggest opportunities. but i'm pretty confident that we're focused on those.
andy hummel -- oppenheimer -- analyst
all right. and then just quickly on the buyback authorization [indecipherable] the $350 million. is that any indication of you got [phonetic] plans on kind of accelerating buybacks any time near-term or is it just kind of an extension of your sort of normal run rate buyback that you plan to look at over the course of time? thanks for taking my question.
john forsyth -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, sure. well, our preferred use of cash remains m&a. so, absent good acquisition opportunity, then we'll continue to look to return cash through share buyback on an opportunistic basis. what that authorization reflects and represents really is just that we have historically high amount of cash on the balance sheet, and we want to be in a position to leverage that if the circumstances dictate.
operator
[operator instructions] we have a follow-up question from the line of tore svanberg from stifel. your line is open.
tore svanberg -- stifel -- analyst
yes, thank you. two quick follow-ups. first of all, thurman, inventory days are at 55 days. i mean, that's not an all-time low. but it really is at the lower end, if you look through history. how should we feel about your ability to get that number back up for the march quarter? i mean, obviously, revenue is going to be down, but just want to get a sense for your ability to build some inventory here this quarter?
thurman k. case -- chief financial officer and vice president, finance
yeah. from our visibility, we're expecting inventory to increase by the end of this quarter. how much? there's a lot in environment [phonetic], right? so, how much that will be that we do expect it to grow as we head into the first quarter of fiscal year '22.
tore svanberg -- stifel -- analyst
very good. and then the asp ranges that you guys have for your products, they tend to move around and i assume that's because you keep penetrating new applications and especially, the sort of mid-tier part of the smartphone market. first of all, is that the case? and then second of all, can you just clarify that these asps are tied to editing not related to your largest customer, right? so it's tied to 30% of your business?
john forsyth -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, that's broadly correct, tore. when they move from quarter-to-quarter, if we update the presentation to reflect that, that's -- yeah, typically, it may be because of the new product introduction or may be new category that we're penetrating or a new tier. and those products in there don't reflect -- the asps that we talk about in there don't reflect customer products.
tore svanberg -- stifel -- analyst
great, thank you guys.
john forsyth -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
[operator instructions] and there are no further questions at this time. i turn the call back over to chelsea heffernan.
chelsea heffernan -- director, investor relations
thank you, operator. there are no additional questions. so i'll turn the call back to john.
john forsyth -- president and chief executive officer
thank you. well, in summary, we are delighted with our results for the december quarter as higher-than-anticipated demand for certain components shipping in smartphones drove revenue above guidance. we continue to be amazed by what our team has been able to accomplish during the unusual and challenging circumstances of the past year. and i believe that this dedication and talent combined with our innovative roadmap and the strength of our relationships with the leaders in the markets that we serve will position the company well to capitalize on the growing opportunities ahead of us.
if you have any questions that were not addressed, you can submit them to us via the ask the ceo section of our investor website. i'd like to thank everyone for participating today. goodbye.

thank you, thurman, and thank you, everyone, for joining the call today. in the past year, cirrus logic made excellent progress on the key growth factors and strategic initiatives that we believe will contribute to our continued success in the quarters and years ahead. we increased the penetration of our audio solutions and smartphones. we gained momentum with audio and haptic solutions in exciting categories beyond smartphones, and we brought innovative products to market in new technology domains, expanding the range of product areas where cirrus is recognized for its leadership. we are particularly pleased with the progress we've made in driving product diversification in the high-performance mixed-signal area, which we have highlighted as a key pillar of our strategic vision for the company's future. the introduction of our first camera controller contributed to 55% year-on-year revenue growth in the high-performance mixed-signal category.
i feel it's also especially important to take a moment to thank our employees for everything that they have done over the past year. amid many, many challenges, they have shown extraordinary dedication both to supporting our customers with their current products and to keeping our track to many important development programs that we believe will be central to our and our customers' future success. turning now to our results. cirrus logic delivered fy 2021 revenue of $1.37 billion, up 7% year-on-year, and non-gaap eps of $4.58, up 27% year-on-year, driven largely by content gains and higher unit volumes. like many in the semiconductor industry, we have been experiencing strong demand in excess of supply. and while capacity constraints have not meaningfully affected the largest parts of our business, they did have some impact on our revenue for the last quarter as well as on our outlook for the first quarter of fy 2022.
today, we still see demand in excessive supply in some areas of our business, most typically in older products and in some cases, in parts of our audio business that we've added during the supply constrained period. and our experienced team is working closely with our supply chain partners to meet that demand as rapidly as possible. in the coming months, we will begin shipping new technologies to our customers across a range of end devices, including important new content in the high-performance mixed-signal category. and based on these factors, we expect to accelerate revenue growth in fy 2022. with this pipeline of new products and the r&d investments we are making to further strengthen our road map of compelling audio and high-performance mixed-signal solutions, we're extremely excited about the coming year. before we begin the q&a, i'd also like to note that while we understand there is always intense interest related to our largest customer, in accordance with our policy, we do not discuss specifics about our business relationship.
operator, we are now ready to take questions.
",":
operator
[operator instructions] and our first question comes from the line of matt ramsay of cowen. please go ahead your line is open.
matt ramsay -- cowen -- analyst
thanks very much good afternoon guys. john, i -- in light of the results and some of the stock action tonight, i think it's appropriate to ask the question. you guys have talked a bit openly to the extent that you can about content expansion expected in premium devices, both in the power domain for upcoming this fall and also in work that you've been doing on the 22-nanometer kodak for future products. and maybe just -- i know you can't give a ton of details and all of us have lots of questions about those things, but maybe you could just talk about if any of those expectations changed in terms of penetration, content, asps, visibility on those programs from the update you might have given us a quarter ago? thanks.
john forsyth -- president and chief executive officer
thanks for the question, matt. yes. i, obviously, will stress that we don't disclose details of our customers' products, but you are absolutely asking about some of the things we are most excited about. so i do want to provide a little more color as we are a little further along the road than we were one quarter ago. so in -- specifically there, you're referring in part to the power conversion and control ic that we've talked about. we're very excited about that. it's an expansion, again, into another high-performance mixed-signal area for us. we have said, as i've said previously, that we think that device will trend toward an attach rate of one. that's it's kind of natural state, i think. and we believe there's a compelling case for the being one in every phone.
and we believe it's going to have a pretty healthy attach rate straight out of the gate. we're obviously still early in the year to say more from that. but we're very excited about it also because of its value in asp terms, which i previously said was meaningfully higher from the closed-loop controller. so indicatively, i think it's best to think of the value of that as being about $1. you also asked about 22 nanometer. again, we've made really good progress there. i previously talked about us seeing silicon that we were really happy with and being deeply engaged with customers. we don't have a product vehicle that we're ready to talk about there yet. but we do see multiple applications for that technology on our road map that we are really excited about.
as a reminder, the reason you would invest in 22 nanometer is either to pack in more digital processing close to the analog and/or to make something that is radically smaller and more power efficient. so we can see multiple applications for that ip investment across different device categories and products. we have some particular routes to market that we're obviously working on that we've alluded to previously, but nothing more specific to say today.
matt ramsay -- cowen -- analyst
got it thanks. i appreciate the color and also the sensitivity on it. for my follow-up question, thurman, i wanted to ask about the printed results for the march quarter. i think most of us that follow the company realized that the june quarter is always transitional and seasonally down, and it's a little bit of throwing darts from the outside to see if we can model that right. but i think the concerns that i've gotten in my calls in my inbox tonight are around the march quarter print, given the upside that their largest customer showed in their results last night. i would have imagined back in the december quarter, as -- and in january, when you were giving the guide for march, you guys would have been able to understand the units that you had shipped into support from their phones and other devices and calibrate the guidance accordingly if you had overshipped versus what they had sold through.
so maybe you could give us some color there about how you guys were thinking about that with the march quarter results? and then if there was any other factors you mentioned, supply constraints, etc., that might have affected the march quarter?
john forsyth -- president and chief executive officer
matt, maybe i'll just chime in quickly with a couple of thoughts on that because the last time i spoke a little bit about the difficulty of drawing a straight line between what we ship and recognize versus what our peers or customer ships. in particular, the closed-loop controller content with the module assembly phase that, that's got, we talked at the time about the possibility that, that just put things a little out of sync on the scheduling of our revenue versus customers and so on. i think we're seeing that, that's pretty visible now. if you look at our q3, we were 30% up year-on-year. we took a lot of success there on the back of that content. and i think that's obviously been feeding product for our customers for some time since.
in the march quarter, i think -- and you may be alluding to at least the possibility of this so i'll clarify. we've been able to serve all the demand from our large customers -- our largest customers that we've had. so supply constraints haven't impeded us there. that's really just affected our ability to have upside in some of the smaller areas of our business.
thurman, if you have any other additional content or color you want to add to that, please go ahead.
thurman k. case -- chief financial officer and vice president, finance
well, also, as we noted, we had a -- we were able to service our larger customers, but we were constrained on some of our general market customers in the quarter. but again, we fulfilled most of that, and that really didn't -- none of those were factors in our results for the quarter.
operator
our next question comes from the line of blayne curtis of barclays. please go ahead your line is open.
blayne curtis -- barclays -- analyst
you kind of change your reporting segments. i'm assuming the easy answer is that your growth coming from these new products, the clc and the power chip. but just kind of curious, thought process around that, beyond that. and really, just when you look at the segment, i guess, audio was kind of flat year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter. it's first time we're seeing these numbers on out of the history, but how do you think about the growth rate of these two new segments?
john forsyth -- president and chief executive officer
you're absolutely right, blayne, the part of the thinking there is really to eliminate the growth that we anticipate in line with the strategic plan, where we believe we've got great opportunities now and in the future around high-precision mixed-signal category. the growth rates, going back to what i've said about strategic growth vectors, we see opportunity for growth in audio. the two primary areas there being the expansion of our footprint that we've talked about in android and then in other nonsmartphone categories, but we do think the growth rate in high-performance mixed-signal is going to be higher. and so over time, you'd see that as a larger portion of our revenue mix.
blayne curtis -- barclays -- analyst
got you. and i just want to ask, it's obviously harder to kind of back out and analyze now, but just your performance in the android world in the march quarter. and then i think you mentioned in your letters a positive outlook going forward. but just in perspective as to how that business turn you through you in march and into june.
john forsyth -- president and chief executive officer
i think broadly in android, our story there has been -- obviously, we're coming from a content headwind in 2021 with the smart codec disappearing. so we've got -- we had some room to make up there. in our key android customers, momentum was pretty slack during most of the last calendar year, but then really accelerated in the first part of this calendar year. and it sets us up for an fy 2022 in android terms, which i think was -- would probably looks, at least from where we are today, at being at least as strong day we see.
operator
our next question comes from the line of tore svanberg of stifel. please go ahead your line is open.
tore svanberg -- stifel -- analyst
yes, thank you. just a question on the segments. you talked about some of the growth. but what about profitability? is there a gross margin differential between the new segments?
john forsyth -- president and chief executive officer
broadly, no. the new products that we introduced are really consistent in gross margin profile, whether they're in audio or high-performance mixed signal, tore. there are one or two obvious exceptions to that in -- we've mentioned in the small print, which you may not have got to yet, but there are some legacy products that sit in high-performance mixed signal, which typically do have high margin. they're very low volume so they don't really move the needle around. broadly across both of those categories, the gross margin would be consistent with the corporate model.
tore svanberg -- stifel -- analyst
very good. and when it comes to capacity, you said it's still tight, but you were able to increase your inventory days. i'm just wondering, as we think about the june quarter, do you think that you'll sort of be back into equilibrium before the ramp in the second half or no?
thurman k. case -- chief financial officer and vice president, finance
no. we actually -- the constraints that we're seeing now are across a lot of products. and we're doing what we can to build that. but as far as equilibrium, we think that the capacity constraints will actually flow through fy 2022 and even possibly beyond. again, it's not going to affect any of our ability to meet our ramp schedules or our -- that we have at the back of back half of the year. what it will affect is that we still are seeing strong upside demand that we may or may not be at well likely will not be able to meet all of that. and we're continuing to work the process but -- and try to find capacity where we can. but that's really how we look at it for this year.
operator
[operator instructions] our next question comes from the line of christopher rolland of sig. please go ahead your line is open.
christopher rolland -- sig -- analyst
hey guys. thanks for the question. around maybe the pmic and timing in the back half as well, if you guys can talk about, from a timing perspective there, are there any details around -- is there a preassembly for this? or is there anything that can pull in the timing for that part? and then as we transition into these next handsets, are there -- is there an update of any parts so we might be seeing a drawdown of inventory today in order to ramp up a new part in the back half? just any sort of details as to a transition that may be taking place would be great.
john forsyth -- president and chief executive officer
let me take a run at that, and you can let us know in the follow up whether we -- whether i hit the nail on the head there, chris. so first of all, on timing, there's nothing really out of the ordinary. we are, with the power conversion device, preparing for a ramp that takes us through a full launch of a product. it's going to be a steep ramp, as i said. we're expecting a pretty healthy attach rate straight out of the gate. so there's a lot of wafers and content to move between now and then, a lot of work to do. but is the basis for our optimism and kind of our upbeat tone about fy 2022 as you'll have picked up. but there's nothing really out of the ordinary from a scheduled perspective there. and then the -- you may be alluding to this in the second part of your question. that product, in particular, the power conversion and control ic, that's not replacing anything.
so there's nothing that gets phased out or impacted from a legacy product inventory perspective by that. one thing that i haven't touched on elsewhere in the call, though, that may be looking in the background there is, of course, we have mentioned previously, and there's been discussion about it, that our camera control device has -- and given attach rates. we -- again, without saying anything about our customers' products and there's a lot of stuff that we don't know about our customers' products, however, it would be very consistent with what we've seen in many of our customers' products over the years, if that attach rate would it go up over time with cascading of kind of high-end camera features through the product tiers. so again, we think that's likely to happen, but there's nothing -- there's no particular drawdown of old inventory or anything like that associated with that -- that ramp.
operator
[operator instructions] our next question comes from the line of derek soderberg of colliers. please go ahead your line is open.
derek soderberg -- colliers -- analyst
hi guys. thanks for taking my question. thurman, i'm wondering if you could provide any detail around the pricing environment? our asps in terms of asp declines, having an abnormal impact on results or guidance? and then looking forward, do you expect asp declines to be anything out of the ordinary this year? any thoughts on the pricing environment would be helpful. and then i have a follow-up.
thurman k. case -- chief financial officer and vice president, finance
no. our asps, we see normal declines on our -- on a year-over-year basis on our asps with most of our older products. so i wouldn't say that there was anything abnormal in our asps this time or anything that was different from historic. i'd say that probably the bigger effect would be pricing for us in terms of we saw some pricing pressure because of the capacity constraints on that side of it, we did see some effect.
derek soderberg -- colliers -- analyst
got it. and then, john, i'm wondering if you could describe, to the extent you can, how the pandemic maybe opened up new opportunities and new products that use sort of voice authentication and interface in the early days of pandemic? there was a lot of talk about this new normal. we're going to be using voice more. i guess i'm wondering if that's playing out at all. i think you called out some new products in the shareholder letter. is that leading to shipments into any of these types of applications?
john forsyth -- president and chief executive officer
not in particular around those technologies, although i would say that one of the exciting areas of growth for us which is certainly, in, on, the back of the pandemic is just through the increased use of laptops, tablets and mobile devices. we've seen, consistent across those categories and across our different customers, a desire for higher quality audio. i think because of the fact that the ab and the video conferencing experience and the sheer amount of screen time has become so essential central to people's lives for working from home and so on. so we've actually seen going from really having almost no pc-related business a year ago, we've seen a high degree of customer engagement and are starting to gain real momentum and traction there, which we're excited about because we do believe that those devices are going through a transition where they have many of the same challenges that we've seen in smartphones when it comes to audio and haptics.
as they get thinner and thinner, they're going to work exactly the same kind of boosted down proprieties, haptics drivers to replace mechanical control and so on, which represents a great opportunity for us that gives us the ability to expand audio in new nonphone categories. so i would say that's one of the biggest areas where we've seen growth and new customer interest on the back of the pandemic, and it's certainly a meaningful part of the demand that we have sitting in the pipeline for fy 2022.
operator
and our next question comes from the line of christopher rolland of sig.
christopher rolland -- sig -- analyst
just a quick follow-up. you did mention laptops and haptics in your note here. and i think you actually said there were a couple of customers that were interested there. perhaps talk about that. and then i don't know if you want to maybe eliminate what mixed-signal product, besides -- i think the pmic that you're most interested in for 2021 or even 2022 as we look out.
john forsyth -- president and chief executive officer
sure. yes. i think i may have just hit on most of my talking points around the pc space. but just to recap, there's a really interesting transition. there are a couple of meaningful changes taking place, in particular, around ultrabooks, where their architecture and industrial design is becoming more and more akin to smartphones and encountering many of the same problems. so we anticipate that many of the mechanical assemblies in laptops, as they get thinner and thinner, will be replaced by haptic devices. and we've seen that in some products with track beds, and we've talked about our technology and collaborations around that, which we're really excited about, and we've been seeing great customer interest and traction there. in addition to that, the challenges that people face with smartphone audio was really partly as a result of wanting better and better audio out of thinner and thinner devices.
and that drove the desire for higher voltage, boosted amplifier sitting close to the micro speakers. and again, that's something which has been hugely successful for us in smartphones. we believe there will be, and we are seeing, a transition toward that in the ultrabook space as well. so for sure, that's been an exciting avenue of opportunity that's opened up over the past year or so. on the subject of high-performance mixed-signal areas, i'm saying we're not in the standard pmic business here. obviously, over time, we'll be able to share more details about what we're doing in the power conversion and control product that i talked about. but we're really not replacing anything there. we're doing something new that we believe has a lot of value to certain kinds of battery-based system.
and so that, in particular, is very interesting and exciting for us for two reasons. one is because of the avenues it opens up longer term. we believe it's relevant to a whole load of battery-based systems and is -- has a whole road map of innovation around it, where we can continue to grow value and bring new stuff to our customers; but also because of the real-world near-term revenue impact for us. that's a meaningful ballpark dollar additional content that we anticipate seeing from the fall of this year. and therefore, will be very meaningful in fy 2022 and even more meaningful in the full cycle in fy 2023.
christopher rolland -- sig -- analyst

operator
ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. welcome to the cirrus logic first quarter fiscal year 2022 financial results q&a session. [operator instructions].
i would now like to turn the conference call over to mr. thurman case, chief financial officer. mr. case, you may begin.
thurman k. case -- chief financial officer and vice president, finance
thank you, and good afternoon. joining me on today's call is john forsyth, cirrus logic's chief executive officer; and chelsea heffernan, our director of investor relations. today, we announced our financial results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2022 at approximately 4:00 p.m. eastern. the shareholder letter discussing our financial results, the earnings press release, including a reconciliation of non-gaap financial information to the most directly comparable gaap information, along with the webcast of this q&a session are all available at the company's investor relations website at investor.cirrus.com.
this call will feature questions from the analysts covering our company as well as questions submitted to us via email at investor.cirrus.com. please note that during this session, we may make projections and other forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from projections. by providing this information, the company expressly disclaims any obligation to update or revise any projections or forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new developments or otherwise.
please refer to the press release and shareholder letter issued today, which are available on the cirrus logic website and the latest form 10-k as well as other corporate filings made with the securities and exchange commission, for additional discussion of risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from current expectations. now
i'd like to turn the call over to john.
john forsyth -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, thurman. cirrus logic delivered q1 fy '22 revenue of $277.3 million, up 14% year-on-year, driven by higher smartphone volumes in android, content games in smartphones and an uptick in sales in laptops. during the quarter, we made great progress in both accelerating our sales momentum and executing on several of the strategic initiatives that we believe will position the company for sustained growth in the longer term. we increased penetration of our android customers, ramped shipments for the leading laptop oem, supported the adoption of new content in anticipation of product launches in the latter half of the year and advanced the development of a number of exciting new devices that are expected to fuel future revenue growth.
we also made very positive headway in the high-performance mixed-signal category. within this product line, our largest single area of both investment and growth opportunity remains power. the company's first-generation power conversional control ic, which we are currently ramping brings new technology and system-level capabilities to smartphones and adds significant diversity to our product and intellectual property mix. to further broaden our product portfolio in this space, we recently acquired lion semiconductor.
doing so extends our footprint into the rapidly growing wired and wireless fast charging market and brings considerable long-term growth potential. we also believe the addition of battery-centric charger products is highly complementary to our power conversion and control investments. with lion component shipping and volume in both flagship and mid-tier android smartphones, the acquisition aligns well with our current target end markets while bringing meaningful opportunities for further diversification.
with our continued leadership in audio, our innovations in high-performance mixed signal areas such as haptics, camera controllers and power and our continued investment in building strong and enduring customer relationships, we believe we are well positioned to achieve sustained growth in the coming years. in addition to this progress in executing our growth strategy, i would also like to highlight that the company recently published its first environmental, social and governance report, which can be found on our esq website.
in doing so, we've formalized our esg strategy, setting out both short- and long-term commitments in the areas of sustainability, diversity, equity and governance that matter most to our customers, our employees, our stockholders and the communities in which we live and work. we also put in place structures for accountability to monitor and report on our progress in these areas in the coming years.
and to continue the theme of energy efficiency that unites so many of our products, we also reported on the company's energy usage and emissions for the first time, establishing a baseline carbon footprint to help identify opportunities for improvements and to set science-based emissions reduction goals for the future. before we begin the q&a, i would also like to note that while we understand there is intense interest in our largest customer, in accordance with our policy, we do not discuss specifics about our business relationship.
operator, we're now ready to take questions.
",":
operator
[operator instructions]. first question from the line of tore svanberg of stifel. your line is now open.
tore svanberg -- stifel -- analyst
good. thank you and congrats on the results, especially that strong guidance. don, could you just talk a little bit more about your ambitions in power? i know initially when you sort of got into the space, i think you were working on a completely new function or a new application. but now obviously, you're extending your reach into charter top technologies. so help us understand a little bit the long-term strategy in power, how ambitious you are going to be in perhaps going after other subsectors of the power management space. thank you.
john forsyth -- president and chief executive officer
absolutely, tore, and thanks for the time. yes. so i previously talked about the three main growth vectors for us. one of them is continuing to drive strength in smartphone audio, one of them pushing -- broadening our audio reach beyond phones. and thirdly developing more volume and revenue in adjacent mixed signal areas in the beginning, focused on smartphones. and our initial areas in those mixed signal adjacencies were around haptics and then the closed-loop controllers for cameras and then latterly, and more recently, the power conversion and control product that we've been working on.
obviously, what we have been working on up until now, we believe is highly differentiated. it's -- we're not interested in getting into the vanilla theme game, but it's also custom silicon. so we're very limited in what we can say about it. but we have talked about it being relatively about it being involved in power conversional control and relatively close to the battery. in a complement to that, of course, we want to continue to grow the offerings we have in the power space and broaden out to the general market to grow the addressable market in that area.
so lion is a piece of the jigsaw in that picture where what it brings to us is some highly differentiated technologies that serve the current appetite and growing demand for fast charging as well as broadening the addressable market and having a lot of potential applicability for other markets beyond smartphones in the future.
tore svanberg -- stifel -- analyst
great. thank you. and as my follow-up, this is the first time i've heard you guys be as excited about the notebook market. i mean i know you've had the wins in the past, but it sounds like you're starting to hit a bit of a bigger stride here. so if we think about the content opportunity in notebook, i know it's probably a little bit less perhaps than what it is in the smartphone. but beyond amps and haptics, are you starting to get design wins in other of your products as well in the notebook market?
john forsyth -- president and chief executive officer
yes. exactly. we are thinking about that. i appreciate that market, the laptop market has been itself pretty buoyant over the past 18 months on the back of the pandemic. but i think a lot of the growth we've been seeing is entirely new to us and is partly causing -- or part of the reason for our excitement there is that it's spread across a number of products,
tore, so we've talked about the haptic devices being -- replacing the mechanical track pads, but actually, our laptop product sales cover audio domain as well. so at this point, we are designing in or shipping haptic drivers, codecs and audio amplifiers into laptops. if you look back to where we were just over a year ago, we had one of the top five laptop oems as our customers today were either shipping or designed into four out of the top five, and we've seen a very significant growth rate to date, even though we have much more coming down the track.
so i think it's particularly exciting to us. i've spoken previously about the fact that we do believe there's a real convergence in a lot of ways between both the architecture and the needs in the laptop segment and the smartphone segment, and that obviously fits extremely well with the strength of our product portfolio.
tore svanberg -- stifel -- analyst
great. thanks. just one last quick one for thurman. thurman, any details you could share with us on the supply commitment agreement with globalfoundries? any numbers that you can share with us?
thurman k. case -- chief financial officer and vice president, finance
we're not -- as you saw in the 8-k, we didn't release the numbers. we have -- we did talk about the prepaid and the reservation fee, which we can talk about in terms of pricing for -- that we got on in certain areas and so forth, that's a bit sensitive in terms of competition and other things for us to talk specifically about.
john forsyth -- president and chief executive officer
so what i'll add to that, tore, that i'm particularly excited about is that, that agreement secures for us in a time of really overwhelming demand and a lot of challenge to meet that demand, that secures for us a very significant increase in our wafer supply and allocation in the coming year over what we've seen this year. and that's against the baseline where what we have this year is up meaningfully on last year as well. so it really -- it's very supportive of continued momentum and supportive of the strategic growth initiatives that we've talked about.
tore svanberg -- stifel -- analyst
sounds good. congrats, again.
john forsyth -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
next question from the line of ruben roy of westpark capital. your line is open.
ruben roy -- westpark capital -- analyst
thank you. thanks, guys, for taking my question. john, i wanted to follow up firstly on the laptop discussion you were having with tore. just kind of wanted to dig in a little bit more. in the shareholder letter, you're talking about particularly strong design momentum. you talked about getting into more tier one oems, etc. you also have some discussion about operating expenses going up as you're expanding your power-related products team. you've got the lion acquisition. it sounds like there's real need -- i would say, real-time need for new product and expansion into laptops. is this an area then kind of as you look out 12, 24 months, the laptop market as sort of a primary area for the power products? or is it going to be a mix between smartphones and laptops?
john forsyth -- president and chief executive officer
i think that's a really great question. but up until now, we've really talked about the laptop opportunity as being related to our audio products and the haptics products. but in particular, the lion acquisition and the technologies that come along with that focused on enabling really fast charging seem to have, for sure, a lot of relevance and appeal in the laptop market as well. so that -- the primary target for the lion products today has been the smartphone market.
part of that is just reflective of the fact that, that was a relatively small team. and so you can see our desire to invest in the power space to scale up to meet the demand that lion were seeing and we see for those fast charging solutions. initially, that revenue associated with power is going to be driven mostly by smartphones, but i do believe there are going to be significant opportunities in the laptop space for the power and charging solutions as well. i mean it's a very compelling idea to me. i would love -- i mean who wouldn't love to have a laptop to charge really quickly.
i think that's a very easy thing for a consumer to get their head around. so that will, in time, put us in a position of having a very compelling broad spread of content across audio haptics and power and charging targeting the laptop market to hopefully help continue our growth there.
ruben roy -- westpark capital -- analyst
okay. thanks for that. and as a quick follow-up, just on lion. i don't know too much about the company, but it seems like most of their revenues that you guys are expecting kind of over the next year coming from the android smartphone market. is that correct, number one. and number two, can you give us an idea of what the partial quarter of revenue contribution will be for the september quarter? thanks.
john forsyth -- president and chief executive officer
first of all, yes, you're right. the revenue is all driven by android devices there. and that's going to be the case to begin with, with the lion technologies. we haven't broken that out by quarter, but what we have said is that $60 million would be the rough contribution over the remainder of the fiscal year between deal closure and the end of the fiscal year, deal closed on july 20.
so you've got a couple of months of the present quarter and then the back half of the fiscal year to cover that $60 million. from the point of seasonality typically, typically lion's largest quarters are going to be the december and the march quarter, just given the nature of the customers that they're selling to. so you should be able to triangulate from that to something that's in the right ballpark.
ruben roy -- westpark capital -- analyst
right. got it. thanks, john.
john forsyth -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
thank you. next question from the line of blayne curtis of barclays. your line is open.
blayne curtis -- barclays -- analyst
hi, guys. thank you for taking my question. this is tom o'malley on for blayne curtis. thurman, in the release that you guys put out, you kind of talked about a gross margin trajectory into fiscal year '23 that's below your long-term rate. is that related to the new agreement with globfo? or can you talk about what's driving that gross margin profile down in the fiscal 23rd year?
thurman k. case -- chief financial officer and vice president, finance
well, i mean, we did mention in the letter that we've seen -- we are seeing supply constraints, and we are seeing increased prices, and we've talked about that for a while. as we move into -- as we get into fiscal year '22 for us, which is the beginning of the year, the costs associated are going to, and we expect to increase. and it's not just with one particular supply partner. i mean, this is across the board, and there's a lot of complexities in that.
and really, this was just a directional kind of comment that we wanted to make that our longer-term model has been 50%, and we've talked about that for a long time. and this can take us under that. but all of that said, we'll be working and doing things to maximize our margins, just as we always have. so that's pretty much where we are there.
blayne curtis -- barclays -- analyst
thanks. and then, john, not to beat a dead horse, but helpful on the $60 million that we saw before, but maybe that's just thurman as well. can you help us understand the cost profile? obviously, a pretty significant step up into the september quarter. i would expect with the addition of the new business, you see some ramp up there as well in december and march. can you help us kind of frame what the cost increases may look like from an opex perspective for the rest of the year due to lion?
john forsyth -- president and chief executive officer
yes. i'll let thurman add a little more color in a second, but just to paint the picture there. the lion team is about 35 folks, but we're also having -- experiencing a pretty significant revenue acceleration on their side. and so given the opportunities in front of them, we would like to -- we decided that we would like to expand our r&d in the power space, and we're able to have a really strong hiring period in addition to the lion acquisition.
so over the past few weeks, we've managed to bring in something close to 60 engineers focused on the power and charging space for us to help with that initiative, which is -- which we're really excited about. but that's the bulk of what you're seeing there in the cost step-up in the guidance we've given. i'll let thurman add a little more color.
thurman k. case -- chief financial officer and vice president, finance
yes. and to note on that, i mean $3.5 million of that was nonrecurring additional costs. so that's not a way to look at the run rate. you could take the guidance that we've shown and pulled that out. and we would expect, as we see a full quarter of these expenses, we should see a step up next quarter in overall opex and through the slight increases, but that's really what the primary of what's driving it is the increase in headcount and the cost associated with it.
blayne curtis -- barclays -- analyst
thanks for the tour, guys.
thurman k. case -- chief financial officer and vice president, finance
and we continue to invest beyond this. so the year is not over, and we'll continue to invest in product development.
operator
thank you. and next question from the line of ananda barowa of new capital. your line is open.
ananda barowa -- new capital -- analyst
hey. good afternoon, guys. thanks for taking the question. i apologize. i jumped on a few minutes after the call start. i was in another call. so this has actually been asked already. but is there an opportunity or can you frame the opportunity, potential opportunity for closed-loop controller technology in the android space going forward or at some point in the future?
john forsyth -- president and chief executive officer
you know, our initial opportunity around that has been in the custom silicon space. as you know. and we continue to see plenty of opportunity to enhance that and grow the feature set and grow value in that part of our business over time. and at this point, that's the major focus for us. and maybe in time, there are opportunities outside of that in the general market. but right now, we're just concentrating on the biggest opportunities in that space in front of us, and they're very much in the custom silicon today.
ananda barowa -- new capital -- analyst
that's really helpful. but is that also imply that nothing would necessarily precludes you in the future from going -- from entering the android space?
john forsyth -- president and chief executive officer
i wouldn't say nothing because we always have to make some pretty difficult choices about which opportunities we select relative to the pool of r&d resources we have, for example. but we're very excited by the path that we're on with that product in particular. -- it's obviously something that the team is incredibly proud to be a part of enabling such a compelling camera experience. and to see that over time, continue to grow in value and hopefully be as prominent in our customers' marketing and promotion as it has been to date would certainly help continue to drive our revenue and success.
ananda barowa -- new capital -- analyst
that's really helpful context. i appreciate that. and i guess just a quick follow-up is with regards to the guidance. and again, i apologize if this was addressed before i jumped on. but could you just talk about what the drivers, the incremental drivers of the guidance are? it's a really nice guide up. so i would just love to get the sort of the order of magnitude contributors to that. thanks.
john forsyth -- president and chief executive officer
yes. in particular, the guidance is reflective of us getting into the typically the strongest quarters of the year, ramping a lot of new content this year with our power conversion and control ic. and then obviously, going through the second cycle of our closed-loop controllers for the cameras, which as that moves into its second cycle is obviously going to be prevalent across more models represents more volume. and all of that adds up to a pretty large number just in that space alone.
in addition to that, as we've signaled, we have a very positive path of revenue momentum in android and in the laptop space as well. android is meaningfully up on last year. but admittedly, last year was not the strongest year for android across the board. the entire android market was all over the shop last year. so even if you compare it back to fy '20, our previous half -- the quarter we've just reported on is still up by about 30% relative to what we delivered in android there. so android still has pretty good momentum as well, and that's also still reflected in the guidance for the coming quarter.
ananda barowa -- new capital -- analyst
that's really helpful. i really appreciate it. thanks a lot.

next question from the line of matt ramsay of cowen. your line is open.
matt ramsay -- cowen -- analyst
yes. thank you. good afternoon, everyone. john, i apologize, there's a bunch of calls going on tonight. so if this is already asked, i apologize. i was pleased to see that you guys did the lion semi acquisition. i wonder if yourself or thurman might talk a little bit about the valuation that you were able to acquire the company for. i get the thesis around expanding ip and products that you can potentially leverage with your customers. but i was surprised anyone could buy anything for three times revenue in semis these days. so it'd be interesting to hear your perspectives on how that process went and the really attractive valuation you were able to buy the company for. thanks.
john forsyth -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, matt. yes, we also feel that the valuation is really solid relative to what the opportunity we see there is in both the near term and the long term. i mentioned they're on a great train from a revenue growth perspective. it's a really solid team that has built some very, very good customer relationships. so we're excited about that. the -- yes, the process of getting there, i guess, and getting to the valuation that everybody was happy with is always a complex stance. i think there was -- all sides recognize that it was a particularly good fit here.
there's a lot of complementarity between what we were doing and what the lion team was developing and bringing to market. thurman, i don't know if you've got any other particular color to add to that. it's difficult to get into real specifics of how we landed on that figure with the investors. but i think all parties got really, really positive by the opportunity. and we've had a very solid relationship with the lion team for a couple of years now, and they were certainly extremely excited to join up and become part of cirrus.
matt ramsay -- cowen -- analyst
thanks, john. appreciate it. i guess for my follow-up question, i know some folks had already asked on the call about gross margin in fiscal '23 that you guys outlined in the shareholder letter. i wonder if -- i know there's some products on the come and you guys haven't announced timing for some of those yet, but there's some work being done on 22-nanometer. there's also an increased shift in mix toward maybe non-smartphone opportunities and mixed signal. if you could just like walk us through maybe a little more detail on what's driving some of those margins? or is it all on the input cost side? is there no mix element to it? thanks.
john forsyth -- president and chief executive officer
it's really on the cost side, matt. the -- some of the movements we've seen over the past few quarters has been, as we've noted at the time more related to product mix. but anything new we have coming to market is broadly supportive of the corporate model. and if you're going to have margin challenges, obviously, the kind you would prefer to have is where you're working on costs because people don't want to buy your stuff.
we have a lot of demand for our products, but a fairly complex supply environment where we anticipate some continued headwinds that are taking us potentially below the 50 mark. so we wanted to get out in front of that and just message that to you. the demand side is very, very robust and the new products that we're bringing to market continue to be supportive of the overall business model -- the corporate model that we've set at.
matt ramsay -- cowen -- analyst
thanks very much for the details, john. appreciate it.
john forsyth -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.

next question from the line of duksan jang of sig. your line is open.
duksan jang -- sig -- analyst
hi. this is chris rolland, actually from sig. thurman, you talked about some supply constraints, are these with potentially your own supply chain? or are you looking kind of downstream or upstream. we had some comments last night about the handset supply chain and perhaps some constraints there, if you could elaborate at all, that would be great.
john forsyth -- president and chief executive officer
well, maybe i could jump in on that. when we talk about the constrained supply environment i would take that pretty simply. we could just sell more stuff than we are currently selling. if we could get more through foundries, get more to our sets and so on, but principally, it comes out a way to supply. chris, that's really the limiting factor on our sales.
and the way to think about that in relation to our customers is -- and the general shape of our business is when it comes to our largest customers and the major strategic relationships we have, we have -- we've put a lot of effort, and we have a very experienced team working on the long-range planning associated with that, securing capacity, working deeply with our customers and our foundry partners to ensure that we have everything we need for our biggest products, and our biggest customers.
the demand which we are working to supply as much as it can, but invariably, is how stripping wafer supply is more on the kind of short-term, relatively short spanning horizon parts of the business with a bunch of our other customers.
duksan jang -- sig -- analyst
understood. and john, while i have you, looking forward, call it one to three years or something like that. what are the products or the product categories that you're most excited about to drive incremental growth for cirrus here. and if there are new products that you haven't disclosed yet, could that be a driver as well? thanks.
john forsyth -- president and chief executive officer
we're very excited about a whole host of things on our road map, which for obvious reasons, i will really limit the amount of detail i share. but to give you the broad strokes, we really believe there's opportunity to continue with the success we've been having in the audio space in smartphones and expand that to other areas. i mentioned earlier in the call, just how receptive we found customers in the laptop market in particular to some of our audio and the haptic solutions. that will continue to drive the audio business for us.
we've seen good progress over the last year, especially in tablets as well and then in wearables. we have audio and other technologies in most of the ar/vr products that are out there. so if that market ever really catches fire, i think we'll be very well positioned. but alongside that, we are very, very excited about what we can do in the high-performance mix signal space. we've had notable success with the closed-loop controller but now we're bringing to market in the back half of this year in our power controlling -- conversion control, i see something that has meaningfully higher value on a pay as unit basis than the closed-loop controller, and that's something that we can build on.
so in the conversations we have with customers around that technology, there is a lot to do there. so we have a very big to-do list. we have more test ip and development, test vehicles and a very rich road map of products that i think bringing the lion team into the service picture has only added to that. they have a really compelling set of fast charging solutions.
i think being able to explore how that complements our product portfolio today and also the possibilities for integrating that with other products that we have as we go forward. it's really exciting. that's going to continue to grow our content with oems in the android space and with other parts of the general market, and that's going to be really positive from a revenue perspective.
duksan jang -- sig -- analyst
thanks, john.
operator
next question from the line of rick schafer of oppenheimer. your line is open.
rick schafer -- oppenheimer -- analyst
this is andy hummel on for rick. to start, i just want to touch on the annual growth guidance. it sounds like you guys are still expecting acceleration. i know last year -- or last quarter, you talked about acceleration for the year kind of on an organic basis. and now you're layering in buying, which my math is about a little over four points of growth.
that kind of puts you guys in a firm double-digit growth for the year, and it sounds like a lot of other things are going well on the android and laptop perspective. but could you guys just give any other color on how you're thinking about growth for the full year? and i'm sure wafer supply factors now that as well. but what other puts and takes are there that are factoring into that growth.
john forsyth -- president and chief executive officer
well, i think your summary was pretty spot on and actually the initial comment we made, which we reiterated in this quarter's commentary was that we're anticipating accelerated growth for the full fiscal year. so we have 7% growth in fiscal '21. we anticipate to be ahead of that for the full fiscal year '22. and we made that comment yes before we layered lion into that.
so we're still feeling very upbeat about that, even with some relatively conservative assumptions about the market. obviously, there's a lot of variables that we don't control. but from the point of view of your comments on the supply chain, any supply chain overhang on that. when we're guiding, we're really taking everything into account. so the guidance for the quarter reflects what we have confidence that we can supply and where we have most of the material for the quarter is obviously going to be implied by the time that we guided.
but then as we look further out, we feel on very firm footing with our foundry partners and the rest of our supply chain when it comes to making those comments about growth. we're in a great position. and then obviously, entering into a strategic supply agreement for -- with the foundry partner for wafer supply that represents a pretty significant chunk of our business gives us added confidence in the ability to grow next year given that, that's a significant step-up in our wafer allocation as we go into calendar '22.
rick schafer -- oppenheimer -- analyst
okay. great. that's really helpful. and then as we think about the ramp, the new power control ic with your biggest customer this fall, i think you mentioned in the past that it's not going to be included in full portfolio of the ramp. but is there any way to think about which models aren't going to include it? is it just the higher end? is it go thick or broader than that? is there any other color you can add on that product?
john forsyth -- president and chief executive officer
yes. i think the way to think about it is, ok, number one, if we did know when we wouldn't tell you because we don't disclose the details of customers' products and thoughts, but i said a couple of things, elsewhere, which i think i can hit on now. number one, that we think this is naturally a product, which will have a one-to-one relationship with the devices that it's in. and with phones, there's a reason for one being in every phone. it's about $1 each, and we're making a lot of them, which would be broadly consistent with the wanted one attach rate from the get-go.
rick schafer -- oppenheimer -- analyst
all right. great. thanks for taking my questions.
john forsyth -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
[operator instructions]. next question from the line of rajvindra gill of needham. your line is open.
rajvindra gill -- needham -- analyst
yes. thank you and congratulations on the acquisition of lion. i think that's a really good acquisition. just staying on that business, wondering if you could give us a sense in terms of its historical growth rate. you had mentioned for lion that it's going to generate about $60 million. you mentioned that there's a lot of business there that the ramp is accelerating.
any sense of terms to what it was historically? and how do we think about that ramp going into the next calendar year? what is going to be the main driver, is it mainly going to be increasing the attach rates of these power ics in the android market? or is it going to be expansion outside of android.
john forsyth -- president and chief executive officer
yes. so first of all, i'm not sure the historic growth rate is especially meaningful given they're a pretty small company that has been a very recent rapid growth in the fast charging market. so obviously, the gradient of that curve looks incredible. but if you took that and drew a straight line on it forever, that would be normal. so really, just over the past 1.5 years, they've seen -- or a couple of years, they've seen an incredible acceleration of demand -- and that's really driven by the fact that, especially at the higher end of android devices, there's a lot of competitive differentiation around the speed of phone charging and the user experience that goes along.
so in the coming year, i would say that, that is still going to be driving most of the revenue and design wins for the products that the lion team developed, it's -- there's still plenty of headroom in the android market for continuing that momentum alongside which we, of course, want to be developing products and taking the solutions to the market. so we think the technologies are pretty relevant. and what i mean by that is that speed of charging and the amount of power that's going into the battery is still increasing meaningfully and still is going to go through a period where it's stepping up higher and higher, and that drives the demand for higher value content.
so if you look across the products that lion is selling into and the kind of tiers of value associated with entry level and mid-tier and flagship level fast charging, it can be anything from $0.50 right up to $2.50 say a device at the top end of kind of differentiated, very fast charging. so the targets and the performance bar at that top end is going to continue to move. so the primary goal will be to continue to serve that and to capture as much of that value as possible. and alongside that, as we've said, that we believe there are really great opportunities in other battery device spaces such as laptops and beyond as well.
rajvindra gill -- needham -- analyst
and thurman, last quarter, there was discussion around the lead times being different for the camera controller versus the other components like the smart codec. and then the lead times for the camera controllers were shorter, and that caused a difference in terms of timing of revenue, which led to some differences relative to past seasonality. i'm wondering how we're thinking about the lead times for camera versus smart kodak in the september guide?
thurman k. case -- chief financial officer and vice president, finance
well, i think what we talked about last quarter is it was a different supply chain route. so we normally sell into the contract manufacturer directly, with the camera controllers we sell into a module maker who then sells that module in. so for us, it was an adjustment period of understanding what those -- what that process looks like. we would recognize revenue as we sold it into the module maker and -- but that timing didn't always match up nor did the flow or the orders that we're seeing and the backlog that you were seeing.
and that's all that we've said. we're getting more -- we've gotten more comfortable with it. we understand this much better as we're working through the process. and so i wouldn't write anything into that. we think that that's not really going to change a lot of what you see from our results this year.
rajvindra gill -- needham -- analyst
okay, great. appreciate it. thank you.
operator
thank you. next question from the line of tore svanberg of stifel. sir, your line is open.
tore svanberg -- stifel -- analyst
yeah. thank you. john, i just had a follow-up on lion and just kind of trying to understand the market opportunity. so you mentioned fast charging. my understanding, a lot of their businesses is in wireless charging. and i assume that their products are mainly in the device itself and not in the adapter where obviously, right now, there's a big move toward gan. so if you could just elaborate on the market opportunity that would be great.
john forsyth -- president and chief executive officer
right. yes. and you've got it absolutely right there, tore. gan is appropriate for the world side. it's not appropriate for the phone side or the device side charging technology for a whole host of reasons. but the switch gap architecture that lion have on their seamless devices is the kind of leading edge of what you see in fast charging for smartphones today, and that can be used in conjunction with either wired or wireless tracking. wire charging is clearly more efficient.
the efficiency metric on the whole is one of the key things about these products because if you look at what's the limiting -- what's the rate limiting factor for the speed at which you charge mobile device, one of the most critical things is heat dissipation, it's the thermal budget that you have to work with. if you have very efficient power conversion then you're generating less heat, i mean you can put more power into the battery for a given thermal budget is one of the things where lion has demonstrated leadership is in the efficiency of its charging technologies, and that also matters a lot in the wireless space as well, which is kind of inherently less efficient. but again, something where the speed efficiency trade-off with lion's technology is very attractive.
tore svanberg -- stifel -- analyst
got it. thank you, john.
john forsyth -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
[operator instructions]. there are no further questions. i would now like to turn the call over to chelsea heffernan.
chelsea heffernan -- director of investor relations
thank you, operator. there are no additional questions, so i'll turn the call back to john.
john forsyth -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, chelsea. so in summary, in the june quarter, we significantly increased sales in smartphones, laptops and other products, while also making great progress on several of our longer-term strategic initiatives. those included the ramping of our power conversion control ic and the acquisition of lion semiconductor. we expect these initiatives to drive growth of our high performance mix signal business, diversify the range of products that we offer and meaningfully expand our addressable market.
with a strong pipeline of audio and high-performance mixed signal products ramping in the coming months, we continue to anticipate accelerated revenue growth in fiscal year '22. i would also like to note that we will be participating in conferences hosted by keybanc and oppenheimer this quarter. please check our investor website for the details. if you have any questions that were not addressed today, you can submit them to us by the ask the ceo section of our investor website. and i'd like to thank everyone for participating in the call today. goodbye.

operator
ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. welcome to the cirrus logic second quarter fiscal year 2022 financial results q&a session. [operator instructions] as a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.
i would now like to turn the conference call over to mr. thurman case, chief financial officer. mr. case, you may begin.
thurman k. case -- chief financial officer and vice president, finance
thank you and good afternoon. joining me on today's call is john forsyth, cirrus logic's chief executive officer; and chelsea heffernan, our vice president of investor relations.
today, we announced our financial results for the second quarter fiscal year 2022 at approximately 4:00 pm eastern. the shareholder letter discussing our financial results, the earnings press release, including a reconciliation of non-gaap financial information to the most directly comparable gaap information, along with the webcast of this q&a session are all available at the company's investor relations website at investor.cirrus.com. this call will feature questions from the analysts covering our company, as well as questions submitted to us via email at investor@cirrus.com.
please note that during this session, we may make projections and other forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from projections. by providing this information, the company expressly disclaims any obligation to update or revise any projections or forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new developments or otherwise. please refer to the press release and shareholder letter issued today, which are available on the cirrus logic website and the latest form 10-k, as well as other corporate filings made with the securities [phonetic] and exchange commission for additional discussion of risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from current expectations.
now i will turn the call over to john.
john forsyth -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, thurman. before we discuss our results, i would like to make a few comments on today's announcement that thurman is planning to retire from his position as chief financial officer. i want to take this opportunity to thank thurman for his outstanding dedication and commitment to cirrus logic over the past 21 years. all of us here greatly appreciate his many contributions to the company's growth and to the development of a world-class finance organization during his nearly 14-year tenure as cfo. thurman will remain in his current role while we conduct a comprehensive search to identify his successor and will work to help ensure a seamless transition to that successor in due course. i want to thank thurman sincerely from all of us at cirrus logic and wish him all the very best in his next chapter.
in other news, before we get to the quarter's results, i'd also like to say how excited we are to have recently welcomed raghib hussain to the company's board of directors. raghib has a deep knowledge of the semiconductor industry, strong technical expertise and a track record of both operational and strategic success. we believe he will be an extremely valuable addition to the cirrus logic team as we look to continue our growth momentum through innovation in mixed-signal products and expansion into new technologies and markets.
turning to the results now. cirrus logic reported record revenue and earnings per share in the second quarter, while also delivering year-over-year operating profit growth. revenue was $465.9 million, up 34% year-over-year and our highest ever for the september quarter, due in large part to the ramping of components ahead of customers' new smartphone launches. during the quarter, we also made great progress on the strategy that we've outlined to diversify meaningfully beyond audio passing, as we did, several major milestones in the high-performance mixed-signal products area of our business.
these included increasing the attach rate of our camera controllers in smartphones, bringing a new power conversion and control ic to market, and sampling new fast-charging products to our general market customers. these accomplishments represent a significant expansion of cirrus logic's technology and product mix, with our high-performance mixed-signal business delivering 30% of total revenue in the first half of fiscal '22, up 117% from just a year ago.
as we discussed in the shareholder letter published on our website today, we continue to be very excited about the opportunities these new technologies offer for further growth and diversification in the future. before we begin the q&a, i would also like to note that while we understand there is intense interest related to our largest customer, in accordance with our policy, we do not discuss specifics about our business relationship.
operator, we are now ready to take questions.

thank you. [operator instructions] and the first question comes from the line of matt ramsay of cowen. your line is now open.
matt ramsay -- cowen -- analyst
thank you very much. good afternoon everybody. first off, thurman congrats. it's been great to work with you down the years and all the best going forward. for my -- i guess my first question -- john, congrats to the whole team on getting lion semi closed. i wanted to pick your brain a bit, if you think about your current power ic roadmap and the technology and the people that you'd be acquiring from lion that are now within the company, how -- can you ballpark for us what kind of integration efforts might be underway to bring those two product lines together and what kind of timeline could we look at as sort of a minimum and then i guess a realistic timeline of when you could have product in market that would be fully integrated between the two companies? thanks.
john forsyth -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, matt. yeah, i'll try to talk to that. i want to explain that some of the way we think about this is that we really want to give more ammunition to the lion team and help them build out their roadmap and expand across customers and into other new markets as rapidly as possible. of course, integration is a goal because we believe the technology that the lion team have developed can be highly complementary to other things we're doing. but actually the first priority is execute on pretty significant raft of opportunities they have in front of them. the second priority is continue to expand that and accelerate the roadmap. and then the third priority is exploit the synergies between those technologies and other areas of our business.
so right now, clearly lion -- the team there has seen a lot of interest within certain smartphone vendors. they are running extremely fast to execute on that and then continue to expand it because that's still a market that has some ways to go in terms of rising expectations and demands on performance. so we're excited about that, but then we also believe that there are other product categories that can benefit from that charging technology.
now -- so all of that's by way of saying our initial focus is really just helping the lion team execute, scale up a bit and service more of the demand that they have in front of them and we're really -- it's an amazing group of people that we got there. we're super excited to be doing that and then increasingly we do see, further down the road, opportunities for synergies between the lion technology and some of the other ip that we've been working on. i think we haven't laid out a timeline for that yet, but that's something we're very excited about internally, just to give you a little bit of flavor for that. we really believe that having the opportunity to innovate simultaneously, both in the charge path and the discharge path around the batteries, really being able to deliver the silicon that sits around the battery can deliver great value to our customers' products in due course.
the lion ip and technology clearly represents the charge path of that and then a lot of what we've been doing elsewhere is more focused on the discharge path. so it's highly complementary. it will take a good while to actually converge, given the number of opportunities that the team is addressing in the near term.

now, i really appreciate all the color there, john. as a quick follow-up, it's been topical over the last six, nine months that in certain portions of the notebook market and that audio codecs from some other suppliers have been a bottleneck and you guys have called out in the letter and maybe on the -- i think on the last earnings call as well, opportunities for cirrus to grow into the notebook market i guess. so maybe you could help me quantify how large those opportunities may be in the next six, 12, 18 months. and, john, do you consider that strategic business or opportunistic business and how are you investing there? thanks.
john forsyth -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, that's a great question. thank you, matt. the nature of the comments in the letter were actually intended to tease apart the opportunistic and the strategic elements to it because it's a bit of both. and i think when we talked about seeing revenue grow in our laptop engagements, there was a -- there is a little bit of the reaction that, yeah, well, the supply chain disruption created opportunistic situations where that could occur, which, to be clear, has been true to date, but there are also some meaningful underlying factors that are strategic for us. so we've picked up a reasonable amount of codec business, especially over this year. we'll continue to build on that. i think there are reasons why a number of those customers will want to continue using our technology. we tend to be fairly difficult to dislodge once we get in somewhere. but the underlying factors, which is actually what we were shooting for originally, of a transition more toward boosted amplifiers, a transition toward potentially haptic trackpads and the kind of growing requirements around audio and video, those were the things that we saw happening with or without any covid-related supply chain disruption.
so those represent a decent opportunity for us to continue to grow. our estimate of that over the next five years is that, that looks like something along the lines of the $400 million sam for us to tilt at. so that's focused on the segments where we would play. it would tend to be at the upper end of the notebook market, it would tend to be the devices, which we're really focused on, premium performance, on being stand [phonetic] and having very high power efficiency and so on. but given that we see opportunities across audio, maybe haptics, maybe power in those segments, it means the total asp per device -- the total content per device may actually be pretty significant and that's reflected in that sam.

next question from the line of tore svanberg of stifel. your line is open.
tore svanberg -- stifel, nicolaus & company -- analyst
yes, thank you. and, yeah, let me echo -- say congratulations to thurman, going to miss you. and since this may be your last earnings call, you will get the first question, thurman. so could you elaborate a little bit on the $255 million payment for globalfoundries? how is it going to work out as far as securing the actual capacity? i mean, is this a one-time payment and then what do you get in return?
thurman k. case -- chief financial officer and vice president, finance
well, i mean, essentially there were two pieces of this. we paid $225 million of the capacity reservation and wafer supply commitment and $175 million of that was pre-payments for wafers. further out in history -- actually [indecipherable] forward and it will -- that will last through '26 and then there was a $50 million of a reservation fee and that will be amortized over the life of the contract. so that's how those will show up. in addition to that, during the quarter, we exercised an option for a new technology, which essentially resulted in a $10 million more of non-refundable capacity reservation and $20 million more pre-payment. so -- and this was a technology that we did not have visibility when we -- it was part of the first agreement, and as we got more visibility for the opportunities associated with this, we decided to take that option. and by the way, this type of investment will see revenue quite a ways down the line. so this isn't going to be something you would see immediately.
tore svanberg -- stifel, nicolaus & company -- analyst
great, thank you for that color. and maybe as a follow-up to john and kind of related to that agreement, obviously, you're trying to drive the high-performance mixed-signal business much higher and you mentioned moving to the 22-nanometer node. is this related to that or, to thurman's point, does this go beyond that?
john forsyth -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, no, i would think of those two things as being separate, tore. the 22-nanometer investment that we have been making, and you're right, has been going to quite some time and is pretty well advanced. so there isn't really additional technology enablement fees that we envisage relating to that. there will be a place for 22-nanometer, we believe, in both our audio and our high-performance mixed-signal business areas. so it kind of cuts across those two. the additional fees and technology enablement investment that we made with global, that thurman's referring to, is outside of that, it's not related to 22-nanometer. it's related to some other technology, which would serve products in the high-performance mixed-signal area for us. that was something where, as thurman says, at any one time, we've got a bunch of new opportunities we're working on, that should represent some sam expansion for us.
one of them was kind of -- we were working on it during the time we were cutting that agreement with global but it wasn't something that we felt we'd landed. so -- but it was a significant opportunity for further diversification and revenue growth. so we kind of put a provision in the agreement for it and then obviously much more recently activated that, given that we got more confidence and line of sight over the -- our ability to win that opportunity and then go ahead and execute on product related to it. but that's in a new area that's not covered by the 22-nanometer commentary we've previously provided.
tore svanberg -- stifel, nicolaus & company -- analyst
great, thank you for that. just one last question. could you talk a little bit now about the attach rate of the camera controller? i mean are we talking about sort of one for one? and as you mentioned next generation in this area, should we expect sort of like new devices every year or is it more every two years? any color there would be great.
john forsyth -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, thank you for the question, tore. i don't think we know for sure what the cadence is going to be around the camera device updates. i think -- and i say that because if you look across our other product lines, the cadence varies over time, like when you go through a period of accelerated innovation, then it can be a fairly rapid evolution and then it can stabilize for a while. in the case of the camera investment we've be making, to date, it -- really what we've seen is a growing attach rate based on the same solution from us. but as i've indicated elsewhere, we've got a really good roadmap and a really solid amount of investment across innovations in that area and i think it's a reasonable expectation here. we don't want to talk in detail about our customers' product plans. but i'm on fairly safe ground, given that for the most part, i don't know them in relation to this area. but i think if you look at what we are planning to do and what we're investing in, i think you'll probably see some kind of pattern whereby we're bringing in increased functionality of the top end and then there is some mix of those devices in -- across the products over time.
the attach rate, obviously, on this cycle has risen. and that's been really very positive for us. it again has been one of the drivers of that growth in high-performance mixed-signal revenue that we've seen which is very important for the company. and then also just if you look at the total content that we see across some products now at the upper end of that, there are smartphones in the market now with eight of our products in them, so, four of which are high-performance mixed-signal category products, and four which are audio category products. so that's a really, really positive trend from the point of view of driving that increased product diversity and technology diversity. obviously, in the long run, we want to continue that path and diversify the revenue as it grows as much as we can.
tore svanberg -- stifel, nicolaus & company -- analyst

next question from the line of blayne curtis of barclays. your line is open.
blayne curtis -- barclays capital -- analyst
thanks for taking my question. offer my congrats to you as well, thurman. maybe just first, i wanted to ask, if you look at the revenue outside your largest customer, it's about $50 million. i think that's around the level that you were talking about for lion. so just kind of curious how that came in post the acquisition. and i'm kind of just curious, as you look at that bucket, you have a lot of moving pieces outside your largest customer now. i think there's a lot of thoughts that there may be -- the android handset market might be a little weaker at the end of the year. i think people are looking for things like pcs and tablets to be a little softer, but then you have all these new wins and i know, as someone mentioned on prior call, that the audio codecs been short so you might have some opportunities. i wonder if you could just balance all those as you look outside your largest customer and any perspective into the end of the fiscal year would be very helpful.
john forsyth -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. thank you, blayne. obviously, we guide for the current quarter. when we look out to the end of the fiscal year, i mean, it feels this year, more than most, it feels like an awful long time between now and march. so there is a lot of uncertainty there. i would say the biggest thing going on -- we've got great design momentum. i think we have a stronger and more diverse relationships across android and other parts of our business outside of smartphones than we've had in recent years. the biggest factor weighing on those areas really is supply. so that's -- we're still comparatively constrained. i think we've commented elsewhere that where we work with customers on a longtime horizon, we are in a very strong position from a supply point of view, but a lot of the android demand over the past year has being a lot more erratic. so we're kind of very much focused on the upper end of the market there, making sure we can service those sockets and we could probably grow the business faster if we could grow the wafer supply. that's a fairly universal challenge right now.
blayne curtis -- barclays capital -- analyst
thanks. and then maybe the follow-up, maybe the harder one to ask, but your largest customer was talking about constraints having -- impacting their -- shipments of their products. kind of just curious, is there a way you can talk about seasonality and are you also -- as you look to december, are any kind of constraints prohibiting what you can ship in that quarter? and then does that translate into any kind of different seasonality for march?
john forsyth -- president and chief executive officer
right. i think that's a great question on the seasonality actually, blayne. i would say when it comes to our own constraints, this kind of falls into the category i just referred to that that's an area of our business where we tend to be very focused on the long-term collaborative planning with the customer. so we've generally been in a very good position to execute against some pretty phenomenal production ramps that we've been seeing and we've obviously got a lot of volume through the end of the year -- this year. so it's not really any different from the way it has been in the past where we've encountered our challenges as typically being in the areas with shorter planning horizons as i've said.
regarding how that maps on to seasonality, i would say that that's where, for us, even to the point of guidance being challenging here, we see very strong demand, but there is volatility in how the servicing of that demand gets scheduled because we've been -- our long-term planning with our customer, our long-term planning with the supply chain has really stood us in excellent stead as has our investment in capacity agreements at the supply chain level. but if there are other suppliers to our customers, who those customers depend on, who are gating or who are constrained, that can just mean that some of our material is subject to rescheduling as a consequence of that.
in a quarter like the present one -- so a couple of comments about that. in a quarter like the present one, it does mean you have so much material here in any one given week, a small amount of rescheduling across the boundary could have a pretty major impact. but it also would appear, and this would be consistent with what you've heard on earnings calls last week, that the fact that there are some constraints in the present quarter is certainly teeing up strong demand for the first quarter next year. so we're obviously not guiding that, but the signals that we've been getting so far have been that our customers are very keen to maximize the amount of material they can get during that first calendar quarter as well. so that may actually have a -- something of an impact along the lines of what i think you're getting at there.
blayne curtis -- barclays capital -- analyst

next question from the line of christopher rolland of sig. your line is open.
christopher rolland -- susquehanna international group -- analyst
thanks guys for the question, and congrats, thurman. i really enjoyed working with you. so i guess now that you guys have integrated lion, can you talk about perhaps a quarterly contribution that you see, but also the growth rate that we might expect going forward? and conversely, should we think about a growth rate for your organic power business or power products as well?
john forsyth -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. thank you. we haven't broken out growth rate specifically for those areas. i think the way to think about lion on a quarterly contribution basis would be, to date, it's been in line with what we expected and we talked about something of the order of $60 million contribution during the remainder of the fiscal year from deal close to fiscal year end. we still believe that we're tracking to that and they were, and i think we talked about this last time out, themselves -- they were on a relatively steep growth path. they had a lot of momentum within their customer base. so, i think certainly over the next year or two, we're excited about what can happen with that part of our business even if we're not necessarily breaking out the individual growth rate.
the growth rate in the rest of our power business right now would frankly look completely meteoric, given that it was pretty much zero until a few months ago, and now we've got a one to one attach rate with one of the best products on the planet. so i think that's obviously going to stabilize a bit, but what i would say is that, that represents a couple of things for us. one is just a really big tangible step in the direction that we've been talking about of diversifying really meaningfully the technology areas where we have proven expertise and leadership. and i think that can really help the business long term, as well as, obviously, the revenue contribution that we see today. but also that is really the first step in a whole series of things that we want to accomplish there and there is a pretty well-stocked pipeline of ideas and ip and test vehicles, which we're investing in to kind of continue to grow that. so much as -- i'm not putting a number on it, we -- you'll be able to see from our comments that we're very excited about where that can take us in the medium term.
christopher rolland -- susquehanna international group -- analyst
okay. and i guess kind of tying into this as well, can you talk about opportunities that you have captured in phones today for some of these products, including your power product, but also things around cameras and the possibility to broaden into new devices as well, whether they be tablets or laptops or perhaps some other devices?
john forsyth -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, absolutely. so when you look at, in particular, those areas you talked about, which constitute a lot of our high-performance mixed-signal business, so on the camera side. obviously, that's focused on smartphones right now. we've seen a growth in the attach rate. i think that what we're doing there is highly applicable to other products that contain cameras. obviously, what we are doing is kind of stabilization and focus-related. we've talked about that elsewhere. so any -- it'd typically be a camera that moves around, rather than one that's fixed somewhere. so we'd certainly like to find ways of expanding that -- the reach of that technology into other products. in the power space, so we launched during the quarter, the power conversion and control ic that's in a recently launched flagship smartphone. so there's one of those pad device right now that's custom silicon, obviously, and we are very focused as a team on serving our biggest customer, first and foremost, and kind of continuing to execute on that is priority number one for the team.
but it's also clear from everything we're saying that we're making a lot of investment in this area and we really believe we can be innovative around the battery. so that certainly represents a a great opportunity to broaden and expand our business. and i think you can certainly think some of the other devices that you mentioned such as tablets and laptops and so on could certainly be places we would seek to land some of that technology as well.

next question from the line of ananda baruah of loop capital. your line is open.
ananda baruah -- loop capital -- analyst
hey, thanks guys, good afternoon, for taking the questions. congrats on the strong results and, thurman, congrats as well, certainly. two, if i could. one may have [phonetic] to be a clarification. but in the shareholder letter, when you guys spoke about accelerating -- in the laptop space, accelerating ahead of your strategic objectives, is that a general comment or is that what you're sort of seeing as we go through the fall here? would love to get context there. and then i have a quick follow-up as well.
john forsyth -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, ananda. that comment relates specifically to the growth in our laptop business and what we're communicating there is that when we set out to engage customers in the laptop space, outside of our largest customer, where we already had business, we were principally focused on what we see as an emerging opportunity to sell boosted amplifiers into those devices. those devices are getting thinner and thinner, they are moving from an hda-based architecture to a soundwire-based architecture. all of that means that they are going, in some regards, to look a lot more like smartphones architecturally than they have in the past. and so it's a very close adjacency for us. we've got a huge investment in boosted amplifiers for smartphones, really well-established leadership there. and so we formulated a plan to go after that market.
that's really where those strategic objectives lie that we referred to there. it just happened that as we started engaging customers with that, they responded very enthusiastically, but also were very keen to get a supply in codecs and, in fact, had some more accelerated interest in haptic trackpads than we were expecting. so there were more moving pieces in a positive sense there than we were initially anticipating and that's what we're communicating. so that -- it's been moving quickly for us to the point where, as of today, were designed into four out of the five largest notebook oems and we expect to see a fairly steady stream of new devices containing cirrus logic content in that category come to market over the next year.
ananda baruah -- loop capital -- analyst
that's great. and is this something that you believe could become fairly meaningful over time than the incremental opportunity that you see?
john forsyth -- president and chief executive officer
i would put it as, it's definitely going to be a really solid addition, i think, or has the potential to be a really solid addition to our overall revenue. and it's an area where we can really leverage the investment that we've made in audio technology for smartphones. in terms of magnitude, the investment that we were making and the opportunity we see around the power and charging and battery space is going to be more significant for us long-term.
ananda baruah -- loop capital -- analyst
understood. and then just my follow-up quickly is, just when we look out over the next handful of years, and this is not asking for a guidance, but just anecdotally, so we can all calibrate our expectations directionally, should -- can you remind us what our expectation for margin should be, gross margin, operating margin? and should we expect some expansion in the coming years? and that's it for me. i appreciate it.
john forsyth -- president and chief executive officer
so, our gross margin target is -- our model target is 50% gross margin. we believe that, that level is really important in order to fund the kind of r&d and innovation that we bring to our customers. so we continue to shoot for that or better as we bring new products to market. i think the -- any potential expansion of that, we haven't communicated anything around that. i think that's -- that will require more market diversity than we have today, given the economics of the markets that we're in are pretty well-established and understood. but i have been clear elsewhere that i think a lot of the investment that we've been making in the high-performance mixed-signal space, both organically and through the acquisition of lion and so on, are really important stepping stones to being able to broaden our market reach into other product categories. and so that may open the door to it, but we've really not communicated anything about longer-term gross margin expectations.

next question from the line of rajvindra gill of needham. your line is open.
rajvindra gill -- needham & company -- analyst
yes, thank you, and congrats on strong execution in light of the very, kind of, volatile environment. and i echo my congratulations to thurman, best of luck. thurman, if i could just start with you, just on the gross margin, a follow-up to the previous question, i think in the last earnings call, you mentioned that the gross margins are expected to kind of remain stable in the near term. but you're at sort of lower -- slightly lower in fiscal year '23 on pricing pressure. so i just wanted to get an update on your view on kind of that commentary in fiscal year '23. obviously, broadly, semiconductors are experiencing price increases across a lot of components, given the constraints that's existing. so i just wanted to understand the pricing dynamic.
john forsyth -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, i'm going to step in on that there. i think, i recognize what you're saying about the overall market environment. we've seen costs increase during this year for us across a number of areas of the supply chain, and we'll see further cost increases as we go into the new calendar year. clearly, our goal is to offset those increased costs, both through working hard on the supply chain side and through price updates to our customers. obviously, we've got some pretty unique products and our customers really depend on us for innovation and for world-class engineering execution, and we require solid gross margins to support the kind of investment that's required to deliver that. and i think our customers understand that.
so today, our team is focused on working very closely, both across our entire supply chain base and across all our customers in order to minimize the impacts of those cost increases to our gross margins. so that has to be balanced a little with the fact that we cultivate and build really deep long-term relationships with our customers. so we've obviously got to ensure that we seek to offset our costs in a way that's fair and it preserves the relationships with the customers and is consistent with us managing the business for the long term because that's what we do.
but taken all those things together, we'll continue to work on pricing with our customers. the way pricing updates go, they don't necessarily sync perfectly with cost increases and that can lead to a bit of volatility around gross margin. and when you take all of that together, we felt it was appropriate to signal that we may -- we're likely to dip below the model target in fy '23. but we're very focused on preserving the gross margins and the gross margin target that we've laid out in our model and we believe is a reasonable one and an important one for the health of the business.
rajvindra gill -- needham & company -- analyst
okay. yeah, thank you for that information. and just one, a follow-up on the globalfoundries deal. thanks for the breaking [phonetic] of the different components. but wondering how the capacity addition that you're getting from gf with the pre-payments that you made for the wafers. are you -- that amount of supply, the capacity you're getting, is that enabling you to feel comfortable about kind of your growth rate going into next year? i'm just trying to balance the near-term capacity that you're getting from gf relative to your ability to support your top customer, but as well as expand into some of these other growth areas like tablets and wearables and with lion as well. the pre-payments that you've made, that you've gotten for the wafers, is that going to impact the capacity situation in calendar '22?
john forsyth -- president and chief executive officer
in calendar '22, yes, it will. we expect during calendar '22 that additional capacity will be coming onstream as a consequence of the -- some of the investment that global has been making on the back of the kind of partnerships that we put in place with them. this year is, of course, more of the case where that capacity hasn't really expanded yet. so we are able to serve our biggest customers by virtue of long-term planning. could we sell more if we could get more wafers? absolutely. and could we sell more next year if global could expand their capacity faster? yes, absolutely. but at the same time, we are through that deal, putting ourselves in a position where we have greater wafer supply, quite meaningfully a larger number of wafers during next calendar year relative to this year and that supports -- that would be supportive of a healthy amount of business growth.
now -- yeah, to your point, there may be areas of our business which could expand more rapidly if we are able to get more supply. but i think we are in a good spot relative to the actual capacity that exists in the industry until that starts to expand.

david williams -- the benchmark company -- analyst
hey, thanks, guys. thanks for letting me ask the question and congrats on the quarter and congratulations to thurman there. so quickly, just wanted to ask maybe from a mix management perspective, you talked about constraints earlier. is there any part of the margin maybe that's benefiting from mix management as you think about selling your products on the limited basis if you have available to you?
john forsyth -- president and chief executive officer
well, the bulk of our products by value in terms of share of our overall revenue are going to be driven by the unit sales of the -- our largest customers' products. so we don't really have a role to play in terms of managing the mix of that. we are just focused on supporting our customer getting as many devices as there is -- as is humanly possible. there are other parts of our business where we are -- we've been able to adjust pricing and obtain capacity increases and drive fairly high margin returns on those devices. but that's comparatively small volume and small amounts of revenue for us. so it doesn't really move the needle in the overall scheme of things for us. the most important thing for us really is getting as much capacity as we can, focused on the products of our largest customers because that's really where the bulk of our revenue is tied up.
david williams -- the benchmark company -- analyst
sure, thanks for that. and is there maybe a way to quantify your customer diversification as we kind of think about the lion products coming in and maybe the diversification efforts that you have? how do you think about that diversity as you look out maybe a year or two versus where you are today in terms of your mix of customers?
john forsyth -- president and chief executive officer
that's a great question. i think this is a part of the story where because our -- we have so much of a successful business and a growing business with our largest customer based around their largest selling products that it can kind of overshadow the progress we've been making elsewhere to some extent. i alluded earlier in the call to the fact that we went from close to a standing start to having multiple products in design with four out of the five top notebook oems. we're in three out of the top five tablet oems now, with two out of the top three truly wireless oems, and all of those were in flight prior to the lion acquisition and lion certainly brings us additional products that we can leverage to increase diversity, both in revenue terms and engage new customers. so i think there is a path there that we're on, which is a very encouraging story and one that we'll continue to grow as we reach beyond audio and drive more high-performance mixed-signal growth with -- in the general market as well.

vivek arya -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
thanks for taking my question, and best wishes to thurman from my side as well. i had two questions. first one, john, what are your sales from the non-smartphone tablet market right now and where do you think they can head to over the next one to two years?
john forsyth -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, we don't break that out, vivek. so it's comparatively small relative to -- are you asking specifically tablets? [speech overlap] that's healthy but comparatively small part of our business relative to the smartphone contribution.
vivek arya -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
i see. and for the second one, balance sheet is still strong, but when i look at the payment to the foundry, your cash balance will be under $300 million exiting the december quarter, if my model is right. is that a comfortable range for you since you typically like to operate at higher levels of cash? so any puts and takes would be very helpful as we model the cash, and if there is any need for financing, etc., going forward.
thurman k. case -- chief financial officer and vice president, finance
sure. well, basically, we would say that $200 million to run our operations and manage our operations over a period of time is an area where, as long as we're at that level or above, we're comfortable. we did see that the cash dropped, that the last quarter reflected our deal with lion and also then included in this quarter's numbers will be the global foundry deal. so you're not going to see us building it, but we have really, really strong cash flow. we have no need for financing at this point in time. we may go -- we have that need if we go down the road of m&a or some things like that, but for running our business right now, we're fine. we won't draw on our revolver or need financing. and you will see, as we move through the end of this year, the march quarter and the december quarter are much -- are our highest generation for cash. so you will see us start moving back up toward the end of the fiscal year.

hi, guys. my congrats as well on the results and to you as well, thurman. just one question for me on haptics. there has been sort of a lot of talk lately about this metaverse and movement to a digital world. i'm curious, john, how we should be thinking about that opportunity for cirrus as it relates to haptics or maybe elsewhere, potentially things like full-haptic body suits and things like that. i'd be curious if you're investing in new products for these opportunities there, if there's anything you'd like to comment on for your haptics opportunity there and timeline for when those opportunities might hit, that'd be great. thanks.
john forsyth -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. thank you, derek. that's a really interesting question. i think our expectations, unit-wise, are very modest there, but we are actively engaged with a lot of the folks who are blazing trails in this area. so i think we've commented elsewhere that we have a great track record of engagement and being designed into most of the ar and vr equipment that's been on the market to date. we continue to talk to those customers about both audio, haptic and certain other areas really as a -- yeah, as a long-term bet. i think it could take a long time before we're all wearing haptic suits, but i'm also a big believer. from a haptic perspective, for example, i think haptics have the potential to make the virtual objects real. so it really does seem like it has a role to play in that particular kind of user experience. so we have some very cool technology around haptics. i think we have the right customer relationships. i think our expectations are that it's a long road there but we feel that it's an interesting one to keep a certain amount of investment and engagement focused on.

thank you very much guys for letting me jump back in for a follow-up. hopefully it's a quick one but it's something that i do get asked about. so on the last call, you guys sort of talked about this 50% up gross margin target and you just reiterated it may dip a little bit below that in fiscal '23. but there's three things kind of going on at the same time, right? there is the broad-based foundry industry raising prices, there is the gf deal for wafers that you guys are doing, and then there is the integration of lion. and i just wanted to explicitly ask if the new gross margin targets that you guys have talked about over the last couple of quarters incorporate all three of those. i guess it's just somewhere in the investor bases there might be another shoe to drop. i don't think there is, but i just wanted to clarify. thank you very much.

right. thank you, matt. yeah, the commentary that we provided last quarter is pretty much identical i think to what we reiterated this quarter. and so even though, as you point out, a couple of more cards got turned over during that period. so at this point, what we're messaging around gross margin there is it fully embraces everything we know and everything we think about the current environment and what we can see about the coming fiscal year. so from our perspective, 2021 feels like a crazy year to say, hey, there is no other shoe to drop. but from our perspective, we're really embracing all the information we have there and that obviously includes everything you just alluded to. so yes, i think that answers your question. but let me just check that i don't need to clarify.
matt ramsay -- cowen -- analyst
no, no, john, perfect.
john forsyth -- president and chief executive officer
okay.
matt ramsay -- cowen -- analyst
that's very clear. thank you.
john forsyth -- president and chief executive officer
all right.
operator
thank you. [operator instructions] next question from the line of christopher rolland of sig. your line is open.
christopher rolland -- susquehanna international group -- analyst
thanks, guys, for the follow-up. my question is on opex. it looks like opex be a good guide going forward, a nice kind of higher level here for oems too, above your target at least for next quarter. it seems like you guys have had a lot of new products that you've been ramping and supporting recently plus the lion integration. are we done with opex spending and this kind of better opex that we have here, do you think we can maintain this for a while or is there a reason to believe there could be some catch-up in spending?
thurman k. case -- chief financial officer and vice president, finance
well, i think that we've talked about and we will continue to talk about, we'll continue to invest in r&d and it will be focused r&d on particular technologies or products or customers that we want to invest in and i think john has touched on that a bit in the meeting already. so as you look for this quarter, that is the guidance for us and it's right around flattish to the last quarter, but if you look at q4, we would give you a heads up that in q4 we're going to see payroll taxes and health funding and a lot of those things that happen only in the march quarter so you can expect an uptick there. and you can expect that we'll continue to invest in r&d. what we can do is leverage our sg&a line. we think that we have the infrastructure in place that will allow us to leverage that as we grow revenue in the future and will become a lesser percentage of our overall operating expense.
john forsyth -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. thank you, thurman. i'll maybe just jump in with a quick additional comment there to add a bit of longer-term color, chris. i think our take on this or my take on this is, we want to be really strategic about opex. so when you look at -- you will have seen the headcount number rise quite significantly in the last quarter relative to the previous quarter's messaging. almost every single one of those heads was related to power engineering. so -- and from our perspective, that's where we see a really great raft of opportunities ahead of us. so it's the right thing to do for the business to go attack those opportunities as best we can, accelerate the lion team and grow in the other power areas that are in front of us. by contrast, i think as we continue to grow revenues, i believe we'll see increased leverage from opex, especially on the sg&a side, as thurman said, and that should be favorable to operating margins as we go forward.
christopher rolland -- susquehanna international group -- analyst
