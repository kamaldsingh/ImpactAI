frederick w. smith -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you very much, mickey. welcome to all joining our quarterly call. fiscal 2019 was a year of both challenge and change for fedex. we faced weakening international revenue growth driven by the slowdown in global trade, the less favorable service mix of tnt express business after the notpetya cyberattack and continued rapid growth of e-commerce demand. we're very proud of our team members who are responding with positive actions and innovative solutions that will make fedex even stronger and more successful in the future.
fedex enters fiscal 2020 with a sharp focus on extending our lead as the premier global transport and logistics company and on making the necessary investments today to capture the significant market opportunities we see for the future. these steps include enhancing fedex ground capabilities, speed and efficiency, improving fedex express hub automation particularly in memphis and indianapolis, finishing the integration of tnt, modernizing our aircraft fleet and reducing unit cost and increasing productivity, especially for e-commerce deliveries. while these investments are long term in nature and their success cannot always be measured immediately, we are confident they will drive significant earnings growth and improved margins and cash flows and returns for our shareholders over the long haul.
let me emphasize, however, that based on our current forecast of us gdp growth for fy '20, we anticipate fedex freight will increase earnings and margin over the period. we believe fedex ground will increase earnings for the fiscal year with modest if any margin compression from current levels despite the investments we've announced such as six- and seven-day per week delivery, large package capabilities and in-sourcing of smartpost.
global trade disputes and low global growth rates create significant uncertainty for the express business, leading us to be cautious and projecting fy'20 earnings for this segment. the integration of tnt is now progressing at a good clip and we will see significant benefits by this time in summer 2021. major focus of our investment strategy i should note is also improved sustainability and efficiency. we intend to substantially grow our e-commerce business and are well aware improved profitability in this market requires greater efficiency and delivering residential packages, and we have sound initiatives to steadily improve our cost to serve this market. with these ends, for example, we've recently announced in sourcing 2 million smartpost packages and an agreement with dollar general for over 8,000 pickup and delivery on-site locations in sparsely populated in rural areas. over fy '20, we will announce several additional initiatives in this regard
let me also caution observers who follow fedex in this industry to be very careful extrapolating past assumptions and trends into the future. for instance, we've noted repeatedly short-haul package delivery will become increasingly important as retailers ship e-commerce orders from store or local fulfillment. hence average yields have to be matched with operational changes not visible to most to access -- to assure potential future profitability. also, future developments and speeding up e-commerce deliveries and postal reform, which by the way we have supported, will likely be discontinuities in the next several years. fedex is uniquely positioned for long-term success and will continue to deliver a great future for our customers, care owners, team members and the communities we serve.
let me now turn to raj followed by brie and alan and then a brief comment by mark allen and then we'll take questions. raj?
rajesh subramaniam -- president and chief operating officer
thank you, fred, and good afternoon. as mentioned on the last call, our focus is long-term profitable growth that drives increased shareholder value. fiscal year '20 is in many ways a transition year for fedex as we continue to reinvigorate our business to capitalize on e-commerce growth and execute significant initiatives to reduce our cost to serve. in the us alone, we expect the parcel market to double in size to more than 100 million packages per day by 2026. as the market grows so too our abilities and offering -- capabilities and offerings. our global network serves as the invisible backbone for the fast, easy and reliable e-commerce experience that consumers demand today and we continuously build upon our offerings to customers.
one way we are doing so is by strategically working with retailers to enable market-leading value propositions. this includes working with target to leverage their stores as local fulfillment centers through our fedex extra hours offering and giving our customers access to a multitude of fedex drop-off and pickup services such as last week's announcement with dollar general. these are just a few examples of the ways we continue to flex our operations and network to respond to our customers.
brie will cover these capabilities among others in more detail. it is clear that we are all in on e-commerce. this commitment is illustrated by a number of key strategic initiatives well under way in our operating units. just last month, we announced a number of innovative solutions for our fedex ground network. this includes seven-day a week residential delivery, rapidly integrating fedex smartpost volume into standard ground operations and enhancing network around large package handling. these changes directly address some of the key challenges inherent with e-commerce, namely increasing consumer expectations and managing the cost for residential delivery.
bringing the smartpost volume into the ground network allows us to improve density and efficiency in the last-mile deliveries. it is significant that we are engineering and enhancing the ground network in such a way that it will be more cost effective to deliver millions of residential packages a day, directly by fedex ground. in fact, we expect fedex ground to become the low-cost last-mile provider in the industry.
the recent round announcement should be particularly exciting to online consumers who purchase large items like furniture, tvs, and kayaks with the click of a button. we expect to have a large package operation in nearly 40 ground facilities prior to our peak season. the vast majority of these are existing facilities and this approach minimizes capex and enable us to focus on placing large package handling in the more strategic locations such as near ports and railroads.
not one element of this transformation will be possible without the investments that fedex ground has been making and continues to make in technology, advancements in loading, sorting and scanning technologies will provide near real-time data. it will help optimize operations for maximizing the use of rail, improving delivery density and increasing the efficiency of handling all packages, no matter the size.
these types of technological enhancement and state-of-the-art tools are true differentiators and are being implemented all across the fedex operations, not just fedex ground.
fedex freight for example, is in the midst of modernizing an industry that has been historically paper-based. technology advancements like advanced forklifts computers, electronic shipping labels and advanced driver assist systems, allow our team members to work smart, safer and more efficiently. this evolution of automation, that's a step for continued long-term success.
at fedex express, we are implementing initiatives focused on lowering our cost-to-serve in the us. this includes rightsizing the network as we prepare for future growth. to accommodate this growth, we have launched multi-year hub modernization efforts at two of our largest express hubs, memphis and indi. these investments will enable express to handle more volume more efficiently.
internationally, the global trade picture is less than ideal, but we are confident in our long-term position. we are rapidly moving forward with the integration of tnt. as expected, we began fy '20 with a global sales force that's 98% integrated, positioning us with a single face to our customers in nearly every market worldwide. we have recently completed on-schedule, the rollout of our capabilities to inject legacy fedex express into our european shipments into the tnt european road network.
we expect to be substantially complete with the operational integration by the end of fiscal year '20. this will allow interoperability between the tnt and legacy express networks and in turn results in faster service for customers at a lower cost. beyond fiscal year '20 or work will continue with key initiatives including customer migration, air network integration and product rationalization.
the various areas, i've touched on today position fedex to be future ready. we are focused on the long-term, and i am humbled by the ongoing commitment, dedication and innovation by our more than 450,000 team members around the world.
now i will turn it over to brie to provide more details on our macro view, revenue quality and additional growth initiatives. brie?
brie carere -- executive vice president, chief marketing and communications officer
thank you, raj. good afternoon, everyone. i'll open with our economic update and outlook and provide some commentary on broader industry trends and our growth priorities.
overall us economic growth is holding up well with real gdp growing 3.1% in the first quarter of calendar year '19. however, the industrial sector has suffered from an inventory build up and increased trade tensions, through may manufacturing output was 1.5% off its december peak. for calendar year '19, we expect global economic growth to moderate as the developed world sees slower growth in both domestic and external factors weigh on emerging markets.
we expect services to continue to underpin global gdp growth. global trade has slowed as trade frictions have exerted a negative impact on sentiment and of course, the manufacturing sector. as the chinese economy has continued to decelerate, this has also impacted other asian markets' export performance. china's exports, which grew almost 10% in 2018 have barely grown this year amid heightened trade tensions with the united states.
outlook for the european economies remain slow due to a number of sector and country specific factors such as disruptions in the auto manufacturing sector, social tensions, policy uncertainty as well as uncertainty related to brexit.
in germany and italy, which are two important markets for us, manufacturing output, which turned negative in november has continued to decline with april manufacturing output down 3.5% and 1.9% year-over-year in germany and italy, respectively.
as we have stressed before, tariffs are counterproductive to efforts that encourage business growth and expand global trade. thankfully, however, we have a large and flexible global network that allows us to adjust and meet our customers' needs, when trade issues present challenges in certain markets.
as i mentioned on the last call, we remain laser focused on three key areas, international, e-commerce and small business. despite macroeconomic headwinds that i just covered, our international commercial team is poised for growth. sales integration, as raj has mentioned, is essentially complete. our european network is more reliable and faster than it has ever been. we have simplified our pricing structure and open the valve for e-commerce within europe.
we've also created new pricing programs for our asian team to sell into europe as well as from europe into asia. this is the largest trade lane in the new world. e-commerce continues to be a driving force of total us domestic market growth. we are building our portfolio networking capacity to best serve thousands of retailers in this space. and we continue to differentiate, for example with the launch of the fedex seven-day service.
in 2020 fedex ground will deliver seven days a week year round for 80% of us gdp. this is truly a transformational move that builds upon the largest global commerce transportation network in the world to further serve the growing e-commerce market. we are already faster than the competition by at least one day in 25% of the lanes, this move will further speed up our network and allow us to continue to gain market share.
with the growth of e-commerce and consumer demand for flexible, safe and convenient delivery options, fedex sought to provide unmatched access and create cost saving opportunities for customers. the recently announced alliance with dollar general will provide access to fedex services in places that customers have told us are very convenient in their daily lives. the alliance will provide more than 8,000 additional locations for customers to hold packages for pick up and drop off, pre-labeled packages, including of course pre-labeled returns.
further, it will bring fedex closer to the consumer than we have ever been before within five miles of over 90% of the united states population. once the dollar general rollout is complete, the number of retail locations providing staffed fedex shipping will grow to over 27,000. we are incredibly excited that the access to fedex service continues to improve, especially for e-commerce recipients in more rural, less populated areas of the united states.
this is a tremendous achievement, not just an increasing access, but also in creating cost saving opportunities for our customers and for fedex. for instance, by choosing to ship packages directly to convenient fedex retail locations, merchants can reduce cost of residential delivery surcharges. delivery to our retail location eliminates weather-related damage or ports that helping to reduce customer service and replacement cost for retailers.
and for returns, drop-off at our retail locations result in higher pickup density and drive greater operational efficiency, making fedex even more competitive in the returns market. we have a great returns growth opportunity that our competitive retail network now opens up for us.
across all our priorities, we continue to be very focused on revenue management. while we see irrational pricing market, e-commerce will continue to put pressure on yields with lighter packages moving shorter distances. it is important to note that contrary to the erroneous and misinformed reporting in the wall street journal on june 23, fedex has made no recent pricing changes -- no pricing changes to our strategy. and we have certainly made no changes related to any one customer.
in fact, at express, we have experienced strong growth from small and medium customers using our fedex express two-day product, following a strategic pricing change we made last year. and we anticipate the growth of this successful product to continue in fy '20. we are confident that our strategies will allow us to grow global volumes and revenues profitably.
now, let me turn the call over to alan for his remarks. alan?
alan b. graf -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thank you, brie, and good afternoon, everyone. fedex express fourth quarter operating income declined as weakness in global trade and industrial production drove a decline in our international priority revenue. year-over-year comparisons were also impacted by an $85 million gain on the sale of a non-core business of tnt express last year. to mitigate the weakness, we have undertaken several immediate cost containment actions, including significant reductions of variable incentive compensation, limiting hiring and discretionary spending and completing our us voluntary employee buyout program. approximately 15,000 fedex employees have left or will be voluntarily leaving the company via the us employee buyout program by the end of fy '20; approximately 85% of those employees departed on may 31, 2019.
we incurred costs of $316 million during the fourth quarter associated with our business realignment activities. these costs related primarily to severance for employees who accepted voluntary buyouts. business realignment activities, including the voluntary employee buyout, are expected to benefit fy '20 by approximately $240 million. by eliminating open positions, we expect to achieve our savings goal using less severance than we originally forecasted. tnt integration expenses were $84 million for the fourth quarter and $388 million for fy '19. as you heard from raj, we are continuing to make good progress with our integration activities.
at fedex ground, we continue to see strong e-commerce volume growth in the fourth quarter. however, fedex ground income and margins were negatively impact by increased purchase transportation rates and the january launch of year-round six-day per week operations. fedex freight closed the year with another strong quarter despite weakening industrial production. revenue per shipment increased 4%, operating income increased 15% and operating margin improved to 9.9%. below the line, our non-cash mark-to-market retirement plan accounting adjustment of a net $3.9 billion loss was driven by a substantially lower discount rate, which contributed $1.8 billion through the loss, changes in actuarial assumptions, which significantly increased the liability, and lower-than-expected asset returns. fy '19 capital expenditures totaled $5.5 billion.
for fiscal 2020, we are targeting a mid-single digit percentage decrease in adjusted earnings per share. our performance has been negatively affected by continued weakness in global trade and industrial production, as well as the near-term impact of certain strategic decisions we have made to sustain our leading position in a changing marketplace. at fedex express we expect earnings to be down in fy '20 due to weakness in international priority revenue and ongoing shift to lower-yielding services. our strategic decision to not renew the fedex express us domestic contract with amazon will also be a near-term headwind, which we expect to reverse to a positive in fy '21, as we replace the lost volume and optimize the network.
additionally, we do not expect a significant benefit from the fuel surcharge table changes in fy '19 to repeat in fy '20. fedex express will continue to implement actions to reduce cost to serve, improving efficiencies and adjusted to global network to match anticipated demand. while we expect to make significant progress on tnt integration activities in fy '20, integration work will continue in fy '21. we expect to incur approximately $350 million of integration expenses in fy '20 and $1.7 billion in total through fy '21.
at fedex ground, we expect volume and revenue growth to remain very strong in fy '20; however, operating margins will face headwinds from higher operating costs associated with expanding fedex ground delivery schedule, improving our capabilities for large packages and other investments to significantly improve efficiency and safety, as raj mentioned. at fedex freight, we expect continued improved performance as we remain focused on improving revenue quality (inaudible) technology solutions that will drive efficiency and further differentiate us in the ltl market.
our fy '20 effective tax rate prior to year-end mark-to-market retirement plan accounting adjustments is expected to increase to 23% to 25% and will likely vary from quarter-to-quarter. in addition, our tax rate is very sensitive to international income, which may cause the rate to vary from that range. fy '20 capital spending is expected to be $5.9 billion. these expenditures will include fedex express investments in aircraft and hub modernization, fedex ground investments that increase our efficiency in handling large packages, and investments in technology across the enterprise that will further optimize our networks and improve our competitiveness. all of these targets assume moderate us economic growth, current fuel price expectations and no further weakening in international economic conditions. a further ramping in any trade measures and/or adverse changes in international trade policies and relations would likely drive additional weakness in our business.
as i mentioned earlier, a substantial decline in discount rates, changes in actuarial assumptions, and lower-than-expected asset returns negatively impacted our fy '19 mark-to-market adjustments. with that, our us qualified pension plan funded status declined to approximately 90%. while we are not required to make a pension contribution fy '20, we are expecting to contribute $1 billion.
also, we have funded large increases in our dividend and significant share repurchase over the last several years. our stock buyback level is expected to be significantly lower in fy '20 and our dividend remains at $0.65 per quarter.
in conclusion, management is focused on improving our near-term performance while also positioning fedex for long-term success. while we are adjusting cost to mitigate macro uncertainties and address the growth of e-commerce, we will continue to invest in areas that expand our capabilities and improve our long-term efficiencies. we are confident these investments will drive long-term earnings growth and improve margins, cash flows and returns.
now, let me turn the call back over to fred to introduce the topic mark allen is going to discuss.
frederick w. smith -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you, alan. first, before i do that, let me take a point of personal privilege and mention something in the wall street journal article yesterday, which i am uniquely qualified to speak to and it's the statement that i started the express unit four decades ago to ferry shipments like legal documents and medical supplies over long distances. facts to the matter are that when fedex began operations, it was specifically prohibited for private carriers to move documents in any type. that was only permitted a number of years later when they were relaxation of the private express statutes in order to facilitate the fast movements of legal and financial documents. and rather than medical supplies, the company was basically put together to pick up transport and deliver first overnight for many address in the us to any other address in the united states; technology packages, which was the basic market that we were serving.
of course, we then added two-day express, we expanded internationally added pallets, and of course, today, we pick up and transport millions of items in the express business on a far larger scale at a far, far lower price. biggest issue on a go-forward basis and the article goes on to say that the express unit was built for e-commerce; reality is, it perfectly built for e-commerce with the exception that we have to address, as we've said on several of the remarks here including mine that we have to be very efficient in delivering to residential -- making residential deliveries, which are an increasing part of the traffic moving through both the ground and the express network.
so with that clarification, let me turn now to the subject of the lawsuit that we filed yesterday. there has been a considerable amount of misreporting on this as well number one, as that is related to the huawei issue where we misrouted and then apologized for two packages and returned to the shipper erroneously a third. the huawei packages were only peripherally involved in this lawsuit that we filed, and in fact, it goes back many, many years which in the lawsuit itself, and it concerns not contraband which many people have confused, the lawsuit as concerning. it concerns import and export controls as administered by the department of commerce. so we worked very hard with all kinds of law enforcement agency, as does the postal service and ups, keep certain types of items out of our networks, illegal drugs, unlicensed firearms, you could go down the list, you can go and look at the prohibited items on our website, the postal service. this is not about prohibited items and contraband. it is about regulations that the department of commerce administers which prohibit entities meaning companies or individuals from exporting or importing.
and that's quite different and in many cases, they're either prohibited completely or they are restricted to various destinations or to various commodities or certain contents. in turn, that requires a common carrier like fedex when one of these entities is put on the list to in essence certify, and in fact get a certificate from the shipper that basically lists (ph) what's in the package or in the in the shipment. and that's the issue that we are -- that we are dealing with here.
i note that that secretary ross who i have known for four decades and respect and like a lot, i'm pained by the fact that he issued a statement that disagrees with our position in the litigation, but as we told the department of commerce yesterday, we certainly understand their job and their implementation of the trade policy of the administration, this lawsuit doesn't speak to that at all. it speaks to the issues that our general counsel will tell you about and after his remarks, we won't have any further comments on this as we'll let the process play out in the courts.
but mark allen, our general counsel will make a statement.
mark r. allen -- executive vice president, general counsel and secretary
the action that we filed yesterday in the federal district court in dc request of the government be permanently enjoining from enforcing the export administration regulations against fedex in circumstances where we have no actual knowledge that the contents of a shipment are subject to the ears. the bis takes the position that a common carrier like fedex can be held liable for shipments that do not comply with the export administration regulations, without requiring any evidence that the carrier had any actual knowledge of an apparent violation.
we believe very strongly that the imposition of this sort of strict liability is a clear violation of our constitutional due-process rights under the fifth amendment. we cannot know the contents of the 15 million packages we handle daily and whether those contents comply with the complex ears. by requiring us to police the contents of packages moving through our global networks, the government is placing an unreasonable burden on a common carrier. we have reached out to commerce to let them know of our commitment to compliance, however, we hope to reach an agreement on a common sense way forward. that would be creating a safe harbor that essentially means if we have no knowledge of an apparent violation, the bis will not come after us.
frederick w. smith -- chairman and chief executive officer
so now, we'll take your questions, and (inaudible).
",":
operator
(operator instructions) and our first question today will come from allison landry with credit suisse.
allison landry -- credit suisse -- analyst
thanks, good afternoon. so, you mentioned 2020 is a transition year for earnings and considering the bump in capex, clearly it's going to be difficult for you guys to generate cash this year. so i guess, do you expect any positive cash flow. and could you help us think through the, the longer-term cash generation of the business, as you think about 2021 and 2022? thank you.
alan b. graf -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
allison. this is alan. yes, i do expect improved free cash flow in fy '20. and as far as it's been a transitional year, we -- i think explained it about as well as we could. so i look forward to pass that. i can't predict what's going to happen with trade, tariff, china, g20 and brexit. so if you just set that aside that turns out well or decent, we got a lot of good guys and in '21 will have a seven-day ground operation running full speed, we'll have the benefits from a full tnt interoperability, we'll have lower us fedex express rural and residential cost, we'll have unbelievable improvement in ground productivity and growth, and we'll have continued freight growth and improved productivity.
so i think once we get through '20, we are going to be in fantastic shape with the global macro hanging over. as to our $5.9 billion the company wanted to spend upwards of seven. we worked very hard to push up projects that i think will have good strategic returns, but a lot of really good things didn't make the cut. we have a lot of opportunities here, particularly on the cost side and we're going to attack them aggressively.
operator
our next question will come from chris wetherbee with citi.
chris wetherbee -- citi -- analyst
hey, thanks, good afternoon. it looks, based on the guidance that you're calling for express to be down from a profit perspective, maybe double-digits. wanted to get a sense if you could maybe break out some of the cross-currents from trade and the macro and sort of what that impact might be on the core business and try to separate that out from some of the things that you're doing strategically with delivery as well as some of the late-night pickups and maybe some of the strategic decisions you've made around the customers. any you can kind of parse-out some of the details in sort of that guided weakness in express would be helpful?
alan b. graf -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
chris, alan again. what we're looking at right now. as i just talked about in our fourth quarter, at expressed where we had international priority revenue is actually down. that's hard to -- that's hard to recover from in a very short period of time. again, i don't know what's going to play out here on trade and tariffs, so there could be some upside for that. but at the moment, i'm not seeing that.
our load factors coming out of asia (ph) are not really bad, but the yields are that good and it could be better. so i think the biggest issue is the macro. on the -- as far as what's going on with express in the us, it's doing fine. i mean we had a great growth rate in our deferred traffic, which we went after intentionally, and we're going to get our cost structure in shape to improve the profitability of express for that as well. so really, it's the macro, that's the biggest hangover for what we're looking at for fy '20.
operator
and next we'll go to jack atkins with stephens.
jack atkins -- stephens -- analyst
hey, good afternoon, thank you for the time. could you provide some more details around the steps that you're taking to -- in your words, right-size your operations to better handle e-commerce. do you foresee perhaps further changes in the business model in an effort to gain these efficiencies such as more closely integrating your ground and express operations? thank you.
frederick w. smith -- chairman and chief executive officer
i don't recall who said right-size, did you raj? oh, optimize. well, this is smith here. i said in my remarks that we had made a number of announcements. i don't think anybody on this phone call knew a month ago that fedex was going to announce seven-day a week service, 8,000 dollar general locations, insourcing 2 million smartpost packages. building a number of large package annexes to exploit that business in ground, and then all the other things that raj and brie mentioned to you.
so please recall in my remarks, i basically said stay tuned, that there we'll be telling you some other things during this fiscal year. so we understand the issues involved in e-commerce and residential delivery, and raj made the point specifically, we will be the low-cost producer in the e-commerce space for residential deliveries. we're quite confident of that from many perspectives.
but we're not prepared to tell you some of these other moves anymore than we were prepared to tell you a month ago about the things that i just pushed it off. but there will be other things that we will announce during fy '20 in this regard . you can count on it.
operator
our next question will come from scott group with wolfe research.
scott group -- wolfe research -- analyst
hi, thanks, afternoon. so alan, is there any way you can help us think about maybe the quarterly cadence of earnings -- just now obviously, we've got some weak trends right now, but then really tough incentive comps in the second half of the year, any help there. and then maybe just fred, just following up on that is big picture, are you -- are there reasons why we could potentially consolidate ground and express networks from a delivery standpoint and then any update you can give us on the international buyout potential?
alan b. graf -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
that was three, scott. so look, as to cadence, the tax rate is going to be really spotty. i mean, we've got some -- a lot of assumptions that we have to prove and get through. we're still looking at all these pages of interpretations and regs that are coming out, it's left and right. we're dealing with (inaudible) us from everybody that you follow and international is extremely complex. so tax rate is going to be a factor in our quarter-to-quarter numbers. don't be surprised by that.
secondarily, again, i just can't tell you what's going to happen from the global economic standpoint. so that piece of it, the cadence is going to be the cadence. it's a little bit out of our control. we'll manage to it, but we don't want to do anything stupid and then not have the capacity that we need in the right place. so we're watching that extremely carefully.
you asked ground; they're going to have a great year. i mean, they really are, i mean, they're going to grow fast and if we're going to hold margins are get close to hold margins on this growth with all the expansion and all the investment that they're doing and improving productivity, they're going to be really (inaudible) in '21. they're going to have a great consistent year, so that's about all i can i can tell. the other thing is that people forget that there is a reason that express has a two-day service, it's called distance. when we need an airplane, we need an airplane. the customer really decides, which network makes the delivery. i think we've explained this over and over and over again on the margin, yes, there's always opportunities, but for the most part, we've got to fly when we have to fly, but the customer can make that decision.
operator
amit mehrotra from deutsche bank has our next question.
amit mehrotra -- deutsche bank -- analyst
hi, thanks for taking my question alan, you made the comment, i think in response to allison's question the free cash flow would be better in fiscal '20. i am wondering if you could just help put a finer point in that based on the macro assumptions that the company has made, and related to that the $1 billion pension contribution -- the voluntary pension contribution, i would imagine that that would be funded with new debt given the offsetting cash savings from the pbgc insurance premiums. and then, just related to that, if you can discuss the incremental costs in fiscal '20 associated with the seven-day delivery? thanks so much.
alan b. graf -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
well, there'll be some incremental costs associated with some of the delivery, of course. we've been incurring them and we will continue to incur them but that now that we've gone to six-day, the seven-day leap (ph) is not nearly as significant. so those won't be material, but they probably will likely be a headwind, but i have to say, what i'm hearing from my team is that the customers are lining up to get the seven-day -- get the sunday service and we're going to do it very efficiently, and i think we'll be able to start it in a very good way. so again, i'm excited about what's happening in that regard.
operator
our next question will come from david ross with stifel.
david ross -- stifel. -- analyst
yes. good afternoon. just back on the tnt integration expenses, the total cost of $1.7 billion, about double what initially was. can you remind us what that additional expenses for and is there a difference between network integration, which you said is going to be completed in the next year and network improvement or upgrade that need to be made to the tnt system?
alan b. graf -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
hi, david. alan again. not double. i will tell you a couple of things, one is that we originally gave you a $400 million number about notpetya. that's an old number. that's never been updated, but it continues to be a problem for us in terms of integration, as we have to basically rebuild a system that tnt had and then integrate it with the network that we've got on the purple side, and it's cost us a lot more money and slowed it down and it's made it more complex. the good news on that side is that the interoperability will be done by the end of the fiscal year and that's when we can start really harvesting the benefits of that low-cost road network and flow the express packages through it seamlessly without all kinds of double handling and double packaging and everything else. i mean, i will let raj add to this.
rajesh subramaniam -- president and chief operating officer
yes , i'll just say that there has been tremendous momentum in the last -- literally in the last few months on tnt integration. we have the vision of interoperability by the end of fiscal year '20 and ultimately one network for air and one network for ground. it's a lot of value to be had here, but what i want to say here is that, we are not waiting to create value for the customers because of the customer value has been created as we speak. we are speeding up lanes and our service levels are very good and with -- the demand is strong. so i think we've made a lot of progress and the significant value in this investment it will come to bear fiscal '21 onwards.
operator
and next we'll go to david vernon with bernstein.
david vernon -- bernstein -- analyst
hi. question for you fred or raj on the portfolio. obviously, the expansion into the virtual kind of retail footprint with the partnerships with dollar general, things like that. is there a point where you may be look at the portfolio and say, why do we still have the services business, do you need that retail footprint, do you ever get to a point where you kind of rethink the composition of that part of the business?
rajesh subramaniam -- president and chief operating officer
i guess you're quite asking about the fedex office. i think it plays a very important role as part of our retail network, especially as we move forward on e-commerce, some of the premium value-added services on hold location plus return services -- and there are several things that we process through the fedex office as unique and differentiated and the value is going to get even better as the e-commerce trends increase. i don't know brie if you want to add anything more to that?
brie carere -- executive vice president, chief marketing and communications officer
yes. the only thing that i will add is, obviously , we're very excited about the expansion of our on-site retail partnerships with walgreens and with dollar general. the fedex office retail locations bringing in some of our most profitable small and medium business because the experience they get when they are shipping internationally and when they were shipping and they want the peace of mind of proper packaging. that is absolutely just a stellar experience and those employees just deliver a great experience. so we're very committed to that element of the portfolio.
rajesh subramaniam -- president and chief operating officer
yes. and don't forget these fedex office location, the size of this fedex offices are really substantial and it's a very -- it's an excellent place to conduct call e-commerce and as brie pointed out, the most profitable packages for the fedex system comes through the fedex office network.
frederick w. smith -- chairman and chief executive officer
and we're expanding inside walmart stores, which is becoming a great partnership, and brie, thanks for mentioning profitability, i loved it.
operator
our next question will come from brandon oglenski with barclays.
brandon oglenski -- barclays -- analyst
hi. good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for taking my question. mr. smith, i really submit this question humbly as an analyst, has never run a business but i guess, at what point do we question the scale of the express network because we've seen decade after decade of low returns, low margins; in peak economic activity, you guys can't put in a pretty good return, but you will never really crossing that threshold of covering the cost of capital. and on the call today, just looking at that the strategy is the same, put more capital, and optimize but not rightsize, i guess why not a more radical look at the business i think someone suggests a look at, integrating portions of express or ground or maybe even going more aggressively. just on the overall footprint of the business. can you talk to that please?
frederick w. smith -- chairman and chief executive officer
didn't you ask me the same question in the last analyst call or somebody else asked me a similar question. look, i -- the only way i can respond to that is, obviously, the plans and the programs we put in place were designed to create superior returns. we didn't just decided to do it for the hell of it. and it reminds me a little bit about that all adage of mike tyson that, you know, everybody has got a plan until they get hit in the mouth. so one of the things that always amuses me about watching a lot of things that are written about fedex and so forth, you know, the competition has a vote and the economy has a vote.
so clearly, we've been very disappointed over the last few years with the assumptions that we made on the growth in international trade, particularly with the trump administration. the united states policy since 1934 with roosevelt and secretary of state cordell hull was to expand international trade. and now we have a huge dispute where the united states is basically become protectionist defined as, i'll make everything, i need in my own borders. i don't need to import things and quite frankly don't particularly need to export them, despite the fact that 95% of the world's population is outside the united states.
so we have become a protectionist country. we don't agree with the chinese position on trade either i've been very vocal about that, which is merchant (ph) dealers. i would like to sell to you, but i won't buy from you on a reciprocal basis.
so your question implies that, we have sat around and you said, quote for decades. we don't look at the business as a single segment, we've said that over and over again, you all deconstruct it into some degree, i sort of added in that today by making an exception saying we expected freight and ground to have earnings increases and margin increases in freight. and hopefully, any compression in ground due to the expansion will be very small.
so clearly as we go forward and things change of, if we don't resume any kind of international growth we would change our approach to the business, we don't have any sacred cows here. but you also have to remember in the express business as alan said, our domestic express business is doing fine. it's not the issue, it's the international business that's having a problem for the reasons that, brie, and now, i am saying to you.
good news is that if traffic and yields materialize, the conversion rate to profitability is probably in the neighborhood of 60% because it's a network where the incremental volume goes to the bottom-line faster than any of our other activities.
in the case of tnt, i have to say i've been amazed not just with the people who follow fedex in this industry, with the amazing dis-interest and notpetya attack. it was the largest single attack by a state-sponsored entity in the history of the world. it has put the ukraine on its knees. the only reason that it was less of a factor to us than it was because of the fantastic work of our it team that went and remediated it. had it not been that tnt had been subsidiary of fedex, the company would have been bankrupt. it would you just gone out of out of business.
so clearly, we should have sat and waited knowing notpetya was coming, we could have picked up the pieces, it would have been a lot easier on us. so i think i'm going to ask rob carter, our cio give you a bit of color what he was giving me the other day about the notpetya account. to my knowledge, the only in-depth article that's ever been written by, i think it was in wired magazine.
and when you read that, it's like, oh, my god, this is one of the most under-reported stories in history. so to get to your point, of course, we want to make money in these networks, and we will engineer and modify them to the extent that we need to, but you've got to remember, those two things. the anticipation of continue to embrace a free trade, which was our assumption on building a lot of this stuff and then not assuming the notpetya things are the two exogenous factors we've been dealing with. so rob, you want to comment on this?
robert barber carter -- cif, co-ceo & executive vice president
well, this attack was a weapons-grade attacked by russia on ukraine that utilized cyber tools that were built by the nsa, and the us government. and a group called shadow broker stole those tools and they were turned back on the ukraine, and the devastation in ukraine, just hasn't properly been reported. all the airports were down, all the trains were down, hospital systems were lost, the monitoring systems in chernobyl that monitor, what is the most infamous nuclear plant in the world were lost.
if you looked at pictures that are on the internet of the kiev airport every single screen showing the red screen of death. every point-of-sale terminal in the big grocery store, showing the same thing. every atm machine down in the country. this was an amazing attack and we are thankful that our teams, were certainly able to stop at the borders of tnt, it didn't impact the fedex enterprise. but the devastation in the tnt technology state was considerable, to say the least.
the good news for today is that the state is running significantly better than it ever has with high degrees of reliability that are positively impacting service levels for tnt and the integrated networks that are being put in place now. but fred is right, this was a devastating attack for a nation-state that couldn't defend itself and businesses like ours, and many others were impacted as well.
alan b. graf -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
brandon, this is alan. i just want -- since the questions is an important one i just feel like i need to weigh in as a cfo. what you just -- the question you asked, we talk about all the time. we talk about it at the board level, we talked it about at our smc's. let me just add two things. in the fourth quarter a year ago, we were almost there. i mean we express running on all cylinders and that was without tnt, provide anything but a drag.
so i know we can do it. i know we will do it. i'm disappointed that we haven't done it, but i believe strongly that when we get the interoperability up and we get any kind of global trade environment that's reasonable, that we will be successful with our international at express.
operator
our next question will come from helane becker with cowen.
helane becker -- cowen & company -- analyst
thanks very much, operator. i appreciate the time. fred, what happens to the guangzhou hub in this whole china-us trade situation, if anything?
frederick w. smith -- chairman and chief executive officer
well, there is a tremendous trade dispute going on between china and the united states as is reported almost hourly on the business tv stations. but we've been a good corporate citizen in china for decades. and we are completely dedicated to compliance in china and we have expressed that to them and reinforced it, so they ordered us in guangzhou and many other locations and probably there have been an increase in audits as a result of this, to some degree. but we've cooperated fully with the china state post bureau and their investigation of the two misrouted packages and the erroneously returned package.
again we apologized to the customers, they left our possessions, we offered to make things right, but that has nothing to do with china or huawei. it has everything to do with the purple promise. we would have done that for or any customer. so our guangzhou hub is a huge part of the economy of the pearl river basin. and so we hope there is not going to be any further deterioration in us-china trade relations.
let me say again, just because it's important for this audience to know about this request that we made of the d.c. circuit court on these export regulations. what's really led us to do that at the end of the day, wasn't huawei, at all. it was on last friday, there were five new entities added with these extraordinarily opaque requirements and contrary to what you hear in the media, we don't have to be complicit in this. it's strict liability, if you make a mistake, if the department of commerce, bis, which stands for business and industrial -- bureau of industry and security, they are empowered under their regulations not we think based on congressional law but on their own regulation who fine us or any other common carrier if what's been represented in that shipment even though we have a certificate saying that it comply, $250,000 per package. so i don't think that's what the intended and as mark said, hopefully, we're going to going to deal with them. but that is separate and distinct from the huawei situation, which was three packages out of a 15 million package per day. so it's very difficult these days to keep this in perspective, but we've tried to do so and we've got a great team in china; karen reddington, our president and eddy chan who runs china for us and our government affairs people. so hopefully, we don't have any issues there. there certainly haven't been any operational issues to speak of.
operator
our next question will come from bascome majors with susquehanna.
bascome majors -- susquehanna -- analyst
yes. hi, thanks for taking my question here. alan, i was curious if you could tell us how much incentive comp helped the results in 2019 on absolute basis? i know it was $350 million through the first three quarters of the year and how much would a target level be for that to fully come back and how much or how close to that target are you budgeting in the fiscal 2020 outlook? thanks.
alan b. graf -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
hi, bascome. we're going to have an 8-k in july. i don't think that's a too much of a strategic question. the aic that we are forecasting for fy '20 is in the guidance i gave you and i would just leave it at that and follow up with ir later.
operator
our next question will come from ken hoexter with bank of america merrill lynch.
ken hoexter -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
great. hi, good afternoon. you noted the profit growth at ground incorporated to start up for sunday delivery and would still be up. given the move of retailers for more next day delivery from walmart, target, amazon, do you see a larger shift going from express -- i'm sorry, from ground to express packages and how does that change your dynamic and cost structure?
rajesh subramaniam -- president and chief operating officer
so this is raj. let me the reason we have now a full portfolio of services on transportation and other e-commerce services is to cater to all the needs of retailers and e-tailers as we go forward here. so to your question, when walmart talks about -- overnight for walmart where we are the service provider for that and we have lot of overnight volume for that; if you need extra hours for target, we provide that; if you need local zone one ground delivery, we have that service as well. so my point here is that we have now a full portfolio of e-commerce delivery services along with technology and returns and more to come as the chairman talked about that it is the most robust in the marketplace. so it's really putting together the whole picture that we're trying to do here.
alan b. graf -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
hi, ken, alan. what ground is working on and doing a great job of is lowering their cost structure dramatically. we wouldn't be taking all the smartpost packages into our own network if it wasn't the fact that we can do it for a lower cost in the postage. the postage is going to keep going up; we're driving our cost down. so that's an important phenomenon for you to understand. secondarily, again, the customer decides time and distance is how we decide which network it goes into. ground its asset, it's double turning, it's doing all kinds of things but it can't make a really late in the evening pickup for next day delivery or two-day delivery of any kind of distance and that's where it goes to express. so as raj was explaining to you, we've got networks to provide whatever the customer wants. and that's important thing, but i don't want to day to go by that people understanding, ground is significantly lowering its unit cost and doing it a very rapidly.
operator
and next we'll go to tom wadewitz from ubs.
tom wadewitz -- ubs -- analyst
yes. good evening and thank you for the question. sticking on that topic, i guess, perhaps you could offer more color on what some of the actions are to significantly lower the cost structure in ground. i guess my intuition is that in transportation, density drives cost and it seems like the all in on e-commerce you're doing a number of things that will help grow the business but could drive some dilution in your density just more b2c packages. so i was just wondering if you could help us understand the offsets to some of the margin pressure and perhaps a little more on what you're saying alan, in terms of really significantly lowering the cost structure in ground?
alan b. graf -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
i got it. i got this one. of course, there is density, and as fast as ground is growing as fast as packages are coming to them and the fact that we're sweating the assets more and with the technology and engineering expertise that we have, which is world class, we can handle a whole lot more traffic and a lot lower unit cost and that's a great place to be. by the way, as i want to iterate, ground is faster on 25% on lanes net, sometimes we get compared to over the peak season about how well we do versus the competition. everybody forgets, they're holding us to our own standards not what all the competition does, that makes us one, two or three days faster during peak season. so i think we're in great place and that's why we're doing it.

and now fred smith will share his views on the quarter.
frederick w. smith -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you, mickey. good afternoon. thanks, everyone, for participating in our first quarter fy '20 analyst call. let me also thank the hundreds of thousands of fedex teammates around the world who work every day to keep our purple promise, i will make every fedex experience outstanding.
when our strategic management committee presented the fy '20 business plan to our board of directors last spring, we identified three significant challenges to increasing earnings this fiscal year consistent with our stated long term goals. one, beginning in the fall of 2018, it had become clear that global trade disputes were adversely affecting manufacturing in europe and asia, thereby slowing international shipping demand. two, our tnt integration was facing its most important phase, leading to the integration of european ground operations by the end of fy '20. and three, we plan to add capabilities to enhance our services toward the rapidly growing e-commerce market, which we expect to grow in the united states from 50 million to 100 million packages per day by 2026. these shipments will be destined increasingly to residences and one in four packages will be short distance deliveries. while the backbone of fedex is the b2b business, our unmatched ground and express line haul and short networks carry both b2b and b2c commerce with great efficiency.
to lead in e-commerce, we have launched or announced fedex extra hours, an express service, which provides nightly pickup with delivery the next business day. in-sourcing fedex smartpost packages for fedex ground delivery by peak 2020, fedex ground six and seven day delivery. expanding the fedex ground oversized package network to approximately 100 facilities by peak 2020. new returned services and thousands of additional pickup and shipping points, including $8,000 general on site locations in less dense areas. and finally, fedex freight direct for heavy and hard to handle items requiring delivery over the threshold, the so called h3d market.
fedex can handle millions of additional shipments generated by these new offerings without adding significant additional sortation capacity. it should be noted a large amount of ground growth will be short haul zone one that will be lower yield, but with improved margin due to increasing density and minimal line haul cost. there is a new video on our website that goes into detail about our broad portfolio and i hope you will watch it.
our services and capabilities and costs will be industry leading in the short haul zone one sector. the fedex board of directors endorsed making these moves as fy '19 came to a close, understanding the short-term cost, as we believe by the end of this fiscal year fy '20, we will have significantly repositioned fedex for strong future earnings.
the market is changing as volumes are moving out of the usps and we are in-sourcing more. we have a chart on the ir website that shows these trends. over the summer, these challenges increased somewhat due to the decision to not renew our largest amazon contract and deepening trade disputes. while the amazon contracts represented only a small proportion of our revenues, the nature of our business is such that near-term profits will be adversely affected since the last bit of volume has significant flow through to the bottom line. however, we have closed additional business to replace this traffic, which is being on boarded, and we are taking out significant costs which were unique to amazon's requirements.
also, the global macro economy continues to soften and we are taking steps to reduce capacity. specifically, we will retire 20 md10-10 aircraft over the current and next fiscal year, which will eliminate that fleet type from our air operations. we are highly likely to also retire the remaining 10 a310 aircraft this year, which will also lead to the elimination of that fleet type.
in addition, we are parking the equivalent capacity of seven md11 aircraft this fiscal year. accordingly, assuming no recession, we will continue the initiatives announced in may and june, with confident optimism about fedex's long-term future competitive position and industry leadership.
we posted a chart on our website that shows a significant customer correlation among our three core opcos. our ability to bundle express, ground and freight services is essential to success in our competitive ecosphere. fedex office and fedex logistics also provide important value added services to our portfolio against the major competitors we face every day.
let me now ask brie to amplify our views on the marketplace and the economy and raj to discuss current operations, including our plans for peak season, and alan will give you more details on our financials. then we will take your questions. brie?
brie carere -- executive vice president, chief marketing and communications officer
thank you, fred. good afternoon, everyone. i'll open with our economic outlook, then dive directly into how we're tackling market opportunities and delivering solutions for our customers at fedex. comparing to where we were in june, our overall outlook for us economic growth is down 20 basis points, currently at 2.3% for real gdp. our outlook has changed despite consumer driven growth of 2% in the us and then q2 of cy '19. this change is because the industrial sector remains sluggish due to an inventory buildup and increased geopolitical trade tensions.
as you can see on chart number 3 on the irs site, us manufacturing pmi has been very weak this year given that our industrial production outlook is down 70 basis points from june, currently at 0.9%. from a global perspective, economic growth has decreased as the developed world outside of the us sees weaker growth. and both domestic and external factors weigh on emerging markets.
in europe, ongoing decline in germany's industrial sector is a drag on growth, while uncertainty over brexit is impacting not just the uk, where no sector has been immune to the negative impact, but its major trading partners as well. growth in italy remains weak, with q2 cy '19 data showing no gain in real gdp. in reference to chart 4 in the presentation, you can see eurozone manufacturing pmi has been signaling contraction for most of the year.
in asia, chinese industrial production growth hit a 10-year low in july and exports remain weak. chinese exports to the us have declined every month in 2019. more broadly, all manufacturer, sorry, excuse me, all major exporting economies have been impacted by the slowdown in trade, especially asian economies with high exposure to china. i want to highlight that q2 cy '19 global trade volumes declined year-over-year, which is the first decline since 2009. this decline, coupled with jp morgan's global pmi manufacturing export orders index falling from 47.5 in august from 49 in may, leads us to expect global trade volumes will contract this year on an annual basis for the first time since 2009.
as we have stressed before, a zero tariff, zero subsidy global trade environment is the most powerful economic growth engine there is. we will continue to push for policies that stimulate rather than depress global trade.
now turning our focus to what we can control. we remain laser focused on executing strategies across three key areas, international, e-commerce and small business. right now, our sights are set on an addressable transportation market totaling $550 billion worldwide. the majority of this opportunity lies outside of the united states, where fedex share has significant opportunity for growth. international is a clear opportunity for us with tremendous runway ahead.
as we integrate tnt and lower our costs to serve in europe, we will be ideally positioned to gain share from the competition. the european team is gaining traction and accelerating the acquisition of powerful customers. unfortunately, this momentum has been offset by reduction in industry air freight volumes between europe and the united states.
in europe, we are simplifying our pricing structures and are opening the valve for e-commerce for the first time ever to further stimulate growth. it is important to note that our european competitors have a larger e-commerce volume base, which insulates them from economic headwinds impacting commercial business. we are very excited about the e-commerce potential for our european business.
we are also creating new pricing and improving our value proposition between asia and europe. this is the largest trade line in the world. prior to the tnt acquisition, we did not have the european buyer base to pull this volume from asia as european payers make the majority of buying decisions in this lane.
now shifting my focus to e-commerce. in reference to chart 5 on the ir site, in the us, more than 90% of incremental domestic parcel volume from 2018 to 2026 is expected to come from e-commerce period. this is why we are busy building a world class portfolio of solutions to best serve thousands of retailers in this space. we are very proud of the rapid innovation we have brought e-commerce in the last three years and you can certainly expect more innovation in the months ahead.
on this same chart, you'll see that more than 50% of the us domestic e-commerce market is our addressable growth market with a cagr of 12%. as e-commerce market grows, so does the market for returns, up 35% since 2015.
packages dropped off at our retail locations result in a higher pick up density and drive greater operational efficiency, making fedex even more competitive in the returns market. we are very excited about our network expansion with dollar general. we will have 1,800 incremental locations opened by peak. we also expect our [technical issues] volume to reach a record high this holiday season.
innovation and customer value are driving every decision we make when it comes to e-commerce. we are very excited about making every day a delivery day with the launch of our seven-day service at fedex ground. we are already faster than the competition by at least one day and 26% of the lanes. this move will further speed up our network and allow us to continue to gain market share.
we are also building powerful relationships with many retailers and leveraging solutions like fedex extra hours and fedex ground zone one, which is our local portfolio. our local portfolio enables retailers to leverage local inventory in stores and dcs, to take orders later in the day and still deliver them the next day. we just forged a new strategic delivery partnership with dick's sporting goods. the majority of their spend with us is on their e-commerce business. by leveraging our portfolio of ground commercial, home delivery and express services, they are getting the product to their customers faster, which of course is paramount to them and to their business growth.
another retailer we work closely with is chewy. chewy was one of the first home delivery customers that benefited from our six-day expansion. due to their one to two day shipping commitment and 24x7 operations, they are ready to take full advantage of our new seven-day service. retailers and brands large and small have recognized our commercial teams for their partnership and for our ability to help them grow their business and successfully compete in the market.
also, e-commerce will continue to create great opportunities for our ltl business. our new fedex freight direct service moves large, bulky items into consumers' homes and into businesses, backed by the power of the fedex brand and the speed and reliability of our nationwide priority network, we are able to reach over 80% of the us population, and we have a unique ability to service a large part of this $10 billion market.
and of course, we can't forget about roxo, the fedex sameday bot, who was recently been in three test markets, memphis, tennessee; plano, texas; and manchester, new hampshire. roxo was preparing to change the way on demand e-commerce shipments make it to customers' doorsteps. while these e-commerce investments benefit the broader market, i am particularly excited about how this strategy will support small and medium businesses, who remain our most profitable customers. in fy '19 our small and medium businesses grew more than 8% and there are still a lot of room to grow as there are more than 32 million small businesses in the us.
speaking of being there for small and medium businesses, we will not apply a residential peak surcharge this holiday season, a decision that has received outstanding feedback from countless small and medium sized customers. it's a great way to help make our customers the hero and e-commerce continues to grow and become a major part of their business.
now let me turn the call over to raj for his remarks.
rajesh subramaniam -- president and chief operating officer
thank you, brie. and good afternoon, everyone. as you all aware, the global economic and trade environment remains very uncertain. despite this uncertainty fedex remains committed to delivering long-term profitable growth.
we are taking decisive actions to address the three topics that fred covered in his opening. number one, reducing capacity, especially in our intercontinental network and overall reduction of cost in our express business; number two, completing tnt integration; and number three, leveraging our infrastructure at fedex ground and making targeted investments that to allow us to successfully go all in on e-commerce.
let me talk about each of these in turn. first, capacity cuts and overall cost reduction at fedex express. we expect the current softness in air cargo demand to continue into calendar year 2020. as such, we will take action to reduce our intercontinental flight after our peak season to better match supply to demand. we have already decreased us domestic flight hours and we'll be aggressively looking for additional opportunities. the express team is intensely focused on overall cost reduction. this includes deferring non-critical hiring, limiting discretionary spending and implementing structural cost initiatives such as the united states voluntary buyout program. in addition, we're looking at every opportunity to reduce capital spending. benefits from all these changes will be realized in the coming quarters.
secondly, let me update you on tnt integration. overall, i'm pleased to report that we have picked up the pace of integration and are continuing to improve our value proposition for our customers. cross utilization of combined fedex express and tnt networks, which we shared in our previous calls was a major step toward full integration of the operations. in june, these capabilities expanded across europe. the transit times of fedex, intra-european economy parcel shipments improved by at least one business today on approximately 40% of the european lanes across the 28 countries in europe. we are well on our way to achieving full ground interoperability in our pickup and delivery networks in europe by the end of may 2020.
blowing intercontinental packages into the combined european ground network allows us to improve service, while simultaneously reducing our cost to serve. this will help us accelerate growth into europe from all around the world. asia, europe lane, which remains the largest intercontinental trade lane is particularly important in this regard. given our strong presence in apac and significantly enhanced presence in europe, we expect to gain share in this lane in the months and years to come.
additionally, in q1, we integrated customs clearance and brokerage services in europe to provide a more seamless experience for our customers. this milestone ensures a well prepared for brexit no matter the outcome. clearance integration is also very important for us to enable cross-utilization of tnt road network for intercontinental shipments. and as mentioned in the previous call, sales integration is practically complete. and now we are presenting a single phase to our customers nearly everywhere around the world.
now thirdly, e-commerce, fred and brie have discussed our robust portfolio. let me now address enhancement specifically under way within fedex ground, which is the backbone of our e-commerce strategy. fedex ground continues to transform the package delivery business in response to a growing market demand. network investments, including seven-day residential delivery, large package capabilities and smartpost integration position us for future growth. leveraging the most automated network in the industry, you will once again offer seven-day residential service to our customers throughout the peak season. after peak, the seven-day residential delivery would become a permanent piece of first service offering.
this will speed up our lanes throughout the week and further extend our competitive advantage in some cases by two days. we're also well under way in building our ground's large package handling capabilities to accommodate items like tvs, tires and furniture. this includes dedicated large package facilities, plus new handling equipment in more than 30 of our existing stations prior to peak.
in terms of smartpost, the integration of that volume into our network directly addresses one of the biggest challenges in the industry, density. from a cost perspective, moving these packages to the same service providers already delivering ground, commercial and residential packages goes a long way in driving density up and driving the cost per delivery down. integrating this volume provides significant growth opportunities for thousands of entrepreneurs who run pickup and delivery businesses with fedex ground. we've already started transitioning smartpost volume, majority of which will move during next calendar year. this should be complete before peak season in 2020.
investment in fedex ground has made and will continue to make technology aim to optimize operations, reduce costs and enable real-time decision-making based on applied data analytics. we're offering our service providers new technology tools, so they can make decisions about how best to run their business each day in terms of staffing needs, vehicle load plans and optimized routes.
arming our employees and service providers with these state-of-the-art tools expected to drive efficiency in fedex's ground operation as well as the operations of service providers, all the while strengthening the reliability of fedex ground service. several of these tools have started to be implemented in select markets prior to peak. immediate benefits would begin to be realized in fiscal year '20 with increased benefit in the years to come. these investments will allow us to provide the speed and reliability our customers value, while offering market competitive prices as the low cost last mile provider. this means we are facing near-term headwinds, including additional costs related to our service expansions and smartpost volume integration. but these investments are necessary and will pay off in coming years.
and speaking of last-mile, we're strategically working with a number of retailers to leverage their physical infrastructure with our transportation and logistic infrastructure to provide market-leading value proposition for the end consumer. interest from retailers remain very high in this regard.
in closing, as we approach another busy peak shipping season, we are well prepared to once again deliver exceptional service to our customers. we expect record breaking volumes and multiple mondays during the peak season. e-commerce growth continues, which in turns drives strong demand for residential delivery. peak season is four days shorter this year and operational intensity remains the same.
we have been preparing in close collaboration with our customers all year. the fedex team of more than 450,000 outstanding team members is the best in the business and is ready to deliver the holidays once again for our customers around the world. in fasb [phonetic] the power of our network, coupled with the hard work and dedication of our global team sets us on a path of long-term profitable growth.
now i'll turn it over to alan graf to provide details on our financials. alan?
alan b. graf -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thank you, raj and good afternoon, everyone. first quarter operating results were impacted by several factors. weakening global trade and industrial production have resulted in less than expected demand for our most profitable express package and freight services. express yields have also been negatively impacted due to the resulting mix shift, lower weight per package and customer trade down to a slower, lower price services. these conditions are especially challenging in europe, where capacity and network reductions are limited due to the current stage of integration as we are operating duplicate road and air networks.
fedex ground operating costs were higher due primarily to our expansion of operations to six days per week, higher purchase transportation cost attributable to volume growth and expansion to six-day operations and higher self insurance expenses. each transportation segment had one fewer operating day in the first quarter versus the prior year, which is estimated to have lowered earnings by approximately $100 million. the loss of volume from amazon had a negative impact to the quarter. operating costs, including depreciation, also increased with strategic investment programs, including the modernization of fedex express aircraft and hubs and investment in technology across the enterprise that will further optimize our networks as well as enhance safety and capabilities.
the modernization of our aircraft fleet lowers cost through enhanced reliability, reduced maintenance costs and improved fuel efficiency. partially offsetting these negative factors were the benefits from an approximate $300 million decrease in variable incentive compensation, fedex ground volume growth of 7%, increased revenue per shipment at fedex freight and fedex ground and cost reductions from business realignment activities, including the us voluntary employee buyout initiated last year.
looking at -- looking ahead to the rest of fiscal 2020, we are now forecasting adjusted earnings per share of a $11 to $13 per share. the new forecast reflects our lowered revenue outlook, driven by increasing trade tensions and the corresponding weakening in global economic conditions, especially industrial production that has occurred since our june earnings release.
with the increasing uncertainty of trade negotiations and government policies, forecasting customer demand and our corresponding earnings is exceedingly difficult. our forecasts assume moderate us economic growth, current fuel price expectations, and no further weakening in international economic conditions. a further ramping and anti trade measures and or adverse changes in international trade policies and relations would likely drive additional weakness in our business.
while our current expectation is to earn slightly above the midpoint of our $11 to $13 range, we believe the range is appropriate given the current macro and business conditions we are experiencing. in addition to the impact of macro uncertainty, fedex ground operating expenses are expected to be higher than our previous forecast due to volume mix, lower than planned delivery density, higher wage rates and ongoing investments to enhance our e-commerce capabilities, including our expansion to seven-day operations. a new forecast also reflects the loss of fedex ground business from amazon that began in august.
our fy '20 effective tax rate prior to the year and mark-to-market retirement plan accounting adjustment is now expected to increase 24% to 26% due to lower-than-expected earnings in certain non-us jurisdictions. in response to these issues, we are taking additional actions on a number of fronts to better align our costs, including post peak reductions to the global fedex express air network. we continue to expect to incur $350 million of tnt integration expenses in fy '20, and $1.7 billion in total through fy '21. we're continuing to expect fy '20 capital spending to be approximately $5.9 billion. while it's early in the process, we anticipate fy '21 capital spending will be similar to fy '20.
during the first quarter, we issued $2.1 billion of debt. we use the proceeds to redeem debt maturing this fiscal year as well as to contribute $1 billion to our pension plans. we do not expect to make additional contributions to our us pension plans this fiscal year. we also have no material debt maturities prior to fiscal 2022.
in conclusion, we are taking actions to mitigate the effects of macroeconomic uncertainty. however, we are continuing to make strategic investments to improve our capabilities and efficiency, which we expect will drive long-term growth of earnings margins, cash flow and returns.
now, the operator can begin the question-and-answer session.

thank you. [operator instructions] we'll hear first from chris wetherbee with citi.
chris wetherbee -- citi -- analyst
hey, thanks. good afternoon. thanks for taking the question. i guess i wanted to just talk about the reduction in guidance and get a little bit specific if we could. if you think about the difference of where you were three months ago versus where you are today, it kind of equates to almost the $900 million writedown in the operating profit of the business this fiscal year. so if you'd give us a little bit more specific sort of buckets breakdown, what may be the lower revenues based on macro and then maybe what may be caused by higher costs associated with certain restructuring the network to adapt to e-commerce that would be very helpful.
alan b. graf -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
chris, i would say that the vast majority of this $900 million is the reduction of our revenue forecasts associated with the macroeconomic conditions that we did not expect. some of the cost increases that you are seeing, did have some impact, but the main reason was the macro. the biggest impact, of course, was that express and that was in international with a large degree of that in europe.
operator
we'll hear next from scott group with wolfe research.
scott group -- wolfe research -- analyst
hey, thanks. afternoon, guys. so, this is, i think, the fifth straight quarter of either missing or cutting -- missing numbers or cutting guidance. are you approaching guidance any differently, meaning taking a more conservative approach here? anything that you think that gives you some confidence or us some confidence that this is the final cut?
and then, i separately just want to understand, raj, you said we're doing everything we can to reduce capital spending and yet capex is staying unchanged and now flat next year as well. so, can you help us understand? i know that's two questions, but we need some handholding here, i think.
rajesh subramaniam -- president and chief operating officer
scott, i'll take them both. the lack of being able to hit our forecast is just the difficulty associated with forecasting in this environment. i don't think we've been too aggressive based on what we knew at the time. you've noticed that we've widened the range this year and i did mention that our current point estimate is higher than the midpoint of that range. so we given ourselves a little bit more downside. i also said that we don't -- we're not expecting any additional weaknesses in the international macro environment from where we are today, which is a wildcard. so i just want to point those things out to you.
as far as capex, trust me, fy'21 would be a lot higher than $5.9 billion if we not started cutting already. i think there are two things that are really important to understand. and number one is, we have to continue to modernize the fleet. the profound impact of the lower cost and higher reliability of the new twins [phonetic] is just remarkable. and we're going to continue to do that. we're going to maybe stretch it out a bit, but not much, because the faster we can get those in there, the faster we can enjoy those benefits. fred mentioned the number of aircraft that we're going to take out of service, either fully retiring or parking. so we're not adding capacity in our international network and in fact, we're reducing that and we're reducing our domestic flight hours. but we need to modernize the fleet. it's a very important.
secondarily, on the hubs at express, where they're under way, we have a lot of things that are committed. but the improved automation and processing capabilities of those two hubs when we finish are also profound in terms of the productivity and the amount of throughput we can handle, and we anticipate that we're going to need that. if we get further deterioration in the macro environment or we see something in the us, it looks like a recession, we'll definitely cut further. but those are our plans at the moment.
operator
we'll hear next from jack atkins with stephens.
jack atkins -- stephens inc. -- analyst
hey, guys, good afternoon. thank you for taking my question. can you quantify the p&l benefits from the capacity and cost actions you announced this afternoon? and, i guess, from a bigger picture perspective, why are these capacity adjustments only being made now when it feels like we've been facing more challenging trade and industrial production trends since last december? what's prevented you from taking these actions before today? thank you.
frederick w. smith -- chairman and chief executive officer
let me take a shot at that. this is fred smith speaking. first of all, i think it's important to look at the things that we've said over the last few earnings call in the context of about what's going on globally. i mean, i watch the business press every day and i have to tell you, i think there is a lot of whistling past the graveyard about the us consumer and the united states economy versus what's going on globally.
so, the serious trade disputes began in the spring of 2018, and they escalated throughout the summer of 2018. and most people don't think about the fact that when china slows down because of us tariffs or uncertainty or for whatever reason, as big a victim, if you want to call it that, of the china slowdown is europe because germany's contraction is because they're not selling as much to china, which is a huge customer of europe. so, remember last spring, there was a tremendous amount of euphoria when we were going to get a deal, china trade deal, and then at the last minute it broke up and then over the period of the summer, there have been escalating tariffs on both sides and increasingly lowered industrial production, and that's why we put those charts up on the ir website.
so, we're reacting inside of fedex to these same things. so, as we went into the fiscal year, we were hopeful of a trade deal and some sort of restoration of normalcy that has not taken place. and the us consumer, which is a remarkable driver of growth and employment and all the things that are spoken about every day, sort of masked the fact that the goods producing sector, which we're in the midst of, is much more global in nature than the us consumer, which is largely services and certain consumption. so, that's the reason that we began the year the way we began it. and should we have moved faster or owned [phonetic] faster or what have you, i mean, all i can do is report the numbers as we see them. and i would point out to you that last fall we were the first people that call this out, and i remember very vividly. i mean, we are the leading prognosticator of this. we have 15 million votes every day in our system. and i remember when we made this call on cnbc, they took our heads off that we were ""blaming"" someone. we're just reporting what's going on and reacting to these macroeconomic things. and as alan said, that's why it makes it so hard to forecast. we think we've taken appropriate steps. we'll do more if we have to. but i can't give any better answer than what i just did.
operator
and from barclays, we'll move on to brandon oglenski.
brandon oglenski -- barclays capital -- analyst
good afternoon, everyone. thanks for taking my question. so, fred, i guess, coming off of that. i mean, clearly, you guys have a culture of forward innovation and growth at fedex. but, i guess, on the flip side, is there any like real ingrained process at the company that says, hey, we need to challenge every day what isn't working? because maybe even outside these cyclical pressures, i mean, if you look at your ltl business, we can benchmark to other carriers that do better. obviously, express margins are at quite a low point right now. and you look at logistics or like fedex office, which we don't think have contributed a lot in the past. so, i guess, what can you tell investors is the process for looking at things that maybe didn't pan out quite as well as you thought?
frederick w. smith -- chairman and chief executive officer
well, i think you're a great person to ask that, brandon, because you're so-called deep dive. so let's talk about ltl. i don't think we have john smith here today. first of all, there are other carriers that do better than fedex with the exclusion of perhaps little small carriers, and one sort i'm not familiar with. i believe the better way to put that is there's one ltl carrier does better than we do, and that's old dominion and we're great admirers of old dominion. but old dominion operates a network that has, i believe, somewhere in the 200-and-some-odd stations versus our 360. they don't deliver every day to every part of the united states. and they've been very brilliant in finding a niche that's, for lack of a better term, near tl. it's in that zone between ltl and tl, and their average weight per shipment in a much more dense network is about 350 pounds, 400 pounds higher. so, their margins are outstanding and they have terrific. and, obviously, we benchmarked them carefully as our other competitors, which gets to your point, do we ever think about doing things differently? and the answer to that question is, we think about doing things differently, constantly.
secondly, in the express business, there is a belief, including you, brandon, that somehow our express operation in the united states is not profitable. our express operation in the united states is very profitable. and we have some of the best industrial engineers and operating -- operations research people in the country. so, there has been this constant mantra for 10 years that, oh, we ought to put express and ground together. well, my goodness, we've gained market share in ground for 19 out of 20 years. and brie and raj just told you, we think it's going to continue and our competitive advantage is going to improve. so we're very convinced that the way that we are operating is the preferred way. and yes, we look at it every day.
the third thing that gets people fired up and, i guess, wolfe, scott group just mentioned it about capex is, we're profligate in terms of capex. reality is about $0.60 out of every $1 we're spending on capex are to modernize the express hubs to put in this new technology. we can't get people in indianapolis and memphis to work. they're not out there, plus it improves the productivity. so the failure to do it would be very dire. and as alan has said, and we've said over and over again, every time we bring on a 767 and to a much lesser degree, the 777, because we're not buying many other of them, it's accretive to our earnings. the reliability goes up. so could we stop buying 767s and 777s? yes. well, why don't we stop buying them? because we put a chart on the earnings -- the ir website today that showed the synergy between the three major opcos. so 80% of our customers buy all three of the services.
so, if you took fedex and tried to subjective, let's say, to i think it was bcg that came up to that diagram, you have dogs and cash flows in one thing or another, if you did not improve the express company unless your costs get out of control, you couldn't win in the ground sector and vice versa. so, we are very convinced. and we put up a chart that specifically addressed your comments about this, fedex will unquestionably be the low-cost producer in the domestic express business because of the fleet modernization. and that includes any new entrants into the business. yes, we have far -- higher pilot cost and amt cost perhaps than the third-party providers. we think that's a good thing, but our total productivity and our cost per ton mile are down 2% over the past 10 years in this year's dollars. i'm not talking about inflated dollars. i'm talking about 2019 dollars are 2% less than 2009 dollars. so, the fleet modernization, yes, we could stop it. and yes, we could stop that capex but the competitive positioning against our major competitors.
and the last thing i'm going to say is, we basically compete in an ecosphere that's got five entities in it. there is ups. there is dhl. there is a us postal service. and now increasingly there is amazon. that's who we wake up every day trying to think about how we compete against and give the best services to our sales force. so, it reminds me one of my days in the service where you'd run all these fake maneuvers, one thing another, it's a lot different when you got competition on the other side. so, we try to beat these folks, ups and in particular has a very strong retail presence and both ups and dhl have significant forwarding presences. so we decided that we would basically cover those portfolio gaps with more focused capabilities, and that's why we operate differently. we carry retail freight on our purple tails and interline it. we don't have a huge forwarding operation. and we have a retail network that is smaller than ups store franchise network, but utilizes partners, as brie talked to you about walgreens and dollar -- more recently, dollar general and some others. so the reason i'm going on about this, i'm not quite sure how this mantra got started, that we're hard-headed or we're not willing to look, we're looking anything. but what we can't do is to change the reality of the math. we can't make the competition go away. i wish they would, just leave the field. they're very good operators.
and the third thing that we have to deal with is the macroeconomic environment. and by the way, there is no company and no person that has been more vocal in our opposition to the trade policies that we are pursuing. now, to be fair, i think it's not just the us, i think china is also pursuing bad trade policy. so, you're taking a system, over the last seven years it's drawn more people out of poverty than in the entire previous history of the world, and essentially putting it all at risk. so, these numbers on these macroeconomic production indicators, we didn't make those up. that's what's going on.
so i apologize for the length of the response. but it's to this continuing drumbeat that somehow we're not willing to look at something and you take selective things like your ltl operation in as good as ""all the others"". it's not as good as one and it's not as good as the other ones in terms of margins for the reasons that i gave you. so it's important to look at this thing with those contexts in mind.
next question?
operator
we'll hear now from allison landry with credit suisse.
allison landry -- credit suisse -- analyst
thanks. good afternoon. so, you talked a lot about the short-term cost inflation at ground and driving down the cost of delivery longer term. i think you've done a pretty good job of explaining that to the market. but it sounds like you're also seeing some unexpected costs creep [phonetic], higher wage rates, lower delivery density so forth. so, i guess, could you help us understand some kind of timeline for when we should expect to see some of the operating leverage and inflection of margins at the ground segment? is fiscal 2021 the right way to think about it or do we need to look further out than that? thank you.
alan b. graf -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
well, i like our ground margins. i think they're fine. and i think we told you early on in the intro, allison, that as at least it goes to zone one where we think we're going to grow really rapidly, we're talking about lower yields and higher margins. so, i think ground is performing admittedly. the issue at ground is, there's just not the commercial traffic we had planned to have, which has significantly higher density than home delivery does. home delivery is growing like crazy and the commercial business is not because of industrial production, and all the other things we said. so, that's a fairly simple explanation. we're adjusting the model accordingly to do that. i think ground's in great shape. i think it's doing fantastic. and i don't see anybody making better margins than us.
frederick w. smith -- chairman and chief executive officer
let me make one comment here, and then raj and/or henry maier, the ceo of fedex ground is sitting here, so he can speak to this too, allison. first thing that people need to understand the things we announced this spring and this summer, we just didn't dream them up in the last few months. we've been working on these for almost four years. and during that period of time, we have invested enormous amount of money in it, which has been dragged through the p&l to make sure that i can make a statement and let me make it again because i think it may have gone over some people's heads.
we will, in the short zone market, the zone one market, the ship from store or ship from local dc, fedex will be the low-cost, high-service producer. you can put the traffic in very, very late in night or in the morning and at lower cost than anybody and i mean anybody, all of the five competitors that i mentioned a moment ago. so, all of these moves that we announced were triggered by a series of developments. and the strategy has been in production for a long time. so we're very confident about where this market is going that brie described to you and we're very confident in ground's position. but, as alan just mentioned, the b2b ground business is being adversely affected for the same reason that the international pmi is going down. the trade effects and the goods production side of the house is much greater than it is in the services business. and that's being reflected across all our businesses; freight, ground commercial, and particularly international.
henry, raj?
rajesh subramaniam -- president and chief operating officer
well, let me just add on to that by just saying that there is a strong divergence between the strong consumer sector and the weak factory sector around the world and us as being no exception. that the industrial production in us is expected to be flat to negative in the second half of cy'19, that's the issue and once we get the commercial traffic -- that's the issue. ground is doing very, very well. and we are definitely investing for the future and we are going to have the market-leading value proposition, best service at low cost.
so let me turn it over to henry for his comments.
henry j. maier -- president and chief executive officer
allison, let me just add cost headwinds at ground are largely six and seven-day, because there is a minimum number of people and to staff a billing in order to operate it prior to the volume and revenue coming on. the wage rate issue is a number of things. first is year-over-year driver rates, which are reflective of the intense composition -- competition for truck drivers in certain geographic markets, both in pmd and line haul. however, what we see going forward as we transition out of the current model into the independent service provider model, which will be completely stood up on october 12th is annual, if not multi-year negotiations with those businesses about the rate -- about their settlement rates.
finally, we've talked about the robust labor environment out there. there are geographic markets, where it's highly competitive to get package handlers into the building. and while our automated network benefits us greatly in that regard for employees, where we're competing for the same unskilled labor in a market we have to be cost competitive. and that's just a function of the strength of the economy and the markets we operate in.
operator
and from goldman sachs, we'll move to jordan alliger.
jordan alliger -- goldman sachs -- analyst
yeah. hi, guys. just sort of from a big picture standpoint, can you remind a little bit what your long-term earnings or profit growth targets would be sort of once we get past this noise? and perhaps assess the ability of things to bounce back. assuming the economy is ok, and assuming you implement the cost initiatives and the capacity initiatives that you do. do you anticipate as we look into fiscal 2021 and 2022, that sort of growth can exceed sort of that long-term eps growth target? thanks.
alan b. graf -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
it depends on your outlook for the economy, for sure. i mean, we said, we're going to be really well positioned by the end of 2021. yes, we were late and over budget on the tnt integration, but we're there -- we will be there. and i don't know what the economic environment in europe will be at that point, but we will be able to significantly reduce our costs and improve our service for all the reasons we've told you about. that's one.
two, some of the things that we've talked about at ground, like the loss of amazon, getting ready for six and seven-day, a lot of that stuff will be behind us. and we'll be ready to move forward. so, given a decent economic environment, we ought to be able to easily hit our 10% to 15% earnings eps growth going forward. but i can't tell you that that's going to be the case because i can't tell you what exactly the economy is going to look like right now. so if i'm a little gun-shy, yeah, probably i am.

moving on to david ross with stifel.
david ross -- stifel, nicolaus & company, incorporated -- analyst
yes. good afternoon. maybe a question for mark, with assembly bill 5 out in california, i know that since the estrada case you've been refining the independent contractor model and now are moving toward an all isp model. is there anything in that proposed bill that could challenge the current isp model or how are you guys viewing that right now?
henry j. maier -- president and chief executive officer
hey, david, it's henry maier. i've been designated the company paralegal for this call. let me give that -- let me give the people listening in a little bit of background on assembly bill 5. back on april 30, 2018, the california supreme court issued a ruling in the dynamex case, which held that an abc test should be used to determine whether a worker is an employee or an independent contractor. assembly bill 5 is just an attempt by the legislature to codify the dynamex decision of the supreme court.
for those who aren't aware, there are a number of states that have abc test. the a prong says an individual must be free of control and direction. the b prong is service has to be performed outside the usual course of business of the employer. and the c prong is the individual is customarily engage in an independently established trade, occupation, profession or business. this is intended to address individuals who are classified as independent contractors. we believe it's largely directed at the ride-sharing and food delivery business in california. and because fedex ground only contracts with businesses that are incorporated in a good standing in the states in which they operate. we, therefore, have no individuals who are classified as independent contractors.
all service provider or employees under contract to fedex ground are subject to tax withholdings and are eligible for workers comp, unemployment insurance and over time. and all of our service providers are contractually obligated to treat their workers as employees are registered, as i said, in a good standing with the states and agreed to compliance audits by the company. so, therefore, we think that any risks that would accrue to fedex ground would be minimal to non-existent, the way the bill is currently structured.

helane becker with cowen and company has our next question.
helane becker -- cowen and company -- analyst
thanks, operator. hi, everybody. thank you very much for the time. brie, i think you talked about demand from china being down between china and the us and china and europe. but did you speak at all to goods going from china to third countries? and then how those volumes are doing, for example, china to vietnam and then vietnam to the us or taiwan or places elsewhere in asia? so, maybe you could talk about trends you're seeing and goods moving that way, if at all?
brie carere -- executive vice president, chief marketing and communications officer
so great question. obviously, right now, from an outlook perspective, we are seeing pressure on all intercontinental and even within asia, all of intra-asia really is connected from a supply chain perspective. so even if it isn't direct to china, we are seeing a lot of pressure intra-asia. what i think is most important to note is, we both raj and i mentioned, is we are under-penetrated from a market share perspective between asia and europe and europe to asia. we now have unleashed an incredible buyer base in europe, which we never had access to before and we have traditionally been very underpenetrated in this lane, and jill and i are locked arm and arm to grow share despite the macroeconomic headwinds. so i think that's really what's most important and that's what's newsworthy for us as we think about growth moving forward.

hi, everyone. thank you for taking our question asking on behalf of david vernon. how should we think about the greater than 20% increase in corporate center loss? and is there any outlook there?
alan b. graf -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
well, we have moved fedex office out to its own now, as you noticed, and while fedex office itself, for reporting purposes, reports a loss gives you that as a channel cost, if you like. it's a vital channel and we've talked about this over and over and over again, our most profitable packages come through fedex office. fedex office has got many, many places where you can pick up, drop off great relationship going with in-store at walmart. so, i wouldn't be too concerned about that. we have work to do on our logistics side of the house. we are working very hard on that. and i expect those will improve over time. but really at the end of the day, the real -- again, the real issue, i want to make sure i get this clear to everybody, all the things we've talked about, our issue is international at express.
operator
now from deutsche bank, we'll move to amit mehrotra.
amit mehrotra -- deutsche bank -- analyst
thanks. thanks for squeezing me in here. just wanted to ask if you think 2020 will represent a trough in ground margins that you can build on in 2021, given the, i guess, the smartpost integration? and then can you just update us on the integration of tnt businesses in the uk, france and germany? where are those countries, given their size and when do you expect the integration to be complete for those regions? thank you.
alan b. graf -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
i think that was two. i think we've answered them both, but i'll try to stab at this again. we will be complete with those countries at the end of may 2020. again, as you have well pointed out in your note, we were a little bit late, a little bit over budget on that. thank you for that.
and as far as fedex ground margins, again, we will have a lot of these things behind us, it will depend on our mix and the economic environment about how fast we can move margins up, but we do expect our zone one traffic to grow rapidly and although at lower yield it will be at higher margins.
operator
and with that, at this time, i'd like to turn things back to you all for any additional or closing remarks.
mickey foster -- vice president of investor relations

and now, fred smith, will share his views on the quarter.
frederick w. smith -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you, everyone, good afternoon and we appreciate your participating in our second quarter fy '20 call. as we've said before, we continue to be in a period of challenges and changes before addressing specific issues, let me thank over 490,000 fedex team members around the world for delivering an outstanding peak season for our customers.
first, let me deal with the challenges. the quarter just ended is an anomaly because of the compressed shipping season before christmas, necessitating a significant bow wave of expenses and volumes that will largely fall in our third fiscal quarter. in addition, this quarter has seen significant effects on the industrial economy due to continuing trade disputes, including reductions in international air freight and tepid at best b2b domestic parcel and freight shipping. despite these issues, we remain highly confident in our strategies, which we believe will begin to bear fruit by our fourth fiscal quarter and then into fy '21, absent negative macroeconomic developments.
now the changes. as we announced last summer, fedex is aggressively expanding north american packages -- package services for the rapidly growing e-commerce market to include year-round seven-day delivery, in sourcing most smartpost volumes formally given to the postal service, standing up more dedicated ground large package facilities, given the remarkable growth in demand for the delivery of oversize items and new unique short-haul services.
while these are the most visible changes, numerous other new technologies and operating processes are being deployed to ensure we can profitably deliver increasing numbers of lighter weight residential packages. these strategies are being well received in the marketplace with record peak volume -- package volumes which are substantially above last year and well over forecast with excellent service levels and high overall customer satisfaction. in the fourth fiscal quarter, we forecast fedex ground margins will again be in the teens.
the second area of strategic change is in fedex express international operations to include the completion of european ground interoperability in the fourth quarter of fiscal year '20. also, we are taking down the intercontinental capacity right after christmas as our hopes for a restoration in trade growth expressed last june, has simply not materialized due to the trade dispute.
given these two major initiatives as fedex express roles into fy '21, we believe we will improve profitability in the segment. while we have numerous other programs under way in fedex freight, fedex logistics and fedex office that are extremely important, there are two additional areas that deserve comment, our focus on yields and capex which brie, raj and alan will cover in detail in their remarks.
in regard to capex, let me just emphasize, we are deferring capital if not essential for safety service or replacement or obsolescence. longer term by fiscal '22 year end, the replacement of 159 a310 and md-10 aircraft will be complete. this will lead to a significant reduction in the corporation's ongoing capital expenditures on both an absolute basis and percent of revenues from fy '23 forward.
now brie, raj and alan, will comment. then we'll answer your questions. brie?
brie carere -- executive vice president, chief marketing and communications officer
thank you, fred. good afternoon everyone, i will open with our economic outlook, then dive directly into commercial strategy and how we're delivering some incredible solutions for our customers that will position fedex to drive increased profit. economic growth in the us slowed in calendar year 2019 and we continue to see a split between solid consumer economy and a struggling manufacturing sector.
consumers are supported by a robust labor market while manufacturers have been hampered by trade policy uncertainty and an ongoing inventory correction. the latest developments on trade are positive, but uncertainty remains. the avoidance of tariffs on approximately $160 billion of goods, scheduled for december 15, and the reduction of tariffs in the september 1 list on a $120 billion from 15% to 7.5% is, in fact, a good news. we look forward to continued progress and the signing of a phase 1 deal in january.
further, we believe that the uk is now in position to manage a more predictable and orderly brexit. our economic outlook does not reflect any continued trade momentum beyond the two changes mentioned to the tariffs above are current. in the eurozone, manufacturing production appears to be stabilizing at low level. germany's industrial sector, however, is still in decline. looking ahead to calendar year '20, european gdp growth rates will likely remain in line with where they are now.
in asia, china's slowdown is expected to continue through the first half of the year, but should have some opportunity in the back half of 2020. total trade between the european union and china slowed significantly in calendar year 2019 as slower growth and impacts from trade tensions have weighed on trade flows. global trade volumes contracted year-over-year again in calendar quarter three and will show a contraction for the full calendar year. we should see a return to positive growth for calendar year '20, assuming no reescalation in trade tensions.
now, turning to what we can control, we are laser-focused on executing strategy centered on five areas: e-commerce, international profitability, market leading revenue quality, b2b growth and operational excellence and innovation which raj will cover. we are evolving our global portfolio and are already winning significant new e-commerce business. while we are excited about the future of e-commerce, we continue to have teams dedicated to the growth of our core b2b business. also, we have found great opportunities to grow within the b2b market by leading with our innovated e-commerce portfolio, which i will come back to in a moment.
at fedex ground, we have the market leading e-commerce portfolio. we continue to see strong demand across all customer segments with our new seven-day service. we will increase our speed advantage during the new year. our sunday roll-out will speed up some lanes by one and two full transit days. this will increase our advantage significantly. and as you know, we are already faster by at least one day when compared to ups's ground service in 25% of lanes. it is also really important to note our speed advantage and seven-day service is also very valuable for the premium b2b sectors, including healthcare and perishables shippers.
we are equally excited about our returns offerings, which are growing at double-digit rates year-over-year. with our expanded retail presence and low returns market share, i am confident we will see this growth accelerate and continue for many years. returns is a quickly growing market with 15% of e-commerce orders are returned. returns are attractive growth segment, because it's basically a b2b move.
in fy '20, we've seen significant growth of our retail location including walgreens and dollar general as well as the volume within these locations. year to date, we have expanded our presence in 1,800 dollar general stores, reaching 14,000 staffed hall locations where customers can come and retrieve their packages. we will continue to expand in the new year and by peak season of next year, 90% of the us population will be within five miles of a fedex drop off and pick up location.
at fedex express, we are enhancing the value propositions we are famous for, our premium time-definite services for commercial shippers. we are rapidly innovating to leverage technology to increase control, security and visibility for express customer base. we will continue to lean into sensor-based technology to differentiate our services for healthcare, aerospace and high-tech segments.
turning to freight, last quarter we discussed our fedex freight direct service, which provides freight deliveries right to or through the front door. freight direct currently covers 81% of the us population and is anticipated to cover 90% by this coming july. fedex freight direct is a market-leading value proposition, including a two-hour delivery window to your room of choice with full packaging removal, delivered of course by our fedex team members. we have a strong pipeline and expect some prominent retailers to begin using the service in january. the pipeline for b2b customers for freight direct is also very strong as we see great opportunities to deliver to spas, dental offices and schools.
revenue quality is one of our five key strategies. we will continue to deliver strong market performance in this area. first, we are excited about our momentum in the small business segment. secondly, we continue to strategically manage our portfolio of large customers. and finally, we continue to manage both annual increases and contract negotiations to ensure we are appropriately compensated for the comprehensive service we provide. as an example, we announced rate increases for large packages for jan -- this coming january. fedex continues to experience strong demand for transportation of larger and heavier packages. the rate increases reflect our commitment to continually invest in our business, while responsibly managing capacities through our network to maintain outstanding service for these larger packages.
turning to international and our focus on improved profitability. i am confident in our growth prospects in europe. we have seen year-over-year momentum and growth in our parcel volume intra-europe and intercontinental to the us from europe, we have the strongest pipeline and activation for commercial that i have seen since the beginning of integration. we are creating momentum as a result of having the sales integration behind us now. further, we are leveraging our world-class us domestic network to penetrate the e-commerce market from europe to the us . as i mentioned on our last call, we are far less penetrated in e-commerce outside of the us, compared to our competitors. we have quickly pivoted to develop necessary solutions and are confident this represents a significant opportunity for both our europe and our apac regions.
finally, fedex kicked off the peak season with a stunning cyber monday and a feat made possible by the best team members in the business.
raj will discuss peak in more detail. so, let me now turn the call over to him for his remarks.
rajesh subramaniam -- president and chief operating officer
thank you, brie, and good afternoon everyone.
i too would like to start by extending a sincere thank you to our more than 490,000 team members who are working relentlessly to deliver a successful peak season for our customers and we are off to an exceptionally strong start this compressed peak season. as data indicates, we moved 37.8 million packages on cyber monday. this exceeded our published projections of more than 33 million packages and represents a 17% increase over cyber monday last year.
additionally, december 9 and december 16 which was yesterday, both were historic volume days for fedex. our outstanding service during peak is supported by our people and the significant investments we have made in the fedex ground network over the past two decades.
now, turning to q2, i'm not pleased with our financial results. and to that end, we have focus areas across the enterprise on b2b, e-commerce, international profitability, market-leading revenue quality and operational excellence. in the short term, this includes targeted actions to shore up our financial performance. we expect a reduction in intercontinental and domestic air capacity post peak and an overall reduction of costs in our express business. this action should result in the decrease of international and domestic flight hours by about 6% to 8% year-over-year in q4.
additionally, we're permanently retiring our fleet of 10 a-310s. the reduction in flight hours would allow us to temporarily park 14 aircraft by the end of fiscal year '20. we will also permanently retire another 29 aircraft over the next 30 months. it is imperative that while we reduce our cost to serve, we also drive higher yields to improve profitability. capacity reductions will bring greater focus on revenue quality as we generate more compensatory volume through the network.
as brie mentioned, we're once again implementing our rate increase in january and have added further increases on extra service and surcharges. yields will also benefit from gains in our share of the small and medium shipper market and renewed focus on b2b shipments.
at fedex freight, we continue to focus on yield management, profitable growth and aligning our cost structure to the lower volumes throughout fy '20. these efforts have enabled fedex freight to significantly offset the impact from softening economic condition. this is yet another example of matching capacity to demand.
fedex ground is experiencing cost headwinds as we undergo a remarkable transformation to seven-day service. with the late thanksgiving this year, we incurred peak ramp-up costs in q2 with none of the revenue benefit. additionally, due to the slowdown in industrial production and other macroeconomic factors, commercial traffic has not been what we expected. our b2b business provides greater density and stronger yields than b2c and so, we are renewing our focus on commercial traffic, which makes up a significant portion of our ground volume.
however, recognizing that e-commerce is the fastest growing segment in our business, we are working to position fedex ground as the b2c player. we've spend years enhancing our network and today, our fedex ground network is well equipped for handling this rapidly growing market including seven-day operations for the majority of the us and the dedicated large package operations for handling the growth in heavy and bulky items moving through the ground network.
we're also increasing efficiency through technology as part of this network transformation. this includes offering technology to our service providers, which we call dynamic route optimization or dro, the system in preparing for increased residential volume associated with e-commerce growth. dro technology provides near real-time data that service providers can use to optimize route planning.
additionally, service providers may use this data to make decisions regarding their vehicle mix and workforce to accommodate the increase in both small and large packages. this new technology and data visibility allows service providers to make dynamic decisions about the most effective and productive way to run their business as well. all of this is expected to drive efficiency, while further strengthening the reliability of both the residential and commercial fedex ground service. looking ahead, our investments in this business ensure we are optimizing capacity and productivity in the long term.
turning to europe, we are on track to meet the may, 31, 2020 target date for interoperability of the intra-european ground networks. this will lower costs as related fedex express operations are optimized. in fiscal year '21, the next key milestone will be the completion of the integration of the remaining pickup and delivery operations in europe, and during the first half of fiscal '22, we'll will complete the air network integration, bringing to close the physical network integration of tnt into fedex. we're progressing toward important milestones and we have significant commercial momentum. our sales pipeline is strong and activation is the best it has been since we started the integration.
as we grow our intra-european parcel business, it will benefit from a lower pickup and delivery cost. and looking ahead, the rationale behind the tnt acquisition remains sound. the value that we estimated at the beginning of the process, remains largely achievable. as i have said before, fedex remains committed to delivering long-term profitable growth. in the near term, we are focused on decreasing cost and improving revenue quality. and we continue to be very excited about our prospects ahead as we transform the ground company, complete the tnt integration and rightsize our network. given a more stable economic environment, these measures should produce strong results for the corporation.
now, let me turn it over to alan graf to provide details on our financials. alan?
alan b. graf -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
thank you very much, raj, and good afternoon everyone.
let me start by saying our second quarter results were very disappointing and i will discuss the drivers and actions we are taking. but first, let me take a minute to provide further context around our strategy and the decisions we have made.
for many years, a fundamental component of our strategy and investment was capitalizing on the growth of global trade which has powered economic development around the globe since world war ii. as recently as 18 months ago, we were seeing accelerating returns from our differentiated international network with greater capabilities imminent as we continued with the tnt integration. while we are encouraged by and supportive of the recent trade agreement with china, it is clear that the dynamics of trade growth have changed and we must adapt accordingly.
in addition, following the passage of the tax cuts and jobs act in december of 2017, we reviewed our capital priorities and accelerated intentionally the essential replacement of our oldest aircraft due to the incentives within the tcja. these investments amid the current environment are impacting our financial performance.
getting back to second quarter results, weak global trade and manufacturing drove less-than-expected demand for our most profitable package and freight services across all our business segments. these conditions are especially challenging in europe where capacity and network reduction opportunities are limited due to the current stage of integration as we are operating duplicate road and air networks. as we've discussed, cost headwinds at fedex ground are largely driven by the expansion to six-day and seven-day delivery, due to a minimum number of employees required to staff and operate the new schedule prior to the volume and revenue coming online. the loss of volume from amazon had a larger negative impact to the second quarter than the first quarter, since the fedex ground contract with amazon expired in august.
year-over-year comparisons for the second quarter were also negatively impacted by the later timing of thanksgiving as raj mentioned and i can't emphasize enough, which resulted in the shifting of cyber week revenues into december. the headwinds of the expansion to six-day and seven-day delivery, the loss of amazon's volume and cyber week shifting to the third quarter accounted for approximately 60% of the ground margin decline year-over-year. higher self-insurance accruals also negatively impacted ground margins by approximately 90 basis points. package and freight yields across our businesses have been negatively impacted due to a mix shift to lower-priced services, lower weight per shipment and an increasingly competitive pricing environment, depreciation increase with strategic investment programs, including the modernization of fedex express aircraft and hubs and investments in technology across the enterprise that will further optimize our networks as well as enhance safety and capabilities. partially offsetting these negative factors were the benefits from a tax benefit of $133 million from the recognition of certain foreign tax loss carryforwards and approximate $65 million decrease in variable incentive compensation and increased revenue per shipment at fedex freight is doing quite well.
fedex express recorded asset impairment charges of $66 million related to the permanent retirement of 10 airbus a310-300 aircraft and 12 related engines. the company is continuing to evaluate if additional aircraft retirements are warranted.
for fiscal 2020, we are now forecasting adjusted earnings per share of $10.25 to $11.50. our revised guidance reflects lower than expected revenue in each transportation segment and higher than expected expenses driven by the continued mix shift to residential services. in response, we are implementing reductions to the global fedex express air network to better match capacity with demand. we are also further restricting hiring and pursuing opportunities to optimize our networks, including investments in technology, aimed at improving our productivity and continuing to lower our costs. year-over-year adjusted operating profit comparison should improve in q3 and q4 relative to q2, and as fred said, we are optimistic about fy '21. we now expect to incur approximately $325 million of tnt integration expenses in fy '20 and $1.7 billion in total through fy '21.
we expect to begin realizing synergies from the integration of fedex express and tnt ground networks during fy '21 and these synergies are expected to increase significantly after the completion of the air network integration in fy '22. improving residential package density is a key aspect of ground strategy to combat residential delivery cost challenges. we expect delivery density to improve as we further integrate the delivery of fedex smartpost operations into our standard ground operations in calendar year 2020.
ground's performance will also benefit as we roll out technology solutions like dynamic route optimization and more automated small package orders to more locations in 2020. our fy 20 effective tax rate prior to the year-end mark-to-market retirement plan accounting adjustment is now expected to be 23% to 26%.
we continue to expect fy '20 capital spending to be approximately $5.9 billion and fy '21 capital spending is anticipated to be similar to fy '20. we are continuing to review our planned spending, and as fred stated earlier, our capital intensity is expected to decline significantly after fy '22 as committed aircraft deliveries are substantially lower in fy '23 and beyond.
our forecasts assume moderate us economic growth, current fuel price expectations and no further weakening in international economic conditions. a further ramping in anti-trade measures and/or adverse changes in international trade policies and relations would likely drive additional weakness in our business.
in conclusion, we are disappointed with our current results, but we are optimistic our long-term performance will benefit from an increased focus on revenue quality, reductions to the global fedex air network to better match capacity with demand, a more competitive solution for european customers through the completion of our tnt integration, modernization of our expressed aircraft fleet and hubs, better utilization of our fedex ground assets from the expansion to seven-day operations, improved residential density through the further integration of fedex smartpost packages into standard ground operations, and continued investments in technology across our business to automate and optimize operations, reduce costs and enable more real-time decision making.
with that operator, we now can open it for questions.
",":
operator
thank you. (operator instructions) and our first question today will come from allison landry with credit suisse.
allison landry -- credit suisse -- analyst
thanks, good afternoon. excuse my voice. i just wanted to ask about the ground segment and specifically the 6% inflation and cost per piece in the flat revenue per piece, which i think is the biggest delta going pretty far back in history. i know there is an element of timing of the cyber week, but how should we think about the cadence of these metrics in q3 and q4 basically just trying to understand how we can get comfortable with the margin snapping back to the double-digit level by q4? thank you.
frederick w. smith -- chairman and chief executive officer
allison. thank you for the question. let me just start off and then i will have henry answer the details here, but the most important thing that happened to us here was the timing. we have as we -- on the calendar, we incurred a lot of the costs of running up to peak in q2 with none of the revenue benefits as we talked about. and that -- you combine that with the slowing down of the commercial segment, resulted in the results for q2. let me turn it over to henry to see what he has to add.
henry j. maier -- president & chief executive officer of fedex ground
yeah, hi, allison. the thing i would add here is that, most of the costs you're seeing is the timing of peak and the six-day and seven-day operation being set up. we began operating seven days a week on november 3 and it's going to take a while for the volume and revenue and the network to catch up and cover the expense. and i think i didn't hear the full part of your first question, but i think it had something to do with yields, and i think that as raj probably said is due to mix.
operator
and our next question will come from chris wetherbee with citi.
chris wetherbee -- citi -- analyst
hey. i guess, i wanted to pick up where allison left off on the ground side and maybe understand things a little bit better and then kind of get into this cost inflation that we're seeing here. so, you outlined a couple of different items there that i think were somewhat unique to the quarter. i think about 60% of the margin degradation that you called out from the six-day and 7-day plus the timing shift of cyber week and then 90 basis points for insurance, when you think about the revenue growth of $170 million plus, your profit still fell by almost $40 million. so, how do we think about that sort of relative $200 million of incremental costs that you incurred outside of those specific items and kind of how do we think about sort of the walk from that kind of core run rate to something that i guess looks like teens in 4q?
rajesh subramaniam -- president and chief operating officer
this is raj again. and thank you, chris. i think i'm not sure what i can add other than to say that we had a run-up on costs putting the seven-day operation in place and then getting ready for peak. we going to -- there is a significant demand for seven-day. we are going to be differentiated with the competition then the customer demand is very high and that's going to come on post peak and that's going to be very helpful for us. and then, in recovery we see in the industrial segment of the economy and driving b2b which is a renewed focus for us that will be very helpful. henry?
henry j. maier -- president & chief executive officer of fedex ground
well, i'm not sure what more i would add there. i mean, we've talked about this. most of the cost, 60% of the of the margin impact as alan pointed out is the timing of peak this year. and by the way it's a -- it's a peak that six days less than last year. so you have -- you have this volume that has to be handled in a much shorter timeline than it did last year that takes more drivers, that takes more package handlers, that takes more line-haul etc across the operation to get done. and then there is a bow wave of costs with the implementation of six-day and seven-day that wasn't in these numbers last year. every day at fedex ground is now a service day and it takes a minimal number of people in order to staff these operations to provide the service.
operator
and our next question will come from jordan alliger with goldman sachs.
jordan robert alliger -- goldman sachs group inc. -- analyst
yeah, hi. just -- sorry, following up on that again. i mean, i understand the timing issues and the mix shifts etc, but can you maybe talk a little bit more going forward, how do we avoid these sort of issues because it seems to me that the macro really didn't get that much worse. so, this must be largely costs related and what have you and i just want to make sure that going forward with the stuff that you're doing, this type of event and timing is going to be minimized because i had imagined -- we knew about the shorter peak season. so, i'm just a little confused because the hit was just so big.
frederick w. smith -- chairman and chief executive officer
well, this is smith here. i don't know, again, how much more of that raj and henry and alan can say about. it's standing up to six-day and seven-day network was very expensive for us and the the expense for peak in general which is always put upfront was a total drag. and we certainly anticipated some of it, but we probably underestimated the cost of standing it up and then, when we went into the peak season as raj also said, we had an unbelievable response. we had 37 million packages on cyber monday and our plan was for 33 million.
so, we have said, clearly, that we believe by the fourth quarter, ground's margins will be back into the teens. we're not able to show you our spreadsheets, but that's our cost projections. and yes, there's no question. we spent more to put the network up than we thought, but we never put up a six-day or seven-day ground network before for a permanent thing.
so they are a little bit of new ground for us, but no question we missed on the cost side, but it's up and operating. as raj said, we probably never had a response in the recent past from our ground customers like we've had. brie can perhaps add to that on seven-day and it's an entirely differentiated product and it's also something that's going to substantially change the e-commerce business. and the last weekend that just finished, we delivered over 14 million packages on saturday and sunday. we weren't even deliver an packages on the weekend a couple of years ago.
so, we're pretty confident where we're going and clearly, we didn't do the greatest job of forecasting our cost and we were hit with a couple of other things like the insurance reserves, which are looking backward some period of time, that's basically because of the litigious society we live in and the more expenses required to operate a transportation company in general, which is a huge issue to the small transportation company.
so, we've answered it three times and we're pretty confident about the fourth quarter and we gave you some aiming stakes, but i don't know that is productive to plow this ground anymore.
operator
and with stephens, we'll hear from jack atkins.
jack atkins -- stephens -- analyst
good evening and thank you for the opportunity to ask a question. so i guess, asking a ground question not related to the six-day and seven-day, but kind of thinking about your pricing commentary, both in the press release and in the 10-q, you referenced increased pricing competition there, which is sort of eroding pricing power and we certainly saw it this quarter. so, whether it's henry or raj or brie, could you maybe talk about sort of what's going on there from an industry perspective and why is pricing power eroding given that obviously significant demand for home delivery services.
brie carere -- executive vice president, chief marketing and communications officer
yeah, great question. thank you, jack. i think a couple of things to clarify. one, as henry mentioned, the primary yield pressure we felt at ground in the past quarter was really due to a mix and the pressure on our commercial business, which is obviously a very important segment to us and that was linked directly to decrease in industrial production. when we think about revenue quality and our ability to continue to command a premium in the market, which we do in every segment that i measure, we actually get a competitive premium over the service.
number one, the seven-day value proposition is opening doors like it never has before for us. so, we really do believe that that gives us great ability to negotiate. number two, we are managing the revenue quality and ensuring that every pricing [indecipherable] contributes. so you saw that addition what we made for large packages, but as we're managing our large customer portfolio, not all customers are equal. we're making sure we get the b2b and the b2c bundle, and we're also making sure that when we grow with seven-day that we've got a strong mix of small business, which we have seen. i just looked at the seven-day activation report and it is very strong. customers are actually switching to fedex during peak to be ready for the seven-day launch in january, which is really something quite unprecedented.
rajesh subramaniam -- president and chief operating officer
and this is raj again. at the risk of being repetitive, i cannot underemphasize the -- our focus on revenue quality. we are -- renewed focus on b2b, gaining on small and medium segment and all the things that brie just talked about, this is very important for us.
operator
our next question today will come from scott group with wolfe research.
scott group -- wolfe research -- analyst
hey, thanks. afternoon, guys. so, fred, i want to ask, we've got record low margins, i think, here and i heard you talk about restricting hiring but why are we talking about more drastic cost and headcount reductions. i know it's may be different, but it strikes me that some of the rails are cutting headcount 10%, 15% without severance costs. do we have any opportunity to do anything like that. and then, just separately, i know you talked about express profits improving next year. do you have any visibility on ground profits for next year?
frederick w. smith -- chairman and chief executive officer
well, i'll have to ask alan if he is prepared to make a forecast for fy '21, but -- which i doubt because he hadn't forecasted to me if he had, but the reality is, to your first question, the rails are not even a remotely comparable business to fedex. it's essentially a business of maintaining tracks and automating to the extent possible, you have an or of 60%. it's not labor-intensive. it's getting less labor-intensive than when you follow the precepts of hunter harrison and smart railroading or whatever [indecipherable] calling, that's what's allowing the precision railroading. that's what's allowing the rails to lower their cost. they are quasi-monopolies, certainly in the geographic areas and certainly to particular customers. so, i don't know that rail is significant.
the second part about this business is, we are, in many ways, spoke to our customers for long-term relationships and if you walk away from customers and disadvantage them and if you break the morale of your troops by not investing in service quality that has long-term deleterious effects. that certainly has been a consideration in europe for mentioning in tnt.
so, of course, we could have done some more drastic things, but i think at the end of the day, the focus on the short-term financial results are only based on what we see for the fourth quarter into '21 and the strategies we're exercising. we have not decided to go down that road. now, maybe, somebody else feels differently about that, but i don't think you can keep the purple promise laying all thousands of people and i think that's one of the considerations again we've had in europe is to make sure that people over there we acquired with tnt were fairly treated. we're invested in delivering that kind of fedex service.
so, it's a value judgment. no question, we could have been more draconian i guess in certain areas, but we're -- as we've said several times, pretty optimistic about where we're headed and going into january assuming there is no more macro economic deterioration. i might also say that i think in this country, there is a little bit of misunderstanding -- estimation of what's going on in the rest of the world, the e-commerce growth, the technology sector that we had, the tax cut, all of these things have led us to have a high increasing employment. it's led us to have reasonable gdp growth. that's virtually not true any place else in the world.
and the industrial economy, particularly in europe which was hit by the ricocheting bullets of the us china trade war, almost went into recession this time last year and it still hasn't recovered and germany in particular is extreme. and i think one of the things that raj has said and brie has said, it's extremely important here. the us industrial economy, which is much more tied to international trade and, of course, the gm strike and now the max shut down, it's been negative for months now. and so, our b2b ground volume is growing and our, what is it john, which our freight volume, it's up a little bit or about flat.
john a. smith -- president and chief executive officer, fedex freight.
it's flat to down.
frederick w. smith -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. and so that's a reflection of the industrial economy large and in truckload carrier, they just went bankrupt, celadon. so, it's really a tale of two economies and the stock market, of course, is very bullish, but the industrial economy does not reflect any growth at all, worldwide, to speak up.
john a. smith -- president and chief executive officer, fedex freight.
so let me try to give you a little bit more detail on that. first of all, a couple of things we didn't mention about our miss here in the second quarter. we got substantially less commercial volume at ground than we had forecast, which was a big impact. high density, higher yield, heavier packages that didn't materialize, our commercial growth is about flat. secondly, we operate in an extremely competitive labor market these days and we've seen wage inflation in certain markets due to increased competition for personnel. that was a little higher than we anticipated.
so having said that, we are at the bottom. our adjusted operating profit decline year-over-year is horrific and it's going to improve -- it's going to improve in q3 and it's going to improve substantially in q4 versus the prior year's adjusted operating income that won't be -- the miss so bad we might not be back to where we were last year, but we will be a lot closer, obviously, than how wildly we were in the second quarter.
the other thing is, is that, i think, if you think about all the positive things we've said and that we're seeing, as we get into '21, we will start lapping the amazon. we will have a lot more of the six-day and seven-day on our belt and we're going to be delivering millions of packages on sunday for the rest of this fiscal year rolling into '21. we'll finally start getting -- turning the corner in europe with the operational synergies that will start soon and also will grow during the year.
i've got nothing in this current range for any sort of a trade deal because we haven't gotten one yet. do we have some upside there, if that happens, we will even have more upside into '21. so we're not giving you specifics. we're at the bottom and we're going to come up off the mat and we're going to improve through the rest of this year and into the next.
operator
our next question today will come from allison poliniak with wells fargo.
allison poliniak -- wells fargo -- analyst
hi, guys. just kind of going back to your commentary around europe, obviously, seeing some stabilization there. the german sentiment and tax is starting to trend a little bit more optimistically. i guess, any color on, maybe, a potential improvement there and your ability to flex that network as you're bringing some of those aircraft or partnering some of the aircraft now.
rajesh subramaniam -- president and chief operating officer
yeah. again, thanks for that question. yes we -- we are actually -- the commercial velocity that we are seeing in europe is quite good. as we talked about earlier, it's the best we've seen since the beginning of the integration and the parcel of volume growth intra-europe and in europe is starting to starting to park up here. so, and the -- at the same time, we are starting to click off our integration milestones. and the next -- as i pointed out earlier, we will, by end of may of this fiscal year '20, we are expecting to be interoperable and then proceed on to fiscal year '21.
so, we are not waiting for the full integration to get all the benefits. we are generating those as we speak and we are seeing the volume growth come and good commercial velocity. i'm going to turn it over to don for any comments you may have on europe.
donald f. colleran -- president and chief executive office, fedex express
thanks raj, and thanks for the opportunity to add a little bit of color to what you've already shared. like you and the rest of the team, i remain very confident in our strategy in europe and what we're seeing relative to the plans we're executing. i think it would help a little bit when we talk about interoperability and integration on the ground to kind of define what that means. so, what that really is, it's our ability to flow volume between networks supported by the proper technology. it allows us to do that in a very efficient way. so, what does that mean.
so, that allows us to link import and transit clearance processes, enables cross-sort [phonetic] capabilities for our packages in a dual network. it allows us to enable inter sub-capability and it links our a-hubs and our ground networks. so what are we seeing over the short term and what are we seeing in our business right now. so, as we communicated on previous calls, we remain on schedule to have the ground interoperability completed by the end of this fiscal year, which is made for us, and on the air side, in october of '21 -- calendar '21, we realize benefits each and every day as we complete our integration tasks.
to give you an example, we sped up almost 1,800 lanes in our european theater, that's 40% of our total lanes are either faster by one or two days and our customers are responding very positive to that. raj and brie talked about the pipeline activity and that's all well and good, but what i measure our results are, what we're seeing in our airplanes in our trucks. and we're seeing some nice revenue momentum in our business right now. that's really where we begin to -- begin to see the synergies in this leverage in our business. as we integrate the networks and at the same time we add parcel volume into it, that's where the music really begins to happen.
so, i feel very positive about where we are. we remain on schedule. we have the european team in here. last week raj and i and brie and jill, we spent a lot of time in amsterdam with the team. so, we are on schedule as we've communicated. we're beginning to see some of the benefits and we'll continue to see the benefits as we transition in the back half of this fiscal year into the next fiscal year.
operator
and our next question will come from scott schneeberger with oppenheimer.
scott schneeberger -- oppenheimer -- analyst
thanks very much. touching on tnt, you essentially reiterated kind of the timeframe of the integration. i'm just curious -- you mentioned the sales pipeline is strong and i think it was activations where the best that they've been. could you elaborate a little bit on that? and please speak to the competitive dynamic you're facing as you're trying to repenetrate there. thanks.
brie carere -- executive vice president, chief marketing and communications officer
well, i think we've really answered. this is brie speaking. i think don and raj and i have covered most of this. i think two things. one, to don's point, commercial volume intra-europe for parcel is growing and we are very excited about that growth, that has been the strongest we have seen. the next lever, we really are pulling as quickly as we can is e-commerce. from a competitive comparison within our express business. that is something that our competition is ahead of us. they have about 5% to 6% or -- 5 times to 6 times the amount of e-commerce volume that we have intra-europe. so, that is really boeing [phonetic] their results.
we are moving very quickly. a year ago, just to put this in context, we had nine leads on e-commerce and i'm giving you that number to show the momentum that we have. we are now actively managing a 1,000 e-commerce customers through our sales pipe and intra-europe alone. we have very quickly pivoted. because of the economic conditions we have to grow in e-commerce and to don's point, the european network is ready to grow from an e-commerce perspective as we've been able to improve our value proposition and grow in europe.
so, number one, we're growing commercially into europe. number two, we've got strong momentum from an e-commerce in europe that's coming now.
rajesh subramaniam -- president and chief operating officer
the only thing i would add to that -- what's encouraging to me is the fact that this growth is happening in light of where it's not a very strong macroeconomic sort of circumstances. so, the team is out there. we believe it. they are taking share. they're growing our business aggressively. we're hoping as both, i think, fred and alan mentioned earlier on a more macro level, the certainty that comes along with hopefully some good news on brexit also has us encouraged, although, we haven't dialed that into our plan. so, i like where we sit. i like how the team is executing right now as we go into the back half of the year.
operator
and next, we'll hear from ben hartford with baird.
ben hartford -- baird -- analyst
hi, good evening. just interested in your perspective on ab5 and what changes, if any, it may have to the way that the ground model is constructed or any potential benefits that may bring about in the market, given some of these disruptions. just would appreciate an update there as it relates to ab5 and some potential consequences.
henry j. maier -- president & chief executive officer of fedex ground
hey, ben. it's henry maier. ab5 legislation relates to the legal test under which an individual's employment classification should be determined under california law. since 2011, fedex ground has only contracted with independent incorporated companies, not individuals, and they must classify and treat their staff as employees under applicable state and local laws. so at this time, we don't believe it impacts us. thanks.
operator
our next question today comes from brandon oglenski with barclays.
brandon oglenski -- barclays -- analyst
hey, good afternoon, everyone, and happy holidays. so i guess, coming back to the analog between the rails, i guess, the question does make sense from the perspective that the rails didn't earn a great return on capital for a long time. then there was a bold new way to run the business. and so, i guess, along those lines, when should shareholders expect that fedex goes under like a portfolio of products review of everything offered at express and where is the plan to get those products earning their cost of capital in the future because there's just a history of that not happening?
alan b. graf -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
this is alan. well, we've done that. we were asked earlier about there are some big bold move. i think you have any idea how big 8% reduction of flight hours is, but it's tremendously large. we're not going to grow our fleet. we're just replacing it. we're tightening it up and reducing flight hours. express's domestic margins are fine. so, it's the international that we got to keep working on. we've been dragged down by tnt. some of it self-reflected, some of it macro. we're handling the flight hours. i think we're doing everything that we can and that we should be doing. well, our capex is going to drop significantly after we get past fy '22. as i said, those are essential aircraft replacements which we need. and for flight -- and more flight hours, we'll be md-11 [indecipherable] we anticipated, but we don't expect any growth there beyond that. i think a 6% to 7% of revenue in 2023 and beyond will start to show a significant improvement in our roic and roe. so, as i look out there, again, it's -- i'm frustrated. i'm sure our investors are frustrated. we're here at the bottom, but we can see a way out.
operator
next, we'll hear from tom wadewitz with ubs.
tom wadewitz -- ubs -- analyst
yeah, good afternoon. appreciate the question. alan, you just mentioned that the magnitude of the cost take out from the, i guess, 8% air network capacity reduction is pretty significant. is there any way that you can help us think about how to translate that to cost? i think in the past you had talked about international, like us frequencies being kind of $50 million to $100 million and operating income impact for taking out of frequency. i just -- is there -- is this hundreds of millions of dollars of cost savings? is it $50 million? so anyway you can help us think about the magnitude? thank you.
alan b. graf -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
well [indecipherable] getting exactly those details because it depends on where the flight hours are and everything else. it's a significant number. and at the same time, we expect to be improving the revenue quality on it significantly. so, we should get it from the top line and the bottom line. and i'll turn over to don. i mean, he's been leading the planning on this and i think it's outstanding.
donald f. colleran -- president and chief executive office, fedex express
thanks, alan. i won't get into the specific -- on the numbers as you suggested, but what i can tell you, we've made -- we have made and will continue to make significant reductions in our flight hours, both in the us as well as outside the us. as we mentioned, our business in the us is in a pretty healthy position, but we lost a significant customer.
so, what have we done in response to that? well, we've taken significant cost out of our us business, inclusive of flight hours, in a significant amount, labor savings, aircraft maintenance and vehicle savings. so, we are looking at this every way, not only in terms of what we're doing in the flight hours, but corresponding costs that are associated with that, both in the us and our intercontinental business. the number that alan has quoted, 6% to 8% is inclusive of both, but we're looking at flight everywhere and ways that we can optimize our network and match lift to load.
operator
our next question will come from helane becker with cowen.
helane becker -- cowen -- analyst
thanks very much, operator. hi, everybody and thank you for the time. i just want to follow up on the flight hours question. so, we estimate that from public data that about half of your pilot will retire over the next decade. and i'm just kind of wondering a, the pilot hiring and your ability to attract pilots to the company, and b, how much of this reduction in flight hours is the result of the pilot retirements.
john a. smith -- president and chief executive officer, fedex freight.
let me start off this and have don speak to it. this is smith speaking. first of all, when the economy started deteriorating a year ago in europe and we were hopeful for trade deals as we went in the fiscal year, we expressed to you and the june analyst call, we began to put constraints on pilot hiring and we have not been hiring pilots for some time now. on an attrition basis, i believe, don and greg hall, our head of air operations told me that we will have a net reduction of several hundred pilots next year, just due to retirement and of course that corresponds to the flight hour reduction.
so, this is something that we've been thinking about for a long time if things didn't materialize. and in terms of female pilots, fedex has been a leader in this. this has been something that's been a [indecipherable] for a long time, female and minority pilots, we -- we, percentage wise at one point, i'm far away from the express business, this level of details. at one time, we had the highest percentage of both, i'm sure that's different now, but we work very hard and we participate in female and minority hiring. longer term, we are among the praised [phonetic] jobs in the aviation industry and we do not have any problems hiring aviators today, but in the future with the military releasing, so a few of them that might be -- that might be a different story, but greg has done a great job for don, developing grow your own pilot program. so, we put a lot of thought in this. our pilot attrition is going down. and so, we anticipated this. raj, don -- don, you want to say something?
donald f. colleran -- president and chief executive office, fedex express
yeah, just one thing i'd like to add to that. i've had the opportunity since i've been in this role to spend a lot of time with our pilots and we have an absolutely amazing group of pilots, without question the best in the industry. and they are the best source of our pipeline. so, because the brand is so strong, because they do such a great job for us, they are helpful in the recruitment of pilots across the world. so first of all, we have an amazing group of pilots. they do a fantastic job for us as they have during this peak season.
i mean the dispatch reliability of our aircraft and what our pilots are doing is nothing short of amazing. so, they are the greater source of recruitment that we have and they are the best pilots in the industry bar none.

and now fred smith will share his views on the quarter.
frederick w. smith -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks for participating on this call.
as we announced last june, fy '20 would be a year of challenge and change. and beginning in early january, the coronavirus entered the picture for fedex. fedex addressed this issue decisively with our team members' safety is our number one priority, and our extensive planning and execution. let me thank and praise profusely all those at fedex who have kept our system operating to the great benefit of our customers. fedex is proud to have played a significant role in supplying medical supplies, both donated and commercial, to and within china in concert with china post and globally.
we continue to work with relief organizations worldwide. with the curtailment of passenger flights across the atlantic, we will provide the lift required to keep vital commerce moving. as was the case in asia, our fedex team members in europe and the americas are dealing with this crisis competently and with great dedication. again, their safety is our first consideration.
regarding broader issues, we remain very confident and focused on these strategic issues, as previously announced: improving fedex express margins and completing tnt integration; becoming the most successful north american package delivery company, particularly for e-commerce shipments; and completing the retirement and replacement of 159 very old and inefficient aircraft by the fourth quarter fy '22 after which we will be able to significantly lower go forward capex while still funding profitable growth across the enterprise. we also continue to work on several entrepreneurial initiatives such as the fedex sameday bot, roxo, sensor based shipping and new digital services which we think have great potential.
let me now ask brie, raj and alan to provide their comments, after which we will take your questions.
brie?
brie carere -- executive vice president, chief marketing and communications officer
thank you, fred. good afternoon, everyone.
i would normally begin my remarks with our economic outlook. however, given the uncertainty in the current environment, we have temporarily withdrawn our economic forecast. rather, i will provide an update on our commercial response to the coronavirus. then i will discuss how we are continuing to evolve our commercial strategy to adapt to a changing marketplace and deliver innovative solutions for our customers.
the coronavirus and the efforts to contain it represent an unprecedented challenge that we are evaluating and addressing daily. as the coronavirus broke in china, we implemented a global response plan and began managing through this crisis with the strength of our global network and unparalleled logistics expertise. we are uniquely positioned to lead in both the relief and the recovery efforts.
we have been on the front lines of the relief efforts, prioritizing the handling of medical and humanitarian supplies for our customers and non-profits, while also supporting our existing customers. we are protecting our customers' base volumes to the greatest extent possible, demonstrating our continued business partnership with our customers. this is especially important to the millions of small businesses who depend on us. we will then manage incremental demand and new customers.
in february, we managed the influx of shipment requests to china amid limited capacity by implementing a temporary peak surcharge for us outbound freight shipments and adjusting our transit commitments to china to maximize our capacity utilization. we have also dynamically adjusted spot prices to and from china. total air cargo capacity reduction to and from mainland china from early february to early march is estimated at 40% year-over-year. wide-body belly capacity contributed to 82% of this decline.
in china, we have seen a rebound week over week since the week of march 3. with the urgent need for stock replenishment and with air capacity shortage in the market, we believe demand will stay elevated. we continue to adjust transit times and spot prices specifically for china outbound to manage demand profitably. we continue to increase the transit differentials between our premium and our economy services to encourage the use of premium service for any time-critical shipments, given the volatility in the market.
what started as a relief and recovery effort in china now unfortunately is global. the recently implemented travel ban between europe and the us is expected to impact cargo capacity significantly since approximately 60% of the air freight capacity between europe and the us are on passenger flights. we are now employing the same strategies in other parts of the world that have helped us manage demand and capacity constraints in china, including transit time extensions, dynamic spot price management and will also leverage peak surcharges for specific lanes and periods of time as they are required.
for our intra-european business, we continue to run our air and ground networks. due to the lockdowns of some areas and enhanced border controls, we are dynamically adjusting our network, and in some lines, we've extended transit times. as businesses close in multiple markets, we are seeing a reduction in volume due to fewer orders and businesses simply not being open for delivery.
now let me pull back. prior to the coronavirus, the consumer sector had been a bright spot, driving b2c growth in europe. there were subdued b2b peak in our q3 numbers, especially from the broader air freight market. i am very optimistic, however, about our long-term prospects in europe, especially as we make strides toward interoperability of the fedex and tnt networks.
while the freight segment of our of our european business has been under significant pressure, we continue to focus on growing the parcel mix in the network. in q3, our international european parcel volume grew year-over-year, with deferred growing at a faster rate than priority. our european sales and marketing teams are seeing opportunity, and our sales pipeline momentum remains at a high pace across all segments, with continued year-over-year growth for the past nine months.
in q3, our sales team in europe has been successfully closing business 30% more quickly than the previous year. in the past year, we have generated more than 12,000 e-commerce opportunities, adding more than 3,400 customer wins. nearly half of these wins are brand new fedex customers. more than 60% of this new e-commerce traffic is international export volume.
as part of our international growth strategy, we have launched a new digital shipping tool for small business customers across 54 countries in seven languages. early metrics show conversion rate from a rate quote to creating a shipment label at 3x the previous application. almost 2 million e-commerce shoppers in 25 key european markets now utilize fedex delivery manager to manage their shipments. and, in fy '20 we have also grown our convenience retail network to over 14,000 locations across europe. combined, these enhancements strengthen our competitiveness and position us very well for success in europe for years to come.
now let me pivot closer to home. when fedex ground began its seven-day delivery in january, our industry-leading e-commerce value proposition became even more powerful. sunday residential delivery includes delivery to more than 188 million people, which encompasses 75% of us gdp. fedex ground is faster to more locations than ups ground. because of our seven day network transformation, 16% of fedex home delivery package volume has been accelerated by at least one day, resulting in more than 72% of volume being delivered in two days or less.
in fact, since now we deliver to most of the us population on saturdays and sundays, our net speed advantage for our home delivery shipments increases throughout the week. let me explain. for packages picked up on monday, we're approximately 20% faster than ups, and by friday, the packages picked up on friday are now more than 80% faster than ups ground. for both our fedex home delivery and our fedex ground commercial services, we are at least one day faster in 320 million zip pairs. in fy '20 we have however experienced some yield pressure due in part to the commercial ground volume softness which we believe strongly is linked to the economy. however, our transit time superiority in seven day service continues to create significant growth and market share improvements while delivering exceptional value for customers, both small and large.
currently, our fedex ground volumes are strong. our largest retail customers' volumes are rising as social distancing efforts are encouraging consumers to shop from home.
finally, turning to our freight business. fedex freight and the ltl industry have experienced a reduction in volumes over the past year due to the slowing economy. despite pressure on volume growth, the team has done an amazing job driving revenue quality. we have a very strong value proposition that includes a comprehensive portfolio of solutions across our enterprise and our end-to-end support for our customers.
with that, i'll turn it over to raj for his remarks.
rajesh subramaniam -- president and chief operating officer
thank you, brie, and good afternoon.
our global team has been working tirelessly to mitigate the effects of the coronavirus on our business and assist in relief efforts. we are first and foremost focused on safety in support of more than 475,000 global team members and our customers who need our assistance. fedex is one of the few companies in the world that has the network and capabilities to keep commerce and aid moving during this time. we are keenly aware of this fact and the role we play. and we view it as our duty and responsibility to continue supporting our customers and communities in a safe and effective manner. we are laser focused on preparation, mitigation and relief response.
we have countless remarkable examples of ways we are working with customers to combat the virus on multiple fronts, both in the us and worldwide. in addition to our extensive relief efforts in china over the last few months, we are providing support within the united states, including the delivery of test kits, masks, gloves, and personal protective equipment to hospitals, labs, testing centers and homes. as part of a public-private partnership with many of our healthcare customers, we are working to rapidly deploy medical supplies to labs and clinics nationwide.
for example, over the weekend, we worked with roche diagnostics to deliver critical products to designated testing labs across the united states. this is just one of many herculean efforts under way. time is of the essence when it comes to getting test kits and medical supplies to healthcare providers who flatten this curve, contain the virus and save lives. and our team members are working around the clock to respond to this global pandemic. we're keeping their safety at the forefront of our operations and have suspended signature requirements to promote social distancing.
i cannot emphasize enough how proud i am of the manner in which our people have rallied together in the face of this unprecedented situation. this is clearly who we are and what we do. during times of uncertainty, one thing is certain. fedex delivers upon the purple promise. given the size and scale of our global network, we are also uniquely positioned to play a significant role in the recovery of manufacturing and other business sectors as the economy rebounds. coronavirus impact in february resulted in factories being shut down in asia and lowered volumes on fedex networks as a result.
these numbers are reflected in our third quarter earnings. however, while the manufacturing has started to come back, the belly capacity on passenger airlines continue to be severely constrained. in contrast, fedex flew 246 flights in and out of china just last week, which is aligned with our normal flight schedule and over in the past couple of weeks our flights have been full and we have registered record load factors intra-asia, especially with our hub in guangzhou.
now turning to the transatlantic theater. as of last week, passenger capacity significantly curtailed. about 60% of the airfreight capacity between europe and the us is on passenger flights. however, demand out of europe is softening as well as factories and businesses close as we heard in the last 24 hours. we have set up a virtual command center to monitor demand and manage in real time all the levers, including pricing and capacity deployment. we will increase or decrease our capacity as required so we can provide the best service for our customers and deliver returns for our shareholders.
now turning to tnt. we continue to make significant progress on tnt integration around the world and are on track to deliver important milestones as we end the fiscal year. in q4, we will complete the interoperability of the intra-european ground network. this will enable us to lower our cost to serve as the related fedex operations continue to be optimized. we also remain fully on track for completion of the air network integration in fall 2021, which will bring to a close the physical network integration of tnt into fedex. as i have stated before, the rationale behind the tnt acquisition remains sound.
earlier this quarter we announced fedex express will be contracting with fedex ground for the transport and delivery of select day-definite express residential packages in the us. that rollout began earlier in the month in greensboro, north carolina and we are already seeing positive results. this initiative, which we refer to as last mile optimization is one element of the ongoing comprehensive transformation of our business to meet the challenges of a rapidly changing market. in april, we'll expand last mile optimization into cincinnati, phoenix, minneapolis, st. paul, newark, salt lake city, and we will continue to roll this out over the next 12 months.
this is the first step in the evolution of our business model to reduce our cost, cost to serve by moving the right product in the right network at the right cost. on previous calls, we've discussed ground's transformation to serve the dynamic e-commerce market, including weekend residential delivery, handling smartpost volume in the ground network and finding new, safe, more efficient ways to deliver large packages. these network changes are being enabled by investments in new technology that will allow us to make dynamic decisions about the optimal routing of any package at virtually any time within the fedex ground network. this will increase our efficiency, drive down our cost to serve and allow us to be more competitive and more profitable even as residential volume continues to grow.
our investments in the technological and operational changes at fedex ground are significant, but they are necessary. they will improve productivity, increase delivery density, optimize the ground network and maximize capacity utilization. and speaking of capacity, given the growth of omnichannel e-commerce distribution we are also investing in smaller regional sortation facilities as we push investment in ground capacity closer to the destination address. all of these combined to shape fedex ground into what will be the most cost-effective transportation company serving the e-commerce market.
before i finish, i want to be sure to talk about the exceptional results at fedex freight in the third quarter despite a challenging economic environment. our team at fedex freight adds great value to the overall portfolio of fedex and they continue to maintain a laser focus on revenue, quality and execution. they are making progress toward the double-digit operating margin goal, even in a soft volume environment.
in summary, fedex continues to be committed to delivering long-term profitable growth. we have successfully weathered global crisis before, and in the near term we are focused on supporting our employees, communities and customers as we work through the coronavirus situation. we continue to be excited about our prospects ahead as we execute on our core priorities, including driving operational excellence by transforming the ground company, improving international profitability by completing the tnt integration and rightsizing our air network. we are optimistic about our efforts to evolve our business model to reduce our cost to serve with the last mile optimization being the first step. with a more stable economic environment, these measures should produce strong results for the corporation.
now i will turn it over to alan graf to provide details on our financials. alan?
alan b. graf -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thank you very much, raj, and good afternoon, everyone.
our third quarter operating results declined due to a number of factors, including weak global economic conditions, including the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, higher self-insurance accruals, an unfavorable variable compensation comparison, increased fedex ground costs from expanded service offerings, the loss of the amazon business, a continuing mix shift to lower-yielding services and a more competitive pricing environment. prior to the outbreak of the coronavirus, commercial volumes and revenues were somewhat underperforming our december expectations. the coronavirus pandemic magnified the global economic weakness.
a reversal of our corporate annual incentive compensation accrual in the third quarter of last year drove a negative year-over-year comparison of approximately $115 million. the variable compensation comparisons is expected to be a modest benefit in the fourth quarter. higher self-insurance accruals negatively impact ground margins by approximately 180 basis points. the combination of headwinds of the expansion to six and seven-day delivery and the loss of the amazon volume negatively impact ground margins by approximately 190 basis points.
these factors were partially offset by residential delivery volume growth at fedex ground, an approximately $100 million benefit from additional operating week day, an 11% increase in revenue per hundredweight at fedex freight which helped drive their best third quarter operating income ever, the shifting of cyber week into december and the benefits of cost containment activities, which has lowered our year-to-date fedex services expenses allocated to our transportation segments through intercompany charges.
our third quarter effective tax rate increased to 25% versus 20.6% last year, primarily because last year's net income included a tax benefit in the recognition of certain loss carry-forwards, which was partially offset by tax expense attributable to the enactment of a lower tax rate in the netherlands. we are suspending our fiscal 2020 earnings forecast for our consolidated and segment results due to the great uncertainty caused by the coronavirus pandemic. while we cannot currently predict how long the economic impact of the pandemic will last, we do remain confident in our long-term strategy and our ability to adjust to market conditions. we will continue to manage network capacity at fedex express by reducing international flight hours in the fourth quarter if global economic conditions deteriorate further. however, if global air freight demand increases as the world recovers from the covid-19 pandemic, we have the ability to flex our network to meet the needs of customers.
we expect continued revenue growth at fedex ground during the fourth quarter. however, we expect higher operating costs and the expansion to year-round seven-day residential delivery and weak economic conditions will negatively impact fedex ground results in the fourth quarter. to further mitigate near-term headwinds and position us for future earnings growth, we are attacking costs throughout the enterprise including continuing to retire our oldest and least efficient aircraft, integrating tnt and lowering our residential delivery cost by having fedex ground deliver fedex smartpost in certain fedex express packages. in addition to these cost actions, our fy '21 performance should also benefit from the lapping of the loss of the amazon business, lapping the cost of fedex ground seven-day delivery expansion, one additional operating week day, increased synergies from the tnt integration, profitable market share gains and a rebound in demand for our services, as the coronavirus pandemic subsides.
we expect to finish fy '20 with capital spending of approximately $5.9 billion. given the uncertainty and business conditions, we are reviewing in great detail our planned spending for fy '21. our capital intensity is expected to decline after fy '22 as committed aircraft deliveries are substantially lower in fy '23 and beyond.
to finish my remarks, i want to congratulate mike lenz for being named my successor. mike has been an invaluable part of the fedex finance organization with his leadership of our treasury, investor relations and strategic finance teams. he is uniquely qualified to guide our company to improve financial success.
now to the outlook. although we have been performing well in march up to today, as raj discussed, there is so much uncertainty that we cannot give guidance nor comment on any question related to near-term financial performance.
and now the operator can begin the question-and-answer session.

thank you. [operator instructions] we'll hear first today from ken hoexter with bank of america.
ken hoexter -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
hey, great. i don't know if this is for raj or alan. i guess i'll just leave it a general question. but as you look forward on your canceled outlook, what worries you most here? is it the scale of the recession? maybe you can give some insight into what made you cancel the outlook. is it kind of the rates -- the increase in air rate not offsetting the decline in demand and the scale of that demand decline? maybe just give some parameters on it. thanks.
rajesh subramaniam -- president and chief operating officer
ken, this is raj. i think if you think -- the last couple of weeks, we have seen, as i said earlier, an increased demand from asia. we've seen strong demand for fedex ground here in the us and especially home delivery and even the commercial volumes have been quite stable. and we -- what we do not know now is how this pandemic evolves and what happens to demand. for instance, we do not know how europe demand is going to come through here as a lot of their manufacturing is starting to shut down there.
so there are so many unknowns at this point. and as alan said, the first two weeks of march have been good. but there is no way for us to project forward what the next a few weeks hold for us.
alan b. graf -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
i think, as you probably heard from a lot of people out there, ken, if it's a v-shape it's one thing, if it's a u-shape, it's something else completely. we are really managing this business almost on a day-to-day basis. we certainly think we know what's going to happen in the next week. but i have to tell you every 24 hours something new happens. europe had been doing well. now it seems that europe and uk are starting to shut down a little bit more and the demand is probably going to be less than i would have told you it was three days ago. we can't tell you about asia is the same thing, is this a bubble or is this going to continue. i do know that we have great plans in shape from the cost side to go either way and that's the best we can tell you right now because it is just so uncertain out there.

we'll move next to david ross with stifel.
david ross -- stifel -- analyst
yes, good afternoon. just a question on the transition of smartpost bringing in-house to ground. given everything that's going on now, are you slowing the migration away from the postal service or speeding it up? and then once it's all within the ground segment, what happens to the smartpost product?
rajesh subramaniam -- president and chief operating officer
david, i think we are continuing the process of moving smartpost into fedex ground as we have previously discussed and this was a purely an economic decision. that's all it was. and the reason we're doing it is with a few reasons. one is of course density. matching stops and adjacency drives significant stop efficiencies for us.
and then second is our enhanced technology. with our dynamic route optimization, it maximizes productivity opportunities in route planning. so we've put that together and we are continuing at pace and we are roughly halfway there and we'll continue to keep moving forward for the rest of the calendar year.
in terms of the product, i'll have brie answer that question.
brie carere -- executive vice president, chief marketing and communications officer
yeah, it's a great question. we continue to believe that we need two distinct products. we will have our home delivery product as well as what is currently the smartpost product. it will be rebranded in the future. we will give sub-pound volume to the post office as that makes sense. but we believe we need two separate products because the slower economy product we will flex that transit as required and we will also flex that transit for peak. we really do you think there are two distinct markets that we can grow into with this portfolio.
operator
and from jpmorgan we'll hear next from brian ossenbeck.
brian ossenbeck -- jpmorgan -- analyst
yeah. hi. good afternoon. thanks for taking the question. i just wanted -- alan, if you could ask -- if you could give a little bit more detail rather on the cost initiatives. it sounds like you're doing some things we've heard of before, retiring the fleet, doing tnt, doing the ground to express. but what else is on the radar realizing it's uncertain at this point? can you commit to anything else given the outlook has been pulled and there's a lot of moving parts out there? thank you.
alan b. graf -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
well, i do want to emphasize, brian, that and also to the last question, as we continue to grow ground and grow its densities, we are lowering those costs at a rapid clip and that is a big part of what's going to i think benefit ground greatly as we look at -- look going forward. that's not a q4 comment. that's just where we need to be strategically. the same thing with the amount of flat hours that we've taken out right now as we continue to right-size the intercontinental air network at express. those two are the big giant buckets.
but everywhere else with technology and productivity, we -- if we can -- as we continue to grow, we think that we will be taking out a lot of additional costs just from efficiencies. we've frozen and reduced our overhead. i have a number of scenarios, good and not so good, where we will know what steps to take as we go through this. and as i've said, this is a day-to-day and week-to-week look right now and we're managing as we go. and i'm confident that we'll be successful in doing that sort of some really bad outcome that i don't know that anybody is projecting at this point.
operator
we'll move next to ubs's tom wadewitz.
tom wadewitz -- ubs -- analyst
yeah, good afternoon. and i want to say congratulations, alan, on your announced retirement. i have covered the company a long time and you've always been the cfo. it's been great to work with you over the years. congratulations to mike as well. the -- let's see, wanted to ask you on the express b2c shipments that are going to be delivered in ground. maybe if you could offer some thoughts on kind of time frame for how long it takes to roll it out. and how do we think about the magnitude of cost savings? it seems it could be large, but it also might require reengineering of the pickup and delivery routes in express to realize the cost savings. i wondered if you could offer some thoughts on that. thank you.
rajesh subramaniam -- president and chief operating officer
hi, tom. this is raj. so yes, we have started this process in march, as i said before, and the rollout is fully under way. we will be in the rest of the country by in the next 12 months and i already talked about the markets that will be in april. so it's a fast-moving program and it's -- as we -- as the market grown for b2c there's an opportunity to rationalize the last mile optimization, specifically on the residential side.
at this point we're not going to be able to tell you the quantification of the benefits and there is a lot more to come here. and for good reason, i don't want to also talk about what comes next in this regard.
alan b. graf -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
there are, tom -- tom, thank you for those kind remarks. i appreciate it. mike is going to be -- doing a great job. you all are in good hands with him. a couple of things. express is going to grow and it's going to be delivering items that require aviation and are going long distance that are time-sensitive. so, we will manage that at the same time, we're managing the flow of the slower moving pieces that have been in express to ground because they can make the delivery time. that's just a normal evolution that we couldn't do a couple of years ago because we didn't have the technology to do it.
now we have the technology to do it. and as raj says, we're about halfway through that. and as we continue to ramp up our technology investments, we've got other things on the horizon as well. so there is a complete program of how we're transforming the operating networks of fedex corporation to what we think the future market is going to be, which is a lot more e-commerce, hopefully we'll have international growth again and that's where we're moving to.
operator
from goldman sachs, we'll hear from jordan alliger.
jordan alliger -- goldman sachs -- analyst
yeah, hi. question, you had obviously pretty strong growth in ground in the quarter and maybe with all that's going on, it will continue to be pretty solid as people order from home. you also mentioned a few headwinds, notably the six and seven-day delivery, amazon, i guess the self-insurance maybe in there. realizing there's still costs ahead to roll that out, sort of -- pretty load sort of for the growth. i mean, do you expect a diminishment in the magnitude of the headwinds as we move forward into the next quarter or do they stay sticky for the near term?
alan b. graf -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
no. i expect the headwinds to diminish. there's a lot of things that we piled upon ground from a strategic standpoint. we are going to wait later till sunday. we said, no, let's get it going. we took the amazon traffic out for strict strategic reasons, as you understand. on our plpd, it's been very frustrating. we're working every day to improve our safety in every one of our companies. at ground, in particular, we are rapidly expanding our use of cameras and video recorders, and where we do that we see the severity and the frequency of accidents decline significantly.
but we have a backlog of old claims that has continued to harness a bit, and we had to take another significant charge in q3. hopefully that's behind us. we're learning how to manage this much better in today's litigious society. and i think we will improve both the severity and the frequency and how we handle these things. and i hope that we can put that behind us as well.
i'm very excited about what i know is going to be our cost structure at ground, particularly in the next 12 to 18 months. and we have to get to the low-cost producer, and we are committed to do so.
rajesh subramaniam -- president and chief operating officer
and if i can add to that, jordan, is that the customer demand is very strong. as the value proposition that brie talked about earlier, we are now the market leading player in e-commerce in the united states, and the demand we are seeing from small, medium and large is very good. and now we have a very, very diversified customer base and we can leverage off of that.
operator
we'll move on to scott group with wolfe research.
scott h. group -- wolfe research -- analyst
okay. thanks. afternoon, guys. so lots of concerns in the market broadly about balance sheets, cash flow. maybe alan, what are you guys doing to support the balance sheet? what's the level of flexibility on capex for next year? and then separately, just generally on the express, can you just clarify, did you still take out the 7% of the capacity you talked about last quarter and any way to think about fuel in this environment? i know that's a few questions. thanks.
alan b. graf -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. a little more than one. so let me hit the big one. i mean, obviously we've got all kinds of scenario planning for cash flow, right. i mean, you've got to have liquidity. that's what everybody is looking for. we're part of the a4a group that submitted our request, via them to the government about some liquidity support. we have a doomsday scenario where we can definitely cut as much capex out of '21 as we need to. i don't think we're going to hit that. i think our cash flows are going to be strong, but i can't tell you that until we get through the coronavirus. and nobody knows when that's going to be. so we are managing the heck out of it right now. we have a -- we just increased our revolver. we have many, many, many unencumbered beautiful new aircraft that we could use if we needed to for liquidity. so, i think as compared to my friends in the passenger business, we are in really good shape in that regard.
as to fuel, if it stays down here, it should have somewhat of a benefit. but the fuel surcharge is just one of the surcharges that we use in managing our business. so we'll just see how that goes. we had committed to you i think 6% to 8% of flat out reduction in q4. i would say, today, we're not there because we're flying more in asia than we had expected to, but we're pretty close to that range.
operator
moving next to allison poliniak with wells fargo.
allison ann marie poliniak-cusic -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
hi guys, good afternoon. just going to your comments on asia and manufacturing. a number of industrials are talking about the increasing need for speed of the supply chain. i know you were talking -- i think you had mentioned you're back to capacity there. how quickly can you evolve or add incremental capacity in there to maybe supply the increased demand over the next few weeks? any comments there?
rajesh subramaniam -- president and chief operating officer
yes, that's the value of our fedex network. and we are able to flex up or down as needed. in this particular case, as we talked about the flight hours earlier, our planned flight schedule is to be down 7.5%. however, we are tactically deploying excess sections as we see the opportunity to move like additional profitable business in this capacity constrained environment. so, that's again, we are a key player in connecting the global commerce, and this fact becomes ever more evident in this current circumstances, especially out of china right now.
operator
from credit suisse, we'll hear from allison landry.
allison m. landry -- credit suisse ag -- analyst
good afternoon. thanks for taking my question. so, just considering the prospects for a global or us recession or a severe downturn, how should we think about the decremental margins at express relative to what you've done in the second half of fiscal 2009? and specifically, could you frame the structural changes you've made in the business during the pip and even in more recent years that maybe could result in some downside protection relative to historical decrementals? thank you.
alan b. graf -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
i've been through a few of these in my four year career at fedex and i think we've always rebounded very well from and always managed them very well. obviously, you're talking about like one of our scenarios, it's way down on the realm of likelihood and possibility as of today, but we still have to have it. so it's all the normal levers that you would imagine it would be.
but, as probably from my point of view, a company that's best positioned to continue to keep global supply chains up as we fight this virus and then rebound from it, i think we're in great shape in that regard. so it just depends on how long it lasts and how much demand there is. but there is going to be demand. people are going to be needing medical supplies; people are going to be needing to eat; people that can run businesses are going to run businesses, and they're going to rely on us to help them with their supply chains, and we're confident in that.
operator
we'll move next to brandon oglenski with barclays.
brandon robert oglenski -- barclays bank -- analyst
hey, good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for taking my question. so i guess i just wanted to ask the strategic rationale behind bringing smartpost in house. you're trying to drive delivery density obviously to residential stops. but at the same time, from a purely analytical perspective, isn't this potentially diluting the revenue base with the $5 product effectively now being served by an $8 network. or is that overly simplifying the issue?
alan b. graf -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
well, i've talked about the cost part, and i'll turn it over to brie to talk about the dilution part. every time we have a match or a near match of the smartpost package in our ground network, our costs are significantly below the postage for smartpost. so it's just math. and the more of those we get out there, the more productive then our independent service providers can be with everything else that they're delivering. so it has a wonderful effect on the productivity and the cost per package across the entire network. and it's working extremely well. i'll let brie talk about the marketing part.
brie carere -- executive vice president, chief marketing and communications officer
sure. as i mentioned before, there is a couple of different nuances from a features or service perspective, but they are important. the first from a home delivery perspective, it is a guaranteed product. the smartpost product is not a guaranteed product. so if you need that peace of mind you're going to pay for it. and we continue -- as i mentioned earlier, we have studied this with a lot of rigor and a lot of in-depth analysis our two distinct markets there.
in addition to that, we have a variety of different features of service on the home delivery product. there are different features of service from a consumer perspective. we call them consumer delivery options that are available on the home delivery product. they're not available on the economy product. and as i mentioned earlier, we do believe that a portion of the product, the sub-pound, will continue to be delivered by the post office. we've studied this. we think this is the right portfolio, and we're very confident in that decision.
operator
moving on to jack atkins with stephens.
jack lawrence atkins -- stephens inc. -- analyst
hey, good afternoon. thank you for taking my question. can you talk about what you're seeing in terms of business trends among your core b2b customers? it certainly sounds like b2c traffic has been strong over the last couple of weeks. but what's happening with that core b2b base? have you seen a change there over the last two to three weeks, given the virus impact? and as you think about your leverage to small and mid-sized businesses, how do you think those particular customers are going to trend as we look out over the next few weeks?
brie carere -- executive vice president, chief marketing and communications officer
yeah, it's a great question. let me talk about our b2b base because it does vary around the world. here in the united states, as raj mentioned, from a commercial business, we see that currently to date, it is quite stable. from an asia perspective, we're actually quite optimistic. from a stock replenishment perspective, we have seen throughout the month of march really day-over-day, week-over-week improvements from a volume, and the vast majority of what we have coming out of asia, the vast majority actually is commercial traffic.
what we talked about this morning actually when we looked at the chinese recovery, what we have seen is 90% to 95% of large manufacturers in china are now back to work in some capacity. closer to 65% to 70% of small businesses in mainland china are coming back to work from a manufacturing perspective. so we believe output is in around 65% to 75% and we are seeing that rebound. so from an asia perspective, we feel really good, large customer leading, small customer coming back from a china perspective.
europe, right now we can't predict because it has had the most change, i would say in the last 24 to 48 hours. you've all seen the media. we do anticipate by the end of the week to be incremental manufacturing closures in europe. so we are anticipating more softness there in europe, but the us is strong and asia is in really good shape as we speak today.
operator
and from cowen we'll hear next from helane becker.
helane becker -- cowen & company -- analyst
thanks very much, operator. alan i can't believe it, an end of an era for you and for me. it's very sad but congratulations and best wishes on your retirement. my question is really for fred. there was a lot of change in the world in 2019 that affected you guys with the trade wars and so on. could you just talk about how you think this whole coronavirus will change the way the world does business, if at all? thank you.
frederick w. smith -- chairman and chief executive officer
well, helane, it is indeed an end of an era. i tried to talk alan out of it. i have told him, we were just getting started here, but i think he's got his priorities right with susan and his family. but he is still the cfo till september the 21st at midnight. and then i'll have a lot more to say about alan on the next couple of calls.
so, helane, i think one of the things that we've been in the midst of and it's been a bit of a disappointment to the smc and me in particular that we haven't gotten across to people how fundamentally changed the world was before the coronavirus. i mean we were the first people in the fall of 2018, in fact, it was on one of these analyst calls that basically we said europe is essentially moving into a business recession because when the trade war began in march of 2018 when the president famously said trade wars are good and easy to win, people missed the point that it wasn't just china that was in the sights, it was europe. and it was a ricochet bullet that hit germany.
so by the fall of 2018 we began to see that. and if you look at the pmis from that point forward, really until the last couple of months of 2019, they look like a ski slope and then they flattened out. so we've done a wonderful job, i think, of trying to deal with that. we were hopeful that it was going to be a china deal on the trade side in the spring of 2019 and in fact we were told that was the case. it didn't happen. we would probably done some different things have we not been a bit more optimistic then back. so fundamentally the major change that's gone on, and fedex had been talking about it for a long time, is the reduction in world trade and the rising of protectionism and mercantilism and a lot of tariff and non-tariff barriers. so you had the coronavirus on top of that and world gdp growth this year is going to be extremely small. and i know we've suspended our economic outlook. so i think that's -- number one is, you're going to see probably less international trade because of those political trends. maybe it will turn around, but there is nothing that seems to be a catalyst at the moment that says that.
second, i suspect this will be somewhat more short term than long term because people forget that there was a tremendous flu epidemic i think it was in 2009 and a lot of people thought that things would change permanently as a result of that. they didn't. now the coronavirus, maybe a little bit different because it's so virulent obviously in terms of the contagion. it doesn't seem to be as dangerous to most people, but the lethality for older people with underlying diseases is quite stark. so if i had to speculate and that's all it would be having sat on the ata and what's now the a4a boards and so forth, at least in the near term you're going to have a lot more use of video conferencing and very prudent steps to minimize a lot of business travel. i think, i think that's going to be a big one.
and then third, we are already in the midst of this e-commerce revolution and we've leaned into it as we've said, particularly as we went into this fiscal year. i don't think that that's going to stop. and i think the major retailers are very heavily focused on that and people misunderstand the e-commerce market as not just one monolithic market, there is sort of the tier 1 set of inventory, tier 2 and tier 3. tier 1 are the things we use every day, paper towels and consumables in one thing and i believe i am correct and amazon announced today or recently that they were going to restrict a lot of the non-essential products. so you see the big retailers and our big customers moving to be very effective competitors into this tier 1.
and to get to raj and alan's point, again we are very confident we are the low-cost producer. we didn't insource smartpost because we felt it was a good idea. we did it because the basic math said that we should and with this tier 1 short-haul e-commerce, we think we can be the low-cost producer and the market leader there. and in fact we don't think it, we know it, and so we've leaned into it painfully but we said that at the first of the year that this would be a year of challenge and change. and as i said, now you have the corona environment -- coronavirus on top of it. so those are the three things i think are going to change.
probably slower global gdp growth and international trade. we think we can take significant market share there, but we have to be very disciplined. and number two, i think you will have some changes in business travel, maybe all travel, but certainly business travel. and then third, i think the e-commerce revolution will continue and we plan to be a big part of that.

moving next citi's chris wetherbee.
chris wetherbee -- citi -- analyst
hey, thanks. good afternoon. want to come back to ground for a moment and maybe try to better understand what we think the cadence of sort of improvement in the margins might be. i understand it's very difficult to provide guidance in the circumstances we're at now. but just given the progression that we've seen so far pre-virus, it would seem like there has been a little bit of a stagnation of the ability to kind of move that margin back up. you called out 370 basis points of specific impacts was kind of get this closer to flattish from an ebit perspective despite significant revenue growth. so maybe it's smartpost, it's maybe just a matter of time before that build density drives better incremental margins. but if you could just give us a sense of what that trajectory might look like? what needs to happen to get those margins to start moving back just given how robust the top line is right now?
alan b. graf -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
well, i don't know how to tell any better than i have so far, chris. i can't really give it to you about q4. i can tell you that, as i said, we got out there with saturday and sunday because we made the strategic move to get out there and do it. i think that will pay off in a big way and we start to lap that next fiscal year. we are halfway through of our technology implementations on our route optimizations and our scheduling. we're growing the densities as we grow the business. every one of those things is driving down cost per package. we did get out with some of the tier 1 closed zone pricing anticipating that we would over time get our cost down there so those would be more profitable. and so, yes, that's part of it as part of the strategy.
but as the way i said it before, i mean, i know where the costs are heading. i know what we're doing to get closer to customers on both sides of the equation where the traffic has an origin or where it has a destination. we're doing a great job with that. we talked about the regional sort facilities that we're putting up. so there are so many things under way and more to come, as, again, we're completely transforming ground. we're not having the yields overall on a total standpoint because we don't have the b2b traffic we thought we would have. but we're managing through that and we'll get back on pace on that as well.
rajesh subramaniam -- president and chief operating officer
and just one thing to add, alan. the good news here is the customers are, they are taking into service, and we are taking share, especially in the e-commerce space. and i think when you put the two factors together, it results in a positive outcome for ground.
operator
we'll move next to ben hartford with baird.
benjamin john hartford -- robert w. baird & co. -- analyst
hey, good afternoon. and alan, congrats on your retirement. raj, just some further perspective on air freight and load factors and how it's most likely to play out, given presumptive b2b business headwinds in europe and the us to come, but specifically europe. how long do you think this demand to supply in-equilibrium with these high load factors to persist out of asia? how long do you think that will be? until we start to see the market respond with more freighter and perhaps some of the belly space capacity come back online with some risk economically in some of the more developed markets? any way to kind of describe as you see it right now, how long we should be riding this very, very robust load factor that we're experiencing in asia at the moment?
rajesh subramaniam -- president and chief operating officer
i'm not sure how best to answer the question other than to kind of go through what we just went through. the demand we are seeing out of asia right now is quite robust. and if you look for -- the intra-asia load factor is at a record, which is also very interesting -- asia to europe and asia to us. and the manufacturing capacity is coming back online, and the capacity of airfreight is down. so net-net, we are seeing the demand, and we should see that go forward.
as far as europe is concerned, very, very early to tell. we're dealing with information that's literally 24 hours old. and trying to project that out is impossible. one thing that i know though is that 60% of the transatlantic traffic went on belly capacity. and as that capacity comes down, the capacity is going to be severely constrained. that much i can tell you. as far as the demand, we have to wait and see, and it's too early for me to say anything about that right now.
operator
we'll hear now from bascome majors with susquehanna.
bascome majors -- susquehanna -- analyst
yes. thanks for taking my question. could you update us on how far along you are with your ground delivery partners negotiating the contracts [indecipherable] the smartpost and express last mile integration? any thoughts in areas where you've already got that structure in place? have you seen the volume and density economics change favorably as you expected? thanks.
rajesh subramaniam -- president and chief operating officer
so, nearly half of the smartpost volume currently is delivered by ground service provider business and we expect to be virtually complete by the end of calendar year 2020 and with some of the exceptions that brie talked about earlier. as to the contractual relationship with our independent service providers, these are great partners. they run very efficient businesses. they love the additional volume that they're getting. we work with them on a continuous basis to make sure that we're giving them everything they can. we're helping them with their scheduling, helping them build their density so they can make their business more profitable. so it's a great relationship.

thank you, mickey. thanks everyone for participating on this call. before i begin, let me take a point of personal privilege and congratulate david abney who just retired as ups ceo. i believe david joined ups in '74 right out of delta state, not far from here. david is an able competitor, a gentleman and a fine man and all of us at fedex wish you well in your retirement. i understand you'll be staying on as executive chairman for a time, but i wasn't sure i'd get a chance to do this again before he left. so all the best, david.
we said on this call last year that fy '20 would be a challenging -- a year of challenge and change, better put. and that has certainly been the case. we told you about a number of strategic initiatives we have had under way to navigate that challenge and change. then beginning in january, we began to deal with covid-19 in china then in europe and then, of course, in the united states. i reported on all the work we have done in those areas of the world to respond to the pandemic during our quarter three earnings call on 17 march.
we've made every effort to keep our team members and the public safe as we've dealt with this terrible disease and we're very proud of our team members and the role they played in keeping the global industrial and at-home supply chains open. my most sincere appreciation goes to our team members around the world for their herculean efforts during this time. we are so proud of them.
let me take another point of personal privilege and note that in addition to dealing with covid-19 on a professional basis, our family has dealt with this awful virus up close and personal. so we offer our sympathy for all those who have suffered with covid-19. our deepest condolences to those who have lost close friends and loved ones and we'll honor the memory of all those taken from us too soon in the days to come.
so let me now ask brie, raj and alan to provide their comments for more details, after which we will take your questions. brie?
brie carere -- executive vice president, chief marketing and communications officer
thank you, fred. good afternoon, everyone. the economic outlook is highly uncertain making forecasting incredibly challenging. around the world, we saw a marked decline in global economic activity in the final quarter of fiscal year '20. however, today we have experienced week-over-week improvement in our business since hitting the bottom in mid-april. as we enter fiscal '21, there are signs of tentative economic recovery under way.
here in the united states, the covid pandemic has accelerated e-commerce adoption, while detrimentally affecting the business-to-business segment. several years of retail share gains have been compressed into a few months in the united states with e-commerce as a percentage of u.s. retail increasing from 16% in calendar year '19 to 27% in april 2020. the growth rate of e-commerce in april was partially a result of the shrinking denominator as total retail contracted. we anticipate e-commerce as a percentage of retail will stay elevated. this shift has left an indelible mark on the retail industry causing the bankruptcy of some chains that have been around for decades, while helping those retailers with a strong omnichannel strategy flourish.
for fedex, surging e-commerce sales from our large customers drove significant fedex volume in q4 and a sizable mix shift from commercial b2b to home delivery/b2c volume. in q4, fedex total u.s. domestic residential volume was 72% versus 56% a year ago. since the end of april, however, we have seen week-over-week growth in our business-to-business segment. needless to say, we've been very focused on improving revenue quality given the high demand against limited market capacity and a higher cost to serve.
fedex ground b2c yields remain above market despite pressure from large customer mix and a move to shorter zones. in early june, we announced that we were implementing three temporary surcharges, including a smartpost surcharge of $0.40 per package, an oversized surcharge of $30 per package and a residential delivery charge of $0.30 per package to offset incremental expenses incurred in our networks. the residential delivery charge affects a small number of our largest customers who have had surging volume.
we are also working closely with our largest e-commerce customers to establish peak plans which include differentiated residential surcharges for the month of november and december. these peak surcharges will help us manage increased demand while maintaining strong level of service for our entire base of customers. these revenue quality actions are driving contribution to the bottom-line, while ensuring we deliver the outstanding experience that fedex customers expect. we are all-in on e-commerce and we're going to continue to profitably grow share in this space.
our revenue quality efforts also mean that we continue to focus on profitable share growth from the small and medium segment. we have continued to champion small and medium businesses and support their recovery. through collaborations, including amex stand for small, fedex has joined a coalition of companies supporting small and medium businesses. we've also taken our immensely popular small business grant contest and in may offered an additional $1 million in support small grants that will support 200 small businesses struggling in the aftermath of covid. we also announced a new alliance between fedex and bigcommerce to help small businesses get up and running online, fast and affordably.
as i have mentioned on previous calls, returns are a critical component of our e-commerce strategy. our returns growth doubled in fy '20 compared to the prior two years. we simplified the returns process through the launch of paperless returns and, through the end of may, have rolled out more than 4,800 drop off and pick up locations with our dollar general collaboration to further expand our retail convenience network.
in addition to e-commerce, we continue to focus on b2b opportunities. fedex has provided unparalleled product and service in the business-to-business space for almost 50 years. we are focused on driving growth through increased penetration in healthcare, specifically in med device, pharmaceutical and testing equipment segments. we are also seeing opportunities emerge within the industrial sector.
shifting now to international. in mid-march, asia-pacific outbound average daily volume grew substantially over pre-covid-19 levels fueled by ppe demand surge. we are also experiencing europe outbound growth on the transatlantic lane due to limited capacity and surging e-commerce volume. we've been able to improve our base load with airport-to-airport moves, charters and complex premium air freight services.
in april, we implemented a global temporary surcharge on all fedex express and tnt international parcel and air freight shipments to balance demand against air cargo capacity. total intercontinental volumes exited may with a year-over-year growth. as we plan for fy '21, we anticipate air cargo capacity recovery will take at least 18 months to return to pre-covid levels. we are actively pursuing opportunities to increase both market share and revenue quality, especially for international priority freight and international economy freight services. we are renegotiating customer contracts to better reflect current market conditions. our capability on intercontinental lanes is highly sought after and demand is growing as country restrictions are lifted and manufacturing begins to ramp up again. we have added extra capacity in the short term to support this demand and help our customers as they restart their business activities.
we are well-positioned to profitably gain share from the freight forwarders. we are also enhancing our e-commerce capabilities in europe. e-commerce demand there has accelerated as a result of the pandemic and is helping to offset the softened b2b market across europe.
in closing, i am confident we have the very best value proposition in the united states for both b2b and b2c and we are profitably winning market share. we have our teams focused on taking this playbook to europe, as we complete the tnt integration. our international business is poised to benefit from the continued contraction of commercial capacity and our best-in-class global network. with that, i'll turn it over to raj for his remarks.
rajesh subramaniam -- president and chief operating officer
thank you, brie and good afternoon. fedex continues to play a pivotal role on the front line of the covid-19 pandemic and i'm exceptionally proud of the way our more than 500,000 team members have responded. the safety and well-being of our team members and customers remain our first priority. whether securing ppe or adjusting our operations, we have kept and will continue to keep safety at the forefront of everything we do.
to reiterate what i said in march, fedex is one of the few companies in the world that has the network and the capabilities to keep critical supplies and supply chains moving during this unprecedented time. this is due in large part to the resilience of our extraordinary team members whose services are essential. like fred, let me also extend my sincerest thank you to our global team for the herculean efforts in helping keep the world in motion. this is truly who we are and what we do.
to fully understand the quarter, trends varied by international region by market segment and by month. let me take a moment to highlight a few of these. asia volumes strengthened throughout q4 as demand rebounded significantly post lockdowns and belly capacity on passenger airlines continue to be severely constrained. in the u.s., commercial b2b volume declined as retailers closed their brick and mortar locations. meanwhile b2c volume and residential deliveries soared. as a result, our fedex ground network has been teeming with peak-like residential volume for the past few months. as in enterprise, commercial volumes hit bottom in middle of april.
we have been steadily climbing back since then with day-over-day and week-over-week improvements. brie has already discussed many of the revenue quality actions we implemented in response to this dynamic environment. in addition, we have put in place significant safety measures including providing ppe for all team members, instituting routine health monitoring and increasing cleaning and sanitization of all our facilities. we launched the air operations coordination center to effectively match capacity to demand. through this coordinated approach, we reduced u.s. domestic flight hours in the fourth quarter and redeployed to international.
additionally, we flew more than 100 charters and delivered 1000 ocean containers of ppe. prior to covid-19, we forecasted flight hours to be down 7% year-over-year and we were on track to meet that goal. however, as mentioned earlier, demand for fedex capacity continued to soar as we maintained essential services amid the pandemic. as a result, our flight hours were up 2.6%.
as business gradually returns in europe, we expect to continue to see the benefits of constrained air capacity. with freighter capacity now accounting for 75% of total air capacity in the transatlantic lane, fedex capacity remains a premium. increasing international profitability is a major priority for us and europe is our biggest opportunity. in q4, as scheduled, we substantially completed the interoperability of the intra-european ground network. in fiscal year 2021, we'll complete the integration of line-haul and pickup and delivery operations and start offering an enhanced portfolio of international services. we will leverage the capabilities that tnt adds to our portfolio, which are expected to improve our european revenue and profit profile.
due to delays caused by covid-19, we are now planning to complete the final phase of the air network integration early in calendar year 2022. we are heavily focused on improving our efficiency and effectiveness by streamlining our organizational structure from six global regions to three within fedex express.
now turning to the u.s. and the booming e-commerce market. the trends we experienced during the quarter validated or to rather put an exclamation point on the importance of our strategic initiatives that directly address e-commerce. this includes fedex ground's seven-day operations, investments in technology that optimize last mile deliveries, over-the-threshold deliveries through fedex freight direct and integration of fedex smartpost volumes to increase delivery density. in many ways, the macro trends accelerated to meet our existing strategy and what we expected to happen over a few years happened in a matter of few months.
in fedex ground, we are employing several initiatives to maximize our capacity. these include leveraging our seven-day ground network, repurposing smartpost facilities for small or large package sortation and adding new low-cost regional sort facilities designed to handle shorter zone residential volumes into certain key markets. the flexibility and automation of the fedex ground network made it possible to quickly react to challenges faced by e-commerce shippers due to inventory imbalances and increase in fulfillment from store. the networkwide rollout of dynamic route optimization technology has continued through the pandemic and will be completed prior to peak 2020. the strategic steps we're taking to manage yields and improve efficiency in our operations, specifically the last mile, will position fedex ground for sustainable industry-leading margins.
in response to these emerging trends, we also continue collaboration across our operating companies to optimize our resources. for example, fedex freight has provided more than 1 million miles of road and intermodal support for fedex ground since late april. in q4 alone, they delivered approximately 270,000 large ground packages. another example is reducing cost and increasing delivery density, particularly through our last mile optimization efforts announced earlier this year. last mile optimization, which is delivery of specific fedex express residential and rural packages by fedex ground has successfully launched in 26 origin markets with an additional seven markets scheduled in july. these are just a few ways we are adapting, adjusting and utilizing different elements of our network to increase efficiency and collaboration.
before i close, i want to highlight our announcement last month with microsoft. our first solution, fedex surround will provide companies with greater visibility, agility and predictability in managing high-value shipments. this allows us to create new value and further differentiation while growing our multi-year alliance. it's only the first step and i look forward to sharing additional initiatives as we reimagine fedex at the intersection of physical and digital networks. we are confident in our strategy and we are invigorated by what the future holds for fedex.
now, let me turn it over to alan for his remarks.
alan b. graf jr. -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thank you, raj and good afternoon everyone. virtually all our revenue and expense line items during the fourth quarter were affected by the covid-19 pandemic. while commercial volumes were down significantly due to business closures across the globe, we experienced a surge in residential deliveries at fedex ground and in transpacific, and charter flights at fedex express, which required incremental cost to serve.
we also incurred an approximate $125 million increase in operating costs related to personal protective equipment and safety supplies, as well as additional security and cleaning services to protect our team members and ensure we are safely providing essential services to our customers. in addition, year-over-year fourth quarter operating results declined due to an approximate $100 million negative dollar impact from one fewer operating week day, increased fedex ground costs from expanded service offerings, higher bad debt expense, increased self-insurance accruals, and the elimination of the amazon business. these factors were partially offset by strong residential delivery volume growth at fedex ground, a 10% increase in revenue per hundredweight at fedex freight and a favorable net impact from fuel.
results also benefited from cost savings initiatives, including lower variable incentive compensation expenses, temporary reductions in certain workforces, delaying nonessential maintenance projects and facility investments, and reducing other discretionary spending.
the cares act includes provisions for relief from air cargo and aviation fuel excise taxes from march 28, 2020 through december 31, 2020. a benefit of $37 million was recognized for the two-month period this excise tax holiday was in effect during our fourth quarter. our fourth quarter tax rate includes a benefit of $71 million related to the cares act provision, which allows our tax loss to be offset against income from prior years which was taxed at higher rates. this benefit was mostly offset by a non-cash expense of $51 million due to a change in our deferred tax balances related to foreign operations.
fourth quarter results also include goodwill and other asset impairments of approximately $370 million, primarily related to goodwill impairment at fedex office. declining print revenue and a decline in market multiples for the retail industry lowered the current fair value of fedex office for the purposes of the goodwill impairment accounting test. however, fedex office remains a great investment and an increasingly valuable asset for e-commerce such as our return solution brie discussed earlier. the high margin packages dropped off and picked up at fedex office locations drive profitable growth for fedex express and fedex ground.
during the quarter, we took several actions to increase liquidity and strengthen our financial position. in march, we extended our $1.5 billion 364-day credit agreement, as well as our $2 billion five-year credit agreement. in april, we issued $3 billion of senior unsecured debt and used the proceeds in part to repay the borrowings under our credit facilities and commercial paper program. in may, we amended the credit facilities to provide additional financial flexibility through the end of fiscal 2021, given the current environment.
we ended the fiscal year with $4.9 billion in cash and cash equivalents and with $3.5 billion available under our credit facilities. looking forward, we are not providing a forecast of expected results for fiscal 2021 as the timing and pace of an economic recovery are uncertain. we will continue managing network capacity, flexing our networks and adjusting as needed to align with volumes and operating conditions. however, some of the higher operating costs related to the pandemic that we experienced in the fiscal fourth quarter will persist in fiscal 2021.
despite the covid-19-related delay of completing our air network integration into early 2022, we still expect tnt integration expenses to total approximately $1.7 billion. we expect to incur $170 million of integration expenses in fiscal 2021. integration expenses will be much lower in fiscal 2022 as we complete the physical network integration of tnt into fedex express.
during the first half of fiscal '21, we will complete the integration of fedex smartpost packages into standard fedex ground operations. we will also continue to focus on last mile residential optimization by directing certain u.s. day-definite residential and rural fedex express shipments into the fedex ground network to increase efficiency and lower our cost to serve.
capital expenditures for fiscal '21 are expected to be approximately $4.9 billion, a decrease of $1 billion year-over-year, due primarily to lower vehicle spending and the delay of certain facility investments. while aircraft spending is slightly higher year-over-year, spending is significantly lower than planned as we adjusted our aircraft delivery schedules to defer capex into future years. our firm orders for aircraft include deliveries through fy '25 and our latest adjustments result in the smoothing of our aircraft capital spending through fy '24 when it starts to come down materially.
strategic investments in safety technology equipment and procedures will remain a critical focus across our businesses in fy '21. we will also continue to focus on lowering costs through investments in productivity-enhancing technology. we do not anticipate making contributions to our u.s. pension plans during fiscal 2021 following $1 billion contributions during each of the last two fiscal years. we also do not anticipate contributions to our u.s. pension plans will be required for this foreseeable future based on our funded status, and the fact that we have a credit balance related to our cumulative excess voluntary pension contributions over those required that exceeds $3 billion. despite the recent stock market volatility, our u.s. pension plans returned 15% for fiscal 2020 and the funded status of our u.s. pension plans at the end of the fiscal year was 90%. our liability-driven investment philosophy helped preserve and protect our funded status.
i'll conclude by reemphasizing that we have reduced our capital spending plans and have taken cost and revenue actions to mitigate the impact of the pandemic. while the near-term outlook is unclear, we expect to continue to benefit from the global recovery as we leverage the strength of our unmatched air network and u.s. residential capabilities, our yield management efforts, and multiple initiatives to improve our financial performance.
now the operator can begin the question-and-answer session.
",":
operator
thank you. [operator instructions] we'll take our first question from scott schneeberger with oppenheimer. go ahead.
scott schneeberger -- oppenheimer & co. -- analyst
thanks very much. i want to inquire a bit more about the transatlantic, transpacific and charter flights. you provided some metrics on how many you are operating. just curious what you view with the competitive environment going forward from the passenger airplanes and how long you think you will have this market share advantage where you're able to price. thanks.
rajesh subramaniam -- president and chief operating officer
yeah, so, scott, thank you for that question. we expect that the passenger airline capacity is going to be down for some time to come and a significant portion of air cargo intercontinental goes on passenger aircraft and that traffic is now going to flow on fedex capacity, which is a premium. it's both on the transatlantic and transpacific. i will turn it over to don to address some specifics about what we have done so far and what we expect to happen here.
donald f. colleran -- president and chief executive officer, fedex express
scott, thanks for the question. we continue to see strong activity on both the transpacific lane, coming both to the united states as well as the back door in europe. we continue to run our p9 [phonetic] in half schedule, but what we're seeing because of the significant reduction in passenger capacity, most of the passenger airlines were essentially running anywhere between 10% and 15% of their normal flight activity on a year-over-year basis. it's obviously presented some opportunities for us on the supply and demand cycle. on the transpacific, we run anywhere between 30 and 50 extra sections a week supported by charter activity and we're beginning to see that activity pick up on the transatlantic as well. so as we optimize our network here globally and reposition aircraft to take advantage of that, we think the transatlantic, once the demand begins to pick up a little bit more on the european side, is an opportunity for us there as well.
as we've talked about before, in any typical year, almost 70% of the commercial cargo that moves between the u.s. and europe moves in the bellies of the passenger airlines. so even as these aircraft slowly come back on online, they'll be nowhere near where they need to be to meet what we think will be the demand as the european economy begins to awaken. we think that puts us in a position to take advantage of this global fleet that we operate around the world.
operator
and we'll go ahead and take our next question from david vernon with bernstein. please go ahead.
david vernon -- sanford c. bernstein -- analyst
hey, guys. thanks for taking the time. i wanted to ask a question about your ground business. maybe, henry or raj, if you could help us understand a little bit on what are the things that changed to drive sort of better incremental profitability. i mean 20% from those 70% [phonetic] is quite an operating profit. i know there were some mix shift in there. is this shift something we need to kind of lap? or do you feel like the surcharge that you're putting into the market need to be made more permanent? like, how do we get the incremental performance and operating leverage to kind of get a little bit better in that segment?
rajesh subramaniam -- president and chief operating officer
david, let me start off and i'll turn it to henry. firstly, i think the strategic initiatives that we have deployed in fedex ground over the past few months, literally the investments we've made over the past few years have definitely paid off in this time frame. and basically, we have a better mousetrap and we have faster service than our competition and we have a good revenue quality and better profitability in this business. so let me turn it over to henry to answer specifics.
henry j. maier -- president and chief executive officer, fedex ground
david, this is henry maier. first, we run one of the most highly automated networks in the world, if not the most highly automated. operating a seven-day network gives us the ability to efficiently utilize our assets seven days a week. the large package facilities that we've added over the last year, year and a half, put those package characteristics in a building that's more efficient and able to handle them, but it also makes hubs and automated stations more efficient, because it gets those packages off the belt and off the sorter. we talked to you before about the smartpost transition into ground that provides us with much better delivery density and the technology we have deployed over the last year in dynamic route optimization maximizes the stops per vehicle in the network while affording those businesses route sequencing that drives fewest number of miles between stops.
operator
we'll go ahead and take our next question from amit mehrotra with deutsche bank. please go ahead.
amit mehrotra -- deutsche bank -- analyst
thanks, congrats on the quarter. impressive quarter in a difficult environment. i just wanted to follow up on the last question related to ground margins. i mean, you're obviously still trying to understand that b2c mix shift is detrimental for density -- last mile density packages per stop and, obviously, sequentially, the operating performance were -- revenue per piece was actually up and cost per piece was actually down despite the big mix shift. it's obviously really interesting and intriguing.
so i guess in that context, i mean, i understand all the stuff you're doing, i was hoping maybe you can provide some numbers around that in terms of, was packages per stop improved and to what level, given the smartpost redirect. and was there any difference in terms of how a b2c package flow through your network in the context of covid because people order patterns are changing? was there any difference in how the b2c package was evolving in your network that helped kind of the fixed cost absorption and the margins that you were able to provide, give rather?
rajesh subramaniam -- president and chief operating officer
hey, amit, the -- all i can say here is that we had an acceleration of b2c over the last -- as the percentage of e-commerce -- as the percentage of total retail moved from 15% to 28%. we had a significant shift in terms of how much b2c volume grew. and in our investment that we made on our seven-day network and all the other things that henry had talked about earlier, just the market trends accelerated to meet our strategy, so to speak. and so there is no more secret than that. i think we were just -- we were -- we are leaning into e-commerce. this is something very important for our strategic priorities going forward and the market moved faster than what we expected. i don't know if brie or henry want to add anything more to that.
brie carere -- executive vice president, chief marketing and communications officer
no. i certainly have covered the revenue quality. we're very, very pleased what the team has done commercially on the revenue per piece from a b2c perspective. overall, very, very happy with the capture on the surcharge. we're trying to implement a two-tiered strategy where we actually push the revenue quality for the customers that create the surge, while protecting our small customer share, and that's worked out quite effectively. we continue to have very rigorous conversations with our largest customers as we head into peak planning, trying to find win-win solutions. but, overall, the revenue quality team has just done some tremendous work last quarter and anticipate that will continue.
henry j. maier -- president and chief executive officer, fedex ground
yeah, i don't know whether i have anything to add to any of that. i would just say again, i mean, the biggest driver in this business is delivery density and putting a very efficient fleet of vehicles on the street everyday with the technology tools necessary to ensure we have the lowest unit cost.
operator
we'll go ahead and take our next question from jack atkins with stephens. go ahead.
jack atkins -- stephens -- analyst
hey, good afternoon. thank you for taking my question. and i don't mean to belabor the point on ground, but i guess, i think what folks are trying to understand is -- you guys have clearly done an excellent job driving top-line growth within the segment even through an extremely volatile macro environment. but at what point are we going to start seeing the leverage show up in the model within ground? when will that delivery density and your pricing action, when will those begin to yield improved margins and profitability there? i think that's what people are really trying to understand.
alan b. graf jr. -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
hey, jack. this is alan. let me take my -- give my friends a rest over here. i think they're showing up in the fourth quarter. i don't know anybody's making margins in ground like we are, not even close. we're operating wide open, full throttle, seven days a week at max peak capacity. when you do that, you incur a lot of cost until you can get your feet on the ground, because it came on upon us so rapidly. so there'll be a period of time, remember, when we continue to catch up with our sorting facilities and our capabilities and our independent service provider get their legs under their feet on a more consistent basis and more routine.
obviously, residential deliveries in the growth of b2c are less productive than b2b. but as brie mentioned in her opening remarks, b2b is coming back. so we're working on every single aspect we can, mix, small and medium customers and costs. and i think i mentioned lowering cost twice in my opening remarks, and we're seeing that happening. so i think that's the answer. i mean we're going to continue to leverage this network. we'll get our feet under us and we're going to continue to deliver good results, i believe.
operator
and we'll go ahead and take our next question from chris wetherbee with citi. please go ahead.
chris wetherbee -- citi -- analyst
yeah, hey, thanks for taking the question. so i know you're not giving guidance for fiscal '21, but if you just -- maybe you could help us sort of walk through some of the puts and takes. if the business has really bottomed from the impacts of covid in april and we are seeing sort of improvement from here, it seem that you're beginning to lap some of -- more substantial headwinds from adding capacity on the ground side and some of the benefits that you should be getting from maybe taking some flight hours down, all that should begin to accrue. so i guess maybe when you think directionally about fiscal '21, can you help us a little bit in terms of some of those puts and takes? should we see some of those things that were headwinds in '20 turn into tailwinds in '21?
rajesh subramaniam -- president and chief operating officer
chris, we're not going to talk about '21. as we've said all along, i can't predict what the demand is going to be. so it's going to be very difficult to answer any questions associated with '21.
operator
we'll go ahead and take our next question from allison landry with credit suisse. go ahead.
allison landry -- credit suisse -- analyst
thank you. i was hoping you could maybe give us your overall thoughts just on the domestic pricing environment, whether that's ground or express. obviously, you're viewing that as a key lever to offset -- excuse me, the b2c mix impacts, but do you see a structural increase in the pricing for parcel as a result of the pull forward in e-commerce and some of the actions that your competitors are taking?
brie carere -- executive vice president, chief marketing and communications officer
structurally, we do. obviously, as i mentioned in my script, that we believe that e-commerce will remain elevated as a percentage of retail and that obviously capacity is a finite commodity in the market. we see a very rational market and we really see a great partnership with our largest customers. so we are working with them absolutely to find a win-win solution, but part of that is that we will, as i mentioned, implement peak surcharges. this is part of the new normal. it will not be just for this fiscal year. but i anticipate customers to pay more for pricing in november and december moving forward. and i do think that, that will be a structural shift in the market.
operator
[operator instructions] we'll take our next question from jordan alliger with goldman sachs. please go ahead.
jordan alliger -- goldman sachs -- analyst
yeah. hello, everyone. a question for you. i know you're not giving guidance per se. i'm just sort of curious as you mentioned that week-over-week volumes have gotten better. presumably, maybe the b2c or the essential might be coming down, but hopefully b2b yields, as you noted, coming back. when you think of product volume and profitability, which is great, you got back to double-digit. is this a type of volume broadly, you would need to sort of stay there? or, alan, are those comments you made on mix, smb and cost enough to keep you there, even if we back off some of the super growth on the e-commerce side? and maybe the trends are staying exactly where they are, i don't know. so i'm curious, your thoughts.
alan b. graf jr. -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
again, i can't tell you much about '21 because i just don't have a feel for what's happening as -- nor does anyone else. i mean, the virus is seemingly coming back in a lot of states, openings are slowing down. people are delaying their openings. microsoft shut in retail stores. just a lot of things that are going on here that make it extremely difficult to answer that question. i can tell you from a strategic standpoint, i feel extremely confident about where we are if things go well, but that's a strategic comment not an fy '21 comment, along the lines of how raj answered that question.
operator
and we'll take our next question from scott group with wolfe research. please go ahead.
scott group -- wolfe research -- analyst
hey, thanks, guys. so i know no guidance for next year but maybe, alan, just help us with some of any discrete items, pensions, tax rate, anything that's sort of outside the macro that you can give us. and then any chance you can give us some of the monthly volume trends at ground and express and sort of what you're seeing in june? i know you don't typically give that but since you're not giving guidance, maybe you can give us a little bit more color on some of the real-time trends. thank you.
alan b. graf jr. -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
scott, who is going to be president of the united states? that will help me a lot with the tax rate. also, obviously, revenues and profitability and where they are around the globe, so the tax rate, it's pretty wide range for me right now. i'd tell you, i'm really proud of our tax team to be doing what they've done and how they held it down in fy '20, which was spectacular. i believe brie did discuss how we came off the bottom pretty nicely in april and we improved, and so that's in history. that's in the rearview mirror. it's anybody's guess about going forward, but i think we're well-positioned, if we can continue.
operator
we'll go ahead and take our next question from tom wadewitz with ubs. go ahead.
tom wadewitz -- ubs -- analyst
yeah, good afternoon. so you've had quite a bit of discussion about changes in ground and highlighted some of the drivers of efficiency. i wonder if you could spend a few minutes on express and delve a little more into some of the structural changes that are taking place, cost structure changes that could affect margin performance in express. i think of the -- obviously some of the b2c going into ground and whether that has a margin impact in the medium term capacity reduction that you had talked about before. maybe that's not taking place. but just kind of comments on cost structure and what's happening in express. thank you.
rajesh subramaniam -- president and chief operating officer
well, let me start there and give it to don. but we have been extremely disciplined in how we manage our cost structure in express, all the way from managing our capacity and redeploying to where the demand is. i mean, as we talked to you about, we have the air capacity coordination center where we are actually moving the capacity very dynamically into the places where we can maximize our revenue and profitability. we have streamlined our organization structure and we are moving forward with our last mile optimization program to make sure that we put the residential packages in the right network to reduce cost and improve density. let me turn it over to don for anything else he wants to add.
donald f. colleran -- president and chief executive officer, fedex express
sure, thanks, raj. let me try to provide a little bit of color to what we're doing at express on our transformation journey. so as we transition to '21 and '22 and beyond, for us it obviously starts with our profitable and optimal growth strategy. we work very closely with our commercial partners both in sales and marketing to ensure that we're getting the proper top-line growth. so in any ongoing business concern, you need to be growing the top-line and taking market share, we're clearly focused on that. what i'm really excited about is the introduction, as raj mentioned, of our new mega region approach, essentially taken our international regions and global regions from six to three. not only does it add a level of efficiency and effectiveness, but it adds a tremendous amount of velocity into our decision-making process. so we did not only have the right construct in place, but i'm really excited about the people that we have in the -- the folks that we have running that organization, i think, and i expect great things from them going forward.
on the transformation side, this is a global initiative. each of our mega regions has a significant role in that transformation. it's just not the u.s or europe or in international play. we're going to do this in a very collaborative fashion. so the transformation begins with the reengineering of the airline. as raj told you, we had effectively reengineered the network to take out almost 7% of our flight hours in this particular quarter. and then opportunity presented itself to redeploy those assets in a very accretive way, which we've done.
on the transformation side, you've heard us talk about our last mile optimization programs in terms of building, as henry and raj talked about, that last mile optimization to assist in the delivery density for residential packages. so there is a series of initiatives, strategies and tactics we have in place. and as alan said earlier, i'm very optimistic as well on the things we can control, and our ability to execute is coming at a very high level. so assuming a normal environment and assuming the focus on those issues that are controllable, we feel like we're in a good place on our transformation at express.
operator
we'll go ahead and take our next question from ken hoexter with bank of america.
ken hoexter -- bank of america securities -- analyst
hi, good afternoon. great job on the ground margins. brie, you mentioned improvement in b2b that you've seen. can you give us some thoughts on the b2c fall off and the mix as we move into the new year? and i guess, alan, in that same vein, any impacts on the $1 billion cuts on that network optimization program on the ground-express mix?
brie carere -- executive vice president, chief marketing and communications officer
i think as alan mentioned, i'm obviously not going to forecast volumes into fy '21. but what i certainly can tell you is, i believe that the e-commerce change is structural. we have seen a huge uptick in the categories that people are willing to purchase online, certainly moved into a higher value. we saw this trend obviously pre-covid but it has accelerated when you think about things like furniture, large packages, high-value electronics. in addition, we saw a huge change in who is buying online, over 65 finally moved to online. from an e-commerce perspective, i do not anticipate that these buying behaviors will revert back, post-covid. you might see some as a percentage of e-commerce decrease as retail itself grows. but overall, i believe that e-commerce will continue to stay elevated, and that will create strong demand for ground for some time in the future.
alan b. graf jr. -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes. and, ken, obviously, we know where the biggest cash flows are coming from inside the company right now. so we are going to continue to invest heavily in ground and ground will not see any reduction, probably an increase year-over-year in the amount of capital that we put in and doing a great job with it. they're figuring out very creative ways how to make it be more productive and obviously with seven days a week, wide open, they're sweating their assets a lot more. so it's just a spectacular performance.
operator
we'll go ahead and take our next question from helane becker with cowen. please go ahead.
helane becker -- cowen & company -- analyst
hi. and thank you very much, operator. hi, everybody. i appreciate the time. i feel like i ask this question a lot, but as you think about kind of the developments in the world and what's going on in china, specifically, is there any time where you have to rethink the guangzhou hub as a asia pacific connecting point?
rajesh subramaniam -- president and chief operating officer
at this point, we are glad that we have a hub in guangzhou and the traffic is flow -- we have a lot of traffic flowing through that hub, and we are -- it's a central -- centroid for a lot of the traffic that flows through the asian region.
alan b. graf jr. -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
helane, you might imagine, though, that we always think about this from a lot of different reasons, mostly not political, mostly natural disasters so that we have -- as you know, we have hubs all over the globe and we can react if we need.
operator
we'll go ahead and take our next question from ben hartford with baird. please go ahead.
ben hartford -- robert w. baird & co. -- analyst
hi, good evening, everyone. raj or don, as you think about completing the global air network that you talked about in early 2022 and as you think about that footprint, particularly in europe, from a ground perspective what tnt brought, anything else that you might look at going forward to complete that ground network more on the b2c side either in the form of a partnership or an acquisition as we think even beyond 2022, any perspective there?
rajesh subramaniam -- president and chief operating officer
it's -- first of all, we are -- with -- as tnt with all the activities we've already done in the last few months and what's coming in fiscal year '21, it's -- we now have a fantastic network on the ground in europe and we will leverage that for b2b and b2c traffic. and as far as air, as we said, we probably -- early in the calendar year 2022, we'll have the air networks integrated, but i think with tnt as now -- as part of the portfolio, we have a great opportunity to really improve the revenue and profit profile in europe, b2b and b2c.
donald f. colleran -- president and chief executive officer, fedex express
hey, ben. we built home delivery from scratch inside of ground. so that should maybe answer part of your question.
operator
we'll go ahead and take our next question from bascome majors with susquehanna. please go ahead.
bascome majors -- susquehanna -- analyst
yes, thank you. so the debt covenant easing negotiated a month ago lets you take leverage above 4.5 times ebitda for a couple of quarters over the next five quarters, i believe, and that looks like a lot of breathing room even considering what covid is doing to profitability and the debt you've added to add liquidity in the last few months. so, i mean, are acquisitions sized above the tuck-in variety on the table for fedex over the next six to 18 months? and are you seeing any motivated sellers in the domestic or international marketplaces at this point? thank you.
alan b. graf jr. -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
hey, bascome, if you'd have been sitting in my shoes, you'd have tried to even get a wider leniency on our debt covenants. because we had no idea where this was going, and so we did what we thought was the best balance between increasing our liquidity significantly enough to what we thought might be the worst case to make sure that we could maintain our operations because we are an essential service and we felt it was important to do that. so that didn't have anything to do with our corporate strategy other than simply that. in fact, it's our objective over the next few years to begin to improve our balance sheet significantly by obviously growing the equity part and cash flows and paying down some of this debt. and, of course, we aren't going to comment on any corporate development activities.
operator
we'll go ahead and take our next question from david ross with stifel. please go ahead.
david ross -- stifel -- analyst
yes, good afternoon, everyone. i want to talk about fedex freight, much better yield growth in the overall ltl market, 10% on average between the priority and economy. i wanted to just get some color there. was it due to the freight that -- i guess the work that freight was doing for ground that you mentioned that may have been at a premium or was there any culling of customer business in the overall downdraft?
john a. smith -- president and chief executive officer, fedex freight
well, thanks for the question. this is john. one of the things that we have been doing a lot in the past is helping ground with their line-haul operation both from a over-the-road, as well as intermodal. but just recently, about three months ago is where we first delivered an actual ground shipment to a customer and we've grown that very rapidly. and the reason that we have played into that so easily is the development of our fedex freight direct. and what that has allowed us to do, to have the right equipment to help our ground partners and on the home delivery side. so we see not only an upside for growing fedex freight direct, but also the ability to help our ground partners making sure, as raj said earlier, putting the right freight in the right network.
rajesh subramaniam -- president and chief operating officer
let me also add here that the freight team has done such a phenomenal job of managing revenue quality over the last few months and years. and i think as much as all the things that john talked about added to the result of base business, the way they managed it is really phenomenal. so hats off to the team.
operator
and we'll go ahead and take our next question from brian ossenbeck with j.p. morgan. go ahead.
brian ossenbeck -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
hey, thanks. good evening. i wanted to ask about capex. how much of a reduction for next year would you view as sustainable with a lower run rate versus something that's more deferred into the future? and then just maybe the bigger picture, if you can revisit the views on capital intensity of ground and express, especially in the u.s. that when you're looking at more growth that's short zone lightweight or oversized and hard to handle. is there any more room to reallocate the domestic fleet internationally if this continues? and how much lower can ground move from a capex intensity standpoint as it gets faster and you add more regional sort facilities?
alan b. graf jr. -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
depends. obviously, it depends on what happens to the global economy, united states gdp and everything else, going forward. i thought we took a pretty bold move by reducing by $1 billion, what we spent this year. frankly, we had a demand for even more than that. so we actually reduced more from the original planning than we would have otherwise done. we've smoothed our airplanes. those are not additions to capacity. again, there was a replacement and ground is mostly for growth. and ground is a very efficient user of capital and particularly at the short zone and i'm going to let henry think about how he wants to continue what i'm saying here by sort of chatting along for a second. but ground is a very efficient user of capital, particularly with their model. henry?
henry j. maier -- president and chief executive officer, fedex ground
yeah. thanks, alan. well, let me just talk about a couple of things here. one is the regional sort facilities are low cost, mainly short-haul inbound sortation facilities. i mean, it's brilliant with the team came up here, because we can put them up pretty quickly in existing buildings and they are nowhere near as expensive as building a hub. longer term, and i guess shorter term and longer term and near term and longer term, i think the bigger issue we have with respect to your question, brian, is van positions and the ability to load vans in existing end of line stations. we use a lot of very novel, quite inexpensive material handling for that. but sooner or later, you just run out of parking and you run out of van positions. so we're going to have to do something in that regard, probably more so than we've done in the past, given the network changes we're seeing in the business as the network get shorter.
operator
we'll go ahead and take our final question from todd fowler with keybanc capital partner -- capital markets, excuse me. please go ahead.
todd fowler -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
great, thanks for, i think, sort of correction there. i think this follows up maybe on the last question. can you just comment in general where you see capacity on the ground side? and thinking about if we see b2b volumes kind of revert back to pre-covid levels, can the network handle both the acceleration that you've seen in b2c, as well as kind of a normalized b2b environment or does it require more investment at some point in the future? and then also, alan, could you care to comment on maybe what the margin impact from the seven-day rollout here was in the fiscal fourth quarter? thanks.
rajesh subramaniam -- president and chief operating officer
henry, you want to take that?
henry j. maier -- president and chief executive officer, fedex ground
i'm sorry. there were a lot of moving parts there. so let me just say, i think we've covered the capex capacity question. and, i mean, it's something that we spend a lot of time on here. we manage it all the time. we've got great engineers here that plan this network several years in advance. we are, as alan said, prudent users of the shareholders' money here. we don't invest in things that don't produce a return. but all that being said, sooner or later, you run out of space and capacity for the volume we're seeing. right now, we don't see in the near term a problem if b2b comes back. but, nevertheless, we're going to continue to invest in this network so we can continue to grow it. thanks.
alan b. graf jr. -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
i would say that, thank goodness that we had a seven-day network when this absolute tsunami of packages hit us because it helped us manage and smooth the ability to deliver all those packages that we otherwise not would have had. so it was a positive in the quarter.
rajesh subramaniam -- president and chief operating officer
yeah, i'm just going to add to the same point that strategically leaning into e-commerce and all the moves that we made earlier in the year about seven-day and the large package moves, as well as the smartpost, those are all right moves. it just -- the market just accelerated and we're strategically -- we are extremely well-positioned to play in e-commerce and b2b, of course.

2021-Q3,FDX,2021-03-18 17:30:00,"prepared remarks:
operator
good day, everyone, and welcome to the fedex corporation third quarter fiscal year 2021 earnings conference call. today's call is being recorded.
at this time, i would like to turn the call over to mickey foster, vice president of investor relations for fedex corporation. please, go ahead.
mickey foster -- vice president of investor relations
good afternoon, and welcome to fedex corporation's third quarter earnings conference call. the third quarter form 10-q, earnings release, stat book as well as our economic forecast on our website at fedex.com. this call is being streamed from our website where the replay will be available for about one year.
joining us on the call today are members of the media. during our question-and-answer session, callers will be limited to one question in order to allow us to accommodate all those who would like to participate.
i want to remind all listeners that fedex corporation desires to take advantage of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act. certain statements in this conference call, such as projections regarding future performance, may be considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of the act. such forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. for additional information on these factors, please refer to our press releases and filings with the sec. please refer to the investor relations portion of our website at fedex.com for a reconciliation of the non-gaap financial measures discussed on the call to the most directly comparable gaap measures.
joining us on the call today are fred smith, chairman and ceo; raj subramaniam, president and coo; mike lenz, executive vp and cfo; mark allen, executive vp, general counsel and secretary; rob carter, executive vice president, fedex information services and cio, brie carere, executive vice president, chief marketing and communications officer; jill brannon, executive vice president and chief sales officer; don colleran, president and ceo of fedex express; henry maier, president and ceo of fedex ground; john smith, president and ceo-elect of fedex ground, and lance moll, president and ceo of fedex freight.
and now, fred smith will share his views on the quarter.
frederick w. smith -- chairman of the board and chief executive officer
thank you, mickey. first, i want to say how immensely proud i am of our fedex team members. since our last earnings call, they've completed a historic peak season and using the power of our expanded seven-day-a-week fedex ground operations, our team handled record-breaking volumes throughout the holiday shipping season. they also worked diligently to clear the backlog caused by the recent severe winter weather in the us, a 50-year event. they worked night and day to move the backlog quickly and as safely as possible. this includes the many team members who typically perform other duties and volunteered their time to help. we're sincerely grateful to them and to our customers for their understanding, as we navigated the effects of these massive winter storms.
our team members are continuing to move the world forward with the delivery of covid-19 vaccines-related ingredients and supplies throughout the us, canada and more than 20 other countries around the world. we did a great job on these vaccines during the weather event, too. fedex is prepared to transport now vaccines to more than 220 countries and territories for as long as necessary to help eradicate covid-19.
as part of our responsibility to be good stewards of the planet, earlier this month, we announced our bold strategy to achieve carbon-neutral operations globally by 2040. to help reach this goal, we focused our strategy in three key areas: vehicle electrification, which we've been involved in for over a decade; sustainable energy; and carbon sequestration -- natural carbon sequestration. in this regard, importantly, our plan includes a pledge to help establish the yale center for natural carbon capture. the center will build on the yale legacy of the school and the environment of world-class research and education to develop measurable carbon capture solutions with an initial focus on helping to offset greenhouse gas emissions equivalent to current airline emissions. findings will be published and shared so that businesses, industries, and governments globally can benefit from this work.
as reflected in this quarter's results, continued execution of our strategies is producing strong earnings growth and margin improvement across our company. we expect demand for our unmatched e-commerce and international express solutions to remain high for the foreseeable future. i'm exceedingly optimistic about the future of fedex, and again, very grateful to our team members for their hard work.
i'd also like to thank henry maier, president and ceo of fedex ground, who is retiring at the end of july after more than 35 years of dedicated service at fedex. we'll have much more to say about henry on our next earnings call in june.
let me now ask raj, brie, and mike to provide their comments, after which we will take your questions. raj?
rajesh subramaniam -- president and chief operating officer
thank you, fred and good afternoon everybody. q3 was a strong quarter of growth for fedex. despite challenging circumstances, the team performed exceptionally well through the biggest peak season in our company's history. this included delivering nearly 0.5 billion holiday packages, transporting the first shipment of covid-19 vaccines here in the us, and increasing collaboration across operating companies.
our results speak for themselves. in december, we achieved the highest monthly totals in our company's history in both revenue and operating profit. results in december were different than previous years. we better maximized our available capacity, and as brie will cover in a moment, better aligned prices to incremental costs. peak 2020 was unlike any peak experience before and sets a new standard for future peak seasons.
as fred mentioned, our operations were impacted by last month's severe winter weather throughout the united states. mike will expand more on the scope and unique nature of these storms. and i'm sure many of you have seen reports in the last couple of days, which illustrate the impact these storms had on the overall us economy, including retail sales and manufacturing output. we implemented numerous contingencies to mitigate the impact, including adding sorts, line haul and collaborating across our network to assist in the recovery. i'm very proud of the team for managing through this very challenging situation.
now, speaking of the team, we announced that henry maier will retire this summer and named john smith, former president and ceo of fedex freight, his successor. lance moll, former svp of operations at fedex freight, has been promoted to ceo, and we're pleased to have all these three gentlemen on the call today.
now, turning to fedex ground. the outstanding margin improvement for ground in q3 highlights the success of our ongoing strategic initiatives and investments to improve efficiency and reduce costs associated with the last mile even amid record residential volume levels. these investments continue to pay off. let me share three examples. number one, we saw a meaningful improvement in last mile efficiency as service providers improved their stops per hour 21% year-over-year in q3. number two, the average cost per stop decreased by 12% year-over-year. and number three, we maximized our assets, expanding to seven-day operations and integrating ground economy, or formerly fedex smartpost, reduced our fixed cost per package by 4% year-over-year. we remain very optimistic for continued profitable growth at ground.
collaboration between operating companies continue at an unprecedented rate in q3. this month marks the one year anniversary of the launch of last mile optimization, which allows us to flex our networks to increase delivery density for residential, rural and deferred packages. lmo will expand to six more markets effective may the 1st, increasing to 63 markets in total and covering two-thirds of the us gdp. additionally, fedex freight has delivered more than 1.75 million shipments for ground so far this fiscal year. this time last year, freight had yet to deliver a single ground shipment as increased support for ground kicked off in may of 2020.
finally, turning to fedex express. our global network is moving covid-19 vaccines, ingredients and supplies as we speak. it has been a coordinated orchestration of our physical and digital capabilities. at fedex express, we expect elevated pricing for at least the next 12 months. we know, however, that these prices are not sustainable in the longer term, and we will flex our networks appropriately as commercial capacity returns into the market. in addition, we will continue to improve our efficiency by executing last mile optimization and transforming our european business. in europe, momentum continues with the physical integration of the tnt network. we recently announced our europe restructuring program, and we are progressing with local consultations as planned and in accordance with local market regulations. april will be a big month as we prepare to roll-out a set of new service capabilities for our customers, which brie will provide more detail very shortly here.
we'll complete their integration in spring 2022, which will bring the physical network integration to a close. our paris hub will be our main express hub in europe with liege serving as [indecipherable] in the us as our second largest european air hub. we remain focused on optimizing the network and strengthening our capabilities to drive upside in europe for years to come.
in closing, fedex remains committed to delivering long-term profitable growth. we have the network, the strategy and the right team in place as we build upon the exceptional results we have seen so far in fiscal year 2021.
with that, let me turn it over to brie.
brie carere -- executive vice president, chief marketing and communications officer
thank you, raj. good afternoon, everyone. in the united states, we are seeing strong growth and momentum. the us domestic parcel market is expected to grow to 101 million packages a day by calendar year 2022, with e-commerce contributing 86% of total us market growth. e-commerce as a percentage of us retail sales was approximately 21% in q4 of calendar year 2020, significantly above the pre-pandemic level. we remain excited about the diversification and evolution of the e-commerce market. some of our largest retail customers reported e-commerce growth rates in the high double and even triple-digits through 2020. as the us reopens, we recognize the potential for a short-term deceleration in e-commerce shopping. however, we are very confident that e-commerce as a percentage of retail, has a long growth runway.
turning now to peak. it certainly was the ship upon we predicted, a peak upon a peak. we had tremendous growth with almost 500 million packages delivered and 19% year-over-year adv growth. to the global sales and marketing teams, i could not be more proud of your execution and the momentum you have created.
fy 2021 parcel volume growth remains strong, supported by a portfolio of e-commerce solutions growing at double-digits. of particular note, our fedex ground seven-day a week residential delivery service is one of the fastest-growing services in e-commerce with 70% volume growth in q3. overall, year-to-date average daily volume growth remains strong for all customer segments. however, our us small and medium segment grew 35% through the end of february.
in fy 2021 q3, fedex total us domestic residential package volume mix was 70% versus 62% a year ago. with the increase of residential packages in our networks, we're focused on improving yield and product mix. in fy 2021 q3, we increased fedex ground economy yield by 35% and overall us domestic residential yields by 15% year-over-year. it's important to note, fedex ground is formally fedex smartpost. while e-commerce is the key driver of the overall growth, in january, our us enterprise b2b volume was at pre-covid levels.
turning to our us revenue quality strategy. we continue to actively pursue yield management, product and customer mix strategies. our primary focus is ensuring large customer pricing aligns to their volume distribution. we continue to manage capacity at fedex ground, prioritizing our highest yielding sam segment as well as our premium home delivery product. as we plan for peak of fiscal year 2022, our peak surcharges will continue to play a critical role.
turning now to international. global air cargo capacity remains down 20% year-over-year as of january and we expect air cargo capacity to remain constrained through the end of calendar year 2021. we expect passenger capacity to recover between 55% and 75% of its pre-covid level by the end of calendar year 2021 with a full recovery not anticipated until 2023 or 2024. from a demand perspective, apac outbound has recovered to pre-covid, while europe outbound is expecting a partial recovery by the end of 2021 and a full recovery sometime in 2023.
with these projections, demand trends will continue to favor freighters and integrators. we are confident in our ability to maintain elevated yields for at least 12 months. with e-commerce driving significant growth internationally, we will increasingly utilize peak surcharges in our international business.
finally, we are executing commercial strategies to maintain and grow our incremental volume as capacity recovers. intercontinental performance continues to be very strong. our total international express yield per pound has again seen impressive double-digit year-over-year improvements in all key markets. our b2b volumes are recovering to pre-covid levels in europe, and are fully recovered in asia, while our overall growth is fueled by significant b2c volumes.
during our fourth quarter, we will dramatically enhance our european portfolio. as stated on previous calls, with the completion of the road integration in last may, our european road value proposition already gained significant improvements. our customers have been accessing the unparalleled tnt european road network. in q4, we will introduce an enhanced europe-to-the-us value proposition, providing an industry-leading next-day service to the us in twice the number of origin countries currently offered. in addition, we will be launching our new fedex international priority express service, giving our european customers two premium services within europe, offering customers' choice between overnight by noon and overnight by end of day. we will be rolling out these new service capabilities to our customers over the coming months.
we will also launch fedex international connect plus from europe to the united states to asia and within europe, providing the service across more than 200 lanes. fedex international connect plus or ficp, has been designed with features of service targeted to reduce the cost to serve, while delivering an outstanding customer experience and is specifically targeted to support our e-commerce customers. the new european transportation portfolio is brought to market through a refreshed and modern online shipping application that has already rolled out in europe and across 143 countries globally.
in summary, we have great momentum coming out of q3.
and with that, i'll turn it over to mike for his comments.
mike lenz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thank you, brie, and good afternoon, everyone. fedex delivered significantly improved financial results during the quarter, as we met the challenges of rising demand and limited capacity during our peak season and overcame severe winter weather in february.
adjusted operating profit increased 120%, and adjusted operating margin increased 210 basis points, primarily due to strong volume growth in us domestic residential package, a 41% increase in fedex international priority package volume, led by asia and europe and solid execution of our revenue management strategies in the face of increasing demand across all our transportation segments. these gains were partially offset by four noteworthy factors. first, higher variable incentive compensation expense of $485 million, including a $125 million special bonus for global frontline team members at fedex express; second, lower revenues and higher costs due to significant weather events that reduced operating income by an estimated $350 million; third, the estimated impact of having one fewer operating week day, which was approximately $150 million; and lastly, consolidated direct covid-19-related cost of approximately $60 million, which does not capture the many accommodations we continue to make across all our operations for the safety of our employees and to comply with various regulations and guidelines.
given its significance, i want to add further context around the adverse weather impact. first, we always anticipate and have contingencies for demand and operational impacts during our fiscal third quarter, which spans the most active winter weather months. the mid to late february events, in particular, impacted many parts of the country, but were historic throughout the south central corridor of the us. the snow amounts in memphis had not been seen in over 50 years prior to the founding of fedex and when coupled with a record time nine consecutive days below freezing, had a significant impact on our operations, as fred and raj mentioned.
our indianapolis and north texas express hubs were impacted as well. demand was deferred as significant portions of the us population were impacted by the various weather events. of the $350 million estimated impact, $240 million was at express, $85 million at ground, and $25 million at freight. despite that, the express segment reported adjusted operating profit of $514 million with an adjusted operating margin of 4.8%, up 260 basis points, driven by significant volume growth in both international export and us domestic package, as well as higher international priority yields.
in the quarter, express absorbed $340 million higher variable incentive compensation expense and was on pace to deliver record third quarter operating profit prior to the february weather. fedex ground had an exceptional peak and third quarter, growing operating margin 270 basis points over the prior year to 8.8%. operating income of $702 million was the highest third quarter in fedex ground's history. yield grew 11%, while volumes were up 25%, resulting in 37% growth in revenues, which more than offset headwinds, including increased payments to our independent service providers, higher labor rates, and higher variable incentive compensation of $70 million. as raj and brie highlighted, our commercial and operational initiatives are yielding and will continue to yield profitable growth at ground, as we capitalize on the e-commerce opportunity.
turning to fedex freight, operating income increased 5% despite the impact of increased variable compensation and the weather. freight continues to post excellent results with their focus on revenue quality, aligning their cost structure with current business levels, and improving operational efficiencies. freight also provided critical peak season operational support to both ground and express. our effective tax rate was 15% for the quarter due to tax benefits of $108 million, resulting from a tax rate increase in the netherlands applied to a deferred tax balances and associated with a $300 million voluntary contribution to our qualified us pension plans.
now, turning to what's ahead. while there remains a degree of uncertainty as we begin to see progress in combating the pandemic, we are projecting full year adjusted earnings per share of $17.60 to $18.20, compared to $9.50 adjusted eps in fy 2020. we expect our effective tax rate prior to the year-end mark-to-market adjustment to be between 21% and 22% for the full year fiscal 2021. we expect higher revenue, operating income, and operating margins on a year-over-year basis at all our transportation segments in the fourth quarter, which does include one additional operating week day.
these forecasts assume continued recovery in us industrial production and global trade, no additional covid-19-related business restrictions, and current fuel price expectations. with this forecast, we expect higher variable incentive compensation expense in the fourth quarter, as we plan to reward our employees for their achievements this year. the year-over-year increase is expected to be slightly higher than the third quarter excluding the $125 million special bonus i mentioned previously.
earlier, fred mentioned our sustainability initiatives and we will record our $100 million pledge to yale university in our fourth quarter results. for express in the fourth quarter, there will be no benefit from the reduction in the aviation excise tax and the cares act, which expired on december 31st. in addition, express maintenance costs will be higher year-over-year in the fourth quarter as we execute on our flexible air fleet strategy. just over a year ago, we shared with you plans to temporarily park the equivalent of seven md-11s. given the increased demand, we are efficiently adding needed capacity for our customers by investing in maintenance expense to utilize aircraft from temporary storage. as of now, we plan to have no temporarily parked md-11s prior to next peak season. this illustrates our ability to flex capacity up or down in a financially efficient manner in response to changes in the market.
our capital spending focus remains on strategic investments that will reduce our cost structure, improve our efficiency, and increase our capacity to profitably meet market growth demands. our fy 2021 capex forecast is now $5.7 billion due to changes in the timing of aircraft payments, as well as the acceleration of fedex ground capacity initiatives. that projects to roughly 6.9% of expected revenue, which is the lowest level in over 10 years. while we have not finalized our fy 2022 plans, capital spending will increase, as we invest in capacity and proceed with investments in replacement capital previously deferred. that said, i anticipate capex, as a percentage of revenue will be 8% or less, which remains less than our historical capital intensity. we will provide more specifics in june.
looking at liquidity on the balance sheet, we ended the third quarter with $8.9 billion in cash and cash equivalents, and on tuesday, renewed our $2 billion five-year credit agreement and $1.5 billion 364-day credit agreement. the key aspect of our capital allocation strategy moving forward will be strengthening our balance sheet and repayment of outstanding debt. given our strong cash flows and liquidity position, we are evaluating potential transactions to reduce and refinance existing debt. the timing of any transaction will be based on market conditions, and we would incur costs related to these transactions, which may be material.
i'll close by reiterating, i have great confidence in our ability to build on the successes we have had this year as we execute our plans to generate sustainable long-term growth in earnings and cash flow.
and with that, we can move to the question-and-answer session.

thank you. [operator instructions] and first, we'll go to chris wetherbee from citi. your line is open.
christian wetherbee -- citigroup -- analyst
yeah. hey, thanks. good afternoon. maybe i want to start on the ground side and understand, i guess, first, around ground pricing, so significant progress has been made so far. but i wanted to get a sense of where do you think you are in the process of repricing this product up for the service that you're offering and ultimately, the demand in the market right now? and then maybe as we think about how's that and mix may impact margins as we move forward, say, into fiscal 2022, clearly, we've moved -- are very heavily overweight toward b2c, over the course of the last 12 months. but as b2b grows, it maybe even takes a little bit of market share. how should that play through your ground margins?
brie carere -- executive vice president, chief marketing and communications officer
thanks for the question, chris. it's brie speaking. you know, from a yield strategy perspective, we still believe we have opportunity from a mix perspective. as you saw this quarter was probably the most dramatic or not probably was the most dramatic movement we've been able to make from a product perspective. you're going to see that shift throughout this year as capacity -- we anticipate capacity throughout this calendar year will be constrained. and as a result, as i mentioned, we've got to prioritize our sam growth. you heard 35%. it's the best segment performance we've got from a small perspective. so we're going to prioritize that. it will continue to work our yields up. in addition to that, the fedex economy product is something that we are very focused on and it will add dramatic yield upside from here out.
henry?
henry j. maier -- fedex ground president and chief executive officer
hi, chris. let me take the margin question. first of all, in q4, we expect teens -- our margins to be in the teens. but let me speak to how we see the business beyond that. first, we believe there's considerable operating leverage still to be realized in this business. strategic initiatives will help ensure the right packages are on the right sort, on the right day for on-time delivery. they also ensure that overnight sorts are reserved for next-day volume, enabling the right balance of sort capacity in the network. these are critical capabilities for a seven-day network operation.
we're also implementing dynamic scheduling tools to match sort, staffing, headcount more closely to volumes, thereby improving dock productivity and our dock expense. and we're rolling out capabilities for certain upstream volume in the network to bypass station sortation and transfer directly to delivery vehicles, freeing up valuable station capacity. none of these initiatives require brick-and-mortar. they're possible through industry leading technology, ai and machine learning and are developed using a safe, agile framework and tools. so with all of that, in my view, as we continue to transform the fedex ground business, fedex ground's best days are still ahead of them.
christian wetherbee -- citigroup -- analyst
all right. thanks for the time.
operator
and next, we'll go to ken hoexter from bank of america. your line is open.
ken hoexter -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
great. good afternoon. let me switch over to express. and i guess, if you exclude the weather impacts, the 4.8% goes up to maybe upper single-digits in terms of margin. maybe you could talk about the -- brie, the return of b2b on the express side, same thing that you were just talking on ground. maybe you were talking about pricing starting to disappear in 12 months. so how do you look at this business? do you see it transitioning back to double-digit margins or is there some structural change that keeps that at the single-digit levels?
brie carere -- executive vice president, chief marketing and communications officer
hi, ken. it's brie. i'll start with the pricing and the yield element and then turn it back over to don and mike. from a yield perspective and from a b2b, as we mentioned, as of january, here in the united states our b2b volume was back to pre-covid level. the mix within the b2b wasn't what historically we have seen. it was obviously heavy healthcare, heavy retail, heavy tech. we have not seen it fully come back in automotive and industrial. so we think that there's some upside there. when you look at the b2b volume outside of the united states, at a whole holistic level, we're back, but europe is not. so we see there still opportunity intra-europe and intercontinental outbound from europe. the european team has done a phenomenal job of shoring up volume, but it is b2c volume that they've shored up that gap with. so i still think that there is some b2b upside coming out of europe still.
from a yield perspective, we're feeling pretty confident in our yields throughout this calendar year from an international express as well as a domestic express. there is pressure on the yield from a weight perspective, because the e-commerce mix will continue to increase outside of the united states at express. so overall, we're quite comfortable from a yield growth and opportunity perspective for the next 12 months.
and i'll turn it over to mike?
mike lenz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. chris, as i said, this is mike. certainly, in the fourth quarter, we'll see margin gains at all three of the transportation segments. you can't get to the guidance that we put out there without that falling into place, as well as the other context i gave you. and we're highly confident we can build on the momentum here with the strategies and the plans that have been outlined, but we're not going to be given forward margin expectations. we'll have more to say about our outlook for 2022 in june.
don?
donald f. colleran -- fedex express president and chief executive officer
yeah, mike and brie, just to add a few things to your comments. one is, i think, raj had mentioned in his prepared remarks, about the strength of the quarter. and it was a strong quarter for us, highlighted by the best december we've had in the company's history, and on-track to provide that same level of performance for the quarter, until the weather hit. now this is not a comment about would have, should have, could have, but it really is one to highlight the strong fundamentals that exist in the express business right now. we're extremely confident of the fundamentals that we'll continue to deliver into the fourth quarter, as evidence of what we've seen. we had $1.9 billion of revenue growth in that quarter. i thank our excellent sales team around the globe and a wonderful job that the express operating unit did in terms of monetizing and turning that into a strong performance.
as it relates to what we're seeing from a yield perspective, i agree, obviously, with brie's assessment. we're seeing some fundamentals in our international business that are quite clear to us in the short, medium and maybe in the longer term. when inventory levels remain low, supply is soft and demand is very strong. and we think that demand is going to even increase as the stimulus checks come into the marketplace. so we think, if you look at it in terms of tri-factor, those fundamental economic issues that we have should continue to benefit us, especially in our international business going forward.
ken hoexter -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst

and next, we'll go to allison landry from credit suisse. your line is open.
allison landry -- credit suisse -- analyst
so, thanks. good afternoon. sorry, i was on mute. just digging a little bit more in terms of the ground revenue per piece and specifically on q3, brie or henry, could you maybe talk about or break out the contribution to the yield equivalent that came from base price versus the peak surcharges and then mix? i guess, what i'm trying to think through is, how to best think about the sequential yield change in q4. normally, i think it's up about 4%. but obviously, maybe the peak surcharges fall-off, you have some incremental surcharges in place. so just looking for a little bit of context in terms of breaking out the contribution of the different pieces there. thank you.
brie carere -- executive vice president, chief marketing and communications officer
hi, allison. from a pricing strategy perspective, obviously, the vast majority of our volume is on highly complex contractual agreements. and so, it's quite difficult to streamline and break that out for you right now. but what i will tell you is from a q3 perspective, you saw really us very much focused on our fedex ground economy product. we know the spread between the fedex ground economy and our fedex ground home delivery product. that yield spread, historically, has been too wide. so, we are very focused on prioritizing capacity at the higher-yielding home delivery product. and so you're going to see two things happen. you're going to see us give more capacity to home delivery at the higher yield and you're going to see us increase the yield throughout this calendar year, both through peak surcharges as well as through gri strategies, and quite frankly, just contractual discussion. so that's really our focus is closing that gap, prioritizing capacity for home delivery and making sure we've got capacity for our small and medium customers.
allison landry -- credit suisse -- analyst
okay. and just any color on what sort of the peak surcharge impact was in q3 from a dollar perspective or a percentage perspective?
brie carere -- executive vice president, chief marketing and communications officer
we're not going to give that out at this time, allison.
allison landry -- credit suisse -- analyst
okay. thank you, guys.
operator
and next we'll go to jack atkins from stephens. your line is open.
jack atkins -- stephens inc. -- analyst
great. good afternoon and thanks for taking my questions. so, mike, i guess, maybe this one is for you. when i think about the fourth quarter implied guidance, historically, you see a fairly significant ramp in earnings from the third quarter to the fourth quarter. and when you normalize for the weather and the lower tax rate, your implied guidance is for maybe a 17% increase in earnings from third quarter to fourth quarter, typically, it's 50% to 60%. so, i'm just curious if maybe if you can walk us through some of the puts and takes there? is it a factor of just the broader economy? is some uncertainty there? just some conservatism in general. just can you help us think through the implied fourth quarter guidance and why you wouldn't see more of a normal seasonal ramp there? thank you.
mike lenz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
jack, i'm not going to get into de-comping all of the puts and takes that come into seasonality. i guess i would refer back to when i mentioned an effective tax rate for the year of 21% to 22%, that implies a higher tax rate in q4 than our -- typically, you can rule a thumb for a full year. the statutory federal rate is 21%, 3% or 4% for state and other, so 25% on a kind of normalized basis. but as we've mentioned on the call, we have had about $300 million of discrete events through year-to-date in q1 to q3. so i think when you kind of normalize for that and look at our underlying operating performance there, it is a very strong q4 and i'll leave it at that. i talked about some of the other elements that will play into q4 earlier, so i won't rehash those. but i think when you are able to piece it all together, it will be a very solid operating q4.
jack atkins -- stephens inc. -- analyst
okay. thank you.

and next, we'll go to jordan alliger from goldman sachs. your line is open.
jordan alliger -- goldman sachs -- analyst
yeah. hi, afternoon. question, when you think beyond fiscal fourth quarter of this year and into the next fiscal year, you start getting to some difference in tougher volume comps, especially in the ground. is your expectation, though, that with e-commerce continuing even at a decelerating pace that you could still grow the overall volume levels year-over-year? thanks.
brie carere -- executive vice president, chief marketing and communications officer
i guess the short answer is, yes. we're anticipating that the market growth, 90% of the market growth is going to come through e-commerce. we've got a long-term outlook at more than 10% cagr from an e-commerce perspective. so the short answer is, yes.
and mike, i'm sure would like to add something.
mike lenz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. jordan, just -- we threw a lot of numbers at you. but as brie mentioned, we went from 62% to 70% residential mix, and fedex ground's margins were up 270 basis points. so i think that speaks to how we plan to execute on the continued growth of e-commerce.
frederick w. smith -- chairman of the board and chief executive officer
and of course, we will be giving an fy 2022 earnings forecast in june. that has been something that's not been available during the pandemic from a lot of companies. but with the forecast that mike just gave you for the fourth quarter, you can anticipate a full year fy 2022 range at our june call.

and next we'll go to brandon oglenski from barclays. your line is open.
brandon oglenski -- barclays capital -- analyst
hey. good afternoon and thanks for taking my question. mike, can you talk to the outlook [indecipherable] capex is going to be below 8% of revenue and [technical issues] look forward on these projects, because i think you mentioned accelerating some of the ground investments there?
mike lenz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
brandon, you broke up a little bit, but if i understand asking about one of the capex references. so as we said, volume grew 25% at ground. and so as we came through december, evaluating and looking at what's ahead and the opportunity there, we see that as opportunity. also, if you look at our -- when you get the chance to look at the stat book in terms of the maintenance capex, you can see that our facilities and vehicles, we deferred a lot of that this year. so there will be some amount of those that -- going forward as well. so we'll certainly give you more specifics on that when it comes to june.
brandon oglenski -- barclays capital -- analyst
yeah, mike, i guess i was asking, like, in the longer term context, what are the type of return [technical issues] projects?
mike lenz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
i think the question is about returns. you broke up again. i will say with very absolute confidence that all of these investments we're making will generate a solid return on investment just as the investments we've made in the last few years are showing results today.

and next we'll go to amit mehrotra from deutsche bank. your line is open.
amit mehrotra -- deutsche bank -- analyst
thanks, operator. hi, everybody. henry, i was hoping i could ask you about ground margins, if that's ok? i think the key question and discussion point we've all had is the long-term outlook for ground margins, given the secular shift to b2c and the density challenges that obviously come with that. i mean, you guys have made incredible progress on pricing and operations. just wondering, if you can update us -- you gave a little bit of it last quarter, but hoping you can update us on what you think the sustainable margins for ground -- the ground business are on an annual basis and when do you think you can get there? and just related to that, you guys called out $350 million of weather. i was hoping you could talk about what the attribution to ground business was from that number. thank you.
mike lenz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
amit, this is mike. as i said in my remarks, $85 million of the weather was ground. again, we've said, we've given you fourth quarter guidance. we'll have more to say about future outlook in -- for fy 2022 in june. but we're very confident of our ability to build on the momentum of generating increased returns and profitability at ground.
amit mehrotra -- deutsche bank -- analyst
can i ask it another way then since it's the same question? the spread between pricing costs in ground was in excess of 300 basis points per package. as b2c recovers, is there any reason why the spread between price and cost per package should moderate over the next four to five, six quarters?
henry j. maier -- fedex ground president and chief executive officer
well, i think the last two quarters, we've given you some guidance on what we've seen unit costs do as we move through the pandemic and we move through the shift in the mix of our business. obviously, we're going to lap some of those results, but we've had significant reductions in our unit costs as we've gone through the last year as a result of many of the strategic initiatives we've outlined here, and we are in -- frankly, in raj's comments. we continue to see considerable operating leverage in the business, and we would expect margins to improve over-time.
amit mehrotra -- deutsche bank -- analyst
thank you, very much. appreciate it.
operator
and next, we'll go to tom wadewitz with ubs. your line is open.
thomas wadewitz -- ubs securities llc -- analyst
yeah, good afternoon. let's see. i wanted to -- i think one of the questions that seems to come up is concern about potential to have some of that strength in international rates that's beneficial for express, but eventually, some of that profitability is going to go back as past device-based comes back. and presumably, that's out very quickly and that you retain a portion of it. i wanted to see, if you could give us a sense of the potential offset from your cost initiatives. those numbers, if you look at a couple of years, are they potentially in the same magnitude? and i'm thinking in particular of integration of some of the b2c shipments for express and ground, but that's helpful on the cost side and potentially tnt and maybe you have other things in mind. thank you.
rajesh subramaniam -- president and chief operating officer
so tom, this is raj. i'll address it overall. obviously, it's not possible to give out the numbers by the individual items that you just talked about. however, we -- let me address it broadly by first saying that, the capacity and the commercial carrier -- passenger carriers, we don't expect it to come back in the next 12 months, maybe more and we expect the premium to remain for that period of time. even if it does come back, we have the opportunity to flex it, flex our networks. we can -- and that is -- we have demonstrated the capability to flex up and we will be able to flex it down as needed and they become our partner networks to move deferred traffic. thirdly, there's a lot of activity that's going on to continue to improve margins in fedex express. our transformation in europe was one -- expansion of last-mile optimization is another and very solid activity. so we feel very confident about our future of our express around the world.
i don't know, don, if you want to add anything more to that?
donald f. colleran -- fedex express president and chief executive officer
i think you hit it, raj. but, clearly, we have a playbook on margin -- improving margin expansion in both our domestic and international business. i think you touched upon and i did in my earlier comments, about why we're confident over the medium term that the supply and demand curve works in our favor. capacity is light and we think it will continue to remain that way, until people start traveling again on an intercontinental basis. we don't think that happens for the next 12 to 18 months, because of the various levels of quarantine restrictions that are in all parts of the globe.
we're working one of the things that i would want to highlight that we didn't talk to is, our last-mile optimization plans and the impact that, that has on our margin. i think our chairman says, density is our destiny. and as we can continue to improve the density in the either of our networks, it's very much margin accretive. we're celebrating the one-year anniversary coming up on last-mile optimization, working very closely with henry and his team. and we're driving a significant amount of volume through the ground network. and those numbers are accelerating on a sequential week-over-week, month-over-month basis. so there's a lot of leverage that we can pull in our business, the european transformation, the domestic transformation, but we have multiple playbooks in play, as we speak, to continue with our margin improvement and expansion.
frederick w. smith -- chairman of the board and chief executive officer
let me add something to that. the lmo initiative benefits in two ways. one, it takes lower-yielding residential packages and deferred packages and rural packages out of the express network, allowing the express system to concentrate on the high priority b2b and the verticals, particularly those that require ancillary services like senseaware id, which is on every single box of vaccines that we're now delivering. i mean, it's almost been flawless, the execution of that. and you can count on your hand the number of issues with the number of vaccines we've delivered in the millions. and so, express is able to be more express in the b2c and the less dense areas are more cost effectively served. so it's not just one side. it helps on both sides, which is what don mentioned about the density, because as we get more residential packages that are not express in nature, time definite, or something that somebody needs in a residence that express has to deliver, it helps ground's density, its cost, its asset utilization.
and i think one of the things that i listen to these calls, the last call we had 13 questions on ground margins. i don't know. we're not going to have 13 this time, but we've probably got half a dozen so far, wouldn't that be close? so one of the things that's hard for us to communicate to this group, henry has mentioned, is the fantastic effect of this technology that we've been rolling out. we don't advertise it all the time, but rob and his team and some of the fantastic work we have going on in other ways, that's why the confidence level is so high, that we can achieve these things in the future. so, what you all want us to do is to give it to you in a quarterly forecast and so forth, but some of the numbers that raj laid out there for you, i mean they're stunning in the productivity improvements. so i think it's important to look a bit at the bigger picture of some of these things.
and finally, i'll say, we have a plan to improve express margins with a lot of passenger capacity in the marketplace and a plan to improve it without a lot of passenger in the market. it's not an either/or situation. and so those are the two recurring questions that come up in these calls. the e-commerce are going to go back because everybody -- the pandemic is over and your margins aren't going to get better and you're not going to do well in express because the passenger is coming back. those are inherent in most of the questions, these last two calls. both of those are wrong. so i felt i had to step in finally. i've tried not to answer any questions, but you're going down the wrong rabbit hole on both of those areas.
thomas wadewitz -- ubs securities llc -- analyst
i think if i can just offer one more thought. i think it's just like the magnitude, it seems like they're pretty big programs and pretty favorable. so i think my question was just trying to understand, if you're going to give us a sense of the magnitude at some point. but they may -- i mean, what you're doing at makes a ton of sense and seems to be a big factor in the results. so, anyway, just -- thanks for all the good perspective on it.
operator
and next, we'll go to duane pfennigwerth from evercore isi. your line is open.
duane pfennigwerth -- evercore isi -- analyst
hey, i guess that rules out asking seven more ground questions. just a couple from me. how much of that $350 million is cost versus volume pushed out into this quarter?
frederick w. smith -- chairman of the board and chief executive officer
well, i will tell you most of the $350 million was revenue-related. we did have incremental costs at express for, of course, beyond normal expectations for de-icing and snow removal, additional labor costs. and then i think a couple of you have noted that, we had a significant event with one of our facilities in the netherlands there as well with the roof collapse, so that is a cost that was in the number as well. but principally, it is revenue from that.
and i'll let brie talk about the overall evolution of where we are now.
brie carere -- executive vice president, chief marketing and communications officer
yeah. i guess, the best way to think about march is the fundamentals are back. so we're very confident. if we take february out, our fundamentals look a lot like they did in january, b2b is strong, smb is back, ground is in good shape. so it was february revenue, but we feel very confident about the fundamentals in march.
duane pfennigwerth -- evercore isi -- analyst
thank you. and then just a quick high-level on vaccine distribution. i wonder if you could talk about any surprises versus your initial expectations, either the level of activity you've seen, or which segment is being utilized? and thanks for taking the questions.
mike lenz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. thanks, and it gives me an opportunity to brag on the team a little bit. so i guess, if there is anything that surprised me and it shouldn't have is how amazing the team is it that provided this exemplary service. richard smith and his organization have done yeoman's work to make sure that these vaccines move through our network. as fred said, an extremely high level of efficiency, a handful if that shipments that did not need service. i think what's important to note though, when we talk about the vaccines is really not the raw in absolute numbers that move in our network. in the grand scheme of things, when you look at almost 20 million packages a day moving through our network, this represents a very small portion of that. but what is important to note is a profound impact that these shipments have when they get to destination and it really just validates our purpose, and it's one we take very, very seriously.
the amount of lives that we potentially save, the amount of people we put back to work, amount of small businesses that reopen, the borders that can reopen back to normal levels. that's really the story on that vaccines and that's what we're most proud about. so i guess the surprise that really shouldn't have been is the amazing work that our team has done to galvanize and be energized around this purpose and they take that purpose very personally. get up every morning thinking about the mission that we have to get these vaccines to market, so we can get them in folks on. so i couldn't be more proud of the team in the way that brought these vaccines to market globally. so thanks for asking that question.
rajesh subramaniam -- president and chief operating officer
yeah, let me also jump in on that. i couldn't wait to. this is one of the most important work that we have done. and to do the work, to be honest, we need a network. and by that, i mean, you'll be able to pick it up in any one part of the world and deposit in any other part of the world in a couple of days. that requires a network. and only a couple of people can actually do -- a couple of companies can actually do that, and we do that very well. but you also tied to it, the technology component, the senseaware id that fred talked about that we rolled that out last year. i mean, it was perfectly timed for the vaccines to provide unprecedented visibility. and we also launched fedex surround last year, which provides the ai and ml predictive capability of what is going to happen. if you put it all together; we have the best service possible, and as the chairman pointed out, extremely low level of failures. so again, we are very proud of this work and continue to do our part in ending this pandemic.
operator
and next we'll go to allison poliniak from wells fargo. your line is open.
allison poliniak -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
hi. thanks for taking the question. just wanted to circle back on the new service capabilities that you talked about within international. is there a way to help us understand or quantify sort of the market hole you're expecting to sell, what drove the development of those products? and any thought on sort of mix, i'm assuming it would be a better mix business for you longer term. any thoughts there?
brie carere -- executive vice president, chief marketing and communications officer
sure. so i think when you think about what we're going -- what we have going on in the fourth quarter, we really actually have three kind of expansions from a service perspective. we will have, actually, we do have the fastest intra-european ground network as we completed the tnt ground network integration. that will provide growth, both from a b2b perspective, as well as a b2c perspective. so we are absolutely looking to take share intra-europe and we see that with the fastest network in europe. we're confident we can do that. when you think about the intercontinental, we actually, today, have the leading value proposition from europe to the united states, and we're going to double that. so we are going to have a dramatic advantage over both ups and dhl. we're adding nine origin countries. so it's going to allow us to really expand both our b2b share as well as our b2c share outside of the major markets in europe.
and then third, as we're talking about ficp, the same story outside of the united states is playing out everywhere in the world with more than 85% of our parcel growth opportunity coming in, in e-commerce and we did not have an international product that really had the right features of service for serving this massive growth opportunity and we are under-penetrated. full disclosure, we are behind both dhl and ups in this market today, so we see there only upside.
when you think about ficp, its features of service are different from our core b2b products in a couple of ways. number one, we've changed the clearance capabilities. so we now have low-value clearance capabilities or what we call type 86, which makes it a lower cost entry for the customer. we are automating our clearance capabilities, which reduces the cost to serve. we are changing the terms and conditions on the number of attempts that we will make at the last mile. and of course, we're rolling out retail access points in europe as well, so that we can provide that access directly to retail, again, lowering the cost to serve. so in all three of these segments, we believe we've got market share upside, but probably most specifically, on the overnight service to the united states, it's a b2b play. on ficp, it's a rapidly growing opportunity for e-commerce. i hope that helps to clarify.
allison poliniak -- wells fargo securities -- analyst

and next, we'll go to scott group from wolfe research. your line is open.
scott group -- wolfe research, llc -- analyst
hey, thanks, afternoon, guys. so mike, i just had a few questions for you. you've been highlighting incentive comp in the last few quarters. if we have more of a normal earnings growth year next year, is more of a normal incentive comp headwind, is that -- that's my question and the corporate elimination volume has grown to like a run rate of about $1 billion a year. i think there's been a bunch of covid losses in there. is that something that should start to normalize to be less of a loss in the future?
mike lenz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
well, scott, one thing that i would mention in the corporate unallocated line, as we've mentioned previously, fedex office results are in there and the print-related revenue, while adv is up spectacularly at fedex office, the print-related revenue is significantly impacted by the pandemic. so as we start to come through that, we would anticipate we'll see some improvement there. on the variable comp, i guess, what i would say to you in that is we wouldn't anticipate that to be a headwind looking at fy 2022. i hope that helps.

frederick w. smith -- chairman of the board and chief executive officer
thank you, mickey. fiscal '21 was truly unprecedented and we are enormously proud of our 570,000 team members who performed magnificently to keep global healthcare, industrial and at-homes, supply chains open and more recently allowed significant additional commerce to flow. the fedex teams were involved in moving ppe, vaccines and international shipments has been perhaps this company's finest hour. our financial results speak for themselves. raj and mike will have more to say about the numbers of course. our priortity in the fedex team and our performance for shareholders has greatly tempered however, but our continuing grief over the 15th april senseless murder at fedex ground facility in indianapolis of eight fedex team members. the lingering sorrow among their families, friends and colleagues throughout fedex can never be erased. raj will also comment on this tragedy in a moment.
the strategies, we've executed over the last several years were carefully developed and have been executed to the high level with great success overall. as we mentioned previously the pandemic simply brought many of the market trends which informed our strategies forward. brie will be more specific about these trends in a moment. as reported fedex revenues for fy '21 were $84 billion and we project fy '22 revenues over $90 billion. we believe fedex margins will continue to improve this fiscal year. however, as raj will cover momentarily, the labor market in the us over the last several months has been quite challenging adversely affecting hiring and leading to significant reengineering of parts of our networks to deal with the lack of these resources. and while the situation has begun to abate, delivering a successful peak season, when we anticipate significant year-over-year volume increases will require additional flexibility and creativity on the part of our management, staff and frontline team members while maintaining our safety above all culture.
to handle future ground volumes, we are significantly increasing capacity to deliver both great service and improve financial results. this summer, we are intently focused on improving network and delivery operations prior to the volume surge in the fall. there is great focus on revenue and quality at fedex, however our focus solely on yields does not give a complete picture of our profit upside. as brie will explain our alliances with retailer partners generate significant amounts of short-haul traffic, much of which is now shipped from stores. our innovate digitally initiatives are gaining steam particularly surround and sensor wear.
let me thank henry maier, for more than 34 years of loyal and dedicated service to fedex and rps, which we acquired in 1998. at the conclusion of this call, i'll have additional comments about henry's remarkable career and countless contributions to fedex's growth and success. i'll further note the bad administration has recognized an exceptional talent in our board member john chris inglis who was confirmed by the senate last week, to serve as the national cyber director. we benefited from chris' cyber security and information technology expertise since he joined our board in 2015 and we wish him well in the hugely important role for which he has been tapped.
now raj, brie and mike will give their remarks, after which we will answer your questions. raj?
rajesh subramaniam -- president and chief operating officer
thank you, fred, and good afternoon everyone. as fred stated, we continue to mourn the tragic loss of eight team members killed at fedex ground facilities in indianapolis on april 15. let me take a moment to remember each team member we lost that day. matthew r. alexander, samaria blackwell, amarjeet johal, jasvinder kaur, amarjit sekon, jaswinder singh, karli smith and john weisert. our most heartful sympathies and condolences remain with the families, team members and friends of these individuals. they will forever be members of the fedex family.
now turning to our results. fiscal year '21 was a pivotal year for fedex as we delivered incredible financial performance, including record revenue and profit in q4 and for the full fiscal year. this is a no short measure due to the outstanding work by our global team members. let me take this opportunity to say, thank you for the fedex team, especially those on the front lines who are going above and beyond the call of duty in these difficult times. when i look back at fiscal year '21, i'm proud of the role fedex played in saving lives, helping small and medium businesses get back on their feet and keeping the globe connected.
the exceptional financial performance was driven by a robust growth strategy and focused execution on three key areas. e-commerce, operational excellence and digital innovation. let me take a moment to highlight each strategic focus area and the progress made in q4. firstly, e-commerce. the acceleration of trends experienced in fiscal year '21 highlight the importance of our ongoing strategic initiatives to win globally in e-commerce. this includes fedex ground seven day operations, investing in technology to optimize last mile deliveries, expanding capabilities to better handle large items, offering the first fedex branded through the door service at fedex freight direct and accelerating the expansion of our retail convenience network.
ground's full seven day operations, including weekend residential delivery coverage now reaches 98% of the us population on saturdays and 95% on sundays, give us a distinct competitive advantage. we are working very closely with customers to leverage the full flexibility of weekend operations, so they can meet the demands of e-commerce every day of the week. this is evident in the growth we saw in ground sunday deliveries with 56% more packages delivered on sunday in q4 than last year. we are also winning in e-commerce outside the united states by leveraging the strength of our global networks and the expansion of our portfolio. brie will cover additional details in this regard shortly.
the second strategic focus area is operational excellence. our competitive advantage in the marketplace is fueled by a relentless focus on operational excellence and customer service. while service is a hallmark of fedex like many businesses, we are facing challenges with labor availability, which have contributed to recent service levels that do not meet our own high expectations of the quality we expect to deliver to our customers. the inability to hire team members particularly package handlers has driven wage rates higher and creates inefficiency in our networks as we use over time to cover open shifts and route volume around known constraints, just as a few examples. as such, we're taking bold actions across the business to address service issues and prepare for sustained volume increases, including continued investments in people, capacity and technology to optimize our networks.
fedex ground's strategic focus on efficiency continue to reap benefits in q4 as seen in our ongoing improvements in density. these improvements are driven in part by both b2b and b2c volume growth as well as enhancements in the route optimization technology, which drove up the average number of stops the service providers made per hour by 3.6% versus q4 of the previous fiscal year. along with the revised service provider e-commerce rate structure, these efficiencies contributed to a 3% reduction in cost per stop compared to the same quarter last year. further collaboration to improve efficiency continued across our businesses as we expanded our last mile optimization program. in addition, fedex freight provided approximately 70 million linehaul miles and delivered 1.75 million packages for ground in fiscal year '21.
another significant opportunity in further enhancing our operational excellence is the improvement in the profitability of our international operations, which starts in europe, with the completion of the physical integration of tnt. while the tnt integration has seen its share of setbacks, including a 2017 cyber attack and the delays due to the pandemic, we are certain of the value this combination creates for the fedex of the future. the european restructuring announced in january 2021 is set to deliver 275 million to 350 million in benefits on an annual basis starting in fiscal 2024. the cost of the severance benefits under this program, which will be incurred through fiscal 2023 will be in the range from $300 million to $575 million in cash expenditures.
in q4, we introduced overnight service from europe connecting 90% of european businesses to major us markets. it's an unparalleled next day connectivity that nobody in the marketplace matches. as you can see, we continue to enhance value for our customers, while restructuring our european business. said simply, the upside in the profitability of our international business is tremendous.
finally, our third strategic focus area, digital innovation. we are reimagining our digital capabilities and infrastructure in a manner that will deliver market-leading customer experiences that are simple, personal and proactive. we made great strides in fiscal 2021 as we continue to drive new value through strategic technologies, including increasing capabilities and products through sensor based technologies like fedex sensor where id and fedex surround which provide unmatched visibility and predictive capabilities, most notably seen during the transportation of lifesaving covid-19 vaccines. building of sharp runner integration and adobe magento extensive to enable a more open e-commerce ecosystem. and furthering development of our portfolio of services in the autonomous vehicle space as illustrated with ongoing roxo testing in this month's announcement of testing with nuro.
in fiscal 2022, we will continue to deliver on our strategy on e-commerce, operational excellence and digital innovation as we execute on the following key initiatives. first, we expect to substantially increase capacity for this peak by investing in fedex ground's infrastructure with the addition of 16 new automated facilities and the implementation of nearly 100 expansion projects at existing operations and key technological enhancements. second, we will completed the air network integration in early calendar year 2022 which will bring the physical tnt network integration to a close and provides the inflection point for long-term profit improvement in europe. next, we are exercising existing options to purchase 20 additional 767fs, 10 for delivery in fiscal year '24 and 10 for delivery in fiscal year '25, as we continue to modernize our fleet and improve service to our customers. and we finally continue to identify areas to adapt, collaborate and utilize different elements of our global network to increase efficiency and reduce cost to serve. our networks and capabiliites reflect decades of investment, innovation and expertise that are differentiated from our competition. it's incredibly difficult to replicate and provides a significant advantage over others in our industry.
when we knit it all back together, despite some of the cyclical factors, we remain very confident for fiscal year '22 and beyond. the e-commerce market will continue to be a growth engine globally and if anything has become clear over the past year, it's the contribution of our industry provides to the e-commerce value chain. we remain focused on differentiation, building customer solutions and improving revenue quality as critical long-term levers of profitable growth. in addition, the transformation efforts in europe and us domestic will generate margin improvement opportunities. and finally, we're just getting started on unlocking value with digital innovation. our robust growth strategy positions fedex to deliver superior sustainable financial returns and drive shareholder value for years to come.
with that i will turn it over to brie.
brie carere -- executive vice president, chief marketing and communications officer
thank you, raj. good afternoon, everyone. in a year of extraordinary challenges and change for our business, i continue to be immensely proud of the team's ability to execute our commercial strategy, while developing solutions to help our customers grow their businesses. before i move into fiscal year '22, i wanted to reflect on our truly exceptional results of '21. fiscal year '21 parcel volume was very strong across our portfolio of e-commerce solutions. average daily volume grew across all our customer segments with us small and medium leading the way at 32% year-over-year growth. e-commerce also drove 28% year-over-year growth in our returns business through april, as more consumers shopped online, enrolled fedex delivery manager users grew by 43% year-over-year. with this backdrop in the momentum from fiscal '21, our fiscal '22 outlook calls for robust growth. enterprise growth in fiscal year '22 will be primarily driven by us domestic e-commerce growth followed by strength in b2b and international and a focus on revenue quality.
in the united states the flourishing us domestic parcel market will continue to provide opportunity in the coming years. the us domestic parcel market is expected to surpass 107 million packages a day in calendar year '22, with e-commerce contributing 88% of the total us market growth. excluding amazon volume, the us domestic parcel market is expected to be 72 million packages a day in calendar year '22. as we look beyond calendar year '22, we forecast that the us domestic parcel market will reach 172 million packages a day in calendar year 2026.
in fiscal year '21 fedex total us domestic residential package volume mix was 67% versus 62% a year ago. as we look beyond this fiscal year, we expect residential volume -- volumes to grow significantly faster than commercial volumes. however, with retail inventories relative to sales at historic lows, we expect solid b2b volume growth this fiscal year. in fiscal year '22 we will continue to execute against our revenue quality strategy. in fiscal year '21 q4, we increased fedex ground economy yield by 28% and overall us domestic residential yields by 16% year-over-year. it is important to note, when reviewing composite us domestic yields that weights and zone will decrease, putting pressure on yields as we grow in e-commerce. we are managing total network profitability. short zone e-commerce and our fedex ground economies service will enable us to sweat our assets and maximize sortation capacity.
within our pricing strategy, we continue to prioritize capacity for commercial and small and medium customer segments. to support the network of ongoing capacity constraints, we have increased our peak surcharges as of june 21 and we'll monitor and adjust our strategy as capacity and demand warrants. we will continue to confidently renegotiate our large customer segment contracts to increase profitability. this means balancing product, day of week and lane mix at the customer level, while ensuring appropriate surcharges and rate increases cover rising labor costs. most large customer contracts in the us are three years. almost half of our total large segment volume had pricing agreement implementations in the past 12 months, leaving upside for fiscal year '22.
now turning to international. global trade volume has surpassed pre-pandemic levels and is on course for its fastest year of growth in over a decade. global air cargo capacity remained down 10% year-over-year as of april, mainly due to the reduction in passenger capacity. we expect air cargo capacity to remain constrained through at least the first half of calendar year '22. recovery will be slow, potentially episodic and a full recovery is not anticipated until 2024. we believe a favorable pricing internationally should continue through fiscal year 2022. we will continue to manage demand internationally even yield management and continuation of peak surcharges especially on transpacific and transatlantic lanes. we are seeing a very good capture rate on these surcharges.
while peak surcharges played a significant role in our international performance in fiscal year '21, it was not the majority of our revenue growth. in fiscal '21, we improved parcel and priority mix versus freight economy, grew our small and medium customer base while penetrating e-commerce. in fact we grew e-commerce parcel volume by more than $1 billion year-over-year out of asia and europe. to a large extent due to its lightweight nature and limited relative linehaul capacity requirements, we were able to price e-commerce very competitively. i believe that e-commerce volume as a result is quite sticky. that being said, we continue to refine our commercial and network strategies to be prepared for when commercial capacity does come back.
overall demand for exports from asia have recovered to pre-covid levels. in fiscal year '22, our network plans include six intercontinental daily frequencies from asia to provide more consistent, predictable capacity based on our demand forecast. this will eliminate some of the adhoc nature of our flights in fiscal year '21. enter european b2b volumes have recovered to pre-covid levels, while our growth has further accelerated by significant b2c volumes on our intercontinental lanes, with reduced pandemic related uncertainty and industrial activity on the rise, we expect the overall european economy to be back to pre-pandemic levels in late calendar year '21.
raj covered our new european value proposition. customers are very interested in both our new europe to us overnight service and e-commerce product expansion. on the europe to us lane, we have strong demand with a healthy mix of small and large businesses. we have deployed incremental capacity to serve this high yielding segment. our e-commerce value proposition anchored by our new fedex international connect plus product is very compelling. we continue to gain new customers and have a very robust sales pipeline. in summary, we had a stellar fiscal year '21 and the strategies we have in place will help us to win what's next in '22 and well beyond.
with that, i'll turn it over to mike for his remarks.
mike lenz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thank you, brie, and good afternoon everyone. our fourth quarter and fiscal 2021 results reflect the tremendous momentum in our business and reinforce our growth strategy and investments across our network to grow our capabilities, improve collaboration and drive efficiency. our full year results include over $1 billion in variable incentive compensation expense as we reward our team members for their invaluable contributions.
in the fourth quarter, fedex continued to drive higher profitability with increased margins across the board. consolidated revenue grew 30% year-over-year in the quarter, while adjusted operating income was up 117%, even with higher cost to support increased demand, increased variable compensation expense of $380 million and our previously announced $100 million contribution to yale university to support our carbon neutrality goals.
drilling down into those numbers, the rise in us parcel volume was the greatest driver of our revenue growth and through the incredibly hard work and ingenuity of our team members we took a significant portion of that revenue growth to the bottom line. ground revenue grew 27% in the fourth quarter with operating margin increasing 310 basis points to 13.6%. ground substantially improved margins and earned the most operating profit in their history. as our international business and e-commerce in the us continued to grow express revenue grew 32% over q4 last year, with adjusted operating margin up 340 basis points. freight grew out this quarter with 38% revenue growth and their highest quarterly operating margin ever at 16.1%. they also topped $1 billion in operating income for the full year for the first time. with our overall profit growth, we generated a record $4.6 billion in adjusted free cash flow while balancing continued investment in the business, funding our pension plans by $300 million and strengthening our balance sheet.
during the fourth quarter, we executed a debt refinancing and extinguishment transaction underscoring our focus on reducing our financial leverage. in the fourth quarter, we reduced our outstanding debt by $2.6 billion or 11% of the total outstanding liability, eliminating all debt maturities through fy '25 and one in fy '27. this transaction resulted in $393 million charge in q4, however, it will lower our interest cost over the next three years with a positive payback on the transaction.
in fy '22, we will continue to drive a robust growth strategy capitalizing on global economic recovery and e-commerce. this focus will flex all levers of our business, including volume growth, yield management, operational efficiency and network optimization. the fy '22 adjusted eps range we provided corresponds 13% to 18% year-over-year growth on top of record fy '21 earnings. i'd make the following highlights behind that. we expect margins in all our transportation segments on an adjusted basis to exceed fy '21 levels driven by several key areas. we expect e-commerce to continue to drive higher profitability and we will continue to invest in our fedex ground network to improve efficiency and utilization through expanded in new facilities as well as technology enhancements.
we also look forward to incremental benefit from the completion of our physical integration of tnt, which will enable us to offer more and better services to our customers internationally. this key milestone will continue to drive momentum and provide a launch point for even better profitability down the road. integration expenses will be lower fy '22 than in fy '21 and total integration spending is expected to be $1.8 billion, slightly higher than our previous estimate due to additional opportunities identified to further optimize legal entity structures and improve back office automation.
we expect continued improvement at fedex freight through our ongoing revenue quality and profitable growth strategies. our outlook includes substantial funding of our incentive compensation program for our team members. that said variable compensation expense is not expected to be a headwind for fiscal '22. while we have clear growth opportunities, the widespread labor shortages impacting many companies and industries across the us is also impacting us through higher wage rates and lower productivity, particularly in the first quarter and this is reflected in our overall outlook for the year.
earlier raj talked about our innovate digitally initiative. the spending related to these important projects is included in our outlook and will largely be recorded in the corporate eliminations and other section of our p&l. further, we estimate a higher effective tax rate for fiscal '22 of approximately 24% prior to the mark-to-market retirement plan accounting adjustments.
finally, address -- i will address our capital allocation, starting with capital expenditures, which is expected to be $7.2 billion in fy '22. this projects to 8% or less of revenue which is the target level for the capex to revenue component of our fy '22 to '24 long-term incentive plan and remains below our historical capital intensity. approximately half of our expected capital spending this year will be for growth, but the remainder for important projects like replacement of our aging fedex express aircraft, which not only is expected to have a high financial return but is an important part of our strategy to reduce our carbon footprint. we will also continue to invest in the modernization of our key express hubs and upgrades to other facilities in all our transfer net -- patient networks to drive efficiency. we will increase replacement of vehicles across the enterprise, which we largely deferred in fy '21. we will add safer, more energy efficient equipment, all of these projects will yield benefits in the near term and long term.
we ended fiscal 2021 with $7.1 billion in cash and as such our leadership team is laser-focused on enhanced capital allocation opportunities, including our 15% dividend increase for fiscal '22, which raised the dividend to $3.00 per share as we announced on june 14. next, our plan to restart our stock buyback program during the first quarter, which we can do without having to increase leverage and our focus primarily to offset dilutive effects of our equity compensation program. and our plan to voluntarily contribute $500 million in fy '22 to our pension plan, which was funded at 95% on may 31.
in closing, we are adding shareholder value by driving profitable revenue growth, expanding margins, generating strong free cash flow, focusing capital spending into the greatest areas return, strengthening our balance sheet and improving cash return to shareholders. based on record fourth quarter results we just covered and the future ready strategies we have in place, i can say with confidence that we fully expect fedex to continue delivering sustainable and superior financial returns in the future.
next, we will be happy to address your questions.

[operator instructions] and first we'll go to brian ossenbeck from jpmorgan. your line is open.
brian ossenbeck -- jpmorgan -- analyst
hey, good afternoon and thank you for taking the question. mike wanted to see if you could give some color as relates to the ground margins. in the guidance obviously some considerable operating leverage here in terms of incrementals, over here you've talked about the right store at the right package, the right truck, but clearly there is some inflation working its way through the system. so can we think about double-digits on the way to teens or would you guide us to something little bit less than that considering what you are outlining on [indecipherable] seem to be a little bit front end loaded. so maybe if you can address that and also about the surcharges that you might be able to install to offset some of those costs? thank you.
mike lenz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
well, brian, i'll kind of hit the first part and just reiterate a few things we've said and maybe try to tie it together in a different way. but as we said the pandemic accelerated the dramatic and rapid shift in the growth of e-commerce and at the same time, as you noted there, put some pressure in areas along the way as well, which is really why the performance at ground in '21 has been nothing short of stellar. atv increased an astounding 23% driven by e-commerce and we still improve margins. so brie highlighted that us domestic parcel growth will continue to be the primary -- primarily driven by e-commerce and we're very confident in our strategy to profitability execute against that. so we expect margins to improve in '22 and beyond as we continue to increase density, further improve the facility and on-road productivity, enhance the utilization of our assets and i kind of emphasize those aspects as ground is generating exceptional roic margins and so we remain very confident of the future opportunity and we'll continue to innovate and differentiate the capabilities there. and there was something about surcharges did you ask as well, maybe you can clarify that.
brian ossenbeck -- jpmorgan -- analyst
yes. earlier this week we saw, i mean competitor announced some surcharges for peak season that were instituted earlier than last year and they are also a bit higher. so with the inflation you're talking about with the capacity in the system, maybe you can address that as well and what you've assumed in this guidance here?
brie carere -- executive vice president, chief marketing and communications officer
thanks, brian. it's brie speaking from a structural pricing perspective, we believe that peak surcharges are kind of the new normal, and that we have to align our pricing to our costs. i think i've covered that in previous calls that we do anticipate every peak that there will be e-commerce surcharges, as we, right now we already have peak surcharges in market and we continue to evaluate changes that we need to make based on demand and capacity. we implemented some changes on june 11 and we continue to monitor the environment.
operator
and next we'll go to bascome majors from susquehanna. your line is open.
bascome majors -- susquehanna -- analyst
yes, good afternoon and thanks for taking my questions. it's pretty clear that we are in one of the best trade up scenarios we've seen from logistics customers with -- of your higher yielding higher priority products doing exceptionally well in this environment. can you talk a little bit about -- more about how you protect that profitability from both mix and pricing whenever the inevitable partial being reversion to a more stable and sustainable demand and priorities environment comes?
brie carere -- executive vice president, chief marketing and communications officer
sure happy to take the question. i think we have to separate it between the domestic market and the international market. here in the us, you heard me quote some just outstanding growth numbers from a parcel perspective. so we think we actually have quite a sustained growth environment where demand will outpace capacity in the domestic market. structurally, as i mentioned, we will continue to use surcharges, not only for peak, but to cover large package and to really just make sure that our pricing quite frankly aligns to our costs. we think we have the very best value proposition in the market. we have the best we can in coverage. and so as a result, we think the demand that we are planning for it will be there for quite some time here domestically.
on the international side, it is a little bit of a different story and far more complex. we do believe as i mentioned that commercial capacity will come back episodically it will not be a straight line up and we actually have -- we believe until 2024, the longer it takes for commercial capacity to come back quite frankly the longer we have to make sure that this customer base is sticky. i pointed out in my opening remarks that we had a $1 billion growth in e-commerce. we priced this e-commerce volume at future price. it is going to be very sticky. it was very competitively priced. so we don't believe there's any risk there and our small business growth. we've also had internationally. we also believe that volume is very sticky. so as commercial capacity comes back, we'll adjust the network, we will bend the cost curve to offset some of the surcharge risk, but overall we feel quite good about the strategies and we have some time to implement them.
operator
and next we'll go to helane becker from cowen. your line is open.
helane becker -- cowen & company -- analyst
thanks very much, operator. hi, everybody. thank you for the time. i have two questions. my first question is, given the labor shortages that we're seeing and the expectation that it's likely to continue, is it a good time to pivot aggressively into more use of more robotics and accelerate the implementation of automation and so on.
mike lenz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
well, helane, this is mike, i'll just highlight that within that capex projection, a good amount of that is to enhance the efficiency of the facilities, which is what exactly aspect you're hitting on. i'll give it to raj to talk more broadly about the broader point you raised.
rajesh subramaniam -- president and chief operating officer
well, i think the point that i want to make here is that the labor environment remains challenged right now and we are doing everything we can possibly do whether it is from wages from technology from routing and all things associated with it to make sure that we can get our service improved. we expect that over the next two, three months that situation gets better and that we get ready for peak and of course we are considering longer term opportunities that mike talked about in terms of technology as well. thank you.
operator
and next we'll go to ravi shanker from morgan stanley. your line is open.
ravi shanker -- morgan stanley -- analyst
thanks. for me one. can you give us a little bit of color on what the two halves of fiscal '22 look like, first half versus second half given that you probably have a little bit, i would say pandemic conditions continuing through the next couple of quarters, but then some of the comps start getting a little bit harder in the back half of the fiscal year?
mike lenz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes. ravi look we're giving our best middle of the fairway estimate what we think the year looks like as you highlight there is any number of moving parts. so i don't want to try and parse various elements along the way there, but certainly the recognition that the first quarter here with the labor challenges and productivity impacts as well as, keep in mind, we are continuing to still have to make accommodations in the express air network as well for labor requirements in that. so there is a number of related aspects there. so i'll leave it at that in terms of what's in play here.
operator
and next we'll go to david vernon from bernstein. your line is open.
david vernon -- bernstein -- analyst
hey, good afternoon, everyone. so, mike, maybe just a follow-up a little bit on that. is there a way to dimension in terms, or in an overall sort of like cost impacts that both the productivity and the wage impact from the inflation that you're seeing in the marketplace can be difficulty in getting sortation kind of labor into the network. i'm just trying to ask -- anything you can give us that will help us to further kind of dimension how big of a headwind that would be? would be extremely helpful.
frederick w. smith -- chairman of the board and chief executive officer
well, i wish we could break it down into the simple buckets. but when to amplify what raj mentioned earlier when you don't have the people as many people as you would optimally staff the facility with then of course your throughput is lower, and then maybe you're not getting the density within trailers of that you might otherwise expect, so then you're getting incremental costs there in terms of running the network, the linehaul in that. so it is not as simple as saying ok, we're at edge short and that that's impacting us this way and wage rate is y percent of it. it's is a iterative ongoing exercise we have to adapt, adjust and configure around that. so that's how we're managing it.
operator
and next we'll go to david campbell from thompson davis and company. your line is open.
david campbell -- thompson davis and company -- analyst
yes, thanks for taking my question. i was just curious, hey, you know you [indecipherable] ltm division canadian company, few months ago. is that expected to have any impact on your marketing or your shares and market in the ltm business?
mike lenz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
well, david first, this is mike. let me just say our commitment and value of our freight business given the results that i just spoke to is absolute. so i'll let brie address what we think how the market evolves going forward.
brie carere -- executive vice president, chief marketing and communications officer
well honestly, this doesn't impact our freight strategy. we are the market share leader, because we have the best value proposition, we have had just a stellar year with the freight team, they have done a tremendous job managing despite the tumultuous year we have, and while they did that they introduced a new product that is growing rapidly and in addition to growing our share with small customer, we intend to grow our share with the -- across the threshold fedex freight direct product and grow our residential share. so we are tremendously excited about our fedex freight division and we're going to just stay the course.

and next we'll go to scott schneeberger from oppenheimer. your line is open.
scott schneeberger -- oppenheimer -- analyst
thanks very much. on the labor topic and also the first time to freight as well, like you mentioned that it's -- it looks like it's largely affecting first quarter. you mentioned you adjusted the guidance for the first quarter. i'm curious on your confidence of i think much of the country is hopeful that this labor dynamic and at the end of the summer. but just curious how conservative you were, or maybe a little bit more color about how you're considering it, and if you hope you get hold by say end of first quarter. and then the follow-up question but thematically the same is in freight you had some customer suspension and it looks like that's largely alleviated. but could you put a little bit more color on what occurred and your comfort that that's back in a good situation? thank you.
mike lenz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
okay. scott. i'll take a swing at the first part and then i'll give it to lance, our ceo of freight for the second part. i mean, look, it's not unique phenomenon that we're experiencing. it's the, all the aspects we highlighted. it certainly, it obviously impacts the first quarter, the most in the general expectations that everyone has that this will mitigate as we moved into the fall and the markets returned to more normalized conditions. so look, we're at it every day, but there is no unique consideration there beyond just you see a lot of people suggesting that come september-october. maybe that will have a more expanded workforce. lance?
lance d. moll -- president and chief executive officer, fedex freight
thanks, mike. well, since freight hardly ever gets any questions. i want to take this opportunity to add brief comments and recognize our team for an exceptional year. they successfully battled through what has been the most challenging year, i've ever seen in my almost 30 years in this business and i grew up in it. so i want to recognize all of the points they put on the board. now, i'm sure you all have read the multiple articles written over the last several months about the tightening in the trucking industry and it starts with the truckload sector. they are 5 times the size of the ltl divisions and when they get full the spillover comes into ltl. we has the largest ltl carrier, get the majority of it. and so when you have it combined with what the broad actions our competitors have taken to embargo entire sections of the country, without any notice impacting all customers, we decided to take an implemented temporary targeted volume and to minimize the network disruptions and balanced capacity that were at the backlogs across the entire country. so with record growth has come some tough but necessary decisions to protect our employees, reduce our backlogs and staff to our business volume. this continues to be the driving force behind our business decisions.
now, in hindsight, i would not have wanted to make a decision back in the corner like this and we're taking measures to avoid it going forward. i hope that provided the transparency.
operator
and next we'll go to tom wadewitz from ubs. your line is open.
tom wadewitz -- ubs -- analyst
yes, good afternoon. brie you commented -- you provided some comments on pretty optimistic view on tightness in the domestic market. i think the sense that tightness is going to continue. how do we think about the approach to pricing? i mean, i know you've had tremendous momentum in pricing i think was at 14% rise in revenue per piece in ground? how do you think about the pricing dynamic, the next couple of years? would we expect continued kind of stronger than normal pricing gains in express and ground? and is it fair to view that as a pretty important driver of margin expansion that you would expect to continue, as we look at the domestic package businesses?
brie carere -- executive vice president, chief marketing and communications officer
absolutely. as we look at '22 and '23, we absolutely think that you're going to see a greater than our historical average from a year-over-year price increase. as i mentioned this past year, when we look at our domestic volume, we repriced about 45% of our large customer segment, and quite frankly, we actually did most of that in the back half of this year. so we're going to have some lapping. you're going to get benefits of those renegotiations in the back half of this fiscal year. we're going to get them in the front half of '22. in addition, we still have to reprice the rest of the large customer segment. and really importantly as fred mentioned, it's not just about the topline yield, it's about really making sure that our price matches our cost, and we're getting very, very focused on that, very disciplined, making sure that customers that have large package, they have the right surcharges, the right structure there, those that have the highest peaking factor, really pay for the incremental labor at peak. and so it's not just about the top line, which i am -- i want to be clear, i'm optimistic about, but it's really about aligning our price strategy with our cost. and we do think that that is going to have tremendous momentum next year. and quite frankly, the year after, as well.
operator
and next we'll go to chris wetherbee from citi. your line is open.
chris wetherbee -- citigroup -- analyst
many thanks. maybe just to follow up on that point. so you know, with the tightness in the market and it seemed -- maybe you can correct me if i'm wrong, it seems that you and your major competitor are the biggest influences on capacity in the market. and if you can sort of meter that capacity out over the course of the next couple of years, it should set and it should support sort of a relatively robust pricing environment, certainly above cost inflation, as you go out into the outyears. so i guess, what would sort of take away from that potential opportunity, bring those domestic margins back up to maybe where we had seen in a couple of years ago? is there some other impediment that we're thinking about, or i guess really just a dynamic of trying to match capacity with the volume growth that you outlined, that is fairly robust, maintaining this very, very good pricing environment in the foreseeable future?
brie carere -- executive vice president, chief marketing and communications officer
go ahead.
frederick w. smith -- chairman of the board and chief executive officer
yeah, chris. let me just highlight one aspect, when we talk about capacity too. the capex growth at ground is focused on smaller units than kind of going back to historical legacy large hubs. we have one opening, but it's in -- it's targeted to efficiently and effectively execute on a lot of this growing shorter zone demand. and so that's why, when we talk about having the right targeted investments to align the costs with where demand is going, that's how we're thinking about it. and then of course, it has to be matched on the pricing side, which as brie has covered, i think pretty comprehensively. so again, it's an integrated planning process and assessment here. look the finance team is part of the discussions and assessments that go on in that as well. so it's very integrated with operations, finance, sales, pricing and marketing. so the team really has a collective focus.
operator
and next, we'll go to jack atkins from stephens. your line is open.
jack atkins -- stephens -- analyst
okay, great. thank you. maybe a longer-term question for either raj or mike. but in the past, we found a very high correlation between return on invested capital and the stock's valuation multiple within the transportation sector. and at analyst day earlier this month, ups laid out a plan to get its return on invested capital, up to 26%, 29% versus about 20% today. your ltm return on invested capital is between 7% and 8%. so mike, what do you think is a realistic target for roic for fedex, when you look out over the next three years?
frederick w. smith -- chairman of the board and chief executive officer
jack, i'm not going to go put out any sort of targets or guidance beyond what we've gone with today. but i will reiterate that the investments that we're making, we're highly confident will generate a high return on invested capital. and i alluded to the fact that we continue to expect to see margins grow in all the business segments. so that's what we have to do, to continue to get that to where we want to keep seeing -- the trajectory. so i think that's where we'll leave that one.
operator
and next we'll go to amit mehrotra from deutsche bank. your line is open.
amit mehrotra -- deutsche bank -- analyst
hi guys. sorry about that. that goes on mute. thanks for taking my question. brie, i just want to see if you could talk about the recontracting process for enterprise customers? i know you mentioned they come up every three years. does the company have an ability to kind of change pricing intra-period, with 60 or 90 days notice, or is this just really the end of the contract period? and then separately, henry, can you just share -- i don't know, sorry if i missed it, but just the b2b and b2c mix, where b2b is today, relative to where it was pre-covid. just to give us some runway on some of the density benefits you'll get, as b2b continues to recover. thank you.
brie carere -- executive vice president, chief marketing and communications officer
hi amit. it's brie. so from a an enterprise contract perspective, each contract is very nuanced. we have opened some contracts out of cycle, when the customer has looked for increased demand. and so of course when they want to do something different than what has kind of been our historical average with them of course, we are going to have those conversations. i think it's really important, yes. we want to grow our price, yes. we want to grow our yield. but we also want to have really happy, satisfied customers. and so we're trying to strike that right balance. and so some customers, yes they do require changes in their portfolio, a change in mix to meet their business needs, because many of them saw explosive growth, especially in our retail segment, and of course and our healthcare. so of course as required, we do -- we open accounts, and have those conversations every thursday morning. as mike mentioned, mike, and joe and i get together, and we review what's necessary to run the business. so i'm very pleased that the team has been incredibly agile.
i think the second half of the question was about b2b and b2c. so i think the answer from a domestic perspective is, we are going to continue to make express more express. we're going to lean into commercial. we're going to lean into premium. and healthcare, we're very optimistic about our last mile optimization strategy, which will allow us to continue to put some residential business into the ground network. when we, and i guess -- the other thing that i can share is that if you look in may of this past year, it was our highest absolute commercial volume in the domestic network since september '19. so we're very confident about the return of our commercial business here in the united states.
however, as i mentioned, 90% of the market growth will be e-commerce, and so there will be no settling of the b2c volume within the ground network. we're going to continue to drive that growth. we're going to lean into it, grow yield, and as mike has mentioned, our goal is to grow the margin while we do that. so very-very -- quite frankly, excited to lean into the e-commerce growth for fedex ground.
mike lenz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
this is mike. i should add one thing, for those of you that are asking about the sequencing or trajectory through the year. just as a reminder, i mentioned that we accrued $380 million of variable compensation expense in q4. and so if you add up the prior qs in that, that gets you to $1 billion or so for the year. so q1, we were not accruing as much last year, understandably amid the uncertainty. so just kind of keep that in mind, as you think about modeling through.
operator
and next, we'll go to ken hoexter from bank of america. your line is open.
ken hoexter -- bank of america -- analyst
hey, great. good afternoon. so in the outlook, you talked a lot about ground, but what about express. so if we normalize for the $100 million donation to rebound of fedex europe with the tnt integration, the aircraft efficiency, what's the timeframe to get back to double-digit at express? maybe detail the progress at tnt as well? and then just an update within that -- the blending of express into the ground network, both on the package and facility side?
frederick w. smith -- chairman of the board and chief executive officer
well there has been a number of milestones on the tnt. we had the road network. we completed that milestone, and that helped facilitate the enhanced commercial proposition that was highlighted. and again the air network is another key enhancement and that comes for the end of this fiscal year. so there is value coming this year. more to come and as we highlighted, with the business realignment, that hit full stride into '24. so it's a multiple year of significant opportunity increases there.
rajesh subramaniam -- president and chief operating officer
yeah ken, let me just add that, we are very excited about where we sit with tnt. the combination of the physical integration this year, this fiscal year and next calendar year is an inflection point like i talked about. and at the same time, we are also improving -- continue to improve our value proposition. the one i just talked to you about overnight service from several markets in europe to u.s. is unmatched. so we continue to make great progress and we really think that we should see greater margin expansion, beginning in fiscal '22 and building into fy '23.
operator
and next we'll go to allison landry from credit suisse. your line is open.
allison landry -- credit suisse -- analyst
thanks, good afternoon. so raj, you talked about lower cost per stop at ground. so it's only to parse out how much of that was driven by the increased b2b mix versus increased density and e-comm residential volume related to last mile optimization, and improved asset utilization from the seven day operations. and then if you could just maybe address, how we might be able to engage the improvement in cost per stop in fiscal '22? thank you.
rajesh subramaniam -- president and chief operating officer
allison, i'm going to have john answer that question.
john a. smith -- president and chief executive officer fedex ground
allison, thanks for the question. if you go back when we talk about the lmo, fy '20 we only delivered 1.2 million packages of lmo. through fiscal year '21, we delivered 21.6 million packages of lmo, and that's one factor that's improving our optimization. the next if you remember, we integrated smartpost, which is now our economy product and plus the surging residential growth since the pandemic, and all these factors has helped us improve our residential density.
now one of the things to remember, we're seeing package matching, where we have commercial, residential economy or lmo packages, where they are destined to the same address or nearby address for another ground package and we fully expect this to continue to increase. and we're also confident that our weekend residential delivery coverage, which as already mentioned, reaching 98% of the u.s. population on saturdays and 95% on sundays, truly gives us a distinct competitive advantage.
operator
and next, we'll go to allison poliniak from wells fargo. your line is open.
allison poliniak -- wells fargo -- analyst
hi, good evening. one of the issue that we have had at the manufacturing side, is really the supply chain constraints and sort of the impact that maybe those increased volumes have had. is it something that has been, i guess one noticeable to you, and is it starting to beat or is it still sort of a level of volume that you would continue to expect, particularly on the express side, as we move through the rest of the balance of the year here?
rajesh subramaniam -- president and chief operating officer
the supply chain constraints are of course real. the other thing to keep in mind here is the inventory to sales ratio, it's at an all-time low. and so we do fully expect that as the -- especially as the supply chain starts to get organized here and the -- we still have opportunity to grow, because -- especially in the express side of the business, as the inventory sales ratio still remains very, very low and that drives a lot of express traffic. i hope that answers the questions, if not, just ask again what was not clear.
allison poliniak -- wells fargo -- analyst
so the express part of it. like, is it starting to normalize somewhat, where you're seeing that sort of fall off here, and obviously the inventory to sales ratio might not be as sort of next day just in time, based on some of the issues we've had over the past few months? just sort of -- if that was noticeable and sort of the volumes that you were seeing at this point?
rajesh subramaniam -- president and chief operating officer
don, you want to take that?
donald f. colleran -- president and chief executive officer fedex express
sure. the intensity of the demand has not abated and it's driven by the factors that you and raj both mentioned. one, on the inventory side, not only is it finished product, but its raw materials, i.e. chips and other things that are going in, into finished products. so it remains at historically low levels. the demand also hasn't abated and so the demand cycle that we're seeing both domestically and internationally continues to be extremely strong, and then the combination of supply being light, both in the air -- in the ocean, that has trickle down and trickle-up effect, certainly factors that have us remaining optimistic, that there is no short-term change in what we're seeing. as a matter of fact, i'm seeing an intensification of that in our international business.
operator
and our next question comes from bruce chan from stifel. your line is open.
bruce chan -- stifel -- analyst
great, thank you operator, and good evening team. it's nice to be back in the mix here. brie i want to go back to the pricing discussion for a moment, but maybe more specific to europe. it seems like a meaningful commercial opportunity for you over there, but some of your competitors are also looking at expanding in that region as well. so my question is, are you seeing any signs of a land grab or any competitive pricing pressure develop on that front? or are you seeing the same sort of structural differentials between demand and capacity, as you're seeing here in the u.s.?
brie carere -- executive vice president, chief marketing and communications officer
great question. and no, from a european perspective, we're kind of the underdog. we actually see and i've had tremendous momentum, as i mentioned the $1 billion growth from an e-commerce perspective between europe and asia, and that's intercontinental. so when we look at the europe business, raj mentioned, number one, we now have -- we already had, but we even strengthened it further, we have the best coverage across europe into the united states from a commercial perspective and the sales team is really excited about that value proposition. so we have upside potential on both the b2b and b2c market share into the united states from europe.
from an intra-europe perspective, we are predominantly focused on b2b. we're just getting going on b2c, but we see upward potential there, and we actually also are seeing improving yields in the inter-european theater [phonetic]. so from an intra-europe perspective, we're feeling optimistic. and then from an asia to europe, that's our third focus area for the european team. we have historically been under shared in that lane. we have seen a tremendous relationship between our asia and our european team. actually our asia team has taken share from dhl over the last four quarters. so we're pretty pleased with them. we see a great pricing environment, and we see some really strong momentum.
rajesh subramaniam -- president and chief operating officer
and bruce, if i can just add, in some ways the european markets are the late boomers of post covid-19. but we now expect them to be back to pre-pandemic levels this calendar year versus what we thought will come in next one. so there is going to be the demand, especially b2b coming back sooner and again, i think we are in a very good position for that.
operator
and next, we have duane pfennigwerth from evercore isi. your line is open.
duane pfennigwerth -- evercore isi -- analyst
hey thanks. thanks for squeezing me in here. on the ground facility investments, as you tilt to smaller facilities, which you talked about being driven by ship from store, where the demand is headed. can you talk about utilization of your existing assets? what does churn look like in those, and how often do you exit a facility, and is there any geographic focus to your ground investments?
john a. smith -- president and chief executive officer fedex ground
thanks duane, it's john. first of all, we've already talked about this, but let me remention the brick and mortar that we're adding. we are adding a very large hub in chino, california, and we'll end up with 16 regional sortation facilities this year, as well as four new automated stations. already been mentioned, that we're expanding over 100 of our existing facilities. but that's not just how we're attacking our capacity. we're also expanding our operational solutions that maximize how and when we're using these existing buildings. for instance like, when we run multiple preloads in an existing building. also technology is a huge play for us here, and it's going to provide solutions that are critical to enable these solutions to work. and in addition, we're refining tools that use real-time data, to help us streamline multiple aspects of our operation, all the way from staffing through package routing to trailer, as well as mode optimization.
and we're also collaborating with our customers on solutions that will leverage the full flexibility of our seven day operations, and benefit from our expanded regional and local solutions for e-commerce shippers, that will allow them to reach their customers both quickly as well as cost effectively.
rajesh subramaniam -- president and chief operating officer
and duane, if i can answer the strategic point here, i have long talks about how we work strategically with some of the retail customers as they see their online growth. and again, that's exactly what we're doing in this, when you see stories of retailers showing tremendous online growth, you can bet, there is a fedex story right behind that.
operator
and our next question comes from jordan alliger with goldman sachs. your line is open.
jordan alliger -- goldman sachs -- analyst
yeah, hi. given the investments you're making in ground and the automation facilities and preparing for a strong peak. is there -- can you give some sense against obviously what's difficult year-over-year comparisons? what sort of big picture volume outlook might be looking at, in terms of growth perspective? is it a mid single-digit type of number or better? just curious. thanks.
brie carere -- executive vice president, chief marketing and communications officer
well, we're expecting a pretty robust peak. i think last year, we called it the shipathon. i think we're looking forward to another shipathon quite frankly. so, especially in the ground network, we are absolutely expecting a robust peak and volume growth. i think fred mentioned in his opening remarks, the goal is over $90 billion for the year, and i'm looking across the table at jill, my commercial partner, and we're pretty confident in that number.
operator
and i'll turn it back to you for closing remarks.
frederick w. smith -- chairman of the board and chief executive officer
thank you very much for participating on this analyst call. as i said, i'd like to take a moment to personally thank henry maier, for his dedicated service to this organization. henry's various roles were pivotal at key points, from the time we bought rps, until today. i think even henry and i would be amazed, looking back in time, if we thought fedex ground was going to be the enormous entity it is today. with substantial growth prospects and an awful lot of that, henry, it is due to your leadership and insights, you're a remarkable professional in an area, which is very arcane and very poorly understood, and in many, many quarters because of the topology of networks and how they actually operate and had a lot of fun, just on a personal basis with our repartee and i'm going to continue that with you, as we talked about the other day. so, all of us wish you and diane great success and retirement, and on behalf of all of us, well done, and we are deeply grateful to you.
so let me end with one administrative announcement in reviewing the format of these calls. we made the decision going forward, raj, mike and brie will handle these quarterly calls. i'll be available on the mid-year december call and year-end call next june to answer any questions. the rest of our smc, we're going to give this time back to them in order to run the railroad, because the size and scope of this operation needs every minute that they can devote to their day job, rather than to these reports, which will be very adequately handled, as we just -- demonstrated by raj and and brie and mike. so, back to you, mickey.

raj subramaniam -- president, chief operating officer and director
thank you, mickey and good afternoon, everybody and thank you for joining today's call. first and foremost, i would like to extend my sincerest thanks to our global team members who continue to deliver for our customers in an exceptionally challenging operating environment. we are extremely proud and grateful for the manner in which team fedex continues to move the world forward. the execution of our strategies continues to drive high demand for our differentiated services despite the disruptive impact of the pandemic, the labor availability, industry capacity and global supply chains.
as you look at our first quarter results, our performance was highlighted by double-digit increases in yield across all our transportation businesses driven by limited capacity, high demand and the revenue management strategy. the impact of constrained labor markets remains the biggest issue facing our business as with many other companies around the world and was the key driver of our lower than expected results in the first quarter. as mike will share in more detail momentarily, we estimate that the impact of labor shortages on our quarterly results was approximately $450 million, primarily at fedex ground. labor shortages i just had two distinct impacts on our business. the competition for talent particularly for our frontline workers have driven wage rates higher and pay premiums higher. while wage rates are higher, the more significant impact is the widespread inefficiencies in our operation from constrained labor markets.
to illustrate this, i'd like to share a brief example from fedex ground. our portland oregon hub is running with approximately 65% of the staffing needed to handle its normal volume. this staffing shortage has a pronounced impact on the operations, which results in our teams diverting 25% of the volume that would normally flow through this hub because it simply cannot be processed efficiently to meet our service standards. and in this case the volume that diverted must be rerouted and process, which drives inefficiencies in our operations and in turn higher costs. these inefficiencies included adding incremental linehaul and delivery routes, meaning more miles driven and higher use of third-party transportation to enable us to bypass portland entirely. now that's merely one example.
across the fedex ground network there are more than 600,000 packages a day being rerouted. we anticipate the cost pressures from network inefficiencies such as the one i just illustrated to persist through peak, as we navigate the labor market and impacts of new covid waves. overcoming these staffing and retention challenges is our utmost priority as they not only affect our cost structures and operational efficiency, but also having a negative impact on service levels. as such, we are taking bold action across the enterprise to hire and invest in our frontline team members as we prepare for the peak season ahead. these actions include targeted paid premiums particularly for weekend shifts, increased tuition reimbursement, sponsorship of a national hiring day on september 23 as we seek to higher 90,000 additional positions ahead of peak, detailed volume and demand planning with customers to drive additional sorts to alleviate congestion and expanding network capacity, which i will touch on shortly.
based on these actions combined with our expectations for improving labor conditions, we do anticipate gradual improvement in our operational efficiency as we turn into the new calendar year. during the first quarter, the team continued to execute on our strategy, even amid the challenging operating environment. as e-commerce drives higher demand, we continue to strategically invest in our network to boost daily package volume capacity, increase efficiencies and further enhance the speed and service capabilities of our networks.
our investments continued in q1 as fedex ground expanded its physical footprint with a new state-of-the-art hub in chino, california, which began operations in august. this fully automated hub includes large package sortation has the capability to process up to 30,000 packages per hour and strategically located to help address ongoing port congestion challenges. fedex ground also continue to see year-over-year improvement in last mile efficiency driven by 2.4% increase of packages delivered per hour compared to q1 last year, thanks to route optimization technology.
as we move into q2, we are meticulously planning for peak season ahead, including close collaboration with customers to build solutions to enable them to succeed. we expect to have substantially higher ground capacity this peak season due to our investments in fedex ground's infrastructure. this includes the addition of more than a dozen new automated facilities and several other sortation equipment expansions in addition to the chino hub that i already mentioned. several key technology projects are also slated for completion this fall including the modernization of multiple sortation, transportation management and safety systems, which will help to increase ground's network capacity by hundreds of thousands of adv as well as its flexibility and resiliency. this brings the total capacity increase of more than 1 million average daily volume compared to last peak.
another significant opportunity in our growth strategy is the improvement in the profitability of our international express operations. we reached a significant agreement with the social partners at our liege express operations regarding the intended european air network transformation. this is an important milestone in the completion of the air network integration, which remains on track for completion in spring 2022. that will bring the physical network integration of tnt into fedex to a close and when combined with the benefits of our previously announced european restructuring, provides significant upside in our international profitability moving forward.
in summary, we're taking bold actions in the short term to navigate through this highly uncertain environment. we remain committed to long-term shareholder return and we are very confident in our strategy for the following reasons. we have a differentiated portfolio of services to attack the fast growing e-commerce market. our business model gives us the framework to be very successful in this regard.
in fact, we are working strategically with several retailers to deliver a win win win solution, win for the retailer, win for the end consumer and win for fedex. for instance, we recently partnered with a large retailer to create a common data platform that drives optimization of our combined assets and enhancement of visibility and predictability to the end customer. further as a day definite residential volumes grow in our network, thus increasing opportunity to collaborate across our operating companies to improve efficiency by better utilizing our assets.
another upside for fedex is international, as the completion of our physical integration in europe provides an inflection point for profitable growth. and finally, we are in the early stages of unlocking value from digital innovation, we are confident that this will play a significant part in success of fedex for years to come as we make supply chains work smarter for everyone. our strategy is sound and positions us well for improved returns as we move through fiscal year '22 and beyond.
with that, let me turn it over to brie.
brie carere -- executive vice president, chief marketing and communications officer
thank you, raj and good afternoon, everyone. our first quarter commercial results were very strong with 14% revenue growth and double-digit yield improvement in our transportation segments. these results reflect the positive backdrop for growth in the parcel market, including a very healthy pricing environment. for fiscal year '22, fedex revenue was forecasted to past $90 billion. further, we are forecasting that the us parcel market will grow to 101 million packages a day by calendar year 2022, which is year-over-year growth of 12%.
these market projections are slightly lower than last quarter as e-commerce percentage as a percentage of retail declined, with our shift to in-store shopping and buy online pickup and store and spending and services of course increased. however, despite this moderate change in e-commerce growth, the secular trend of e-commerce growing as a percentage of retail will continue to drive healthy parcel market growth. we are forecasting a 10% annual growth rate of us domestic market volume through 2026.
fedex in the first quarter, total us domestic package volumes increased year-over-year by 1.5%. at express, our total us domestic package volume grew 7% year-over-year. total fedex ground volumes were relatively flat in the quarter, however, i'm very proud as we proactively managed our capacity for higher yielding commercial and home delivery services. in fact, fedex ground commercial volumes grew double digits in the quarter. in the first quarter of fiscal year '22 fedex total us domestic residential package volume mix was 57% versus 62% a year ago. us b2b mix improved year-over-year in the first quarter of fiscal year '22 as b2b volumes continue to recover with inventory replenishment and manufacturing rebounding as the economy opens. b2c mix continues to remain higher, however than pre-pandemic level. in q1, fedex freight revenue increased 23% driven both by increased volume and higher revenue quality, a huge shout out for the fedex freight team, great job team. fedex freight direct continues to gain incredible momentum.
turning now to our revenue quality strategy. the continued constrained capacity in both the us domestic and international markets has led to a very favorable pricing environment. we are focused on protecting and growing volume in high yielding commercial segments including commercial ground and small and medium segments. we have an incremental opportunity to improve large customer yields through contract renewals and providing large customers an ability to procure incremental capacity at current market rates. as announced yesterday, effective january 3, 2022, fedex express, fedex ground and fedex home delivery shipping rates will increase by an average of 5.9%. while fedex freight rates will increase by an average of 5.9% to 7.9%. we also announced other surcharge increases which can be found on fedex.com. these increases will help us continue to balance capacity with demand and mitigate the impact on the increased costs that raj just outlined.
turning now to international, we are forecasting air cargo market to be more than $80 billion by calendar year 2025. at fedex, we currently have single-digit market share and as such this remains a significant growth opportunity for us to continue to pursue. we expect air cargo capacity to remain constrained through at least the first half of calendar year 2022, a full recovery is not anticipated until 2024. global air cargo capacity continue to recover in july. it is still down 10% compared to pre-pandemic levels. capacity on international lanes remain scarce and we have seen european and apac export demand recover to pre-pandemic levels. globally, we continue our efforts to optimize our network and customer mix. we managed to a very high percentage of priority service on our international flights. with yield per package improvement of 11% for international parcel and yield per pound improvement of 18% for international freight.
exports from asia are fueled by the strong demand from b2c and b2b recovery. b2b will further benefit from a shift in demand from ocean freight to air cargo as our customers replenish stock levels in time for the peak sales season. to provide access to reliable capacity in this constrained environment, we turned six previously adhoc intercontinental flights and the scheduled service and fiscal year quarter of q1, four trans-pacific and two for the asia-europe lane. we are seeing a strong recovery in europe as well with the overall economic recovery back to pre-pandemic level. our intra-europe cross border b2b volumes have recovered to pre-covid levels. our growth is further accelerated by significant b2c parcel volume. e-commerce growth will be critical for both our asian and european businesses.
in q1 we expanded fedex international connect plus from europe to six new global destination, increasing coverage to 82% of global gdp across a total of 300 lanes. and on september 1, we launched ficp and emea across 80 origin destination lanes. for businesses looking for a cost-effective solution with competitive transit, ficp provides a compelling e-commerce value proposition. we continue to gain new customers through ficp and have a very robust sales pipeline. in summary, while it continues to be a very dynamic market, we remain incredibly confident in our global growth potential and our world-class commercial teams to bring and market leading yields.
and with that, i'll turn it over to mike for his remarks.
mike lenz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thank you, brie and good afternoon, everyone. our first quarter fy '22 adjusted earnings per share of $4.37 was negatively impacted by approximately $800 million in year-over-year headwind. and while raj covered the operational impacts of these challenges, i will detail the financial impacts to the quarter. with these headwinds the difficult labor market have the largest effect on our bottom line, representing an estimated $450 million in additional year-over-year cost, the majority of which impacted our fedex ground business.
as we look into the impact of labor cost from the business, i want to break this impact into two components, higher wages and the impact of network inefficiencies. of the $450 million we estimate that $200 million was incurred in higher wage and purchased transportation rates. this included higher wage rates and pay premiums for team members and higher rates paid for third-party transportation services.
in addition to the higher wage rates, we estimate that network inefficiencies of approximately $250 million contributed to the total impact of labor shortages on the business. these costs include additional linehaul, higher usage of third-party transportation, cost to reposition assets in the network, over time and recruiting incentives all to address staffing shortages. on the labor impacts, our results for the first quarter also included the following headwinds, an additional $135 million in healthcare costs due to lower utilization a year ago, $85 million related to investments in the ground network, which represents the cost of bringing online 16 new automated facilities and expansions at 100 facilities, which are critical to improving service and adding capacity to meet growth for peak and beyond.
and at express, we estimated $60 million in incremental air network costs due to the impact of covid restrictions on our operations, including limitations on layover, supplemental crews to ensure service continuity and immigration restrictions. in addition and as a reminder, our prior year results at express included a pre-tax benefit of our first quarter results did come in lower than our own expectations as difficult labor conditions persisted throughout the quarter. as a result of that variable compensation was not an expense headwind in the first quarter.
with that overview of the consolidated results, let's turn to the highlights for the segments. an express results declined due to the higher operating expenses from staffing challenges and covid-related air network impacts i discussed. profitability was also impacted by fewer charter flights compared to the third last spring during the early months of the pandemic. while we've covered the impacts to ground results in detail, i would like to call your attention to an enhancement in our reporting included in the release and the 10-q. as a result of business growth and our unmatched seven-day operating network at ground, we are now providing additional product level disclosures for average daily package volume. beginning with our first quarter we are breaking out adv statistics for fedex ground commercial, home delivery and economy services. turning to freight, we reported a record operating margin of 17.3% for the quarter as our continued focus on revenue quality and profitable growth drove average daily shipments up 12% and revenue per shipment increased to 11% as brie highlighted previously.
now we pivot to capital spending. during the first quarter, we spent $1.6 billion in capital as we continue to invest in our strategies for profitable growth, service excellence and modernizing our digital and it platforms. our capital forecast for fiscal '22 remains at $7.2 billion and less than 8% of anticipated revenue includes the following key elements. first, more than 50% increase in capital spending at ground year-over-year for capacity expansion and new facilities to capture opportunities from growing e-commerce business. and second, fleet modernization at express with continued investment in 767 and 777 aircraft, which not only has a high financial return but it is an important part of the strategy to reduce our carbon footprint. in evaluating capital investments our return on invested capital on existing capital on new projects is a critical metric to managing our business and we have a rigorous approval process in place on all new capital projects.
as we look at investments, we set the internal rate of return hurdle above our weighted average cost of capital, which varies based on the nature of the project. for example, an investment in replacement capital will have a lower hurdle rate than growth capital. capital returns has always been an important metric to managing the business both historically and in the future. we ended our quarter with $7 billion in cash and are targeting over $3 billion in an adjusted free cash flow for fy '22, which puts us on pace to deliver over $7.5 billion in adjusted free cash flow for fy '21 and '22 combined, far exceeding our historical levels. we continue to focus on thoughtful capital allocation and strengthening our balance sheet in fiscal 2022. during the quarter, we repurchased 1.9 million shares totaling roughly $550 million and are targeting approximately 1 million additional shares for the balance of the year. in addition, we plan to make a $500 million voluntary contribution to our pension plan this year. we are lowering our fiscal 2022 guidance to reflect our first quarter results, which were lower than our expectations.
as we look to the rest of the fiscal year, we expect certain factors to extend longer than we originally forecast in june. so for fiscal '22, we are now forecasting earnings per share of $18.25 to $19.50 before the mark-to-market retirement plan accounting adjustment and earnings per share of $19.75 to $21 before the mark-to-market adjustments and excluding estimated tnt integration expenses and costs associated with business realignment activities. and our effective tax rate projection is approximately 24% again prior to the mark-to-market retirement plan adjustments.
while our outlook reflects more uncertainty moving forward it represents adjusted year-over-year eps growth ranging from approximately 9% to 15.5% following our record fiscal 2021. as you all know we are navigating an inherently uncertain macro environment and managing several unknowns, the pace, shape and timing of global economic recovery given the dynamics of the pandemic including the spread and response to new and existing covid variants. the uneven nature of global government restrictions, disruptions to global supply chains and to improvement in labor availability, current fuel price expectations and existing tax regulations.
with respect to labor, we are assuming that the combination of these actions that we are taking that raj outlined, combined with a steady increase in labor availability as we turn into calendar '22 will allow us to add team members which will drive improvement in our efficiency, productivity and cost structure. while we are not providing specific second quarter eps guidance, i do want to highlight a few key assumptions within our outlook.
overall for the second quarter, we anticipate a similar level of headwinds in q2 as we experienced in the first quarter as the challenges and impacts to our operations from the labor shortages are expected to persist in the rest of calendar 2021. consistent with the [technical issues] first quarter we also expect headwinds in q2 to be driven by our expansion at ground, higher healthcare expenses, covid-related air network inefficiencies at express and the benefit in the prior year of reduced aviation excise taxes. that said, while these headwinds will persist in the second quarter, we expect strong performance in the second half of fiscal '22. we remain confident in our long-term strategies will allow us to realize the benefits of growth investments in the future.
and next, we'll be happy to address your questions.

[operator instructions] and we'll go first to scott group from wolfe research. your line is open.
scott group -- wolfe research -- analyst
hey, thanks. so guys, it strikes me that everybody in transportation right now has a lot of pricing power and everyone is dealing with tight labor capacity and inflation. but every other transport company is reporting margin improvement and earnings growth. so i guess my question is, why do you think you're seeing a bigger impact than anybody else in transportation, and outside of just adding more capacity and spending more, what sort of meaningful significant changes do you think you need to make or are you contemplating making to start realizing more sustainable improvement in margin earnings returns of that? thank you.
raj subramaniam -- president, chief operating officer and director
let me start by saying that we definitely do not see this as an us versus them situation at all. in fact, the minneapolis fed noted that firms in every sector reported difficulty in attracting labor and that 68% of the fortune 100 and other companies address supply chain and labor disruptions over the past quarter. so the situation is very complex, not just the availability of workers impacted by safety concerns with the covid of course the real issue of child care and properly and if schools and day cares cannot stay open. so our approach to our teams and our people first culture combined with a flexible operating model in ground has positioned us to remain competitive in this market and we are highly confident that the actions we're taking to address this shortage as well as i outlined in my prepared remarks.
i will -- let me just also add that we are very confident in our strategy. i mean, where the market is growing, we have a differentiated value proposition. we have a network, an operating model that makes it very -- that makes it good for us to succeed. and so we are confident in the long-term strategy here and as mike said, we expect to see in the calendar year -- the new calendar year, the labor availability continue to recover. mike?
mike lenz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah, scott, i would add, i think you can't just characterize all transportation companies in one singular bucket there and assume that everybody has the same considerations in terms of the nature of the business there. we've tried to explain with great specificity how this operationally impacts us and thus the financial ramifications of that. so look, we fully recognize that the first quarter wasn't what we anticipated. we've taken a number of actions to address that. we will continue to identify further actions, but i will fully say if certainly [phonetic] to revisit the pace of plants that we have. the strategies are sound, what we would absolutely need to think about the pace of things given the environment that we're operating in. so i think brie highlighted the characteristics of what growth is and will continue to be in the business, so that remains the underpinning going forward.
operator
and next we'll go to brandon oglenski from barclays. your line is open.
brandon oglenski -- barclays -- analyst
hey, good evening, everyone, and thank you for taking my question. mike, can i just follow up on that, i think the frustrating part from the investor perspective, you guys have definitely seen a pretty substantial growth in the past decade, definitely put the capital behind that margins are actually lower now than they were, prior peak returns to have obviously come down and we do hear lots of the actions how to sustain forward growth. but i guess, you're going to ask the question, just the same way like, what is being done in a bold way to improve returns and profitability across all these networks? and is there a way to look back and say, hey, we're going to invest in the 777 and 767 fleet, express margins aren't showing much traction. how do we review those prior plans to ensure that they deliver in the future? thank you.
mike lenz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
so brandon let me -- first, you mentioned about express investment in the aircraft there. if you rewind roughly a year and a half ago, we were in the midst of talking about parking and reducing capacity in number of our md-11 fleet. obviously, the market changed radically here and there was the need for the additional capacity and the opportunity there. so we unparked those. should things change going forward that remains a flex lever and it absolutely is the case than having a higher proportion of the newer, more efficient aircraft, which the 767 and 777 are in the fleet will drive improved economics and margins at express. so again we're ongoing looking at these different network initiatives and so that absolutely remains a long-term winner in terms of the fleet renewal and we will continue with that. what was the second part of your -- you started off with another aspect?
brandon oglenski -- barclays -- analyst
you know mike the first one indicate seems that a lot of your investors that the growth is very evident, especially in the last few years. it's just that margin has not improve, so there's always a plan to improve margins it doesn't seem to accompany. so what are the bold steps that can be taken to improve those outcomes in the future?
mike lenz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
well, let me just step back a little bit. we had record results in '21 and improved margins. our guidance while be it lower than what we shared with you three months ago, if you look at the operating earnings, in fact it's double-digit at the low end. we had some discrete tax items there. so, indeed we are focused on driving improved margins, cash flows and returns and feel that we're projecting another record year on top of a record year. so again, we are absolutely committed to continuing that trajectory.
operator
and we'll go next to chris wetherbee from citi. your line is open.
chris wetherbee -- citigroup -- analyst
hey, thanks for taking the question. i want to ask about costs. mike, you're helpful to kind of run through a number of the items that were impacting the quarter, but if i were to sort of exclude those items and look at sort of the cost inflation on the package business, the express and ground package, it still looks like i'm getting about 9% cost inflation on essentially flat volume. so i was wondering maybe if you could help us understand, ex-some of the items that you've talked about, what's driving the cost inflation at such a high level when we're not seeing the volume growth in those individual segments? i mean, do you expect the that to sort of change and do you think margin to expand in both of those segments for the full year?
mike lenz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
let me take a swing at that first. so, as it relates to the cost inflation and taking that category broadly, let me just clarify what's in our outlook. the network inefficiencies inherently are contributing to that cost increase that you're talking about. we expect those to mitigate and work away. in our outlook that we're giving you here, we're not assuming any change in terms of the current labor market in terms of wage rates in that. so just to give you an illustrative example here, a year ago our package handlers at ground, we are paying an hourly rate that is 16% more than previously and our express major sort locations the hourly rate is north of a 25% increase. though that is the reality of the labor market right now and so that's as brie highlighted we are taking a number of actions to recognize and address that.
maybe if i help talk through as we go through the year here, i think maybe part of what your -- we are also there. so again like i said more efficient operations as we go through the year, the pricing actions that we announced yesterday combined with our ongoing efforts, those largely will impact the second half of the year. raj highlighted a number of the adaptations we're making in our operating plans as well as some of the technology and other initiatives we're bringing on to execute more efficiently. and then just to tie-off some aspects here, we will have some tailwinds in the second half. you may recall, we had the severe weather situation in the third quarter of last year. variable comp will be a tailwind in the second half of the year and then there were two other items, the top line bonus program and then the recognition of our yield contribution. so trying to put all that in context for you there, raj anything you want to...
raj subramaniam -- president, chief operating officer and director
i just want to caveat out by saying that, we expect in the second half that improved margins in all segments of our business.
operator
and next we'll go to ravi shanker from morgan stanley. your line is open.
ravi shanker -- morgan stanley -- analyst
thank you. i just wanted to follow up on a basis that the last comment because, again some of the items that point that the second half being materially better than the yield contribution variable comp, i mean though you don't seem operational because of like almost one time. so i'm just trying to get a sense of how you had this confidence in second half being significantly better than the first half? the reason why i'm asking the question is because you gave some -- at the start of your full year guidance by approximately the magnitude of the first quarter mix, which doesn't necessarily imply that you expect either false headwinds [phonetic]?
raj subramaniam -- president, chief operating officer and director
ravi you broke up some there, but there was a reference to some of these items being non-operational in the second half. i guess maybe i turn it around in other way and say, if we were fully...
ravi shanker -- morgan stanley -- analyst
i'm sorry. if i can try again, if my supplementary [phonetic]. i just want to get a little bit more detail into why you think second half is going to be materially better than the first half because some of the items you quantified, the yield contribution and the variable comp, etc., do seem kind of non-operational almost one-dimension nature kind of -- so again, do you really feel like the top line is going to accelerate, the volume is going to accelerate? and the reason, i'm asking this question is because you basically cut your full year guidance by approximately the magnitude of the first quarter myth, which does not seem to imply that you are expecting the labor cost issues to continue for the rest of the year?
mike lenz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
well, we're not sitting on our hands amid these circumstances. we're taking actions to mitigate it. so i wouldn't characterize it as just singularly looking at q1 and changing as a result of the outcome of that. so we're aggressively managing every aspect there. i guess i might turn it around the other way and say if you looked at our results in q1, absent, the labor availability challenges it would be extraordinary and thus we realize the absolute number of matters and so we're taking actions on a number of fronts to -- that will make the second half exactly as we outline. i'll let brie address your volume question for later as we go through the year.
brie carere -- executive vice president, chief marketing and communications officer
yeah, i guess the only thing that added we're still pretty bullish on the volume growth and our ability to take share both domestically and internationally. the q1 of our fiscal year is the hardest comp year-over-year from a growth perspective. so for sure we had -- to say early, i think there was a comment earlier about, kind of flat volumes, we have to put that in perspective and we have record high volumes within the network right now. as we look toward peak, we're going to see growth on what was a tremendous growth at peak last year. so we're pretty confident in the volume and then again to complement what mike shared as a reminder, a lot of our increase large year that will happen in january.
so it will have it in the back half, which is obviously a big driver of back half performance and then a couple of things. john has had great technology that's coming into market. as we had into peak in the back half is going to help us be more productive and karen reddington and the europe team has some incredible work going on as they finalize the integration of their network and we've got some other work going on there to improve european profitability. so we are pretty confident in the back half of the year.
operator
and next we'll go to ken hoexter from bank of america. your line is open.
ken hoexter -- bank of america -- analyst
all right, thanks. so, raj, i think there was a comment in the release kind of talking about some of the deceleration on some of the e-commerce and with ground volume down 10% year-over-year international, domestic down 13%. is that part of what you're anticipating for labor to improve or maybe just talk about the top line or you were just mentioning still seeing strength and a good network at the peak, but yet these numbers indicate and kind of what we're hearing from the market that we're seeing some of this deceleration as you had in the print? so maybe just talk about the volume side a little more?
raj subramaniam -- president, chief operating officer and director
yes, i'll start and i'll turn it over to brie. no, absolutely, we are actually seeing very strong volume to add toward brie just said, the only reason we have seen a flat volume in the ground segment is because of the economy product, we just broke out for you for the first time. and even from a -- the commercial volume is growing strongly and even our hd volume on a very tough year-over-year comp, we're have we still growing on top of that and international is growing very strong. so the only place where we're not growing, there is restructuring in our international and domestic businesses. but our ip business, our ie or our business, our export business is very, very strong. so, no, the demand for our services continued to be very strong because of the differentiation that we are providing in the marketplace and we continue to gain market share around the world. so brie?
brie carere -- executive vice president, chief marketing and communications officer
yes, i think raj kind of outlined it pretty clearly from a volume perspective as we get beyond. i guess the one thing i should add that maybe it wasn't clear in my opening remarks is that we are constraining demand right now. as mike and raj talked about the labor, we are doing everything we can to strike that right balance of growth with service and i will tell you that as we've done that you can see where we've constrained it, it's the fedex economy product, it's the least profitable products, so it's the right place to constrain growth.
and we have made sure that we are not constraining growth in our highest profitable segments that small and medium and as a commercial and you saw those strong commercial numbers that i referenced earlier. so i would say, number 1, we're confident in the secular growth opportunity for fedex. two, we feel we've been gaining share my last market share report shows that. and then we are having to constraints because of the labor issues, we are doing so in a very disciplined manner.
operator
and next we'll go to tom wadewitz from ubs. your line is open.
tom wadewitz -- ubs -- analyst
yes, thank you. i wanted to go back to labor. i mean it seems like your guide really in a pretty big way hinges on that assumption of improving labor availability in second half. so i guess just two elements to that. do you feel like you have much visibility to that improvement and what maybe have you seen that would give you confidence that's going to happen? and then i guess component within that if you go into peak, it would seem like if you can staff to the swords ahead of peak, then you have to hire, i don't know what your number is 50,000, 70,000 people that could -- that problem could get worse before it's gets better. so i guess visibility and your labor and being ok during peak as well? thank you.
raj subramaniam -- president, chief operating officer and director
thank you, tom. yeah, the number is 90,000 and we are well on our way here. now, over the last two weeks, we have seen pockets of opportunity and you know positive changes that we hadn't seen in the first quarter. so that gives us a little bit of encouragement. and this is a systemic issue and so, yes, we're making some assumptions here in terms of labor availability, but would be staff for peak then hopefully we're in q3 will be in good shape. so we're making -- we're not making dramatic assumptions here in terms of q3 and q4, but we are assuming that q3 is going to be better than q2 is going to be better than q1 and the early indication just very early indication is that, that's indeed the case. so i don't know mike want to add anything to that?
mike lenz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
no, just to reiterate, i broke the labor impact into two pieces. the part that we're assuming that does mitigate as raj outlined is the impact from the availability. again the market wage rate is what it is and we can assume nothing different than that and that is what is baked in to the outlook.
operator
and next we'll go to brian ossenbeck from j.p. morgan. your line is open.
brian ossenbeck -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
all right, thanks for taking the question. just wanted to ask brie about the trend in pricing, obviously you saw with gri yesterday you talked about that briefly. you've got some new surcharges in place, fuel is going up, but i think you mentioned in your prepared remarks, there is some availability for people the largest shippers to get capacity now at current rates. so maybe you can just instill that -- those two factors? what do you feel about getting price in the market to capture? you're ahead in some of these costs and then maybe you can clarify the comments on the larger shippers, we generally [indecipherable] at these synergies from a volume perspective? thank you.
brie carere -- executive vice president, chief marketing and communications officer
got it. thanks, brian. good question. to be really clear when we're talking about incremental capacity, one of the key elements of our revenue quality strategy, which has application here in the united states as well as on our intercontinental. as we talked about it, i talked about the six new flights that we launch from asia outbound perspective. as we -- and that was primarily quite frankly in transition from adhoc to scheduled service to improve reliability. but that allows us to plan and predict and it also allows us to sell differently. as we sold into those flights versus previously a lot of that was kind of catch-up in spot rate. we are making sure that we are bringing on customers at current rates and we are measuring one of those current rates. so if a customer had ex use of our intercontinental lift prior to the last 18 months, we've contractual terms there.
but as we increase the capacity, we give those customers that incremental business comes on at a higher rate. so we're really trying to strike the right balance with our customers, give them the predictability that they need and honor our existing contractual terms as well as we expand capacity, give them availability into that capacity at an incremental current market rates. so really trying to strike that right balance. so that's what i was referring to. it's predominantly in the intercontinental side, but of course it does have application from a peak perspective as we brought on new customers this year and we look at our surging customers, they obviously those peak surcharges help them get the capacity they need. so they can have a successful peak. i hope that helps answer your question.
operator
and next we'll go to jordan alliger from goldman sachs. your line is open.
jordan alliger -- goldman sachs -- analyst
yeah, hi. just on the new ground buckets that you've broken out. can you maybe talk a little bit about the three pieces and would you expect going forward. roughly similar trend lines with the commercial sort of outpacing everything, but still positive on the home delivery and as you mentioned the constraining capacity to keep limiting the last piece of the business?
brie carere -- executive vice president, chief marketing and communications officer
great question. so for this fiscal year, as we talked about inventory levels are at an all-time low. and all of the economic indicators that we're tracking thing that we're going to be a very strong commercial year here in the united states as well as in europe and of course that's also going to drive our intercontinental business. so for fedex ground commercial, we are expecting a strong growth year. from a home delivery perspective, i do think that you will see -- we will say moderate growth for home delivery given the lapping of last year is very, very strong growth. so i think you're going to see some good home delivery growth.
and from an economy perspective, this particular quarter, you saw the 30% year-over-year decline. i do not think you will see that trend continue. john and i are working and we've got some really great new technology coming to market, a new feature called sort the due day [phonetic], which is going to allow us to really move economy through the fedex ground system at a different pace and continue to lower the cost. so i think you'll see us find a better balance of the economy to home delivery, but directionally commercial will grow the fastest followed by home delivery, followed by economy as we think about this fiscal year.
operator
and next we'll go to david vernon from bernstein. your line is open.
david vernon -- bernstein -- analyst
hey, good afternoon. brie just following up on that sort of the growth outlook. you put out some numbers out there on 10% market growth, i think in residential for the next couple of years. is it your expectation that pricing and the operation will be at a point where you can kind of participate at an above-market growth rates from -- once you get past this period of volatility or do you intend to kind of grow the ground business, maybe a little bit lower than the overall market as some other competitors add capacity to the lower end of the service spectrum?
brie carere -- executive vice president, chief marketing and communications officer
that's my favorite question yes. yes, our intent -- we have the best value proposition in the market. we have the best seven-day transit and coverage in the market. we feel really good about our value proposition. as i mentioned earlier, we are actually right now controlling demand because we're trying to balance service in the current labor environment. so that is absolutely our intent. the market is growing. we've got a great value proposition. i can't think of a better time to lean in and to growth here in the united states.
operator
and we'll take our next question from todd fowler from keybanc capital markets. your line is open.
todd fowler -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
hi, great, thanks, and good evening. mike i understand kind of the thoughts around not being too specific about quarterly guidance, but i do think from a street perspective kind of volatility from quarter-to-quarter can be an issue. so i just want to make sure -- are you seeing that in the second quarter, you're expecting a similar $800 million magnitude of year-over-year headwinds? and then secondly, when we think sequentially, the second quarter operating income is flat or down a little bit from the first quarter, is that going to be a similar cadence this year or are there some other things that we should think about just as we move into the second quarter from a seasonal standpoint? thanks.
mike lenz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
sure, todd. yeah, that's a fair characterization. when you -- when i said that the headwinds would be similar that the $800 million. look, the pandemic and many other factors impacting our market, including the supply chain disruptions. i think you have to kind of take pause in terms of assuming typical seasonality across the board. yes, there is a -- there is a degree of that that you will see, but i would say you can't -- you can't just rely upon that because the dynamics are much more fluid than they were and that's why we're trying to outline that as best we can, but we are -- we're navigating those that -- those changes along the way that we're very confident in what we -- what we shared with you.
operator
and next we'll go to amit mehrotra from deutsche bank. your line is open.
amit mehrotra -- deutsche bank -- analyst
hey, i just wanted to follow up on that last question. so just want to understand., so you're obviously entering peak season, higher b2c mix, margin pressure, density pressures, so you typically see a pretty notable step down in ground margins fiscal 1q to 2q, is that -- is that the same cadence? i mean because 1q is obviously pretty low to begin with. just trying to get understanding of that. and just as a high level, do you think ground margins can be up year-over-year this year? thanks.
mike lenz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
so amit, i'm just going to stick with it -- we're not giving a margin forecast. what we -- what we outlined was that we expect operating profit to be up in all the transportation segments. so i'm not going to get into giving a specific margin forecast by quarter. and again the seasonality is -- we don't -- we don't think it's value added to kind of get into trying to parse that a level of precision given the dynamics of the market right now.
operator
and next we'll go to helane becker from cowen. your line is open.
helane becker -- cowen and company -- analyst
thanks very much, operator. hi everybody and thank you for the time. so we've been actually doing a lot of work as you know in the china area, you guys have about 30,000 people employed there. i think it's getting increasingly more difficult to work there. so can you just talk about how you're thinking longer term about being in that market versus moving more capacity offshore to places like where you have regional sorts like japan or back to the philippines? thank you.
mike lenz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thank you, helane for that question. we actually have 12,000 employees in china. we have -- as you know, we've been in business in china since 1984 and we have been serving our customers there and it is extremely important market. we value our business in china and we are committed to continuing to improve our value proposition there. our growth in market is very strong and our operations in our hub in guangzhou is going smoothly and we also just opened up new air operations from beijing. so china remains a very important market for us and we are very committed to it.
operator
and next we'll go to jack atkins from stephens. your line is open.
jack atkins -- stephens -- analyst
okay, great, thank you for taking my question. i guess just to go back to the capex and return discussion for mike. thank you so much for the additional sort of comment around returns and free cash flow. but i guess when we think about sort of the longer-term targets for the business, you guys have always sort of talked about this double-digit consolidated operating margin. we haven't really come close to it since fiscal year '16. you raised the capex as a percentage of revenue targets in the proxy several weeks ago, can you talk about why it makes sense to raise your long-term capital spending plans, when the business still isn't achieving the long-term targets you've set for it from a margin perspective? just help us square those two things? i think that's a vested issue that a lot of people are having trouble to justify it?
mike lenz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
right. jack first, look, let me just say because you brought up about roic, i'll expand a little bit about on the remarks i made earlier there. we're obviously referencing to our wacc when we compare our roic, which we put in the 7% to 9% range, which i think is consistent with what we see in many of your analysis. but when it comes to the roic itself, there is a number of different approaches and methods that practitioners use, so there tends to be variability in the absolute as well as the comparative measurements, but that said we're revisiting the various aspects of that, so that we can maybe expand the context around our discussion of the topic. but i will say, regardless of how you calculated, our roic does remain above our wacc.
so you asked about the lti plan, look i am -- i'm not going to speak on behalf of the board, but i will give you some context around -- partly about what i mentioned, two, three months ago. so again with pandemic and delivering the life saving vaccines around the world, buy chains, customer expectations and all that. so we did indeed accelerate purposefully from investment opportunities for capacity expansion and of course, the replacement of the aircraft, i mentioned before. so as i did specifically say on june call, the fy '22 to fy '24 lti plan was at 8% to account for these opportunities. and that target it is below our historical capital intensity.
fiscal '21 was 7%, but that was the lowest in 10 years. so again there is absolutely the focus on returns and i think that we will continue to address your considerations there and i would also highlight because there was a question earlier about ground and investment there we're making returns there. and we talked a lot about how we're utilizing our assets differently, more efficiently, investing in smaller units of capacity. we got the one single hub, but there is no other hubs on the drawing board. if ground can generate a higher roic at different margin levels than it did call it eight, nine years ago. so again, that's -- that absolutely factors into how we look at these things.
operator
and next, we'll go to allison poliniak from wells fargo. your line is open.
allison poliniak -- wells fargo -- analyst
hi, good evening. brie, i think you had mentioned a low single-digit share internationally, certainly unique environment, limited capacity. can you maybe talk to how you're focused on expanding share, things you're doing there, but more importantly, what you're doing to try to retain some of that share you're capturing today once capacity eases at this point?
brie carere -- executive vice president, chief marketing and communications officer
yeah, great question. so a couple of things. number 1, when we think about our international business, our largest growth opportunity is europe. so when we think about what are we doing to gain share. well first and foremost, we're going to complete the physical integration, which is obviously critical, but when i think about europe, there's three lines of business. there is the intra-europe. we bought tnt. it has a very comprehensive and very unique value proposition because it's got the parcel and the freight network intra-europe to grow our cross-border business and we're very pleased with the momentum there.
from an international perspective, late last fiscal year, we expanded our intercontinental value proposition between europe and the united states. we now have 90% of businesses in eu 17, have access with the fastest overnight service into the united states. so we have the leading intercontinental value proposition from europe to the us. it's a great bundle to sell to b2b or commercial customers, sell to intra-europe as well as the intercontinental.
and then thirdly, when i think about europe, it's -- we are absolutely under penetrated in e-commerce both within europe, as well as from europe to the united states and we, as i talked about have launched the fic product, which is really a very competitive product, it's got quick transit times that has very different features and service for last mile. so it allows us to lower our cost to serve because the features on last mile delivery was a lot more like the ground domestic network. so that's our primary focus from a europe perspective.
i will say, we are also under penetrated between asia and europe and we've got great momentum in that lane. similar metrics, we have sped up our service into europe from asia. in addition to that we are launching the ficp product between those countries, obviously asia into europe, it's a very large e-commerce market and again, we're underpenetrated. just looked at my notes, commercial and home delivery here in the united states, as we think about the rest of the fiscal year are going to be neck and neck from a growth perspective. so, as i talked about commercial growing faster than home delivery, they're going to be pretty darn close as we look at the volume growth this year.
operator
and next, we'll go to bascome majors from susquehanna. your line is open.
bascome majors -- susquehanna -- analyst
yeah, good afternoon. when i look at the ltl freight business, it seems to be performing much better relative to at least early expectations compared to parcel. yet, that's still a manual labor intensive business that requires a lot of drivers, line-haul, freight handling and bodies to do that. can you characterize why you think that you haven't had these labor-driven struggles in that part of your business that seem to be plaguing the parcel businesses, particularly domestically and any best practices or lessons you can learn and apply elsewhere? thank you.
mike lenz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
bascome, this is mike. so first, i'll let raj address more broadly, just to clarify, within that 450 number of labor impact, there is impact there for freight in terms of the same considerations that we talked about there. so i don't want to have the takeaway or imply that the freight team isn't dealing with similar considerations there, but i'll also highlight as i mentioned to scott early on there that different networks and different transportation businesses can have different characteristics in that. so raj, you want to talk about the great things at freight.
raj subramaniam -- president, chief operating officer and director
well, we are extremely proud of the fedex freight team and what they also leading with exactly the same set of challenges and, but we have -- the team has done a fantastic job of managing through our revenue quality and operational efficiency despite these challenging circumstances and, you know, it's obviously a very, very key part of our portfolio. having said that with 20 million packages on the ground network per day, the us domestic parcel network is a very different -- very different set of challenges than dealing with a much smaller set of shipments that go through the freight system.
so look, on -- your point about sharing best practices and making sure that we do the right thing across our operating companies that goes on every single day and we are -- they operate collaboratively is a big mantra at fedex now and we are definitely doing that. so again, i'm very, very proud of what the freight team has done here.
operator
and next, we'll go to duane pfennigwerth from evercore isi. duane, your line is open.
duane pfennigwerth -- evercore isi -- analyst
hey, thanks. so just on the $200 million wage pressure and the $250 million in inefficiencies that that triggered. just to dive a little deeper there was this a turnover issue or an investment for growth issue. are people leaving at a faster rate or are you struggling to staff to grow and if it's the latter, given the environment, why grow?
mike lenz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
so i think, if i understand the question. it is a staffing availability issue on the $250 million piece of it. for the $200 million, it's the rate, so just to reiterate that and like i said, we fully expect and are beginning to see some improvement in the availability but should not -- should plan to not proceed as we fully expect. and like i said earlier, we would need to obviously reassess the pace of implementing the initiatives there, but the opportunity remains nonetheless, we just need to be mindful of the overall environment.
raj subramaniam -- president, chief operating officer and director
yes. and i would just add one line to that is, if that were to happen, there's obviously much broader implications that's way beyond fedex.
operator

and now, raj will share his views on the quarter.
raj subramaniam -- president and chief operating officer
thank you, mickey, and good afternoon, everyone. let me begin by extending a heartfelt thank you to our more than 600,000 dedicated team members, especially those on the frontlines who are working relentlessly to successfully deliver another robust peak season for our customers. as expected, we are seeing strong levels of volume in our network given unprecedented levels of shopping and shipping this holiday season.
fedex ground had an outstanding cyber week, with 100 million packages picked up during the first official week of peak. our ability to handle this influx of packages has been years in the making as we have taken deliberate steps to enhance our unparalleled network to support customers, large and small. this includes strategically adding more capacity across our network to support our growing customer base. for example, at fedex ground, this means adding 14.4 million square feet to our network, the equivalent of 300 football fields since june of this year.
in q2 alone, we brought online 24 major expansion projects, with nine of them starting operations in november just weeks before peak. while it was important that these facilities were up and running to add to a capacity in time for peak, experience tells us that they will operate with increasing efficiency in the weeks and months ahead. as we shared on the q1 call, overcoming staffing and retention challenges due to the constrained labor market has been a key focus. we continued to take bold actions in q2 to hire and invest in our frontline team members and thus increase network efficiency. these actions including pay premiums, increased paid time off and tuition reimbursement.
i am pleased to share that we have made considerable traction in recruiting frontline positions. last week, we exceeded 111,000 applications, the highest level in fedex history. to put this in perspective, we had 52,000 applications the week of may 8. this has led to appropriate staffing levels of peak, including having more than 60,000 frontline team members since we last spoke in september. we delivered strong results for the quarter with an 11% increase in adjusted operating income, which exceeded our initial expectations shared during the q1 call.
second quarter results include outstanding performance by our team at fedex express, where operating income on an as-adjusted basis exceeded $1 billion for the quarter. the ability we have at express to flex our cost structure and network in response to changing market conditions positions us for long-term sustained profitability. fedex freight also delivered a strong quarter with an operating margin of 14.7%. i am proud of the team as they continue to focus on revenue quality and profitable growth. we estimate the effect of labor shortages on our q2 results was approximately $470 million, in line with our original expectations. and consistent with the first quarter, ground once again, bore the majority of these costs to the tune of $285 million.
while ground's results were negatively affected by labor challenges in the first half of the year, we are encouraged by hiring momentum as we look to the second half and are focused on retaining recently hired team members after the peak season concludes. we know we have an excellent value proposition for employees, which we are strengthening even further with technology that enables employee-friendly, flexible schedule options, including the ability to pick up extra shifts when convenient or swap shifts with a colleague all from the convenience of an app on their phone or computer. all of this to say we anticipate cost pressures from constrained labor markets to partially subside in the second half of the fiscal year.
now, it's a good time to focus on what is ahead for fedex. the fedex business has been built over nearly five decades. and during that time, we have built networks and capabilities that are differentiated from our competitors and nearly impossible to replicate. our customers and their customers value these networks and capabilities as we enable global supply chains to stay connected. this has never been illustrated more clearly than during the last two years of the global covid pandemic.
our industry has proven to be absolutely critical in delivering during this pandemic, whether it is business-to-business or e-commerce. and within this industry, our strategy is unique. our future growth and profitability will be driven by our strategy and we will drive total shareholder value over the immediate mid and long-term. there is solid momentum in our base business as we continue to lean into the dynamic growth of e-commerce amid a robust pricing environment.
in addition, we have other levers for profitable growth, including number one, increasing collaboration and efficiency to optimize our networks and businesses; number two, driving improved results in europe and international; and number three, unlocking value by digital innovation. our expanded collaboration across operating companies will drive cost benefits, lower delivery and line-haul cost and better utilization of existing assets.
said differently, we'll utilize our air and ground networks in a smarter, more calculated manner. fedex freight trucks have traveled four million miles while operating on behalf of fedex ground this year. fedex freight has also provided fedex ground with intermodal containers, which have already been dispatched nearly 50,000 times. we will continue to look comprehensively at all assets in our network, including stations, hubs and equipment to put the right package in the right network at the best service for our customers.
and as i highlighted earlier, the focus on collaboration also extends to our customers as we work to make their supply chains smarter. this includes providing integration and common data platform opportunities and planning the best way to leverage our network flexibility for their volume needs. the second lever is continuing to improve our international profitability. our international business, particularly europe, remains one of our biggest opportunities.
i was in europe in october, and i was happy to note the excellent progress there as we build upon the success of station integration, which was completed in may 2021. we remain on track for the completion of our air network integration in april 2022, which will complete the physical integration of tnt into fedex express and enable full physical interoperability of these networks. after april 2022, paris' charles de gaulle airport will serve as the main hub for all european and intercontinental flights. liege will connect specific large european markets and ensure we have the flexibility to scale our operations in response to market needs, thus enabling us to focus on international growth. brie, will share more on what this enhanced value proposition means for our customers.
finally, we are unlocking value through digital innovation and our accelerated integration of data-driven technologies and enhanced digital capabilities ranging from increased network efficiency to customer experience improvements. for example, early package visibility enhances visibility of third-party trailers as improving customer collaboration, information sharing and package prioritization.
model-driven estimated delivery date uses machine learning to provide a more accurate estimated delivery day of packages to customers and recipients. and trailer load scan automation eliminates the need for a manual scan enabling faster and more efficient loading while significantly reducing package touches. these ongoing investments, network capacity, automation and technology, have helped fedex build the most flexible and most responsive network in the industry, affording us significant competitive advantages.
in closing, the successful execution of our strategies continues to drive high demand for our differentiated services. we remain confident in these strategies for the various reasons outlined. our unparalleled portfolio of services powered by the strength and reach of our global network positions fedex to deliver superior, sustainable financial returns and drive shareholder value for years to come.
with that, let me turn this floor over to brie.
brie carere -- executive vice president, chief marketing and communications officer
thank you, raj. good afternoon, everyone. q2 delivered our second consecutive quarter of 14% revenue growth, demonstrating the strong demand for our differentiated portfolio and our ability to drive revenue quality as a result. constrained capacity has continued to support a favorable pricing environment. we are maintaining a brisk pace for repricing contracts, ensuring a high surcharge capture and yield improvements. we are working with large customers to identify opportunities, to move their volume from our national network to our regional and local networks, freeing up additional capacity for small business customers.
small businesses relied our market-leading transit times in our seven-day a week network to compete. they cannot forward deploy inventory at the same scale as large retailers. our domestic yield growth was 9.1% with fuel in q2. our general rate increase will take place in january and we expect a strong capture rate. in january, the ground economy peak surcharge will be replaced by the new ground economy delivery surcharge at a $1, solidifying the price point for our economy product. and as a reminder, fedex ground economy was formerly fedex smartpost.
the landscape across the industry remains robust and positions us well for continued profitable growth. we are forecasting that the u.s. domestic parcel market will reach 134 million pieces a day by calendar year 2026, a remarkable 70% growth from 2020. e-commerce is expected to drive 90% of the parcel market growth. we have developed a tremendous portfolio of e-commerce solutions and we are very confident that our competitive value proposition will enable us to continue to take share smartly in the addressable e-commerce market.
as you all know, we have a diversified customer base globally as well as here in the united states. and as such, we can confidently grow without the risk of a very large and disruptive customer negotiation. the u.s. domestic b2b market is also expected to grow. it will grow at a 5% cagr through 2026. we are growing our digital capabilities to provide a range of visibility experiences that will give our b2b customers greater clarity, confidence and control over their deliveries, especially in high-value verticals such as healthcare.
turning now to international. our successful commercial and operational execution in response to covid demonstrates our ability to grow profitably in an uncertain environment. demand out of asia continues to contribute strong revenue and profit performance and our international economy embargo and peak surcharges are contributing to our yield growth there. q2 express international export yield grew 12% and volume grew 7.6%, which is outstanding year-over-year growth. international export composite yield grew to almost $54 per package, while average daily volume was more than 1.1 million. i am very proud of the international revenue quality results, especially given that we also had double-digit e-commerce growth internationally, which, of course, puts downward pressure on our package yield.
international priority freight had a very strong quarter with 34% year-over-year revenue growth year-to-date. with new variants of covid causing uncertainty in the global recovery, we believe that air cargo capacity will remain constrained through calendar year 2022 and a full recovery is not anticipated until at least 2024. export demand in europe and apac has fully recovered to pre-pandemic levels and capacity on international lanes remains scarce. we anticipate a continued favorable pricing environment and an embargo on our deferred services out of asia pacific for the foreseeable future.
we are targeting both b2b and cross-border e-commerce market share internationally. we have identified the target lanes for b2b growth where we have shared growth opportunity, most notably in and out of and across europe. as raj alluded to, with the launch of our integrated air network in april, we will dramatically enhance our capabilities within and into europe, creating benefits for customers around the world.
more european customers will have access to next-day and pre-noon delivery times for their intra-european shipments through our expanded portfolio of services. we will be able to offer customers an option of mid-day or end-of-day service in-bound to europe, giving our customers around the world more choice and flexibility while giving our global sales team more opportunities to pursue. these enhancements, along with our intra-europe road services and industry-leading europe to u.s. service, position us with a very competitive portfolio.
as we approach the final stages of physical integration this fiscal year, we are increasing the fedex brand presence on the road in europe by approximately 30%, including the rebranding of vehicles and facilities. additionally, intercontinental e-commerce will contribute approximately half of the growth in the parcel market over the next decade. fedex international connect plus, which launched across europe, asia pacific and the united states, enables us to compete more effectively in this growing e-commerce market. in addition to the improvements in our transportation portfolio, we are very focused on our digital solutions across the customer journey. we have launched our new account opening application in eight countries with very great results.
we are seeing double-digit improvement in account openings and customers opting in for my fedex rewards, which, of course, is the only small business loyalty program in the industry. we have also launched our new fedex ship manager application in more than 100 countries. this is the primary tool for our small business segment to ship with fedex. with the modern, easy-to-use interface, a small business can now create a label and get the package out the door more than a minute faster than they could previously. we will launch this new fedex ship manager in the united states in 2022. in summary, we are very confident in our commercial strategies for revenue growth and yield improvement.
and with that, i'll turn it over to mike for his remarks.
mike lenz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thank you, brie, and good afternoon, everyone. given the historically challenging nature of peak season, along with the continued staffing challenges felt by numerous companies around the world, we are quite pleased with our second quarter consolidated financial results, with adjusted operating income up 11% year-over-year. while adjusted earnings per share was unchanged year-over-year, this year's effective tax rate was significantly higher as last year's earnings included a $0.71 per share discrete tax benefit from favorable guidance issued by the irs. as we anticipated, most of the headwinds we experienced in the first quarter persisted through the second quarter, which dampened our q2 profitability by an estimated $770 million.
to further unpack our second quarter results, i will highlight several key drivers. the difficult labor market once again had the largest effect on our bottom line, representing an estimated $470 million in additional year-over-year costs. as i did last quarter, i'll separate the effect of the labor market into two components; higher rates and network inefficiencies resulting from labor shortages. of the $470 million, we estimate $230 million was incurred in higher wage and purchase transportation rates. this included higher wage rates and paid premiums for team members and higher rates paid for third-party transportation services.
we estimate network inefficiencies resulting from labor shortages, increased costs by approximately $240 million. these costs include additional line-haul, higher usage of third-party transportation, cost to reposition assets in the network over time and recruiting incentives all to address staffing shortages. beyond the labor effects, our results for the second quarter also included the following headwinds; $90 million related to investments in the ground network, as raj outlined earlier, that are critical to improving service and adding capacity; an estimated $75 million in incremental air network costs at express due to the continued effect of covid restrictions on our operations; and lastly, a $70 million effect year-over-year from higher federal excise taxes as the waiver ended on december 31, 2020.
with that overview of the consolidated results, let's turn to the highlights for the segments. ground reported $8.3 billion in revenue, a 13% increase year-over-year, with operating margin at 5.8%. the results at ground in the second quarter with operating income and margin down are not where we would like them to be and our teams remain very focused on improving performance. ground operating income was down approximately $70 million and in addition to the $90 million i mentioned earlier, results were significantly affected by higher wage and purchase transportation rates and network inefficiencies amid the constrained labor market.
express adjusted operating income increased to over $1 billion and reported an adjusted operating margin of 8.8%, which was driven by higher yields and international priority volume growth, which more than offset the negative effects of continued staffing challenges and covid-19-related air network inefficiencies. freight had another outstanding quarter with an operating margin of 14.7% as revenue for q2 increased 17% year-over-year and operating income increased 33% year-over-year. our q2 results include a net pre-tax non-cash mark-to-market loss of $260 million related to the termination of the tnt express netherlands pension plan and a curtailment charge related to the u.s. fedex freight pension plan. i'll point you to our 10-q filed this afternoon for more details on these charges.
now, let's pivot to capital spending. year-to-date, we spent $3.1 billion in capital as we continue to invest in our strategies for profitable growth, service excellence and modernizing our digital platforms. our capital forecast for fiscal 2022 remains at $7.2 billion and less than 8% of anticipated revenue. we ended our quarter with $6.8 billion in cash and are targeting approximately $3 billion in adjusted free cash flow for fy 2022, which puts us on pace to deliver over $7.5 billion in adjusted free cash flow for fy '21 and '22 combined, far exceeding our historical levels. these cash flows have provided extensive flexibility as we continue to focus on balanced capital allocation and strengthening our balance sheet.
as a result of this flexibility, i am pleased to announce our board has approved a new $5 billion share repurchase authorization. and as part of this program, we expect to enter into a $1.5 billion share repurchase program that will be completed by the end of the fiscal year, which is on top of the $750 million of repurchases in the first half of the year. this new program highlights the tremendous confidence we have in our business and underscores our commitment to driving value for our shareholders. during q2, we also made a $250 million voluntary contribution to our pension plan, which mitigates pbgc fees and further strengthens the funded status of our plan for our employees and we expect to make an additional $250 million contribution in february.
as for our fy2022 guidance, we are raising our full-year adjusted eps range to $20.50 to $21.50 to reflect second quarter results and outlook for the second half of the fiscal year as well as the expected benefit from our asr transaction. this improved outlook represents another outstanding financial year with a year-over-year increase in adjusted eps ranging from 13% to 18%, following our strong 2021 results. while the second quarter exceeded our expectations, uncertainty remains across many fronts, including the labor market.
we are closely monitoring developments related to the federal vaccine mandate, ongoing pandemic developments and inflation as we consider our outlook. labor headwinds will persist in q3, but the labor availability and network inefficiency component will continue to mitigate as we move through the quarter, given our progress to date and plans to address this. in addition, we do not expect a recurrence of approximately $1 billion in notable second half headwinds from a year ago that included the timing of variable compensation expense, historic severe winter weather, a one-time express frontline bonus and our commitment to the yale carbon capture initiative.
in summary, the successful execution during the second quarter of our strategies amid a very dynamic environment gives us confidence in our updated outlook for the remainder of fiscal 2022 and beyond. in closing, i do want to take a moment of personal privilege here. while not on these calls, many of you are familiar with john merino, our longtime chief accounting officer, who signed our 10-qs and 10-ks. john has been integrally responsible for the quality and integrity of our financial information. and after 23 years with fedex, he will retire at the end of this month. so, on behalf of the leadership team, i want to thank him for his service and record of accomplishment.
and now before we move to the q&a, our chairman and ceo, fred smith, has joined us and would like to share a few words.
frederick w. smith -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you, mike, and good afternoon to everyone on the call. as promised on the june analyst call, i am here to answer any questions specifically for me. let me start by saying thank you to our hundreds of thousands of team members. this time of year is challenging, especially for those working tirelessly on our frontlines, but your hard work and dedication to keep our purple promise for our customers is evident by the q2 results, raj, brie and mike have covered well today.
let me also thank john merino for his outstanding work for fedex as our corporate vice president and chief accounting officer over these last 23 years. i'm pleased to announce we will be hosting an investor meeting on tuesday and wednesday, 28, 29 june 2022 in memphis. mickey will share details after the new year.
i'll now pass it back to him to begin the q&a portion of the call. mickey?
mickey foster -- vice president, investor relations
now, i'd like to open our question-and-answer session, and please remember, callers are limited to one question, so we can accommodate everyone.

[operator instructions] and we'll take our first question from brandon oglenski from barclays. your line is open.
brandon oglenski -- barclays -- analyst
hey. good evening, everyone, and thanks for taking my question. fred, thanks for joining the call. i guess the supply chain constraints that we've seen in the past year have been pretty steep. through your context of looking at this industry, how much of this rate increase and inflation that we see is going to really result in stickiness? or is this really transitory as we get things moving again?
raj subramaniam -- president and chief operating officer
well, this is raj. let me answer that question. the supply chain constraints we're seeing today are two-fold. one is because of the lack of supply of critical components like semiconductors and the second is because of the congestions we're seeing in the port. now as you know, fedex gets out traffic a few miles downstream from the port and that supply chain is actually flowing pretty good through the united states. of course, we are also flying over the top and delivering high-value goods from the global economy through the system.
we expect the supply chain constraints to stay for some time. the air cargo capacity is going to be constrained for some more time and we are very well positioned for success here. let me also add this point that we have the network flexibility to scale up and down. the size and scale of our network is massive for us to be able to manage the cost accordingly as well. but for the foreseeable future, i think there is strong demand for our services internationally.
operator
and next, we'll go to ravi shanker from morgan stanley. your line is open.
ravi shanker -- morgan stanley -- analyst
thanks very much. fred, i would love your thoughts on the long-term competitive environment in the parcel phase. amazon just told us that they believe that they are now the largest parcel carrier in the country and you've seen the usps kind of ramp up capacity meaningfully in the last decade as well. what does this industry look like 10 years from now kind of both competitively and kind of where, and just what do e-commerce supply chains look like? and what part of the business would you like to concentrate in?
raj subramaniam -- president and chief operating officer
ravi, this is raj. let me just say that the e-commerce market is growing very strongly, as brie pointed out the numbers in her remarks. we are in the center of that e-commerce growth ecosystem. when you talk about any retailers and their omnichannel story, what often gets missed is the fedex story that's right behind it, underneath it. and as you can see from our growth in the last -- these two fiscal years, we're going to grow more than $20 billion, and so we're not lacking for growth. when people talk about the last mile, sometimes and most times, they forget about the first few thousand miles. and again, some of the statistics that people see and talk about are so misleading that i don't even know what to say about that.
operator
and next, we'll go to ken hoexter from bank of america. your line is open.
ken hoexter -- bank of america securities -- analyst
great. good afternoon. raj, just as you think about the cost and you mentioned the decelerating labor impact that mike talked about, with ground hitting the lowest margin level in nearly two decades, express, it's obvious you have the structure set up for sustained growth, particularly with europe and tnt integration. brie talked about that. but now looking at ground, should we expect some of those costs to subside as the labor, you mentioned, gets easier. maybe just walk us through your thoughts on how ground shakes out with the growth of e-commerce and the impact on margin?
mike lenz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
so ken, this is mike. let me just highlight a couple aspects there as you think about the second half. so, ground had the most significant impact from the labor availability challenges. so that, again, has significantly impacted margin and profit this quarter. as we move through the rest of the fiscal year, we'll see further mitigation of that somewhat in q3, particularly in q4, if you recall, the labor market began to turn around that period of time. so, we'll be lapping some of that plus, we will have fully address the network inefficiencies. that said, we're not projecting any change in the labor rates because that is a step change that we think will persist.
raj subramaniam -- president and chief operating officer
and ken, let me add to that by saying this much. firstly, the first and most important point is the demand for our services is very robust. the pricing environment is very robust. the labor headwinds start to recede in the second half. the investments that we have made get more efficient as we go into the second half and the technology investments that make us more efficient as well. so, we expect in the second half, our profit and operating margins to improve year-over-year and we get double-digit. so, i guess that answers that question.
operator
and next, we'll go to tom wadewitz from ubs. your line is open.
tom wadewitz -- ubs -- analyst
yes. thank you. i wanted to get a little more color on the labor market. it does seem like its pretty tightly tied in ground to your margin performance, whether you get traction on labor and kind of how rapidly that develops. so, i guess is the assumption that you have that you convert a lot of the peak season labor to kind of ongoing? and then kind of how much visibility do you have to that? and i guess also, it seems like your point is stability in your cost per hour, let's say, for labor? or are you assuming some further inflation in sequential increase in the cost per hour as you look out? thank you.
raj subramaniam -- president and chief operating officer
thank you, tom. on the labor front, we had obviously headwinds in the first two quarters and we actually landed pretty much where we thought it was going to be. now, we are seeing, because of the actions we are taking considerable traction on the labor front, as i mentioned to you in my earlier remarks, just the last week, we had 111,000 applications for fedex. that's the highest in our history.
again, to put that in context versus what we saw in may, that was 52,000. so, you can see that we're making a lot of progress here. and so we are essentially staffed up for peak, and we think that we can hold on to the required labor to the second half. so, that projections that we talk about now incorporate these assumptions. i don't know, mike, if you want to add to that?
mike lenz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
no, tom, you're thinking about it in the right format there. certainly in december here, as the peak volume surge, we are continuing to navigate the network inefficiencies. but coming off a peak when the package handler count would otherwise perhaps go down further, we will stabilize that at a different level in order to optimize going forward. and just to reiterate, we're not assuming any reduction in the base pay rates as it were of labor from the market because i think that's well documented. that's here to stay, and we're managing to that going forward.
operator
and next, we'll go to chris wetherbee from citi. your line is open.
chris wetherbee -- citi -- analyst
great. thanks. good afternoon. i want to talk about the guidance a little bit and sort of make sure that we understood the main drivers of the increase, particularly in the back half of the year. so, we have some of the cost dynamics easing i think into the back half, obviously comps from year-over-year are more favorable, but if you were to look at the back half and think about ground relative to maybe express, if you could help us sort of parse out where you see the better opportunity and how that's reflected in the new guidance?
mike lenz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
so chris, let me go at it this way. so, first the three key components for driving the second half of the year are the pricing initiatives, the labor aspects that we just covered, as well as the headwinds we had in second half of last year. so, as brie mentioned, we're being very thoughtful about the various pricing levers and initiatives. so, recall that the gri goes into effect in january and that the surcharges -- certain surcharges that we announced back in september, first of those hit in november. so, we only had one month in the second quarter, so that will hit the whole year, as well as the ongoing contract renewals. so, those are three key things to keep front and center when you're thinking about drivers for the second half of the year.
as far as the broader guidance overall, q2 was above our expectations. as raj mentioned, the labor impacts actually came in right in line with what we anticipated back in september, but we executed strongly on our revenue quality initiatives. we managed and deferred the various expenses and we were able to accommodate incremental demand, particularly from asia pacific. so, the combination of the second quarter, our outlook for the second half of the year and then, of course, the impact of the asr on share count is the last component in terms of when you think about the pieces of the overall annual guidance change. so hopefully, that helps frame that.
operator
and next, we'll go to jack atkins from stephens. your line is open.
jack atkins -- stephens -- analyst
okay. great. thank you. i guess a question here for either brie or raj. but when you think about your opportunity set in europe, particularly on the revenue side, can you maybe talk about the cadence of unlocking some of the revenue and market share capture opportunities in europe once the integration of tnt is finally complete here in april?
maybe help us think through what a fully integrated physical network with fedex europe and tnt will give you, and how will that help you with allowing for improved european profits overall?
brie carere -- executive vice president, chief marketing and communications officer
well, i think the short answer is we think post april that we have the best value proposition if you look at the combined bundle of intra-europe ground as well as intercontinental coming in and out of europe. so, we will have the very best coverage of overnight service across western europe from europe into the u.s., and that combined with our leading ground service. we think that that is just a great value proposition. as i mentioned, we're also making some pretty significant investments in our digital capabilities. so, when we talked about the new fedex ship manager online, we've already launched that in europe and we've had great traction with it.
so, when we think about kind of post april, we've got a great portfolio for b2b and we are growing in e-commerce, which has been something that we haven't been able to do. as you look at the details that we released, you'll see that we're actually making room for growth for intra-europe. so, we're trading up from our international domestic portfolio in europe. so, we're making the right portfolio and customer mix decision to also really make sure we get the highest revenue quality out of our european business as well. we feel really good about the business right now.
raj subramaniam -- president and chief operating officer
and jack, let me add one point to what brie just mentioned. the ability for us to access low-cost intra-european networks for our international business in and out of europe, that's the cost advantage as well in addition to all the portfolio and revenue opportunities that brie just talked about.
operator
and next, we'll go to duane pfennigwerth from evercore isi. your line is open.
duane pfennigwerth -- evercore isi -- analyst
hey. thanks for the question. just on the balance sheet and maybe the answer is we got to wait until june and look forward to seeing you in memphis, but how do you think about the balance set longer term and the balance of share repurchase relative to balance sheet improvement from these levels?
mike lenz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes. duane, this is mike. i think, certainly, opportunity to explore that further in june, but i would just emphasize that the announcement of the authorization is just a logical evolution in where we have been in terms of capital allocation and strengthening the balance sheet. you recall, we repurchased -- we paid down some debt in the fourth quarter of 2021. we increased the dividend 15% this past june. we continue to thoughtfully invest in the business for efficiency as well as growth. so, this initiative is just as part of the overall capital allocation and so that's just the next step along the way, and we can elaborate more and explore further in june.
operator
and next, we'll go to jordan alliger from goldman sachs. your line is open.
jordan alliger -- goldman sachs -- analyst
yes. hi. just a question on the labor front, can you talk a little bit more about your progress on getting your core positions filled sort of the full-time folks versus just the seasonal hires that you needed? just a point of clarification. i just want to make sure i heard right on the margin for ground. were you saying that the whole second half would average double digit? thanks.
raj subramaniam -- president and chief operating officer
yes. the answer to that question, jordan, is that we are targeting second double digit margins for the second half and improved year-over-year margins and improved year-over-year operating profit. so in terms of your other question, i'm sorry, say that again, i didn't quite understand it.
jordan alliger -- goldman sachs -- analyst
my question was in terms of the hiring that you've talked about, you've talked a lot about the applications that have gone up. i'm just wondering in terms of actually the hiring of the core positions, not the seasonal employees, but the folks that you need sort of year round, what progress have you made on that versus just sort of the 80,000 or 90,000 people you needed for peak?
raj subramaniam -- president and chief operating officer
so, we hired at the rate of 10,000 to 12,000 per week since q2. and again, our objective here is to make sure that these team members stay with us post peak and that we have the labor situations to make our networks more efficient. the whole problem was our networks were inefficient. and now even as we speak, we are reloading packages back to where it should be in the first place. and that's what's going to make the difference.
mike lenz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
hey, jordan. this is mike. another aspect as we've aggressively addressed this situation is in terms of the flexibility, in terms of scheduling and engaging employees, such that it's not as binary as full-time, part-time there. and that there's the scheduling flexibility helps us well in terms of navigating labor availability when and where you need it.
operator
and next, we'll go to brian ossenbeck from j.p. morgan. your line is open.
brian ossenbeck -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
hey. good evening. thanks for taking the question. couple of follow-ups for you, mike. you mentioned the vaccine mandate for federal contractors, obviously that was put on hold by a court last week. so, did that actually give you some cushion to work with? i guess, can you tell us if that was a factor in terms of hiring people and if that was a headwind that you're now sort of relieved off?
and then also, you mentioned the asr impact on eps, i think it's 80% complete when it's once agreed upon. so, imagine you can put a number around that for us. so, please do that if you can? thank you.
mike lenz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes, brian, it obviously depends on the precise timing and market conditions, but it would be somewhat north of $0.20 per share for the balance of the -- in terms of the overall annual eps. as it relates to the hiring, as raj said, we set a record in terms of applications two weeks ago for hourly positions at vacant. so, we expect to continue to see progress on that front, and we'll be very mindful of how that evolves.
operator
and we'll take our next question from scott group with wolfe research. your line is open.
scott group -- wolfe research -- analyst
hey. thanks for the question. so, as we start to lap some of the tougher yield comps, how are you thinking about yield growth in the back half of the year? and then, raj, i want to just ask you big picture or fred, it does seem like there's a massive margin opportunity for the corporation relative to peers. you've maybe talked about some initiatives, but any way to quantify what you see in terms of the initiatives or the opportunity set?
frederick w. smith -- chairman and chief executive officer
this is smith here. there is a massive margin improvement opportunity. raj, you can talk about the rest of it.
raj subramaniam -- president and chief operating officer
the core business is very strong. we are in the middle of a very robust market and a pricing environment. as i've said before, on the e-commerce market growth, we are in the center of it. we are in the center of this ecosystem and this has got both volume and yield opportunities. our core b2b business is very strong. in addition to that, we have three levers. one is the ability for us to optimize across our operating companies and to make sure the right package goes in the right network and be very smart about how we spread our assets and use our capacity.
the second is the turnaround opportunity or the upside opportunity, i should say, in europe as we finish up the physical integration and to the point that brie talked about in detail earlier. and lastly, the ability for us to deliver value for all our stakeholders from our digital innovation. there's a lot of work going on in this regard. we are sitting on so much global insights about the global supply chain every single day and we're working with our customers to provide those insights and there's value there as well. so, there's significant opportunities to go beyond our base.
brie, do you want to add to that?
brie carere -- executive vice president, chief marketing and communications officer
yes, absolutely. just want to kind of just double-click on the pricing environment in the back half. yes, the comps are aggressive, but we still believe that there is upside from a revenue quality perspective. we're expecting a higher than normal capture of our general rate increase. we are making structural changes in all of our contracts as we move forward. we're just over 50% now of our customer base that we have renewed, so we still have some work to do there and some upside potential.
we've also seen small business was our fastest-growing segment again last quarter. so that, of course, is a great lift from a yield perspective. so yes, we're clear eyed that the comps are aggressive but we still feel pretty confident in the pricing environment as we move forward and we think we're doing a good job of managing kind of revenue quality as well as product and customer mix.
operator
and our next question comes from helane becker with cowen. your line is open.
helane becker -- cowen & company -- analyst
thanks very much, operator. hi, everybody. so, two questions. the first is, mike, would you still consider share purchase as aggressively as you are if congress instituted a tax on them? and the second question is with regard to sustainability and how you're thinking about improving or reducing your carbon footprint either through use of saf for the aircraft fleet or shifting to different electric vehicles and so on? and just kind of wondering how you're thinking about that maybe longer term over the next five or seven years?
mike lenz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
helane, this is mike. i'll take the first part of that. yes, we are aware of proposed legislation related to the repurchase, as you mentioned there. our transaction will largely complete in december. so, we'll just have to see how that would play out subsequent to that, but that's the accelerated share repurchase delivers much of it upfront.
raj subramaniam -- president and chief operating officer
and helane, on the carbon-neutral goals, we have announced and we are very proud of it, the fact that we announced that we achieved carbon neutrality across our global operations by 2040, and we didn't do this casually. we thought about this a lot. and vehicle electrification is a key path to our success here. we are expanding the use of electric vehicles that will lead to significant reductions. we expect that 50% of fedex express global pud vehicles will be electric by 2025, rising to 100% of purchases by 2030. so, we're making good progress there. we have line of sight on the over-the-road vehicles.
on the safs, yes, we will obviously look at that, but saf represents a very small piece of the demand and also the cost is not where it needs to be yet. so, we know that there's some fundamental research needs to be done to really address this issue and that's part of the reason why we're investing $100 million with the yale to create the yale center for natural carbon capture. and again, the initial work and focus on to offset the equivalent of carbon emissions from the aviation industry. so, lots more to come here. but again, this is something we are very serious about and working with the best minds to get the answers.

mike lenz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
we couldn't hear the question. it was static on this end. hello? operator?
operator
[operator instructions] we'll take our next question from jeff kauffman from vertical research partners. your line is open. please go ahead.
jeff kauffman -- vertical research partners -- analyst
thank you very much, and thank you for taking my question. fred, while we have you on the phone, i was just curious, there's legislation moving through congress to affect trade with china. i know there was news about a ground-breaking digital trade agreement between the u.k. and singapore. i know this has always been a popular topic with you. what is your view on the status of trade policy out there? and can you talk a little bit about any catalysts that might occur that might be beneficial with the company coming up?
frederick w. smith -- chairman and chief executive officer
well, we have expressed to both republican and democratic administrations that we feel that it was a major mistake for the united states to walk away from the trans-pacific partnership. what that agreement did was to allow us to deepen our trade ties with our other trading partners. and of course, given the leadership of japan, the other participants did go forward with it. so, the best way to normalize the relationships with china is to sign tpp and get a more normalized trading relationship, which china would like to then join. and on the broader issue, obviously, we feel very strongly.
as our great secretary of state, cordell hull, said decades ago, he and roosevelt were really the architects of united states promoting open trade. it's when goods cross borders, armies rarely do. so, the best way to keep a harmonious relationship with china is not to disconnect, to trade where we can. and that's what we support. and i'm hopeful that at the end of the day that cooler heads will prevail and we'll join the tpp and we will try to have that constructive relationship with china.
the reality is people forget about this, and all of the populous politics. the trade that the united states promoted in the last 30 years gave each household in the united states an increase in disposable income of about $10,000 or $11,000. i mean it was a huge benefit, an enormous tax decrease. so, we are strong free traders and we think we should stay engaged in china and we hope the administration does that. and i quite frankly, am optimistic because i think at the end of the day, that view will eventually prevail. particularly in a period of labor shortage, it's impossible for the united states to manufacture all the goods that consumers in the united states want. so, i hope that was helpful.
operator
and next, we'll go back to bascome majors from susquehanna. your line is open.
bascome majors -- susquehanna -- analyst
yes. thanks for taking my question. you own the largest less in truckload business in north america. it could do potentially close to $2 billion in ebitda this year. how do you get investors to focus more and give you more credit for having that valuable asset?
frederick w. smith -- chairman and chief executive officer
bascome, we appreciate the question. we are very proud of the results of fedex freight and we see great opportunity going forward. it's a key part of the overall enterprise strategy. raj highlighted some of the collaboration initiatives. it will have a key role as well as it grows the very successful fedex freight direct product that's being well received. and so i think it will be just continuing to focus on the success as the largest ltl carrier in terms of the revenue quality and sustainability of the performance of the freight business as a stand-alone as well as the synergies that will accrue to the overall enterprise as we increase collaboration beyond what raj highlighted earlier.
raj subramaniam -- president and chief operating officer
and let me just reiterate that fedex freight is an important part of our overall enterprise strategy and our results at fedex freight, our outstanding margins illustrate that our strategy is working.
operator
and next, we'll go to david vernon from bernstein. your line is open.
david vernon -- sanford c. bernstein -- analyst
hey. good afternoon, everyone. thanks for taking the question. raj, i'd love if you could help us really understand kind of what that opportunity is inside of europe. i remember when you guys first announced the acquisition of tnt, you're sharing some information around the profitability of the domestic segment versus europe. can you give us a sense for whether you're making money in europe today and what the margin level is and where it can go through?
raj subramaniam -- president and chief operating officer
we're not going to break out the numbers for you that you asked for, but let me just address it qualitatively. the rationale for the integration remains as sound as it was when we made the acquisition. the portfolio in europe, we're talking about international. in and out of europe, in the continental, we are very strong there. intra-european express, we are doing pretty good. it's the intra-european ground business that we didn't have very minimal share.
well, with tnt, we have the best player in that business. now, that being part of this portfolio and we will stay very disciplined on the international domestic business, we now have the portfolio to make it successful and piece it all together not only from a customer value proposition perspective, but also from a cost of moving international, especially economy goods on the road.
so, i hope that answered the question, but we feel that -- and also, the restructuring program that we announced earlier this calendar year is on track to make sure that we are as efficient as possible in europe. so, a lot of things going on. very excited about what april 2022 brings.
mike lenz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes. david, it's mike. it's just important to reiterate that completing the physical integration here at the end of this fiscal year really sets the foundation to enable this opportunity going forward and we can certainly expand upon that in further detail when you all come visit us in june.
operator
and next, we'll go to bruce chan from stifel. your line is open.
j. bruce chan -- stifel -- analyst
hey. thanks, operator, and good evening, everyone. maybe just another one on the ltl side because we've spoken a bit about the ground network expansion here, but for ltl, you've got several peers that are adding some meaningful terminal capacity. maybe you could just give us a sense of where you are right now in terms of freight facility utilization and then whether you plan to grow the network there as well? thank you.
raj subramaniam -- president and chief operating officer
the ltl side, our utilization is strong, but we are very disciplined in how we manage that business. the revenue quality and efficiency are watchwords as we -- we are the number one revenue share in this segment, and so all i would say there is that the demand for our business continues strong. our revenue quality remains strong, and we will be very judicious in how we add capacity.
mike lenz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes. bruce, this is mike. ads grew 3% in the quarter. the revenue quality focus came through in the bottom line, and we continue with our initiatives to incorporate technology into the ltl business to do exactly what you ask about there and enhance the efficiency and utilization of our assets.
operator
and our last question comes from todd fowler with keybanc capital markets. your line is open.
todd fowler -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
great. thanks and good evening, everyone. just to close out on ground margins. it sounds like that you've got some stabilization now as we move into the back half of the year, but how do we think about the longer-term path to moving beyond kind of the high single to low double-digit margin range you've been in? obviously, there's been a lot of revenue growth in the segment, but how do we move kind of beyond the margin range of the past couple of years? is that something that you need to price to get the margin level up? is it getting some of the efficiencies? and how do you think about normalized incremental margins there? thanks.
mike lenz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
so todd, this is mike. i know we threw a lot at you as it relates to the initiatives there, but they will continue to build in terms of -- labor is one piece. we talked about the new facilities we opened. those facilities aren't as efficient at the outset. we are making -- we are seeing that from those that we opened last year. we're also exploring different ways to even fully utilize those assets, the technology elements that raj highlighted.
so, there's a number of components there that come together and will be integral to driving ground profitability and margins higher, and so we're very optimistic about the trajectory there and getting past this headwind of the labor right now really will be a good launching point for these other aspects to gain even more traction.
operator
and we have no further questions in the queue. i'll turn it back over to management for closing remarks.

operator
good day, everyone, and welcome to the fedex corporation third quarter fiscal year 2022 earnings conference call. today's call is being recorded. at this time, i will turn the call over to mickey foster, vice president of investor relations for fedex corporation. please go ahead.
mickey foster -- vice president, investor relations
good afternoon, and welcome to fedex corporation's third quarter earnings conference call. the third quarter earnings release, form 10-q, and stack book are on our website at fedex.com. this call is being streamed from our website where the replay will be available for about one year. joining us on the call today are members of the media.
during our question-and-answer session, callers will be limited to one question in order to allow us to accommodate all those who would like to participate. i want to remind all listeners that fedex corporation desires to take advantage of our safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act. certain statements in this conference call, such as projections regarding future performance, may be considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of the act. such forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties, and other factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements.

raj subramaniam -- president and chief operating officer
thank you, mickey, and good afternoon, everybody. first and foremost, our thoughts are with those affected by the ongoing violence in ukraine. the safety of our team members in ukraine is our utmost priority, and we are providing them with financial assistance and various resources for support. we have suspended all services in ukraine, russia, and belarus.
additionally, we are helping to move relief to ukraine, and we have provided more than $1.5 million in humanitarian aid. turning to q3. execution of our strategies resulted in substantially higher operating income for the quarter as team fedex delivered yet another outstanding peak season. december 2021 was our most profitable december in fedex history.
our ability to handle the influx of packages was years in the making as we've taken deliberate steps to enhance our unparalleled network and support of customers large and small. we have fundamentally changed our performance as we handled increased e-commerce volume during peak and set a new precedent for peak seasons moving forward. having said that, we are laser focused on improving our margins. you'll hear us talk more about this today and then more specifically at our upcoming investor day.
even with the successful execution of peak, the new year brought new challenges, mostly driven by omicron. this affected our business in two ways: first, we experienced staffing shortages, particularly in our air operations. in january alone, the absentee rate of our crew due to omicron was over 15%, which caused significant flight disruptions. second, our customers experienced omicron-driven staffing shortages, which reduced demand for our services, especially in u.s.
domestic and european markets. both of those factors resulted in softer-than-expected volume levels, especially in january. we estimate the effect of omicron-driven volume softness in our q3 results was approximately $350 million. while it was significant, it was also temporary, and we have seen volume rebound from january levels.
even with these challenges, fedex express delivered strong adjusted operating income growth of 27% year over year. speaking of the express team, we announced that after nearly 40 years of distinguished service, don colleran, president and ceo of fedex express, will retire later this year and named richard smith, current executive vice president of global support and regional president of americas at fedex express, as a successor. we'll have much more to say about don and his countless contributions to the business during our call in june. fedex freight once again delivered strong results with third quarter operating income nearly tripling year over year, driven by a continued focus on revenue quality.
turning to fedex ground. operating costs continue to be challenged by the competitive labor environment now primarily manifesting in increased labor rates. we estimate the total impact of approximately $210 million at ground in the third quarter, which is significantly lower than what we saw in q1 and q2 as we have seen substantial improvement in labor availability post peak. with the stabilization in the labor environment, i'm pleased to share that we have successfully unwound network adjustments that were necessary to provide service but cost inefficiencies.
staffing levels and the rapid acceleration in labor costs have stabilized and our network is operating at normal levels. despite improvement in the labor headwind, volume levels in q3 were softer than we had previously forecasted, in part due to omicron surge slowing customer demand. as such, we expect our second half ground margins will be lower than our previous expectations and not reach double digits. over the years, fedex ground has built a strong foundation to serve b2b and small and medium customers with an unmatched value proposition.
as a result, we have grown market share in these segments and they remain strong priorities for the future. and then more than three years ago, we built upon this foundation and embarked on a strategy that positioned fedex squarely in the center of the fast-growing e-commerce market with a differentiated portfolio and a diversified customer base. this included a period of strategically investing in our network to meet growing market demand. let me note here that this strategy is different than what our primary competitor has pursued.
by building on our current base of business and making those prior investments in our network to facilitate growth, we are in a position to generate improved operating profit and margins. we saw this potential in our financial results for december prior to the surge of omicron. and moving forward, our financial performance will be further enhanced by maximizing existing assets, improving capital utilization, and leveraging technologies that facilitate optimization of our existing physical capacity and staffing. as we prepare to close fiscal year '22, permit me a moment to share what's on the horizon for fedex as we continue to focus on margin expansion and shareholder return.
in addition to the opportunity to enhance performance at ground that i just discussed, we have other levers for profitable growth, which include: number one, driving improved results in europe; number two, increasing collaboration and efficiency to optimize our networks, lower our cost to serve and enhance return on capital; and number three, unlocking new value through digital innovation. of course, we'll do this in an environment of strong revenue quality management. our international business, particularly europe, remains a big profit opportunity. air network integration remains on track for the end of the month to complete the physical integration of tnt into fedex express and enable full physical interoperability of these networks, both in the air and on the road.
paris cdg airport will serve as the main hub for all european and intercontinental flights. liege will connect specific large european markets and ensure we have the flexibility to scale our operations in response to market needs, thus enabling us to focus on international growth. our expanded collaboration across operating companies will utilize our air and ground networks in a smarter and more calculated manner. for example, fedex freight trucks have traveled more than 7 million miles while operating on behalf of fedex ground this fiscal year.
fedex freight has also provided fedex ground with intermodal containers, which have already been dispatched more than 36,000 times. we'll continue to comprehensively look at all our assets in our network to put the right package in the right network and the right cost to serve. additionally, we are unlocking value through digital innovation, our accelerated integration of data-driven technologies that will drive increased productivity in our linehaul and dock operations, as well as in the last mile. enhanced sortation technology will be operational at fedex ground in hundreds of facilities fired as we speak.
it will increase upstream efficiencies, enabling managers to do better balance and planned sortation operations, thereby unlocking key capacity. for example, during cyber week, this technology helped keep 1.9 million ground economy packages out of constrained sorts. we're also modernizing the planning and staffing of our dock operations, as well as the systems, training, and technology that maximizes productivity on every sort. one such example is a recently rolled out package handler scheduling technology that will help ensure the right staffing levels for every sort and every facility across the ground network.
this will improve dock productivity. and when combined with a focus on employee retention, it will enable us to significantly reduce the cost of turnover and strategically target recruiting spend when and where necessary. for last mile, we continue to improve upon the route optimization technology already implemented to enable service providers to make real-time decisions that enhance their business' daily efficiency. these ongoing investments in automation and technology have helped fedex build the most flexible and responsive network in the industry and will enable us to improve our margins.
in closing, we have the networks, the strategy, and the right team in place as we deliver financial returns and drive shareholder value for years to come. with that, let me turn it over to brie.
brie carere -- executive vice president and chief marketing and communications officer
thank you, raj. good afternoon, everyone. several macroeconomic forces, including the tragic conflict in ukraine, uncertainty around the pandemic, a tight labor market, supply chain disruptions, high energy prices, and inflationary pressure have dampened the current gdp outlook globally and for the united states. last week, we lowered our economic outlook.
u.s. gdp is now expected to increase 3.4% in calendar year 2022, revised down from 3.7%, and our outlook is 2.3% in calendar year 2023, with consumer spending tilting toward services and b2b growth supported by inventory rebuilding. global gdp growth is expected to be 3.5% in calendar year 2022, previously 4.1% and it will be 3.1% in calendar year 2023. growth will be driven by the release of pent-up demand for services while investment demand and inventory restocking support global manufacturing and trade.
given the tremendous fluidity of the macroeconomic environment, we will continue to update our outlook. our teams are ready to adjust plans, as required, to drive margin improvement despite the dynamic environment in which we operate. with fuel prices increasing around the world, today, we announced a fuel surcharge increase effective april 4 for fedex express, ground, and freight. additional details can be found on fedex.com.
the change in economic outlook does not change our confidence that e-commerce will continue to drive strong parcel market growth. we believe the e-commerce growth rate in the united states will be in the mid- to high single digits for the next three to four years. we will continue to build differentiated value propositions to achieve market-leading pricing in all our customer segments, including e-commerce, our small and medium customers and our commercial b2b business. we are very pleased with the results of our revenue quality strategy and know we have a great opportunity to increase the flow-through to margin expansion.
in the third quarter, revenue growth was 10% year over year, with double-digit yield improvement for fedex express and fedex freight, close behind with fedex ground at 9% year-over-year yield improvement. in the united states, our package revenue grew 9% in q3 on strong yield improvement of 10%. we executed on our peak pricing strategy in the month of december, delivering more than $250 million in peak surcharge revenue. softness in parcel volumes came predominantly from constraining fedex ground economy and the effects of omicron on both our network and on our customers.
the focus on revenue quality and profitable share growth drove outstanding results for fedex freight this quarter. for the quarter, revenue increased 23% year over year, driven by a 19% increase in revenue per shipment. additionally, fedex freight direct continues to gain great momentum as an e-commerce solution for heavy bulky items with phenomenal growth in q3 year over year. our international businesses are navigating a dynamic environment.
capacity constraints continue to be a reality. at this point, valet capacity on trans-atlantic passenger airlines is expected to recover faster than trans-pacific. passenger airline capacity is not expected to fully recover to pre-covid levels until 2024 or even later across our largest global trade lanes. scarce capacity on international lanes and strong demand out of asia is resulting in a continued favorable pricing environment.
with the completion of our integrated air network at the end of this month, we have one european air network and one road network in and out of europe. our international portfolio of services contains the best european road network, the broadest u.s. next-day coverage, and a combined parcel and freight offering that no one else in the market has. as a result of the integration, we will be able to offer improved transit times, earlier delivery, and later pickup services to more customers and more locations.
seven new countries will now be connected on a next-day basis within europe, while 14 countries will be expanding our noon delivery coverage. in several countries, this will be the first time we have introduced next-day service to the rest of europe. we will leverage the expanded european portfolio to improve international profitability, drive revenue growth and gain market share. in addition to the improvements in our european value proposition, we have made significant strides to enhance our digital solutions as well.
in january, we enhanced our tracking service based on an advanced machine learning and artificial intelligence model developed by fedex dataworks. this new experience delivers greater estimated delivery date accuracy, including updates for early or delayed shipments through all tracking channels. this improves both the shipper and the recipient experience, and it will reduce calls to customer service. additionally, our new modernized fedex ship manager, which is our online shipping application, has now been rolled out in more than 153 countries.
in january, we began introducing customers to it in the united states and canada. fedex ship manager is the primary shipping application for our small and medium customer segment. we believe a market-leading digital portfolio will enable fedex to continue to take market share in this very profitable segment. in summary, we remain optimistic about q4 and beyond, and we'll continue to deliver on our market-leading value proposition.
and with that, i'll turn it over to mike for his remarks.
mike lenz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thank you, brie, and good afternoon, everyone. after a strong start to the third quarter with the most profitable december in company history, january was significantly influenced by the rapid spread of the omicron variant and its negative effect on our operations and the macro environment. these challenges subsided during february, resulting in third quarter adjusted operating income of $1.5 billion, up 37% year over year on an adjusted basis. there are a number of factors influencing our third quarter results for both this year and last year that i will cover.
as raj explained the effects on our operations, i will give further context for the financial implications. first, labor market conditions, although much improved, once again had a significant effect on our results at an estimated $350 million year over year, which was primarily experienced at ground. for the third quarter, that was primarily due to higher rates for both purchase transportation and wages. labor availability-driven network inefficiencies were significantly less of a factor in the third quarter compared to earlier in the year.
the implications from the omicron variant surge reduced third quarter operating income by an estimated $350 million, predominantly at express, as it influenced customer demand and pressured our operations, resulting in constrained capacity, network disruptions and lower volumes and revenue. the third quarter had favorable year-over-year comparisons for variable compensation of approximately $380 million, including the one-time express hourly bonus last year and significantly less impactful winter weather that lead it to $310 million. with that overview of the consolidated results of the third quarter, i'll turn to the highlights for each of our transportation segments. ground reported a 10% increase in revenue year over year, with operating income down approximately $60 million and an operating margin at 7.3%.
while pressures from constrained labor markets began subsiding, the effect was still significant at an estimated $210 million year over year, predominantly due to the higher purchase transportation and wage rates. in addition, our volume was softer than expected due to the omicron variant surge slowing customer demand. a 9% yield improvement partially offset these headwinds, and our teams remain very focused on improving ground performance, as raj outlined earlier. express adjusted operating income increased by 27% year over year, driven by higher yields and a net fuel benefit, with adjusted operating margin increasing by 100 basis points to 5.8%.
express results also benefited in the third quarter from $285 million of lower variable compensation, as well as much less severe winter weather. the strong results were partially offset by the headwinds i mentioned earlier, with the omicron surge having the largest effect, especially during january, of an estimated $240 million. team member absences primarily among our pilot severely disrupted operations, requiring many flight cancellations and further constraining capacity. additionally, during this time, the omicron surge reduced customer demand in many parts of the world.
freight had another outstanding quarter, delivering an operating margin of 15%, 850 basis points higher year over year, and revenue for the third quarter increased 23% with operating income up over 180% despite the pressures from higher purchase transportation rates and wages. and for the first time in freight's history, they realized sequential operating income and operating margin improvement from the second quarter to the third quarter. this is all thanks to freight's continued focus on revenue quality and profitable share growth. turning to the balance sheet.
we ended our quarter with $6.1 billion in cash and are targeting over $3 billion in adjusted free cash flow for fiscal 2022. as i emphasized last quarter, our stronger cash flow provides extensive flexibility as we continue to focus on balanced capital allocation. as such, i'm pleased to share the accelerated share repurchase program announced last quarter was completed during q3 with 6.1 million shares delivered under the asr agreement. total repurchases during fiscal '22 are nearly 9 million shares or 3% of the shares outstanding at the beginning of the year.
the decrease in outstanding shares resulting from the asr benefited third quarter results by $0.06 per diluted share. also during the quarter, we made a $250 million, a voluntary contribution to our u.s. pension plan and have funded $500 million year to date. now turning to what's ahead.
we are affirming our full year adjusted eps range at $20.50 to $21.50. the operating and business environment uncertainty i mentioned in december did materialize to a greater degree than anticipated during q3, but we have navigated those challenges and project a solid finish to our fiscal year. labor-related network and efficiency effects have diminished and the wage rate component should become less of a headwind as we lap the onset of labor rate increases in the fourth quarter. lastly, variable compensation expense will be a tailwind as it was in q3.
turning to capital spending. we have lowered our fy '22 capital-spending forecast from $7.2 billion to $7 billion. much of the change is driven by extended timelines resulting from supply chain considerations. while we are still developing our fy '23 plans, our focus remains on lowering our capital intensity while investing in strategic initiatives to drive returns.
we are highly focused on ensuring our capital investments generate returns to drive further growth in earnings and cash flows. lastly, our projection for the full year effective tax rate is now 22% to 23%, prior to the mark-to-market retirement plan adjustments. while we are confident in our ability to deliver a strong fourth quarter, uncertainty remains across many fronts, including additional pandemic developments, the labor market, inflation, high energy prices and further geopolitical risk, and the potential effects on the pace and timing of global economic activity. we continue to monitor these trends and adjust accordingly.
with that, we are all very much looking forward to sharing additional background in our upcoming investor meeting on june 28 and 29 in memphis. mickey and the investor relations team will soon provide specifics on logistics, and now we will be happy to address your questions.

thank you. [operator instructions] our first question comes from amit mehrotra with deutsche bank.
amit mehrotra -- deutsche bank -- analyst
hey. thanks, everyone. appreciate the question. i wanted to ask about ground margins, if you can just talk about where you expect ground margins to be in fiscal '22? and henry, this is maybe a longer-term question for you.
i mean, if i look at the ground number since 2013, ground revenues are up $17 billion since 2013 but the profits in ground are up only $400 million, which implies a contribution margin of only 2.5%. so can you just talk about the plan to reverse this long-term trend? it seems like for the first time in a while, you guys are ready to present a long-term plan to improve the cadence in the ground margins. wondering if you could a little bit more meat around that. where -- what the levers are going to be to reverse this long-term trend? and maybe give us some goalposts around that way as it relates to fiscal -- the next fiscal year, which is coming up pretty soon.
thank you very much.

amit, thank you for the question. let me address it broadly and then mike can talk about specifics on this. firstly, we are laser-focused on improving our financial performance at fedex ground. let me start with firstly, the ceo of fedex ground is john smith, and he was at the stage for tremendous performance at fedex freight before he left and we're seeing the benefit of that.
that's the reason that he's there. so we expect that john and his team will drive this performance going forward. but let me also give you just a context of where we are on ground. we, first of all, manage fedex enterprise as a portfolio of different operating companies, and we made a specific decision to invest in capacity and double down on e-commerce three years ago.
we saw -- we were skating to where the puck was going to be and seeing where the market was going. if you look at the history of fedex ground, from the very beginning, starting of the acquisition of rps, when we launched home delivery and now we doubled down in e-commerce, there are periods of time we had to invest. and we were working with our customers and retailers for them to succeed in e-commerce and it is a strategic relationship that we're building. so that period of investment, in many ways, is behind us.
that pace is behind us. now we are focused on getting revenue quality, making sure we put the right package in the right network and making sure that we generate margins and growth going forward. we'll talk about this in more detail when we see you all in june, but that's -- clearly, that's what we're focused on right now. mike?
mike lenz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
no, amit, the only thing i would add is you -- i think there was a question in there about fy '22. i would say certainly, for the guidance that we have, our consolidated operating margins will increase in q4. i'm not going to get into specific segment projections, but it is certainly the case that sequentially, ground margins are typically higher in q4 than in q3, and we would have that expectation this year as well.
operator
we'll take our next question from jack atkins with stephens.
jack atkins -- stephens inc. -- analyst
ok, great. so just another one on ground. i think we've had three quarters in a row where cost inflation at ground has pretty significantly outstripped your ability to -- has outstripped your revenue per package and yield growth. how confident are you that you're in a position to drive cost per package ahead -- excuse me, revenue per package ahead of cost per package as we look forward, especially with rising inflationary pressures that we're seeing across the economy, and i'm sure you're seeing it in your business as well? thank you.
raj subramaniam -- president and chief operating officer
thank you, jack. i think we have had two particular issues regarding labor. i actually embarked on this journey. obviously, that was -- what we saw in the last year was surprising in that sense and we had two things.
one was because of lack of labor availability, we were inefficient in moving some of the packages; and secondly, just the cost of labor going up. we have unwound the inefficiencies. the network is back to normal. but obviously, we have, now in our numbers, we have the year-over-year growth on labor rates.
and so we are -- we have dealt with it head on. it's now in our numbers, and i think it gives us a competitive advantage as we look in the future. revenue quality management is a big area of focus for us. our peak in december gave us a flavor of what we can expect in terms of our financial performance going forward.
and we are confident that we can -- we are able to manage this going forward. we have a certain spike in fiscal year '22 that was unnatural, but it's just -- we set the stage for future earnings growth, both revenue and top and bottom line. i don't know, brie, you want to add anything more on revenue quality?
brie carere -- executive vice president and chief marketing and communications officer
no, we're -- obviously, we have done a tremendous job. we talked about the 9% yield improvement from fedex ground this past quarter. as i've mentioned, we have repriced about 50% of our large customer, meaning customer contracts so we still have some opportunity that we have to continue that repricing. and so we are clear-eyed about the inflationary environment that we are operating in, and we know that we need to stay ahead of it.
so you can anticipate that as we head into next year's business plan and all of our discussions with customers, that you will continue to see a high yield improvement across all segments because it will be required to stay ahead of the environment we're operating in right now.
raj subramaniam -- president and chief operating officer
jack, if i can say one other thing. we have a revenue management committee that meets every week. it is even more important now because of the inflationary environment. and the operations teams and the commercial teams are locked in, and we make decisions very, very dynamically and very, very quickly to deal with this.
operator
and we'll take our next question from tom wadewitz with ubs.
tom wadewitz -- ubs -- analyst
yes. good afternoon. wanted to see if you could offer some thoughts on the consumer. i think, brie, maybe you had, raj, you had some comments about risks or mike.
but have you seen any signs that the consumer is -- i know omicron caused noise but just the consumer weakening, have you seen that recently in the u.s.? and how do you think about the importance of consumer and goods buying when you look at the ground business? if you have a weaker consumer, does that just make it tougher to make that algorithm on ground margin improvement work? so really just wanted to get your thoughts on consumer and near term and also outlook. thank you.
raj subramaniam -- president and chief operating officer
hey, tom, thank you for that question, especially as the inflation has picked up and there's obviously consumer spending in february is already down. it's difficult to forecast this environment, but i'm going to tell you that the big period of growth of e-commerce is now behind us, and we are planning -- in that perspective, we are confident, even with the mid-single-digit growth to -- mid- to high single-digit growth that brie was talking about on e-commerce, that we are able to generate positive returns going forward. so we are not counting on huge consumer spend in our numbers. brie?
brie carere -- executive vice president and chief marketing and communications officer
yeah, i would agree with that completely. as we talked about, we already have modified our economic outlook from a market forecast perspective. a couple of things: one, for this calendar year, we do expect b2b parcel market growth to be actually relatively healthy at 3%. normally, it's in around 2% in our market and that's for this year, we still see a lot of inventory replenishment.
we also see strong requirements coming in from asia, as i mentioned earlier. there's still just a backlog there, quite frankly. so the b2b is still going to be healthy for the year. from a b2c perspective, we have modified our long-term outlook.
we're now projecting about 8.3% cagr in an e-commerce market, that's to calendar year 2026. so historically, over the last couple of years, we had actually projected above 10%. so yes, we think consumer demand will be down. it is already, quite frankly, in our outlook for q4.
and as we look forward for next year, we think we can continue to take market share and have some profitable growth despite sort of a softer economic outlook.
operator
we'll take our next question from jordan alliger with goldman sachs.
jordan alliger -- goldman sachs -- analyst
yeah. hi, afternoon. just curious, you mentioned, i think, that the staffing and labor-related costs for the company was $350 million in the most recent quarter. how does that look in the fiscal fourth quarter direction-wise? and then same thing, ground, i think, you said was $210 million as it's $350 million.
how do you think that sits as we get to fiscal -- through fiscal fourth quarter? thanks.
mike lenz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
hey, jordan, this is mike. look, so we went from like roughly $470 million in q2, $350 million this quarter. i mean, i would put it in order of magnitude around $100 million or so based on what we are seeing here today. that's, again, principally the wage rate element of it, which really began to manifest in the may time frame essentially, april, may time frame.
operator
and our next question comes from chris wetherbee with citi.
chris wetherbee -- citi -- analyst
it is great. thanks. good afternoon. quick clarification then another question on ground.
just making sure i understand, raj, i think you said you wouldn't hit double digits on ground margins for mix or i heard that the average for the back half of the year, so i guess, we won't see expansion in the fourth quarter. and then maybe taking a step back in terms of the isp model on the ground side. just kind of curious, in this type of inflationary environment, do you see pressure? does it kind of go back and maybe you open up contracts and do things differently with that piece of the business? is that something that we need to think about beyond this year out into next year and beyond if inflationary pressures keep up? or it's the kind of thing that would just sort of be normal course as we move forward. thank you.
raj subramaniam -- president and chief operating officer
thank you, chris. i'll let mike answer the first question in a minute. but on the entrepreneurial business model with our contractors is a win-win scenario. it provides us the flexibility.
as the market dynamics change, we remain committed to collaborating with those service providers and enable that when the lines of communication are open. so yes, we will work closely hand in hand to make sure that we are successful for fedex and our contractors going forward.
mike lenz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
but, chris, nothing from what i said prior where we have consolidated operating margins. will be up in q4 and the ground q4 margin sequentially would be higher than q3. but not going to go past in terms of the specific segment quarterly margin projections.
operator
we'll take our next question from duane pfennigwerth with evercore isi.
duane pfennigwerth -- evercore isi -- analyst
hey, thanks for taking the question. i wonder if you could comment on -- you gave us the impact to ebit. i wonder if you could comment qualitatively on the impact relative to volume growth from omicron in express and ground. and to what extent you've seen those volumes and advs accelerate and pick back up?
brie carere -- executive vice president and chief marketing and communications officer
sure, happy to. great question. when we look at the volume in q3, we really have to break it down by month. so from a december perspective, we actually saw softer than anticipated volume for a couple of reasons.
the first was fedex ground economy. we have been constraining that product to make sure we get the revenue quality that we require for the network. the second was, we were absolutely focused on service and make sure that we had volume in the right places within the network. and then third was that we also saw a huge pull forward in early in november.
both retailers and, of course, the carriers were really pushing to get volume moving earlier in the peak season and actually it was quite successful. so overall, december was softer than anticipated for those three reasons. and when we got into january, we obviously saw a significant impact in volume in the express network here in the united states but also in europe. and then we did see some impact in january at fedex ground, but also we did have the fedex ground economy constrained growth impacts january because as you can imagine, the ground economy product is heavily used for returns as well.
so that was what was going on in december. in january, you saw omicron but you also saw those other impacts in december and january. and then we got to february, we actually saw a rebound. so as raj mentioned in his opening remarks, we actually saw quite a dramatic recovery from a volume perspective relative to january.
and so that's sort of where we're at from a volume perspective.
operator
our next question comes from scott group with wolfe research.
scott group -- wolfe research -- analyst
hey. thanks. afternoon, guys. so mike, you've got a big range of earnings guidance for the year, one quarter left.
any thoughts on directionally where you think we should be shaking out well to that range? and then i'll ask another on ground margins. you guys operating, give or take, at an 8% margin. ups is on its way to 12%. you guys used to be better.
is this structural? is there a reason you can't get to those kinds of levels? and then any thoughts on this ground contractor lawsuit? thank you.
mike lenz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
all right, scott. first is mike, talking about the range. look, certainly, it is the case that relative to where we were three months ago in a little different place in the range as the uncertainties manifested in a greater magnitude than we had anticipated. but i think we're quite proud of the fact that our guidance remains where we started the year at.
and look, if you had told me at that time, we would have the most dramatic labor market shift in generations, as well as another phase of the pandemic that resulted in case counts in the u.s. and europe higher than any previous waves, we undoubtedly would have had a significantly wider range. so we feel that it is a great accomplishment of the team to be where we are with this. lots of moving pieces and things change along the way within the scope and scale of what this enterprise is.
and so we're looking forward to a strong finish to the fiscal year.
raj subramaniam -- president and chief operating officer
well, let me just say big kudos to our cfo on setting the range in the beginning of the fiscal year and all the things that have happened in the middle and we're still the same range. so i mean, that's terrific. i don't -- i've already talked to you about what our dealings with our contractors and it's a win-win situation. and we will continue to work that.
the lines of communication are open. i've spoken to john several times, and he's directly in touch with his team. and as far as our upside for fedex ground, yes, we have upside. we know that and we are laser focused on that.
and again, john is the right person to lead that team to get there as well. thank you.
operator
our next question comes from allison poliniak with wells fargo.
allison poliniak -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
hi. good evening. i just want to go to the levers of growth. you talked about collaboration, increasing that collaboration to optimize the network, understanding it's early innings there.
just any color on the productivity you're seeing from some of those efforts? and then maybe, as well as the potential chokepoints that you're seeing that might need to be addressed before that could accelerate further. just any color. thanks.
raj subramaniam -- president and chief operating officer
yeah, allison, thank you for that question. clearly, as we -- the e-commerce market has grown. and in both our networks, there is now opportunity to optimize the very definite traffic between the two networks. and so we're clearly doing that.
but we are, as you call it, in the early innings. we have -- there's a lot of work to be done, and we'll share that with you when you're all here in person in june. but the opportunity also is quite big. we're already moving in this direction and we will continue to make strides here.
now in this context, please don't forget what fedex freight is doing in this regard and especially working with both ground and express and over time with international. and so we will clearly focus on trying to -- making sure that they put the right package in the right network at the right price. and again, we'll share more details with you in june.
operator
our next question comes from brandon oglenski with barclays.
brandon oglenski -- barclays -- analyst
hey, good afternoon and thanks for taking the question. raj, since the rest of the management team is not on this call, maybe you can give us some insight into the appointment of richard at express. what was the process therefore electing the next leader? and then what do you hope to get out of the leadership change in that large division? thank you.
raj subramaniam -- president and chief operating officer
thank you, brandon. of course, we have a very set succession planning process where don was in this role for three years. i knew that was going to be a finite time period of time. and so we were already working on the succession planning very carefully, as we have done so with john in fedex ground, with in fedex freight.
similarly, we have a process going on with express. we've divided it into three groups, three mega-regions with americas, asia, and europe. and richard is leading the americas region. he was responsible for the vaccine distribution and also in the planning of our global network in this very interesting time that we've been through.
so we are very confident that richard is going to take the organization to the next level. don has done a fantastic job of creating a unified culture and getting the right players in place. we have a great bench, and this is going to be terrific. thank you.
operator
we'll take our next question from bascome majors with susquehanna.
bascome majors -- susquehanna international group -- analyst
yeah. good evening. you took down the midpoint of your multiyear restructuring spend in europe but didn't change the benefit you expect to get from that. can you talk a little bit about what drove that update in your expectations, and what the next steps could be in the europe profit improvement plan as you get right at the point of discussing that with investors maybe next year? thanks.
mike lenz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
sure, bascome. this is mike. so first, yes, we did narrow the range of the expected cost of that program as we have moved through the process. and as you've noted, the -- we've talked about the charges as we recognize them there.
the benefits range is unchanged, and so we felt it was appropriate as we were further down the process just to simply narrow the range of that. so that was it. a lot of things going forward as it relates to tnt beyond that, so i'll have raj elaborate a bit on some upcoming events, too.
raj subramaniam -- president and chief operating officer
yeah. so bascome, thank you for the question there. i think it's -- the end of this month, it's a very important date for us as we complete the physical integration. europe remains a big profit opportunity for us going forward.
just to put it in perspective, today, we -- fedex operates 350 flights a week, serving 42 airports and tnt operates 600 flights serving 59 airports. by combining, we're going to reduce the total flights to 825, but we extend our reach to serve 72 airports. so fewer flights, more airports, and oh by the way, because there are just extended off-time, so the value proposition gets better. so that happens right away in april.
the logic behind our acquisition of tnt remains sound. we are closing a portfolio gap because we did not have an intra-european deferred service and now we do. with this, we can also now serve europe in and out on a lower cost structure. and we also launched priority timed options.
we have noon and end-of-day service and it gives us flexibility. so a lot of things going on as we -- mike already talked to you about the back-office savings there. the cdg hub, 70,000 pieces per hour. i was there two, three months ago and billed back there in may again.
there was something to behold. and so it's going to be -- we are confident here that this now sets the stage for our improved performance in europe from here on out. thank you so much.
operator
our next question comes from brian ossenbeck with j.p. morgan. your line is open, and we are unable to hear you. please check your mute function.
we'll move on to our next question from helane becker with cowen and company.
helane becker -- cowen and company -- analyst
thanks very much, operator. hi, everybody. i just have two questions. one is, when you say that you're taking share, i think brie mentioned that, can you just be a little more specific about where that share shift is coming either in verticals or geographically? and then my other question is with respect to your facilities.
can you just talk a little bit about the use of robotics and automation that lower -- potentially could lower labor costs. thank you.
brie carere -- executive vice president and chief marketing and communications officer
sure. happy to talk about our targeted revenue growth strategy. so from a market share perspective, our goal here is to take share strategically in the segments that value our network. and as we've talked about over the last year or two, we've made some pretty significant enhancements in our network and our value proposition, some of which i covered earlier.
from a small business perspective, we have taken share over the last several years consistently. and this year, we actually have seen our small business segment grew faster than our large customer segment. so we're really pleased with that. when we compare ourselves to our primary competitor, i still have share upside in both b2b, as well as in e-commerce.
and as i mentioned, we are very disciplined and very focused on our small business acquisition strategy. we're doing some things very differently. we are acquiring them direct. what do i mean? we're not going on mass through platforms.
we're being very selective with the platform partners that we are choosing because we want to have that direct relationship with the small customer. we have a fantastic loyalty program that no one else in the market has. we are strategically using earned discount to bundle our parcel in our ltl portfolio, which of course, our primary competitor can no longer do. so from a small business perspective, historically, we've taken share this year.
i've seen small business grow faster than large. and i'm talking predominantly here in the united states, although i will tell you that both europe and emea are rolling out a very similar playbook. we're very optimistic about our share opportunity there as well. additionally, we saw apac or our emea region take share and we're very pleased with that as well.
they've been very focused and we see strong momentum out of asia, as well as out of europe in e-commerce -- intercontinental e-commerce. the premium piece of that market is a share opportunity, those that pay for the value proposition there. from a europe perspective, we have not been as successful from a share perspective, but we could not be more excited about what raj just covered. this physical integration allows us to unleash just an incredible value proposition.
we've got some brand awareness, work to do still, but i'm very optimistic that you're going to see some real momentum in europe next year. so i hope that answers your question, but happy to answer any other details you need.
raj subramaniam -- president and chief operating officer
let me take this opportunity to give a shout-out to our commercial teams because they've done really a remarkable job of growing share and managing revenue quality and we'll continue to do that. on the robotics front, it's a very important question, helane. and i think especially in the last year or so, the field of robotics itself has actually changed because -- with ai and ml coming to the picture, there's significant developments in the robotics field. so we think it's a huge opportunity for us.
and again, we already -- if you look at some of the facilities that we have in ground, a lot of facilities are now automated. but we can move further here. we are obviously working on several processes inside the hubs and to involve robotics and also working with partners and on autonomous vehicles. we have fedex roxo for same-day delivery on demand, and we have partners like nuro and also over the road.
so a lot of effort in this direction because it's very strategic and could have big implications in the years to come. so again, thanks for the question.
mike lenz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. helane, this is mike. it's unquestionably the case to amplify the point raj made that you're seeing tremendous amount of capital coming into the robotics space as a result of the labor market constraints that have been experienced worldwide. so that's really an opportunity.
and certainly, when you are here to visit here in a few months, you'll get the opportunity to see, within our facilities, how that really works because that is where the bulk of the labor is deployed as the loading and unloading of the trailers there, particularly in the ground facilities, given the investments we've made in automating all the sortation in that. so a very relevant point to raise.
operator
our next question comes from jeff kauffman with vertical research partners.
jeff kauffman -- vertical research partners -- analyst
thank you very much. i'd like to get back to the question on the improvement that you were seeing and marked throughout the network. obviously, the global supply demand equation has changed a lot with the recent events in eastern europe. so i think earlier, you were giving us a view more of the omicron impact on domestic express.
could you talk a little bit about what's going on globally as you move from february into march? i know omicron impacted europe, you mentioned. and now we've got a new version of covid in asia. what does the step-up look like on the international side? and how have the events in eastern europe affected global capacity?
raj subramaniam -- president and chief operating officer
well, let me start and i'm sure brie will clean me up here. firstly, it's kind of almost funny that omicron is almost a thing in memory even though it was ravaging just a couple of months ago but is now behind us in that sense. and we have other bigger things now to deal with. the conflict in europe was really tragic.
first ground war like that in many, many years. and -- but the impact on the economy is something that we have to see. i think it starts with the cost of fuel. as the fuel cost goes up around the world, inflation goes up and then because of that, the potential economic slowdown.
how long this lasts is anybody's guess. i'm not going to project that forward. so we will have to be very flexible and nimble in dealing with that situation. we're watching the china situation carefully.
our operations are close to normal as we speak. and the demand is still very strong. but again, this is a very dynamic situation. and we have more than 10% of our employees in a closed loop system today, working -- i mean, just amazing job by our team in keeping our operations going.
so this is something that's very fluid in nature and we got to watch as we go along. i don't know, brie, if you got anything more?
brie carere -- executive vice president and chief marketing and communications officer
no, not a whole lot more to add. as i've mentioned, global commercial capacity is still constrained. and as a result, right now, we have not seen an impact despite the high inflationary environment as we talked about some of the risks we see from a consumer perspective. out of asia, demand seems pretty high because of the current commercial capacity constraint, but also, as i mentioned, because inventory levels are still so low.
so right now, demand looks good coming out of asia. we're keeping an eye on the united states, as well as in europe. right now, from a europe perspective, we believe we still have some opportunities, as i talked about, to take share and that's our intent. so right now, we're feeling pretty good.
but as raj talked about, things can change and we will adapt as required to do so.
operator
next question comes from scott schneeberger with oppenheimer.
scott schneeberger -- oppenheimer and company -- analyst
thanks very much. just a clarification kind of on that last question. you discussed some of the russian conflict, some indirect collateral issues. could you please just give us a bit of a size of how much business russia and eastern europe represents to you? and then just switching gears.
could you talk about sustainability of freight margins? obviously, you have been very strong for a long time now and look like it continues to have momentum. should we continue to expect in the mid-teens or is that something that you would expect to change as we move through the rest of the calendar year? thanks.
raj subramaniam -- president and chief operating officer
thank you, scott. i think if i got the first question right, i think the -- if you're specifically talking about the three markets, ukraine, russia, and belarus, the profit impact for that is not material. so that -- if you have another question, i'm happy to take it. on the fedex freight, i'm just delighted with the progress that we have made there.
we have made -- it's been years in the making, so to speak. we are focused heavily on revenue quality management and operational efficiency. and also again, let me make this point, fedex freight is doing a remarkable job in stepping up and helping other operating companies as needed. i think this is a winning formula and that we expect that to continue.

good day, everyone, and welcome to the fedex corporation fourth quarter fiscal year 2022 earnings conference call. today's call is being recorded. at this time, i'd like to turn the call over to mickey foster, vice president of investor relations for fedex corporation. please go ahead.
mickey foster -- vice president, investor relations
good afternoon, and welcome to fedex corporation's fourth quarter earnings conference call. the fourth quarter earnings release and stat book are on our website at fedex.com. this call is being streamed from our website where the replay will be available for about one year. joining us on the call today are members of the media.

raj subramaniam -- president and chief operating officer
thank you, mickey, and good afternoon, everyone. i'd like to start by thanking team fedex for continuing to move the world forward amid unanticipated challenges. this was recently displayed during operation fly formula, where, in response to the critical shortage rippling across the united states, we have moved hundreds of thousands of pounds of baby formula from europe to the u.s. and this weekend, our team will move 52 tons of medical relief to poland for ukrainian refugees in coordination with direct relief international.
now, turning to our financials. i'm proud to share that in the face of an increasingly challenging global backdrop, we finished fiscal '22 with our highest-ever revenue of $93.5 billion and adjusted operating income of $6.9 billion, both up 11% year over year. this is a testament to our value proposition and continued execution against our long-term strategy. as i shared on the last call, we have worked through many network inefficiencies caused by labor shortages.
although wage rates remain higher than this time last year, they are stabilizing. still, covid-related conditions slowed global recovery and pressured second half performance. while q4 volumes were down year over year at all our transportation segments compared to an extraordinary fiscal year '21, we successfully implemented strategic actions that drove double-digit yield improvement across the board, with express composite yield per package up 20%, ground up 11% and freight yield per shipment up 28%. we remain focused on revenue quality as one of the key levers to help offset the ongoing macroeconomic pressures and driving improved margins going forward.
turning to express. even in the face of higher operating expenses related to inflationary pressures, we delivered improved quarterly operating income and revenue. thoughtful execution of our new revenue management actions has allowed us to overcome headwinds from covid lockdowns in asia and geopolitical uncertainty in europe. at fedex ground, we experienced modest revenue growth driven by higher yields as a result of pricing actions and improved volume mix.
volumes declined year over year due to our efforts to constrain economy volume as well as lower customer demand. we will continue to leverage opportunities to maximize utilization of existing facilities through operational adjustments, including multiple pre-load and relay operations. ground operating expenses continued to be pressured by higher purchase transportation and wage rates, although we see these pressures stabilizing. we continue to proactively address labor availability head on through multiple levers as we increase the frontline retention and refined the recently launched package handler scheduling tool, will not only ensure we have the right level of staffing for every sort based on volume, will ensure a workforce that is safe, efficient and highly engaged to stay and grow with the company.
additionally, we are implementing several technology-based initiatives that are driving increased productivity in our line haul and dock operations as well as continuing our efforts to optimize the last mile. we're seeing early benefit from these efforts, with productivity of ground dock operations improving 6% in q4 compared to q3. fedex freight once again delivered outstanding results with fourth quarter operating margin of almost 22% driven by a continued focus on revenue quality. a job well done to lance moll on his first full fiscal year as freight ceo and to our freight and commercial teams for their solid execution.
as we look ahead to fiscal year '23, we expect the macroeconomic risks both in the u.s. and globally to continue to put stress on supply chains and trade. brie will cover this in more detail shortly. let me now reaffirm confidence in our key strategies.
as ceo, my focus is maximizing total shareholder return driven by improved revenue quality, higher margins and a balanced capital allocation strategy, which mike will provide more color on shortly. importantly, our foundational long-term investments have set the stage one of the strong year, driven by focus on lowering our cost to serve. a great example of where we are going to lower our cost to serve is in europe. the integrated network and consolidation of many flights into our charles de gaulle hub allows us to improve operational efficiency and enhances our network.
for instance, since april, the number of european airports we service from cdg increased by 71%, but the number of flights intra-europe was reduced by 13%. we're confident that actions like this will drive bottom line improvement in fiscal year '23. as we move forward, i'm honored to lead our global team who enable fedex to deliver what's next. and speaking of what's next, we are looking forward to hosting our investors in memphis in a few days.
our goal for this two-day event is for attendees to leave with a deep understanding of our strategies, including financial targets and priorities and how we plan to execute. now, before i turn it over to brie, i'd like to say a few words about fedex express' president and ceo, don colleran, whose 40-year career with fedex has been nothing but short of exceptional. as one of the pioneers of our international business, he helped lay a foundation for the significant growth in that sector of the fedex portfolio. since assuming his current role in 2019, he's launched new capabilities for our customers and led our global fedex express team through some of the most challenging times, including the covid pandemic.
as announced in march, don will move into ceo executive advisor role in september of this year in support of richard smith's transition to the ceo of fedex express and will retire from fedex in december. don, we appreciate your service and countless contributions to this company. we wish you nothing but the best in your well-deserved next chapter. and now let me turn it over to brie, who last week was named chief customer officer in a move that aligns several teams under her leadership to give us even greater focus on our commercial strategy and our end-to-end customer experience.
so brie.
brie carere -- executive vice president and chief marketing and communications officer
thank you, raj. it's an honor and a privilege to take on this responsibility to deliver for our customers and drive quality growth for our shareholders. i'd like to reflect on fiscal year '22, then drill down to fourth quarter '22 revenues. finally, i will discuss the outlook for fiscal year 2023.
fiscal year 2022 was another year of change for fedex. the operating environment was quite challenging, requiring flexibility and creativity on the part of our management, staff and front-line team members to ensure we deliver for our customers. i am proud of how our team rose to this challenge. we executed against our commercial strategy and remained intently focused on revenue quality across the business.
in the fourth quarter, our consolidated revenue increased 8% year over year. revenue management actions drove our growth, which was partially offset by lower shipment demand. fedex ground and fedex express generated year-over-year revenue growth of 4% and 6%, respectively, despite lower volume levels. at fedex ground, yield management actions affecting our fedex ground economy service is the primary factor behind volume declines, with fedex ground economy volumes down 36%.
in contrast, our commercial and our home delivery volumes declined 1% due to macroeconomic conditions. at fedex express, covid lockdowns, geopolitical uncertainty and slower economic growth contributed to package volume decline of 11%. in some areas, we also selectively reduced volume to ensure we could deliver the service that is expected of fedex. fedex freight had a banner revenue quality quarter, growing yield of 28%.
fedex freight's market-leading value proposition, combined with the disciplined execution of our sales team, drove these exceptional results. the fedex freight team continues to do a phenomenal job at managing revenue quality. now, let me take a moment to discuss 2023. we anticipate consumers will keep spending, and their spending will continue tilting toward services from goods.
we expect more consumers to return to stores. with this backdrop, we do expect pressure on b2c volumes. through may, industrial activity has been solid. but today's june flash of pmi was a sharp decline.
further, after a strong build late last year and early this year, inventory restocking is slowing. this will dampen freight demand. our international businesses continue to navigate a dynamic environment. global trade growth has slowed from disruptions related to lockdowns in china and the conflict in ukraine, limiting the flow of goods and reducing international export volumes.
we do anticipate supply chain disruptions throughout the fiscal year. we continue to expect passenger airlines to fully recover to pre-covid levels, and that, that recovery will take some time. belly capacity on passenger airlines is expected to remain constrained in fiscal year 2023, resulting in a pricing environment still favorable to fedex if a little less than before. the europe to asia lane is estimated to recover in q1 calendar year '24, and belly capacity on trans-pacific airlines is estimated to recover in q3 calendar year '24.
commercial capacity between europe and asia is not expected to recover until q1 of calendar year 2025. our fiscal '23 forecast assumes a normalized economic environment. the factors i discussed earlier have been incorporated into our volume forecast. our volume forecast has low single-digit volume growth.
we've also prepared plans to manage through a slowing economic environment, if required. we will take costs and revenue actions to mitigate impact of further economic softening, incorporating the lessons learned over the last two extraordinary years. in fiscal '23, we will execute a very targeted growth strategy. we will prioritize revenue quality and our intent on pursuing business that provides attractive yields on our assets.
we expect the pricing environment will remain rational here in the united states and also around the world. we believe that the systemic changes, especially e-commerce peak surcharges, are durable changes for the industry. we are closely monitoring both inflation and fuel prices. and as a reminder, we adjust our fuel surcharge weekly in response to market rates.
i am confident we have the tools to continue getting inflation plus pricing. strong revenue quality is possible because we will target customers who value fedex's unique capabilities. let me talk about four of our favorite capabilities. first, we're the only provider to bundle our parcel and ltl portfolio.
second, fedex ground has two very significant advantages over our primary competitor. fedex ground is faster to more locations than ups ground, and fedex ground delivers on sunday while ups does not. third, we continue to evolve our digital portfolio. express and ground are the first nationwide carriers to announce we will provide a picture proof of delivery for every u.s.
residential delivery that doesn't require a signature. and fourth, we have a robust intercontinental offering for both b2b and b2b segments. fedex provides fabulous solutions for the world's manufacturing, healthcare, high-tech and e-commerce customers. in closing, this has been an extraordinary year for fedex.
we generated strong growth, executed on our revenue quality strategy and overcame industrywide challenges. our plan for fiscal '23 incorporates a dynamic environment, and we have the right strategies and the right team in place to deliver profitable growth and margin improvement. and with that, i'll turn it over to mike for his remarks.
mike lenz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thank you, brie, and good afternoon, everyone. we had a strong fourth quarter, with adjusted earnings per share improving 37% year over year, revenue increasing 8% and consolidated adjusted operating margin expanding 50 basis points to 9.2%. these results reflect the outcome of the revenue management emphasis brie described as we aggressively adjust to mitigate continued inflationary cost pressures. notable fourth quarter year-over-year expense items included higher self-insurance costs, primarily at ground, as well as a roughly $130 million impact from higher rates for both wages and purchased transportation.
offsetting these headwinds were favorable year-over-year comparisons for variable compensation of approximately $300 million and last year's $100 million contribution to yale university to support our carbon neutrality goals. with that overview of consolidated results, i'll turn to the highlights for each of our transportation segments. ground reported a 4% increase in revenue with operating income down approximately $260 million, resulting in an operating margin of 10%. self-insurance expense increased approximately $200 million, reflecting a higher loss experience as well as an adjustment to the reserve for the projected cost of claims.
we have multiple initiatives underway to mitigate the cost of risk, including new vehicle safety technology and driver certification standards in our service provider agreements. the strong 11% yield improvement at ground was not enough to offset that headwind, along with higher cost of wages and purchased transportation. looking forward, the continued revenue quality emphasis in conjunction with specific productivity and workforce initiatives will drive improved profitability. stabilization of the labor market will also support further traction in these areas.
at express, adjusted operating income increased by nearly 10% year over year, with operating margin improving by 20 basis points to 8.2%. this improvement was driven by higher yields, including the favorable net impact of fuel and lower variable compensation, which more than offset volume declines. in addition, crew cost per flight hour have been further elevated as operating the network has had to accommodate not only covid protocols, but also to the routing changes to avoid layovers and locations with stricter covid regulations as well as conflict airspace. freight had an incredible finish to the year, with revenue for the fourth quarter increasing 23% and operating profit growing 67%.
these outstanding results are a testimony to freight's continued focus on revenue quality and profitable share growth as we build on our strengths as the leader in the ltl market. turning to fy '23. we are projecting continued momentum with a range of 9% to 19% adjusted earnings per share improvement. we expect margin expansion at all of our transportation segments on an adjusted basis as we execute on key priorities, including enhanced revenue quality beyond inflation, technology-driven operational efficiency improvements and increasing utilization of our assets.
as we begin fiscal 2023, we are seeing the lower customer demand trends we experienced in the fourth quarter continue into june and expect first quarter volumes will continue to be pressured. in addition, express continues to experience flight constraints due to crew covid protocols, as has been highlighted industrywide. we do expect both express air network efficiency and year-over-year volume comparisons across all of our transportation segments to strengthen as we go through the fiscal year. in addition, our outlook includes an approximately $450 million noncash pension headwind due to lower asset returns realized in fiscal 2022.
this is all below the line expense that will be recognized evenly over the year. our retirement plan's operating expense will be relatively flat as lower pension expense will be offset by higher 401(k) expense. and as a reminder, our primary u.s. pension plans were closed to new entrants beginning in 2020, and we introduced a new 401(k) plan with a higher company match in january of 2022.
our projection for the full year effective tax rate is approximately 24% prior to the mark-to-market retirement plan adjustments and costs related to business optimization initiatives. turning to capital allocation. our fiscal 2022 adjusted free cash flow of $3.6 billion supported the repurchase of approximately $2.2 billion of our stock and $800 million of dividend payments. in addition, we funded $500 million in voluntary pension contributions and ended the year with a solid $6.9 billion in cash.
as we look to fiscal 2023, we remain focused on driving total shareholder return and thoughtfully allocating capital. first, we will continue to invest in attractive roic initiatives. fiscal 2023 capital expenditures are projected to be roughly the same as the $6.8 billion invested during fiscal '22, which came in lower than our initial $7.2 billion estimate as supply chain considerations extended timelines. facility investment at ground will decline as well aircraft expenditures at express.
offsetting that is increased investment in vehicle replacement, including rollout of our vehicle electrification initiatives as well as additional automation projects. we project fiscal 2023 capex as a percent of revenue to be under 7% compared to 7.2% for fiscal 2022. next, we expect to repurchase an additional $1.5 billion of stock in the first half of fiscal 2023. and of course, as we announced last week, we are raising our dividend by over 50%, which increases our adjusted payout ratio to over 20%.
these significant shareholder return advances reflect confidence in our continued execution and ability to adapt to the evolving market. and lastly, i'd add we are projecting $800 million of voluntary pension contributions to the u.s. plans. so we entered fiscal 2023 with a strong foundation for driving improved profitability and returns.
we are mindful of the uncertainty across many fronts, including the pace of global economic activity, inflation, energy prices, additional pandemic developments and further geopolitical risks. we're actively adjusting to these changing circumstances. in closing, we are focused on delivering shareholder value by driving profitable revenue growth, expanding margins, lowering our capital intensity and improving returns to shareholders. and we look forward to sharing additional insights about our plans for this year and beyond at our investor meeting next week here in memphis.
now, we'll be happy to address your questions.

[operator instructions] and our first question will come from brandon oglenski with barclays.
brandon oglenski -- barclays -- analyst
hey. good afternoon, everyone. and raj and brie, congrats on the new roles, obviously. look, guys, i know you want to discuss the future next week, and we'll be in memphis for sure.
but raj, could you just give us what are your priorities for fedex? obviously, there's a pretty big change after 51 years under prior leadership and very big shoes to fill up for mr. smith. and one thing that keeps coming up on this call is revenue quality. so could you just give us a little bit more insight into that perceived change, at least, that i'm picking up on?
raj subramaniam -- president and chief operating officer
thank you, brandon. i will start here and then have brie talk a little bit more about revenue quality in a minute. but firstly, you're 100% right, we're building on a very strong foundation and very fortunate to have had the opportunity to work so closely with fred over the years. and we have a strong foundation to build from.
my strategy is pretty straightforward. the #1 element we talk about is revenue quality. and again, we will comment more about that. the second part of the strategy is going to be to improve operating margins in each of our operating companies, and we'll be extremely disciplined on our capital allocation and drive total shareholder return.
so we'll look forward to sharing more with you next week but let me turn it over to brie talk about revenue quality.
brie carere -- executive vice president and chief marketing and communications officer
sure. thanks, raj. yes, we mentioned revenue quality a couple of times. we're operating in a very large market, and it's not a homogenous market.
we have spent a lot of investment getting to the place we are today, and we are incredibly proud of that value proposition. and so, we're very focused on customers who value that. and so, we're being selective in this market. we're targeting b2b.
we're targeting small business, and we're really targeting customers that value the speed and the reliability we provide.
operator
and our next question will come from jack atkins with stephens.
jack atkins -- stephens, inc. -- analyst
ok, great. thank you for taking my question. i guess, brie, for you. you noted in your comments that you expected continued above inflationary pricing.
i guess when we look at ground in particular, it doesn't feel like we've been able to see that over the last year, at least, with margins down 250 basis points or so. where do you think the disconnect is there? and, i guess, as you look forward, perhaps is it a function of maybe the benefits from the pricing initiatives are going to be coming in '23, and we're seeing some lessening of some of these inflationary pressures? maybe if you could just kind of help us walk through that, that'd be helpful. thank you.
brie carere -- executive vice president and chief marketing and communications officer
sure. happy to, jack. so i think from a revenue quality perspective, if you look at the fourth quarter, we're actually quite pleased with the revenue quality that we were able to secure at fedex ground. i think two other things that is important to note within the mix of fedex ground.
we're also very pleased that we've got the right mix. b2b is actually up, and small business mix is up in the fourth quarter. so we're very pleased with that. i will say what is pressuring, and honestly, what will pressure us as we move forward is weight will come down, depending on the economy.
so that is putting some pressure. and then, of course, zone also is impacting that. but within each cell at fedex ground, we're quite confident that we are getting more for each package that we move. we're very pleased with the progress.
mike lenz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
and jack, this is mike. i want to make sure we emphasize, too, it's not singularly driven by revenue quality in terms of how we drive ground margins further going forward. we won't repeat the labor challenges of last year, obviously. but in terms of the active initiatives we have underway, we'll get further maturation of the productivity initiatives that we started last year.
we've got additional ones coming on later this year. and i alluded to, we've got multiple efforts to mitigate the liability costs. and we wouldn't expect the rate of increase that we have experienced the last couple of years on that front.
operator
and our next question will come from chris wetherbee with citi.
chris wetherbee -- citi -- analyst
great. thanks. good afternoon. wanted to ask about the guidance, the eps guidance.
i guess, it sounds like there are some headwinds or at least normalizations in your economic forecast as you think forward. yet from an earnings perspective, obviously, it's a wide range, but the upper end of that range is a nice acceleration in terms of earnings growth from what we've seen. and i know there are some headwinds that you have been facing in fiscal '22 that presumably turn to tailwinds or at least sort of get mitigated as we go forward, but i kind of wanted to square the sort of body language around the economy being a little bit softer but with the optimism about earnings power accelerating from where we are. so can you just help us a little bit with that?
mike lenz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
well, chris, this is mike. i'll give a little context around our thinking around the range, and then brie can give further backdrop for the economic perspective. but yes, we certainly are mindful of the conditions and uncertainty in the environment ahead. it's a wider range than we put out there last year exactly for that consideration.
at the same time, though, we're confident that it's a balanced and achievable outcome that we can navigate amid the uncertainty that's out there. so we felt that it was appropriate and where we need to get to.
brie carere -- executive vice president and chief marketing and communications officer
i think the only other thing that i will add is we kind of look at our -- no. 1, from a volume forecast perspective, we were conservative in the range and the volume itself. and then, as we go through the year, the comps in the back half, especially here from a domestic perspective, they're actually a little bit easier for us. so we've taken both kind of the economy into consideration, the size of the market, and obviously, the year over year.
but right now, we feel pretty good about the range we have.
operator
and our next question comes from amit mehrotra.
amit mehrotra -- deutsche bank -- analyst
thanks, operator. hi, everyone. raj, congrats on the appointment. wish you really all the success in the world.
i guess, you guys are preparing to provide some mid- to long-term profit targets next week, and it's been a while. so i think that'll be quite welcome. but the question really is -- we've seen a lot of uncertainty over the last several quarters. it's an incredibly fast-moving market.
inflation is really high, and that's actually caused you guys to miss even the newest of profitability targets. and so, the question is, as you guys prepare to come out with these multiyear targets most likely for each of the businesses? where does the confidence come from that you're going to be able to hit those targets? and is there an element of cost or idiosyncratic opportunity related to efficiency where gives you guys and should give us confidence in being able to hit that given the experience of last year? and mike, just related to that. if the company is asking investors to gain confidence in multiyear targets, i think it would be helpful to have some goalposts here now around 2023 around what underpins the 15% eps growth in 2023 with respect to ground margins and express margins. hopefully -- i don't know if you guys are willing to engage with that question, but i think it would be helpful to set that up ahead of giving these multiyear targets.
thank you.
raj subramaniam -- president and chief operating officer
amit, thank you very much, and i also appreciate your question. the last year has been quite challenging from many respects as we build out our networks and expanded our e-commerce portfolio, and then we had the labor challenges that were quite unexpected. they took $1.4 billion in fy '22 because of unexpected labor challenges, one, some due to network inefficiencies and some just rate. so as we look ahead, the foundation that we have built, the e-commerce portfolio that we have and the -- we are in the center of an ecosystem for e-commerce for several customers that we are essentially a critical infrastructure for e-commerce.
and we are doing a lot of things to make sure that we improve our productivity through technology initiatives that we'll launch in this fiscal year '23. we will continue to focus on -- as you talked about, revenue quality before, i think the market is there for that, and then improve our performance in europe. and so, i think there are several things that we can do to execute, and we are confident in our -- the ranges we gave you. mike?
mike lenz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes, amit. well, first, certainly, look, i highlighted three specific elements for ground cost improvements and efficiencies that we will be elaborating on further details next week. and as i said, we expect margin improvement at all of our transportation segments, and the most significant one will be at ground relative to fy '22 looking at fy '23. so appreciate the feedback there and absolutely understand that we need to give specifics and what are the actions that will get us there.
i will take one exception there about the target miss comment you made. our annual eps for fiscal '22 fell within the range of guidance that we gave you a year ago. so while i appreciate there may have been different twists and turns along the way in terms of how we got there, it was indeed within what was a pretty narrow range, all things considered.
operator
and our next question will come from tom wadewitz with ubs.
tom wadewitz -- ubs -- analyst
yes. great. appreciate it. and also, i know others have said this, but really looking forward to the further detail next week and the kind of, i don't know, new direction or new elements of the strategy.
so looking forward to that. when you look at the fiscal '23, because that's what we're focused on today, can you give us a sense of just magnitude of some of these big pieces? is it two-thirds of it is revenue quality that's giving you the growth, and cost is smaller, and costs can grow over time? or is this something that cost is a pretty big component of your margin improvement, your earnings growth? just trying to get a sense of the kind of relative frame of that. and i guess i would also kind of look back to the analyst meeting 10 years ago where you had the express improvement program, and you had a lot of improvement, but it took a couple of years to see that. so i guess just trying to figure out how quickly we see some of the costs and productivity measures come through and how big of a component that is versus price and revenue quality in fiscal '23. 
mike lenz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
ok, tom, there's a lot packed into that. again, much of which in terms of flushing out details in that is something that we can elaborate on and spend a whole lot more time on next week. but as brie mentioned, the volume growth in the projection here for '23 is low single digit. so while there is continued yield opportunity because of the inflationary environment and because of the capabilities and value that our networks provide, we do have meaningful, significant cost and efficiency initiatives underway.
i talked about how we're lowering our facility investment in the ground. the emphasis now is on utilizing the capacity that we have, sweating the assets and driving further efficiencies and productivity there. raj mentioned about how we schedule our people in that to get it optimally targeted and resource per sort in that. so there's no sort of single magic bullet to point to there, but it's a number of concrete, real initiatives across the enterprise that will allow us to achieve the results that we need to get to.
operator
and our next question will come from jon chappell with evercore isi.
jon chappell -- evercore isi -- analyst
thank you. good afternoon. brie, there's a been high-profile entrant in the market, so to speak, who's clearly overhired, added a lot of capacity, and others talk of trimming a significant amount of capacity in the next 12 months or so. as you think about the network in general, what's fedex' opportunity and its risk from maybe some laying off some people where you've had some labor issues in the past and also spare capacity and what that may do to pricing in the business over the next 12 months?
brie carere -- executive vice president and chief marketing and communications officer
thanks, jon. a very fair question. i think a couple of things. no.
1, we've absolutely planned conservatively so that we really can focus on those customers that value us. we have, over the last couple of years, done, i think, a tremendous job negotiating mid- to long-term contracts that i think puts us in a really good place to stabilize the base of our volume. so to mike's point, if things do soften from an economy perspective, i think we're in a really good position. and we're going to focus on disciplined revenue quality, disciplined targeted growth.
and that will kind of be our primary focus versus kind of filling the network from an alternative perspective. so i feel pretty good about where we are despite some of the competitive activity and some of the other headlines we're all reading.
operator
and our next question will come from allison poliniak with wells fargo.
allison poliniak -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
hi. good evening. so first, on the labor inefficiency. is there a way to quantify what that headwind was to ground? i know you quantified the absolute wage increase.
and then, in line with that, a lot of productivity initiatives out there based on your volume outlook. is there a way to think or quantify what those eventual productivity initiatives will contribute to margin expansion in '23, particularly in ground? just any color there.
mike lenz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
ok. so allison, yeah, this is mike. the ground network inefficiency aspect of the labor availability for fy '22, we pegged that at roughly $300 million. so that was certainly most prevalent in the first half of the year.
so i think that addresses that. sorry, the second part of your question?
allison poliniak -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
in the context of your low single-digit volume increase, a lot of productivity initiatives. i think you talked about the technology and the software related to the dock, some improvement on that side. is there a way to better understand what that contribution to that margin expansion would be from some of those initiatives as we look to '23 here?
mike lenz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes. so raj highlighted that just the first leg of that, roughly 6% improvement just quarter-to-quarter. so that gives you a flavor of the opportunity ahead there. we certainly -- i talk about the liability and the cost of risk.
that was a significant impact to the margin and bending that going forward. that's going to definitely provide opportunity there. the question earlier about the labor market easing, we are hiring fewer new people that is supportive, too, of more efficient and a more safe operation, too, when people that are more experienced. so again, all these elements come to play.
and we have good plans behind it that the team will be happy to speak further to next week.
operator
and moving on to jordan alliger with goldman sachs.
jordan alliger -- goldman sachs -- analyst
hi, everyone. so yields were very strong, as you noted, across the board. is there any way to at least give some big picture view how to think about the components of the yield improvement, whether it be fuel surcharge, core price, mix as you referred to revenue management or other surcharges? just some picture how to think about these very large improvements.
brie carere -- executive vice president and chief marketing and communications officer
thanks, jordan. appreciate the question. so specifically for q4, fuel was the largest driver of the revenue quality. we also did a -- quite frankly, as i mentioned earlier, i thought the team just did a tremendous job within our portfolio of managing to hold on to the -- really our best and most profitable volume.
so when you look at kind of the volume decline, we actually moved the right way. within the express company domestically, we had lower volumes on deferred than our overnight from a year-over-year perspective. when you look internationally, the intercontinental, the team did a really good job of stabilizing volumes there. and actually, we decided to let some international domestic volume go.
and then, the same thing happened within ground. we will see the huge difference in ground economy decline versus actually we did a really good job of stabilizing the commercial and the hd, of course, our highest value proposition product. so from a revenue quality perspective, while fuel was the largest driver, we also did a great job. we continue to get inflation plus renewals.
and they're really working on making sure from a mix perspective, we get the revenue for the most premium part of our portfolio. so i hope that helps clarify that.
operator
and our next question will come from ken hoexter with bank of america.
kenn hoexter -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
great. good afternoon. raj, brie, congrats on the positions and really almost the entire team since the start of pandemic. so again, mirror everybody's sentiment about next week in the conference.
but it seems like you've had, coming out of that maybe a week ago, a big capital and return focus, the involvement of an activist. you've now talked about lowering capex. maybe talk about what's getting removed from the capex or how your thoughts on investment shift from your prior kind of growth focus and how we should think about that. obviously, you've built a huge cash balance now and maybe talk about your thoughts on capital allocation and distribution going forward.
raj subramaniam -- president and chief operating officer
first of all, i'll just say conversations with an activist here, but then i'll let mike talk about the specific question here. we have been working on investor day for nearly a year, and the strategies and the dividend plans are well in place. and so, we had very strong plans and then long proceeded any conversations that we had with anybody. and then, when we had the opportunity to sit down with them is this clear alignment on where we were headed.
so that was -- i wanted to make sure that you understood that, but these plans have been well in place for a long time, and a key part of the equation is what mike is going to talk about now.
mike lenz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
well, ken, you're trying to ask -- you're trying to get me to give away everything ford next week, but i'll say, look, we've highlighted before that we were at a significant phase of refleeting the express air fleet. and as i said, that is going to come down. we can detail more of that going forward. we've built up the ground network with the capabilities that are industry-leading and are going to be able to continue to realize value from that going forward, and we'll further utilize that so we don't need to invest as much as the hard assets.
we'll certainly be investing in technology aspects to more fully utilize it in different and creative ways. so it's just a natural evolution from building to having these capabilities and now transitioning. but i would remind you, too, we repurchased roughly 3% of our shares last year. while the dividend increase was certainly very significant, we've long been looking and striving to increase that.
in fact, it was the second largest percentage increase. so a few years ago, we actually had a larger percentage increase. so again, it's just a natural evolution of where we are in terms of capital allocation and driving improved returns, and i look forward to elaborating further next week.
operator
and moving on to brian ossenbeck with j.p. morgan.
brian ossenbeck -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
hi. good evening  and thanks for taking my question. so i want to come back to the impact of fuel. brie, you mentioned it didn't sound like there's any demand destruction or trade down and it's actually better, so if you can elaborate on that.
would you expect that to continue given where fuel prices are, where surcharges are? and then, mike, can you just talk about how much of an impact fuel was on a net basis, as mentioned a few times in the press release and what do you have baked into the guidance next year?
brie carere -- executive vice president and chief marketing and communications officer
hey, brian. you're right, in q4, we didn't see a lot of trade down. there's a couple of reasons for that. obviously, from an intercontinental perspective, capacity is still quite constrained.
so if the economy does continue to soften, do i anticipate that there will be more demand for deferred portfolio? i absolutely do, but we are very focused on customers who have a bundle, who have a deferred need and have a need for our premium portfolio. and so, as we look at that targeted growth, we will be very thoughtful about not just attracting customers that rely solely on our deferred portfolio. it really is about bundling to make sure that we maximize the value of our network. hope that helps clarify.
mike lenz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes. brian, look, there's many elements of fuel as a -- when you aggregate it. and as brie has highlighted before, it's a fundamental component of the overall pricing construct. so i'm not going to parse it out in terms of one specific aspect of it.
but i would say in terms of the guidance that we have, the fuel price assumption that we have in there is not as high as current fuel prices. so that is maybe a little more help for you on that front.

and our next question comes from bascome majors with susquehanna.
bascome majors -- susquehanna international group -- analyst
yeah. thanks for taking my questions. understand that you're modeling and guiding to the projections that you have out there, and a lot of investors would love to see the economy come out with that. but as they discount potentially worse scenarios, can you walk us through how the business in your mind would perform in a moderate to deeper recession and whether or not there are any nuances we should consider versus the, call it, 40% eps drawdowns we've seen historically in that type of environment?
raj subramaniam -- president and chief operating officer
let me begin this and have mike and brie jump in and help me here. firstly, let me just say that, yes, we have economic projections today out there, and we -- some of those projections may come down, and we are prepared for that. and what we are prepared to pull some levers here. we're already moving, making sure there's significant cost controls.
and we're operating in a very constrained environment from that perspective. but we will adjust networks. we'll adjust -- take down flights as required. we'll just match the capacity to demand.
and that's the beauty of having a big network is we're able to flex up and down. we have demonstrated that historically as well. and so, yes, there's a range of outcomes that we are ready to deal with. we are definitely not assuming a prolonged deep recession.
that's not what we're assuming here. but we have some flex for some slowdown in our economy. mike?
mike lenz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes, bascome. i mean, look, just to give you some parameters around how we have adapted and adjusted previously when the trade or macroeconomic backdrop can change on you. in february of 2020, so just before the pandemic, obviously, we were seeing significant shifts in trade policy and demand. and as a result, we had lowered our frequencies across the trans-pacific by 20% from the prior year.
fast forward a few months later, the pandemic in that when we had to completely realign and shift instead of temporarily parking airplanes, we were trying to get more lift back in the air to support commerce, to support the pandemic efforts in that. so certainly, one, we've demonstrated historically. and two, i think, as an organization, the ability and the speed at which we were able to adjust among all of our networks during the pandemic gives us every confidence in the learning that we can react faster than we may have thought we could in the past, and we are absolutely prepared to do so.
operator
thank you. and our next question will come from helane becker with cowen.
helane becker -- cowen and company -- analyst
thanks very much. hi, everybody. my three questions are this. the passenger airlines, as you know, are hiring every pilot they can possibly get.
and i probably asked you this question before, but how are you thinking about hiring and retention so that you can continue to master your network? and the other question is -- i think there was an announcement earlier this week that you took 150 electric vehicles from brightdrop. so i think that's out of the 2,500 van order. can you talk about the capex related to that and how you're thinking about sustainability efforts? and if you're going to do it next week, that's fine. i can wait.
mike lenz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
helane, first, on the electric vehicles, that is what i spoke earlier about increasing our investment in vehicles across the board. the principal element of that is continuing with the pickup and delivery electrification at express. so that is absolutely a key plant going forward. and look, we're fully committed to reaching the goals by 2040, and that means we've got to get going now on that replacement.
i'll let raj address the pilot consideration, but thanks for the question.
raj subramaniam -- president and chief operating officer
yes. thank you, helane. and yeah, the pilot situation, just wanted two -- i'll make two points. firstly, i want to say thank you to our pilots who have done a tremendous job during this time frame and a big part of the value that we provided here.
and secondly, because of the work environment that we have in fedex, there's no dearth of people who want to get into the fedex pool. so we're not seeing that is an issue for fedex.
operator
thank you. and our next question will come from scott group with wolfe research.
scott group -- wolfe research -- analyst
hey, thanks. afternoon. mike, you talked about ground seeing the biggest margin improvement this year, fiscal '23. i'm wondering, do you think we see that margin inflection in q1 and -- or if it's more later in the year? and then just maybe bigger picture for raj.
i think there's a lot of hope or expectation for next week that we're going to hear about big strategic changes, focus and -- at fedex and cost reductions and things like that. and understandably, we're not hearing about that today, but do you think -- would you agree that we should be seeing and hearing about big strategic changes next week?
mike lenz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
well, scott, first, this is mike. just to clarify, look, for ground to have the largest margin improvement of all the segments within the guidance we have here, yes, it is the case that we have to see margin improvement certainly in q1.
raj subramaniam -- president and chief operating officer
and scott, yes, you're definitely not going to get me to give away the story for next week today. but i'll just tell you this much that historically, express focus on time-definite services. ground focus on day-definite services. and it is fantastic, and then we actually gained a lot of share in the u.s.
domestic market over the last 20 years. and what has changed in the last three or four years is the emergence of e-commerce and residential delivery and the emergence of day-definite networks -- day-definite packages on both networks that gives us the opportunity to optimized across. and we launched operate collaboratively a few -- a year or so ago now, and we'll talk more about that next week.
operator
and our next question will come from david vernon with bernstein.
david vernon -- alliancebernstein -- analyst
hey, good afternoon, guys, and thanks for taking my question. raj, i know you don't want to detail too many of the plans for next year, and this isn't about that, but i want to think -- it would be helpful, i think, if you could talk us through kind of the operational situation [inaudible] outside of just labor cost pressure. was there an impact on service levels over the [inaudible] because of those staffing challenges? and where are we on service kind of today for maybe where we would have been? and [inaudible] out of the service levels in ground. these metrics are all taken around on a public data on this stuff.
but we continue to hear from contractors and some shippers that their service levels may be not exactly when they want to be, trucks are taking too much time to go out of buildings, that kind of thing. it'd be great if you could just talk to us a little bit about [inaudible] and where we are in recovery on the productivity side.
raj subramaniam -- president and chief operating officer
david, you're breaking up a little bit, but let me answer the question that i thought i heard. i think, firstly, yes, a year ago, for this time, we saw significant challenges on the labor front that the labor availability started to go away from us, and the volume was very strong. and that resulted in inefficiencies on the network and also service challenges. by peak, we had unwound most of the network inefficiencies, and we are heavily focused on improving our service.
and this is the conversation that we have every week. and i'm glad to say that week-over-week, month-over-month that we have improved our service to the point now we are, i would say, back to a normal situation. we will not relent here. this is going to be a purple promise, and service differentiation is a key for our success going forward.
and so, we will get the service back to market-leading, and that's our goal.
operator
and our next question will come from scott schneeberger with oppenheimer.
scott schneeberger -- oppenheimer and company -- analyst
thank you very much for the question and looking forward to seeing everyone next week. i would like to focus my question on the smallest but certainly most impressive segment this quarter being freight. mike, and maybe raj if he's on, just what do you view for the industrial economy here where we are in the ltl cycle? and kind of the cadence of what we should expect over the course of fiscal '23 for this segment as the margin expansion has been nothing short of impressive 500 basis points plus quarter over quarter and year over year. so just how should we think about modeling that going into the year?
mike lenz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
well, scott, as i said, we expect margin improvement in all of our transportation segments. look, the freight ltl business has certainly evolved from where it was a number of years ago. you have a much greater discipline in terms of when the environment changes, in terms of pricing discipline when its demand is strong. there is not the degree of capacity adds, which then is excess capacity when you go through a little more of a cyclical change.
so we're very confident in the discipline within both the industry overall as well as the approach we're taking to it in terms of continuing to drive freight margins from an outstanding year upward from there.
operator
and moving on to todd fowler with keybanc capital markets.
todd fowler -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
so brie, i just wanted to make sure i understand the volume expectations. i guess, no. 1, the low single digits, is that across both express and ground? and then no. 2, it sounds like the shape is slower in the first half with an easier comps in the back half.
want to make sure i got those pieces right. and then, if you can help us understand on the ground economy side, how much volume is still left to call on that business and the thought around calling that versus the ability to move price up on that business?
brie carere -- executive vice president and chief marketing and communications officer
ok. i'm going to try to get it all, but please feel free to ask again if i didn't miss the whole question or questions there. ok. so i think the first question was when we're looking at the volume between express and ground, and we're saying low single digits.
the low single digit is the total volume. from a ground market perspective, we still believe in the secular growth of e-commerce. we have been looking at the e-commerce as a percentage of retail. it's still -- last number i looked at was just above 21%.
pre-covid, we were like 16%, 17%. so we still believe that ground has the largest growth opportunity, and that is reflected in our range for this year. we've got ground going faster than express. i don't think that would be a surprise to anybody on this call.
and then, as i mentioned in the back half, the comps, especially for ground, do get better. from an economy perspective, fedex ground economy, let me be specific there, i think you're going to see q1 volumes look similar to q4, and then we'll start to build back from there. like i said, we really do need the economy product. it allows us to sweat our assets, and it is a need in the market, especially if things soften.
and i want to make sure that my opening remarks didn't confuse anybody. we're very clear eyed about the economy in which we're operating. when we said normalized economic environment, i meant we're not planning right now in our current forecast for a recession, to raj's point. so i do anticipate that if the market softened, the economy product will have to play a larger role.
like i said earlier, we really have to get the bundle. and there's -- the vast majority of customers who have a home delivery need and a ground commercial need do have either a returns line that needs to use the economy product. they have a different sku that has lower value. so that bundle is really important to us, and we have to make sure that, that product is there to defend.
and so, i think long answer, but you'll see us build back some economy volume later in this year, i believe.
operator
and our next question will come from bruce chan with stifel.
bruce chan -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
thanks, operator. good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for squeezing me in here. just want to come back to the revenue quality discussion. brie, you talked about growing share in smb, and i think b2b is part of that.
can you give us a sense of what commercial initiatives you're putting in place to make that share growth happen there? and then maybe also where do you stand right now in terms of smb share? where is that coming from? and where do you think it can go?
brie carere -- executive vice president and chief marketing and communications officer
yeah. great question. so from a b2b perspective, we've got a lot going on to improve our market share. and again, we're running a massive business.
so i'll try to be specific without going kind of through every country in the world. from a b2b, i guess, one of the primary things that we're working on, i mean you're going to hear a lot about next week, is our visibility tools. as you're talking about managing very complex supply chains, and you can imagine the amount of change that our customers have gone through over the last two years, visibility is critical. and then, honestly, proactive visibility and having the tools to help customers reroute around a weather disruption, reroute around a port congestion, so we are really excited about our fedex surround platform that we've talked a lot about.
this helps our largest customers, and in particular, our b2b customers really navigate and manage their supply chain. we are adding new capabilities onto this tool to allow us to intervene for our healthcare customers so that if there is a service disruption, we can intervene and reice or put something in a cooler. so i would say thematically for b2b, really giving customers the data, the tools, the insight and then, quite frankly, having the intervention capabilities that fedex express does to do something about it because that is really most important. from a small business perspective, i'm just really enthusiastic.
no one can touch our value proposition. small bundle or small customers need simplicity. and they tell us that over and over again, if you're a small customer, you're running just about every function in your business. and so, if you've got a one-stop shop like fedex with an ltl provider with national coverage, it works really well.
we've got the industry's leading loyalty program, and i think the pricing team has done a really good job using earned discount in some of our tools to really reward small businesses for that bundle. we'll talk about it a little bit more next week. but like i said, i think we're pretty happy with our small business. and as i mentioned in q4, our small business mix did improve.
and i guess, sort of one other thing, when we're talking small business, not all small business is created equal. there are a large amount of very price-sensitive lightweight small businesses. that is not who we're targeting. so we're being very disciplined.
and on the portion of small business that we really are interested in, we're very confident in the momentum we've got.
operator
and our final question will come from jeff kauffman with vertical research partners.
jeff kauffman -- vertical research partners -- analyst
thank you very much. for squeezing me in, and really exciting time. congratulations to everyone. looking forward to memphis next week.
mike, i just wanted to get some clarification here. two parts here. no. 1, the drop in capex projection from $7.2 billion to $6.8 million, i think you implied that was more of a timing issue because of supply chain challenges.
so should we assume that that $400 million comes back as we head toward fiscal '24? and then secondly, i want to follow up on helane's brightdrop question. we've actually had a chance to see the vehicle at act expo. and the intel we got was it's not costing much more than a mercedes sprinter, but the tco is dramatically lower between the maintenance and the fuel savings and a positive benefit as these trucks come in, in terms of p&l to the fleet. could you address both those issues, please?
mike lenz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes. sure. no. thanks, jeff.
so yes, let me clarify on the capex. so indeed, it was the case that $400 million lower came in this year because of -- for instance, we simply couldn't get some of the replacement vehicles in the time frames anticipated given supply chain delays with the manufacturers there. certain facility projects just didn't move at the pace as anticipated. so all that said, the $6.8 million for the current fiscal year considers that, that -- those will finish out and plus the other spending i outlined there.
so i guess, you could say if it had been $6.2 million last year, it would have been $6.4 million this year. but our $7.2 million last year, it would have been lower this year. but again, at the end of the day, $6.8 million last year and $6.8 million this year. and then, look, on the brightdrop electric vehicles is indeed the case that -- and we look at this from a very focused financial and economic perspective, too, in terms of our acquisition of the fleet.
obviously, it's a key underpinning of our carbon initiatives. but you're right, it does have much lower maintenance costs going forward, a lot fewer moving parts, so on and so forth. so again, the total cost of ownership over the long run, we definitely believe that can exceed the combustion vehicle. so again, thanks for the question.

operator
good day, everyone, and welcome to the fedex corporation first quarter fiscal year 2023 earnings conference call. today's call is being recorded. at this time, i will turn the call over to mickey foster, vice president of investor relations for fedex corporation. please go ahead.
mickey foster -- vice president, investor relations
good afternoon, and welcome to fedex corporation's first quarter earnings conference call. before we begin, we want to recognize our sec 8-k was filed earlier than planned due to a technical issue. the first quarter earnings release, form 10-q, and stat book are on our website at fedex.com. this call is being streamed from our website where the replay will be available for about one year.
joining us on the call today are members of the media. during our question-and-answer session, analysts will be limited to one question in order to allow us to accommodate all those who would like to participate. we want to remind all listeners that fedex corporation desires to take advantage of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act. certain statements in this conference call such as projections regarding future performance may be considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of the act.
such forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties, and other factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. for additional information on these factors, please refer to our press releases and filings with the sec. please refer to the investor relations portion of our website at fedex.com for a reconciliation of the non-gaap financial measures discussed on this call to the most directly comparable gaap measures. joining us on the call today are raj subramaniam, president and ceo; mike lenz, executive vice president and cfo; and brie carere, executive vice president and chief customer officer.
and now, raj will share his views on the quarter. 
raj subramaniam -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, mickey, and good afternoon, everyone. i'd like to start today by acknowledging our pre-announced first quarter earnings results and updated outlook we provided last week. our network capacity did not align with the demand we experienced as the quarter progressed. but as communicated last week, we have taken swift actions to address what's within our control.
getting costs out rapidly is my priority, and today, i will outline why i'm confident in our ability to drive improved performance and profitability through aggressive cost actions. before providing more details around these actions, let me briefly discuss what happened since we last spoke to you in june. we saw a decline in our volumes during the first quarter, which accelerated in the final weeks. our softening volumes in asia and the u.s.
were predominantly due to the economy while the shortfall in europe was both economic- and service-related. therefore, we had costs in the system for volumes that didn't materialize. while we immediately took action, savings from these cost efforts lagged the volume decline due to the scale of our operations. as a result, while revenue was up 6% year over year, these dynamics translated to volumes being down year over year at all our transportation segments.
the volume decline directly impacted our bottom line, driving total company adjusted operating income down roughly 18% year over year. now, what matters most is what we are doing about it, and this brings me to our aggressive and decisive plan to reduce costs. i'll speak to you -- i'll speak to our actions in two parts: first, our fiscal year '23 steps to immediately reduce costs; and second, our deliver today, innovate for tomorrow transformation strategy to permanently reduce cost and optimize our network. starting with fiscal year '23, we are prioritizing cost actions to generate $2.2 billion to $2.7 billion of savings, of which about $1 billion will be permanent.
taking each key contributor in turn, at fedex express, we expect to drive $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion in savings this fiscal year. the largest single expected contributor in fiscal '23 will be the changes we are making to our express air network as we cut global flight hours. this reduction includes 11% of pan-pacific daily frequencies, 9% of transatlantic daily frequencies, and 17% of daily frequencies on the lane between asia and europe. as volumes deteriorated later in the quarter, we began making these structural changes to our network.
the impact of these initial changes will be fully realized in october, and the benefit of our continued actions will steadily increase throughout the fiscal year. we are also evaluating additional reductions to be implemented post peak. further, we're taking steps to enhance our ground efficiency, including reducing routes, hours, vehicle rentals, and other on-road expenses. for example, in europe, we are altering ground network routes to improve productivity, leading to a reduction of approximately 11% of routes in the u.k.
and 12% in germany. now, turning to fedex ground. we expect savings in ground to be $350 million to $500 million in fiscal '23. our approach to cutting costs in ground primarily centers around rationalizing our operations.
we are consolidating sorts, which will reduce costs while maintaining service, and have canceled several planned ground network capacity projects. and as mentioned last week, we're also reducing select sunday operations in over 170 stations. mike will provide more details on our capital plans shortly. the final components of our expected fiscal '23 savings will be from overhead expenses as we rightsize our overall cost structure.
these actions include our plans to close nearly 140 fedex office locations and at least five corporate office facilities. additionally, fedex services has stopped all noncritical projects. in total, our overhead reduction actions, including fedex services, will contribute $350 million to $500 million. we realized nearly $300 million in cost savings from these actions in q1 and expect approximately another $700 million in q2, with the remainder of the fiscal '23 savings realized during the second half of the year.
the second part of our cost plan is focused on permanent reductions, and we have launched drive, a program supporting our deliver today, innovate for tomorrow strategy introduced in june. drive is how we execute on that strategy. our team has already started implementing cost reductions under this program, and this will ultimately enable network 2.0, the long-term end-to-end trend optimization of our network. sriram krishnasamy, our newly appointed chief transformation officer, will facilitate drive and continue reporting directly to me.
in total, we expect to take out an additional $4 billion in costs related to drive by fiscal year 2025. to be clear, these are incremental to the fiscal '23 savings i just outlined. these transformational changes will lay the foundation for network 2.0, which will create an additional $2 billion benefit over the long term. in closing, we are focused on actions we can control as we stabilize our near-term performance and execute against our long-term strategy.
i'd like to sincerely thank our highly motivated team for their hard work and dedication to deliver upon the purple promise. now, let me turn it over to our chief customer officer, brie carere, to discuss market trends that underpin our outlook and our commercial strategy in some more detail.
brie carere -- executive vice president and chief customer officer
thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. as raj discussed, during the first quarter, manufacturing, global trade, and consumer spending decelerated, particularly late in the quarter, and certainly more than we anticipated. as a result, our first quarter volumes were lower than we forecasted. our current expectations for 2022 u.s.
gdp growth and u.s. industrial production forecasts have declined by about 100 basis points since june. data shows that u.s. consumer spending has slowed as inflation remains a challenge.
further, consumption is skewed toward services, demonstrated by the fact that in june, excluding auto, the real retail inventory to sales ratio fully recovered to its pre-pandemic level. from october to june, the real inventory to sales ratio, excluding automotive, increased 14 basis points, which was the fastest gain over an eight-month period in the 25-year history of the series. also, real retail sales, including auto, after growing 4.6% and 10.8% in calendar year '21 and '22, respectively, are now down 3.1% year over year through july and are pacing to have the worst decline since the great recession. turning to our transportation businesses.
i'd like to spend a moment on the dynamics occurring within fedex express and most specifically in asia and europe. starting with asia, our results were impacted by macroeconomic weakness. our lower demand is consistent with the broader market, with ocean and air freight rates under pressure in recent weeks. a good indicator of how quickly the market changed in asia is to review the spot rates coming out of hong kong and shanghai.
in june and july, spot rates were between 20% and 40% higher year over year, respectively. in early august, these rates fell to single digits, and by the end of the month, shanghai had plummeted to a 10% decline year over year, while hong kong rates were flat. through june, which is the latest data available, we have had small market share gains in our asia region. in europe, the economy was weaker than we anticipated, and service further pressured our results.
our network integration was successfully completed in march, but it is an incredibly complicated effort to combine two individual networks of this scale. throughout the quarter, we continued to refine our standard operating procedures to improve service levels and create momentum across our european division. moving now to fedex ground. revenue growth was driven by higher yields from higher fuel surcharges, base rate increases, and improved volume mix.
despite volumes being lower than anticipated, we have held market share in the united states. fedex ground has strong service levels, best-in-market transit times, and an exciting new picture proof of delivery capability. we are ready to deliver for peak. we will remain nimble in leveraging peak surcharges to balance demand and the capacity of our network as we monitor volume trends.
and at fedex freight, momentum continues to build. the freight team delivered another strong quarter marked by 21% revenue growth. the team continues to drive disciplined execution, focused on revenue quality and profitable share growth. for the company overall, we continue to execute our revenue quality strategy and pursue business that provides attractive yields.
we continue to deliver new pricing capabilities, and we've taken recent actions to stay well positioned relative to the market as we approach peak. we have maintained a brisk pace for repricing contracts for the renewals and continue to negotiate strong increases. we just announced a 6.9% general rate increase this coming january in our response to inflationary pressures on our costs. we also announced our new remote area surcharge and peak residential pricing in the united states.
in europe and asia, we will launch a new handling surcharge as well this january. in august, we implemented international fuel surcharge table adjustments for asia, europe, the middle east, and africa. fuel surcharges are an important pricing tool. we rigorously monitor fuel prices to ensure that we are appropriately positioned relative to the market.
we're moving with speed and agility to reposition our business model for today's operating environment. as you heard from raj, we had a great -- we have a great opportunity to align costs with volume levels. we are committed to doing this while executing against our commercial strategy and delivering for our customers. importantly, we're still focused on the longer-term opportunity growing in high-value segments, driving improved service quality, and, of course, delivering an outstanding customer experience.
i am really pleased with how our teams have responded in this dynamic environment, and we are well positioned to deliver during the upcoming peak season. service is strong and we have a fantastic value proposition. with that, i'll turn it over to our chief financial officer, mike lenz.
mike lenz -- chief financial officer
thank you, brie. while revenue was up 6% for the quarter, profitability was challenged with operating income down 18% on an adjusted basis and adjusted operating margin down 150 basis points year over year. at express, adjusted operating income declined 72% due to lower average daily package and freight volume and increased expenses as cost reductions lagged volume declines. these factors were partially offset by yield management actions, including higher fuel surcharges.
package yield, including fuel, grew 16% year over year. turning to ground. operating income increased 3% primarily due to yield improvement and home delivery volume growth. yield including fuel grew 12% year over year.
these factors were partially offset by higher operating expenses, driven by increased purchase transportation and other operating expenses. freight delivered another strong quarter with operating income increasing over 67% as the freight team continues to execute. this was driven by yield management actions, including higher fuel surcharges. yield, including the surcharges, grew 27%.
this was partially offset by higher salaries and employee benefits, as well as lower shipment volumes. to address the changed environment, we're focused on what's within our control and moving with urgency to take costs out of the network. our team is operating at speed to identify cost-saving opportunities and accelerate for implementation. the $2.2 billion to $2.7 billion fiscal '23 savings we're targeting are relative to our initial plans heading into the year.
the majority of this year's savings will come from express where the demand change has been most pronounced. we expect about $1 billion of our fiscal '23 savings to be permanent in nature, with slight reduction as the largest component along with corporate and back-office costs. these permanent cost reductions were not part of the deliver today, innovate for tomorrow strategy we shared in june, which is about how we structurally optimize our networks. these reductions are directly related to flexing in a changed environment with a view to build back differently in the future.
as raj mentioned, we remain committed to the profit improvement objectives we shared at our june investors meeting. we have launched efforts to accelerate initiatives, identify incremental opportunities and implement metrics to track progress under the drive program. so, next, i'll give more details on the targeted $4 billion savings by fiscal '25 enabled by drive. about $1.4 billion of the total will come from the fedex express operating expenses.
four largest areas of opportunity we are actively advancing are: first, restructuring the air network by reducing routes and more efficiently deploying crews, aircraft, and commercial line haul; next, optimization of sort, surface line haul, and on-road design to improve efficiency, asset utilization, and service; next, driving efficiencies of europe, as we've discussed previously; and lastly, harmonizing global clearance processes to lower cost. about $1.1 billion of the total will come from fedex ground operating expenses via dock productivity initiatives, network, and line haul efficiencies, and reduced liability costs. and approximately $1.5 billion will come from shared and allocated overhead expenses led by procurement savings, back-office automation and infrastructure modernization, increased deployment of digital self-service, and further consolidation of shared service functions. moving to our capital spending plans.
we've reduced our forecast for capital spend for fiscal 2023 to $6.3 billion compared to our prior $6.8 billion forecast. we're intensely focused on allocating capital to the most attractive roic initiatives. our liquidity remains a source of strength as we ended the quarter with $6.9 billion in cash. and based on our cash flows and liquidity, we remain committed to our capital return strategy, including our plan to repurchase $1.5 billion of stock in fiscal 2023.
we expect to purchase $1 billion in the second quarter. our capital return strategy reflects our confidence in our business despite the headwinds we're currently navigating. we have significant flexibility to maintain our balanced capital allocation and preserve a resilient balance sheet. now, turning to second-quarter guidance.
while we continue to drive aggressive cost reduction actions, we expect business conditions to remain challenging in the second quarter. as a result, and consistent with the update we provided last week, currently expecting revenue of between $23.5 billion to $24 billion in the fiscal second quarter, and adjusted earnings per share, excluding costs related to business optimization and realignment initiatives of $2.75 or greater in the second quarter. for the remainder of the year, while we are not providing guidance, given current uncertainties, our plan is based on an expectation that the weak trends we saw in late q1 will persist across our major geographies. this is embedded in our guidance for the second quarter and driving our cost takeout initiatives for the fiscal year.
longer term, we remain committed to our fiscal 2025 targets for operating margin improvement, return on invested capital, and capital intensity that we shared with you in june. we're leaning more heavily into cost actions to get to those goals. the start of the year presented greater-than-expected challenges, but i can assure you that we are moving with urgency to address these pressures while remaining focused on creating long-term value by prioritizing revenue quality, expanding margins, and elevating financial returns through profitable growth and reduced capital intensity. and with that, we'll open it up for your questions.

[operator instructions] and we will take our first question from tom wadewitz with ubs. please go ahead.
tom wadewitz -- ubs -- analyst
yeah. good. good afternoon. i wanted to see if you could maybe give us some more perspective on some of the biggest cost reduction actions and just kind of your level of confidence on the execution.
it seems like, i guess, parking the planes and taking out capacity is something you've done in prior downturns, but perhaps rationalizing sorting centers seems like a new thing in ground. and i guess the labor markets, maybe it's a little tougher to take labor market if you think you might need it back. so, i just wanted to see if you could give maybe a bit more detail on your visibility to those cost actions and kind of how they come through. thank you.
mike lenz -- chief financial officer
sure, tom. this is mike. so, you're correct in observing that the biggest order of magnitude of the cost reductions is from flexing down the air network. so, that will come into play, particularly as we move through into the second half of the year as the flight reductions for the -- take effect in october and into november.
so, at ground, you spoke of a facility and sort rationalization. what that does for us is as volumes fell down below expectations, that leads to inefficient line haul because load factor's down, and so thus, you're running more line haul than you need for the volume you have. so, by consolidating sorts and rationalizing facilities, that's just an example of how we can optimize against the lower volume. i'd also highlight that within the capital spending projections, we have deferred a number of planned ground facilities, and we actually canceled a few that we're literally about to initiate.
so, we are moving quickly on this and fully acting to realize the full potential there. so, we have clear plans to get at all of these. we have a long list, and they all add up to a very solid number, and the team is focused on execution.
operator
we will take our next question from brian ossenbeck with j.p. morgan. please go ahead.
brian ossenbeck -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
yeah. maybe just more basic question. raj, can you just talk about the -- i guess the reason why this is only a fedex issue at least at this point in time? why haven't peers called this out? they all seem to sound like things are actually working pretty well in their favor, at least not nearly as much of a falloff as you've highlighted. so, maybe can you just address that and why you waited a week to talk about the costs, which we're all waiting for? and then just because of the significant downdraft in express, can you give us some recent stats in terms of just how quickly it fell and how september is shaping up?
raj subramaniam -- president and chief executive officer
ok. let me start and then brie can talk about some of the trends you're saying. listen, i can't comment on what our competition is seeing or not seeing. all i can say is the trends that we are seeing in the marketplace, and we want to get out ahead of this.
and listen, the whole -- at the end of the day, the macro is going to ebb and flow. it's really the activities that we do that matters at the end of the day, and we want to take control of what we can control. and that's why we are being very aggressive on our cost actions. and again, we'll let the economic environment, the things that we don't control, it'll do what it will do.
we'll just -- we will focus on the issues that we can control in primarily on the cost side. i'll let brie talk about the revenue trends.
brie carere -- executive vice president and chief customer officer
thanks, raj. brian, just to kind of reiterate what we -- i know we had a lot of opening comments. but when we look at kind of the background, we really did break things into three categories. in asia-pacific, we absolutely believe that this is a market trend and not a fedex trend.
as i mentioned, our market share studies, they are a little bit of a lagging indicator. but we do see that through june, in our asia-pacific region, we actually gained market share. and that's why i shared those spot rates and how quickly the market changed in august. and we do believe the entire market is experiencing that in asia.
in europe, similar story from an economic perspective. we think that the economy got worse throughout the quarter. we, however, as we acknowledged, did not have the improvement in service in the quarter that we had expected. we actually saw some plateau in service levels, so that was a fedex issue.
and as raj mentioned, we're working on it seriously and actually feel good about the momentum there from a service improvement. and then here in the united states, as i mentioned, through june, we can see that we've held market share. if you actually look from a nuanced perspective, i would say that the one nuance within the domestic performance is that from a fedex ground economy perspective, we have prioritized revenue quality and so we have let some volume go. that was very conscious, and we have seen that kind of persist throughout the quarter.
so, overall, we do think that the entire market is experiencing what we had from a macroeconomic perspective. and then for q2, you've got the revenue range and i would say that september is right in that range.
operator
we will take our next question from brandon oglenski with barclays. please go ahead.
brandon oglenski -- barclays -- analyst
hey, raj and team. thanks for taking my question and definitely appreciate the new cost plans. but maybe we're going about this all the wrong way because there's been plenty of cost improvement plans in the past at this company that just haven't delivered. so, can i ask a pointed question? have you done a product review, like what is not working in the last 20 years that's driving lower profitability in your network relative to your competitor? is there a certain product or customer or a region that just isn't working? and i can tell you from the outside looking in, tnt seems to have been an unmitigated disaster here that just has been delivering because you guys are coining out european losses again.
and then from our perspective as well dual express and ground pickup and delivery networks, i get it. i know that express and ground have different dynamics. however, your asset efficiency is literally half that of your nearest competitor, which is unionized, if i might add. so, i guess why not use this downturn to put more concrete plans in place to exit markets or regions that aren't working? and the $1 billion in permanent costs out, obviously a step in the right direction.
but i guess how can you address the deficiencies in the network as you see them?
raj subramaniam -- president and chief executive officer
well, thank you, brandon. i think we are absolutely fully committed to taking cost levers out. we talked about the three buckets, fiscal year '23, the $2.2 billion to $2.7 billion with -- for cost take-out here. we're talking about $4 billion between '23 and '25 and then in the network 2.0 of $2 billion after that.
so, those are significant numbers. we are confident in these numbers. we have identified domains with targets. we have people who are focusing on run the business and people focused on transform the business.
and we are using cutting-edge technology and some of it is already coming on live here. and all of this is in motion as we speak to deliver value as quickly as possible. so, we are confident, we are committed, and this is definitely the focus of the entire team. as far as tnt is concerned, since you asked that question, you got to go back and look at the -- a little bit of history here.
there's a portfolio gap that we had in europe that our competition has -- has been in europe since 1974, and it took -- it's a very important business and profitable business for them. we had to fill that portfolio gap. now, has the integration gone exactly the way we thought it would? no, because we had the cyberattack, we had covid, we had all kinds of things in the middle. but the integration is now complete, and the -- that part of it is done.
we had -- the service issues are getting better. and we have in our portfolio to sell in europe that's unmatched and sales is getting on the front foot. so, this is a starting point, if you would call, and that's why we are confident of the improvements that europe is going to deliver for us over the next two or three years. and again, on the issue of network 2.0, it's very easy to say yes, put it together and look at the numbers, yes, that's great.
but the complexity of -- from a technology perspective, from a facilities perspective, other issues is far greater. and most importantly, we have $4 billion of in-network efficiencies we can get relatively easier than that. and oh, by the way, we're building technology that will enable us to get the network 2.0. so, we think it's the right sequence.
operator
we will take our next question from jordan alliger with goldman sachs. please go ahead.
jordan alliger -- goldman sachs -- analyst
yeah. hi. sort of question for you in light of what could you have done different in the quarter. i guess the magnitude of the express drop-off was so sharp and i get that [inaudible] decelerated.
but i'm just curious, like how did it catch you so off-guard? how do you protect against that in the future? and i would have thought that with the contractual customers you've had, you might have had more of a heads-up that this deceleration was coming. so, maybe you could talk to that. thank you.
raj subramaniam -- president and chief executive officer
let me talk about the -- talk about timing and then maybe, brie, if you want to add about what's up on the customers. but the volume did drop off quite suddenly toward the end of the quarter. as you know, we have a complex system form with which multiple constituencies around that. and there's a time lag between the actions we can take on reducing the line haul network.
and that's all it is. so, as i said, in october, you will see the full benefit of those takedowns. in terms of customer trends, i don't know, brie, if you want to add anything more.
brie carere -- executive vice president and chief customer officer
yeah. what i will say is that from a customer perspective, our customers are incredibly sticky. and what we experienced, especially in august, both in asia and here in the united states is two things, is their demand actually wasn't there and our customers missed their own forecasts. so, i think from a customer relationship perspective, we are working with them furiously to help them manage their -- the difficulties that they're experiencing in their own business.
but from a customer stickiness perspective, this is absolutely a reduction of demand within their own business, not a share loss implication.
mike lenz -- chief financial officer
yeah. jordan, this is mike. we also are very intently focused on identifying these variable costs and shortening the time span of which we can realize the reduction there. so, again, there's a span and continuum across different lines of business and nature of costs, but we are intently focused on shortening that horizon.
operator
we will take our next question from helane becker with cowen. please go ahead.
helane becker -- cowen and company -- analyst
thanks very much, operator. hi, team. so, just kind of wondering if you could be more specific on flights that you're reducing and parking aircraft to get to this $1.6-ish billion number. like how should we think about the trade lanes that are going to be impacted and maybe the number of aircraft that are going to be on the ground? or do you change your boeing delivery schedule?
raj subramaniam -- president and chief executive officer
i'll -- let me hit the trade lanes first and then we'll go to aircraft. i think we have -- we've taken down 11% of trans-pacific daily frequencies, 9% of transatlantic daily frequencies, and 17% of daily frequencies in the lane between asia and europe. and we will continue to look at it and we'll see what needs to happen post peak, depending upon how the volume we will sold. mike?
mike lenz -- chief financial officer
yeah, helane. in taking that down, we're maintaining connectivity and service in the network, but there's lower volume, so we need less lift. so, as a result, we identified the need to -- the opportunity to park aircraft, just as we have demonstrated in the past, the equivalent of about eight narrow-bodies is what we will be idling temporarily. and so, as you can appreciate, that defers maintenance spending that we otherwise would have had.
and of course, you save the operating costs of not flying. so, we'll continue to take that approach for how conditions unfold.
operator
we'll take our next question from chris wetherbee with citi. please go ahead.
chris wetherbee -- citi -- analyst
hi. thanks. good afternoon. i guess i wanted to understand the process of the cost-outs, particularly this year.
so, i think you guys mentioned that $300 million of cost savings is in the fiscal first quarter, another $700 million is realized or expected to be realized in the second quarter. so, that's about 40% or so over the full year, yet the results are running at a level that is about half of what we expected just a week or so ago. so, is this the kind of run rate we should expect as we move into the back half of the year with that extra $1.2 billion to $1.7 billion of costs coming in? or is there improvement? i guess i'm just struggling, particularly with the second quarter with the $700 million of cost savings relative to ebit for the total company, which may be in the neighborhood of $1 billion or a little bit north of that.
mike lenz -- chief financial officer
ok. chris, so this is mike. let me take that in two parts. first, you asked about the second quarter in that.
so, as we emphasize, we saw the downturn in the demand in the latter part of q1. and as we expect those trends to persist through all of q2, while we've accelerated or we'll realize more of the cost savings in q2 as you highlight, we also have three full months of that step change in demand that occurred late in q1. so, that certainly pressures q2 margins. as we go through the year, the savings build, and we expect then that the pressures relative to q2 will mitigate as we go through -- be less as we go through the year.
operator
we will take our next question from ken hoexter with bank of america. please go ahead.
ken hoexter -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
hey. great. good afternoon. just before i get to the question, i just wanted to understand why you chose to launch your q&a with cnbc versus hosting a conference call.
i just want to understand the philosophy of what we can expect of the message going forward and how you plan on distributing it. obviously, you had technical issues today, but just to try to understand why you chose that route in getting a message out. but my question is, how do you solve the festering ground contractor issue? it seems like you talked about purchase transportation cost scaling. you mentioned in your statements, you've pulled some networks.
some have turned their routes in. it seems like there's really deep concern. is there opportunity to use this, i don't know whether the cost savings or something, to change the structure there, to resolve some of these issues that the contractors seem to have. thanks.
mike lenz -- chief financial officer
ken, this is mike. first, as it relates to your question about the prerelease, so we felt that was appropriate for the circumstances. that's consistent with market practices and, quite frankly, allowed us to use more time today to be talking about how we're going to address it and our future plans.
raj subramaniam -- president and chief executive officer
as far as the perceived issues on the ground side, let me just assure you, first of all, that the service levels at fedex ground are now reached pre-pandemic levels and we are very well positioned for peak. the 6,000 contractors, we have 96% of them have signed the peak incentive program. and to put that in perspective, this is running ahead of where we were last year. so, a lot of those were in the media.
they are all much more of a perception issue than reality, and we are well positioned for peak, and we have the support from our team.
operator
we will take our next question from amit mehrotra with deutsche bank. please go ahead.
amit mehrotra -- deutsche bank -- analyst
thanks. hi, everyone. mike, i just wanted to ask about the cost-out initiatives this year and if it's a gross or net number because, obviously, the company has a $90 billion cost structure. if it's not net, $2.2 billion to $2.7 billion, it may sound like a lot but if you have 3% inflation on that number, it wipes out the entirety of the cost savings.
so, i want to know how you think about that if that's a fair or unfair way of characterizing it. and then just very simply, are express profits going up from here in the fiscal second quarter, or are they going down from here? if you can just answer that as well. thank you.
mike lenz -- chief financial officer
so, amit, first, as we said, the $2.2 billion to $2.7 billion is relative to our cost plans that we had coming into the year. now as you rightfully observed, we, as everybody else in the world, is experiencing unprecedented levels of inflation, and so that absolutely impacts our base costs. i guess the best way i would characterize it for you is on an absolute cost basis, the first quarter is the largest of the absolute year-over-year increase. as we move through the year, that will mitigate as the cost initiatives take traction here, and that will offset the cost inflation down the road.
i'm sorry, what was the second question?
amit mehrotra -- deutsche bank -- analyst
well, just if you're just giving me a chance to follow up on that. and then the second question was if express profits are going up from where we were in the fiscal first quarter, the 1.7% margin or even just absolute profits, are they going up or are they going down in the second quarter? and the way you characterized the answer just now, it just seems like there's still no -- if inflation offsets the growth cost takeout, then basically all of the revenue decline prospectively drops to the bottom line. and so, i just wanted to understand how you -- if you agree with that or how you think about that.
mike lenz -- chief financial officer
no, it wouldn't drop to the bottom line because of the actions we're taking. we're reducing costs to adjust to a lower-demand environment. so, while that doesn't leave us at the expectations that we highlighted -- that we outlined in june, it's certainly the case that we're significantly mitigating that as we go through the year. as it relates to express, i would -- as i highlighted earlier, the demand downturn, particularly in asia-pacific, and in europe occurred late in q1.
so, q2 will be -- we'll see margin pressure, again, at express, not dissimilar to what we experienced in q1. but the structural initiatives really gain hold at express as we move through q2. so, as you think about the overall cost-outs, express has more as we move through the year because just of the timing of the big elements there.
operator
we will take our next question from jack atkins with stephens. please go ahead.
jack atkins -- stephens inc. -- analyst
ok. thank you for taking my question. so, i guess, raj, going back to a comment you made earlier about the team, do you feel like you've got the right senior team in place to lead fedex into the future? there's a clear lack of outside talent on the senior executive committee. your largest competitor has really benefited from bringing in some outside talent over the last five or so years.
do you think it would make sense for fedex to do that as you look forward to really put in some best practices and help drive improved profitability and returns? it seems like that's sort of a missing element to the story here.
raj subramaniam -- president and chief executive officer
jack, i think i'm very, very confident in the team that we have. there's a lot of experience here. we have several new players in place. the team is very, very excited.
obviously, we'll look at external talent. we already brought an external talent on several areas of this company, so they're not worse of that at all. it's just that we have a very, very good team, jack, and i'm very confident that we can deliver.

we will take our next question from jon chappell with evercore isi. please go ahead.
jon chappell -- evercore isi -- analyst
thank you. good afternoon. brie, i want to ask you about the service challenges that you referenced. i just want to make sure, is that strictly in europe? we're now six months past the finality of the integration of tnt.
are you confident that those service issues are behind you? and then the final thing is you think about cost cutting across all the regions, is there a risk that cost-cutting could exacerbate some of the service issues going forward?
brie carere -- executive vice president and chief customer officer
great question. and let me answer the second part first. the answer is absolutely not. at fedex, one of the things we talk about a lot is quality-driven management and core service actually costs more.
and our teams are completely aligned that we are going to reduce cost and continue to improve service. and i cannot emphasize that enough that these things will move hand in hand, and we are very confident in our service at ground as we head here into the peak season for e-commerce. when we're talking about service in europe, as raj mentioned, the margin integration of the airline was successful. we successfully integrated the airline.
it was very complicated, and we did suffer some service challenges in march. as we stood in front of you in june, we absolutely had improvement from that march point. we did expect continued improvement in july and august. and what we experienced in europe was a plateau in that service improvement.
and i want to be really specific. when we get into europe, the international domestic markets, when we talk about like our u.k. market or we talk about the france market, that domestic service is actually really, really strong. and then when we get across europe on the deferred service offerings, it's strong.
we have to elevate the service within our overnight business in europe, and that is our no. 1 focus from a service perspective. and yes, i am confident that karen and her team will continue to improve there. but i just wanted to kind of give you that background of kind of where we're at and what we're looking at moving forward.
and absolutely, our entire team knows, reduce cost, and improve service.

we will take our next question from ravi shanker with morgan stanley. please go ahead.
ravi shanker -- morgan stanley -- analyst
hi, everyone. so, regarding the gri you announced, how do you reconcile pushing through your biggest rate increase in history at a time when your volumes are falling double digits? i mean, isn't that going to exacerbate the volume decline?
brie carere -- executive vice president and chief customer officer
fair question. i think the answer is inflation. last year, we had a 5.9% increase in post, and by the way, we have just an incredible insight into our pricing discipline in the market and the commercial tools the team have are just best-in-class. so, last year, we did a 5.9%.
it was incredibly sticky. we had continued cost increases throughout the year, and so we felt that the 6.9% was appropriate for this year's gri. we will monitor post-implementation stickiness. and of course, we're constantly looking to balance the yield and the volume and make sure that we get the right volume levels from a utilization perspective.
but given the inflationary backdrop, yes, we thought this was the right increase for the year.
operator
we will take our next question from ari rosa with credit suisse. please go ahead.
ari rosa -- credit suisse -- analyst
great. thanks. so, raj, as i look at fedex freight, it's now producing almost four times the operating income of express. just could you talk maybe about how you think about the sustainability of the performance on the freight side, particularly as we head into a potential downturn? and then to what extent, if we see some of the strength at freight starting to wane, is it possible that starts to eat into some of the gains that you might see from cost savings at the other units?
raj subramaniam -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. thank you, ari, for that question. first of all, let me just say, our fedex freight team has done -- continue to do a phenomenal job of both managing revenue quality and our operating efficiency to generate fantastic results. and they also form a great piece of our portfolio and also provide synergies on the cost side.
the point that you made is important because -- but we have -- when there's a significant change, when we went to our last downturn, that we were very much focused on revenue quality and efficiency. and as even through the downturn, actually, the margins expanded. and so, we are very disciplined in this area, and we are executing the plan. we'll have to watch how the market conditions change.
our volumes have actually, as you can see, have declined, and yet the margins have gone up. and the team has done a fantastic job and i expect them to do that going forward.
operator
we will take our next question from bruce chan with stifel. please go ahead.
bruce chan -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
yes. thanks, operator. raj, brie, i just want to go back to some of your earlier comments and maybe just ask it bluntly. when you think about the miss, how much of the shortfall was volume-related, and how much was from those european service issues? and maybe just a follow-up, if you can give us some color on what exactly you mean by service issues? i might have missed it but it's not really clear to me what that means.
was it, i guess, customer attrition? and if so, can that come back? thank you.
brie carere -- executive vice president and chief customer officer
so, the short answer is the vast majority of our volume miss was macroeconomic. we talked about it, kind of when you think about the miss, it really was predominantly at express, with asia being the largest issue. we believe that was entirely macroeconomic. and then when we get into europe, there was a split between service and the macroeconomic decline.
i will tell you two things. from a service perspective, when we say service issues, specifically what we're talking about is on the express portfolio within europe, across the european network is that we are not hitting that time-definite mark at the level that we expect of fedex. and so, we need to kind of increase that service commitment there. what i will tell you is that the sales team and our customer base absolutely wants fedex participating in this market.
and we have had strong indications that customers are looking for us in their portfolio in europe. we have great relationships with large globals here in the united states, and they want us as part of their portfolio in europe. so, i'm very optimistic about the future in europe.

we will take our next question from bascome majors with susquehanna. please go ahead.
bascome majors -- susquehanna international group -- analyst
raj, you've managed through a lot of change at fedex since 2016. just to mention the tnt acquisition, the cyberattack, the trade war downturn and the pandemic, a change in leadership from a founder, and whatever we're going to call the cyclical reversal when we look back on it in a few years here. but as you step back and reflect, are there any management mistakes that fedex did make? and if so, what can you learn from those mistakes to set your customers and your shareholders up for success over the next three to five years? thank you.
raj subramaniam -- president and chief executive officer
well, bascome, i think that's an excellent question. and let me just think about this for a second. you see, 2016 was we're primarily in the b2b space. and when you look ahead of the market, we thought 90% of the growth for the next five years is going to be e-commerce and 10% b2b.
well, you look back now and look at that time frame, we see almost, not 90% but more than 100% of the growth came from e-commerce. so, we actually expanded our e-commerce portfolio in a big way and expanded our operations. we're very proud of the work we did in creating this portfolio of services in this time frame. we also did one of the most important work in the history of the company, especially with express by delivering vaccines and healthcare around the world and especially in the time of the great pandemic, where operating a network like ours around the world was extraordinarily complex with changing circumstances.
so, i'm extremely proud of the team for having executed that. so, this is the time frame we're talking about. so, what we did not anticipate, to be perfectly honest with you, was the tremendous inflation of costs that hit us squarely last year. and that was what really got us.
and even with that, we had tremendous results in fiscal year '22 from an eps perspective. but we absorbed a lot of costs from the inflation side of the house. and then, of course, and now that we're dealing with this situation, we had to build capacity and now we have more capacity than we need. so, could we have timed that a little better? i don't know how you're going to calculate it.
it's like you can't build half a building. so, it's just -- it is now we are in a position to -- as we laid out at the investor meeting, we are focusing on the things we have control. we are -- our focus is now on improvement of margins, improvement of roic, and improve our capital intensive. that's what we're going to do.
and this -- again, the economic upturn or downturn, forget about that for a second. let's focus on the things we can control. and that's why this tremendous cost focus and the structural costs that we are talking about, that's going to get us to these targets.

we will take our next question from todd fowler with keybanc capital markets. please go ahead.
todd fowler -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
great. thanks, and good evening. so, i just want to make sure i understand the underlying macro assumptions. mike, is it that the trends that you saw in august, that that's kind of the run rate now going into the second quarter? or do you expect some further deceleration from where we were in august? and then is there a risk that there's contagion or we see weakness in asia and then that comes into the u.s.? or just kind of how are you thinking about the geographic piece of it? and then lastly, we typically have seen price follow volume.
and so, is there a risk on the yield front that as volumes slow, that price follows after that? thanks.
mike lenz -- chief financial officer
ok, todd. so, yes, the basic underlying planning assumptions that we are using is that the demand levels that we experienced in late august will continue through the rest of the year, and so that we're taking actions accordingly to react to that. so, that's the operating assumption now. i don't have a crystal ball about contagion in that.
but rest assured, we are going to be continuing to focus on the things we can control. and if we need to make further adjustments and reductions in the cost structure, we will move quickly and decisively.

jeff kauffman -- vertical research partners -- analyst
thank you very much, and thank you for the guidance on the cost savings as well. i just wanted to ask because i noticed that the other corporate and overhead part of operating income was about $100 million higher than a year ago. it costs money to park planes and i don't know if you're furloughing pilots or you're reducing those hours. it costs money to reduce routes or consolidate sorts or shut down offices.
do you guys have any estimate for where those costs are going to be? how much they're going to be? where are they running through the regular p&l during the quarter? or was that the $100 million in incremental costs that i saw going through kind of corporate office and other?
mike lenz -- chief financial officer
jeff, yeah. let me just specifically address the $100 million, you can put it into two pieces. we had a specific customer bad debt reserve that we booked for $80 million at fedex logistics. and so, while we are pursuing legal action, it was the appropriate reserve to take at this point in time.
and then while we separate it out in terms of our adjusted earnings, there's also $24 million of our business realignment is in that corporate/other line. so, maybe that gives a little more context for what's there. to clarify, as far as any other -- no charges or anything that was specific to the items you were asking about.
raj subramaniam -- president and chief executive officer
and there is also no furlough of the pilots. that's not even a thing.
operator
we will take our next question from david vernon with bernstein. please go ahead.
david vernon -- sanford c. bernstein -- analyst
hey, good afternoon. so, i appreciate the added color on the cost saves, but reductions from baseline, kind of difficult to book as profitability. ten weeks ago, we were looking at a low $20 -- eps number going to something in the low $30s. is there any to think that those targets for earnings power have actually shifted as a result of what's happening in the market right now or are we just pushing those out? and does the $4 billion of extra cost saves just kind of gets you back to that 10% margin level?
mike lenz -- chief financial officer
i think, david, the way to frame it is that we fully recognize that the external environment has changed more than we expected. so, we're focused on delivering the margin improvement, lowering the capital intensity that we highlighted, but it's absolutely the case that a greater emphasis will be put on the cost reductions. and so, that's what we're highlighting here today. and we have the specific initiatives and plans in place to go after that and realize that as supportive of the goals that we outlined.
operator
we will take our next question from jairam nathan with daiwa. please go ahead.
jairam nathan -- daiwa securities -- analyst
hi. thanks for taking my question. so, i just wanted to clarify. are there any -- should we account for any cash restructuring expenses or anything of that sort for these cost savings?
mike lenz -- chief financial officer
so, to clarify, for the cost savings that we've identified for fy '23, no, there's nothing associated with that. now previously, as we talked about the broader business optimization initiatives over a number of years, we scoped that that could be potentially in the $2 billion range but that is over a longer time horizon. but the near-term cost initiatives, there is no special charge for that.
operator
that concludes today's question-and-answer session. at this time, i will turn the conference back to raj subramaniam for any additional or closing remarks.
raj subramaniam -- president and chief executive officer
well, thank you very much. and in closing, let me just say, it goes without saying, it was a challenging quarter. this is a real critical moment in time for fedex to execute and i'm very confident that we will. the actions we are taking are key components on the path to achieve our long-term targets and make fedex stronger for a better tomorrow.
thank you for your time today, and thank you for your interest in fedex.

operator
good day, everyone, and welcome to today's fedex corporation second quarter fiscal 2023 earnings call. today's call is being recorded. and now, at this time, i would like to turn the call over to mickey foster, vice president of fedex investor relations. please go ahead.
unknown speaker
you may start.
mickey foster -- vice president, investor relations
good afternoon and welcome to fedex corporation's second quarter earnings conference call. the second quarter earnings release, form 10-q, and stat book are on our website at fedex.com. this call and the accompanying slides are being streamed from our website, where the replay and slides will be available for about one year. joining us on the call today are members of the media.
during our question-and-answer session, callers will be limited to one question in order to allow us to accommodate all those who would like to participate. i want to remind all listeners that fedex corporation desires to take advantage of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act. certain statements in this conference call such as projections regarding future performance maybe considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of the act. such forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties, and other factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements.
for additional information on these factors, please refer to our press releases and filings with the sec. please refer to the investor relations portion of our website at fedex.com for a reconciliation of non-gaap financial measures discussed on this call to the most directly comparable gaap measures. joining us on the call today are raj subramaniam, president and ceo; mike lenz, executive vice president and cfo; and brie carere, executive vice president and chief customer officer. before we begin, i'd like to take a moment to remember our colleague, jeff smith, who passed away on november 17th after a courageous battle with brain cancer.
jeff's contributions to the investor relations and fedex team were immeasurable, and our hearts remain heavy at his loss. he will be greatly missed. separately, i'd like to congratulate elizabeth allen on her upcoming retirement at the end of the month after 32 years at fedex. elizabeth has been instrumental to the investor relations team, and she will be missed by her fedex colleagues and the investment community alike.
and now, raj will share his views on the quarter.
raj subramaniam -- president and chief operating officer
thank you, mickey, and good afternoon, everyone. let me begin by thanking our more than 550,000 employees who are working diligently to deliver another strong peak season for our customers. i'm extremely proud of the team's ability to sustain excellent service this season while we continue to transform our global network. bz to the fedex team.
i'm encouraged by our second quarter results and the momentum underway against our deliver today, innovate for tomorrow strategy. we exceeded our q2 earnings target and cost action goals shared in september even as the environment remained challenged. at the same time, there is more work to be done. the declining demand trends we saw at the end of q1 softened further in the second quarter, and we are moving faster and with more determination than ever to accelerate our cost actions.
today, we will provide more detail on those cost actions and our plan to structurally transform our network to be nimbler, leaner, and more efficient, supported by our drive program. turning to slide 6 for a snapshot of the quarter. volumes declined across all segments, primarily in express down low double digits. as such, revenue was down 3%, driven by a decline at fedex express, which was partially offset by growth at fedex freight and fedex ground.
adjusted operating margin and eps declined, with volume weakness partially offset by higher yield and cost management actions. all of this said, we knew coming into this quarter that we would continue to be challenged by volume softness and high inflation. i'm exceptionally proud of the team's execution to date, which enabled us to exceed the second quarter earnings and cost targets. a great example of our meticulous focus on cost actions was the results at fedex ground, where despite volume being down 9% in the quarter, we were able to grow both operating income and margin; and at fedex freight, due to operating margin improved 320 basis points due to the continued focus on revenue quality, aligning the cost structure to lower volume levels, and delivering an outstanding customer experience.
now, i'll provide an update on our aggressive and decisive plan to cut costs in fiscal '23 relative to our june plan. in q2, we achieved over $900 million of savings, exceeding the cost target we shared with you last quarter. this brings our total year-to-date progress to $1.2 billion. as we look to the remainder of the fiscal year, we have identified additional savings, bringing our target for fiscal year '23 to be approximately $3.7 billion in cuts.
turning to slide 8. as we execute these cost actions, we are also laser-focused on delivering upon the superior service that has defined fedex throughout our nearly 50-year history. as i mentioned, our team is performing exceptionally well this peak season with ground, time, and transit in the u.s. at just two days.
fedex ground is delivering holiday shipments faster to more locations than our nearest competitor. our ground service is now back to pre-pandemic levels supported by continued enhancements to our route optimization and package handler scheduling technologies. service levels also continue to improve at express. in europe, we have made strong progress, with italy, france, germany, spain, and the u.k.
showing sustained high levels of service performance. the service challenges at paris' charles de gaulle airport have been largely alleviated, and we are capitalizing on efficiencies in the network to further improve service. we're taking swift action to address the remaining issues for our intra-europe service, including the reopening of our netherlands ground hub in october, which will continue to improve transit and depressurize the rest of the network, and completing the novara, italy road hub in february of 2023. moving to slide 9, i'll now provide an update on our ongoing structural transformation.
we have spent 50 years building our networks and growing our portfolio. as a result, we now have the most extensive network of any provider in the industry. we are now focused on optimizing this network to realize our full value potential. this includes advancing our global transformation through drive, our comprehensive program to support long-term profitability and deliver on our fiscal year '25 financial targets.
drive is how we are executing that strategy, achieving more than $4 billion in annualized structural cost reductions by fiscal year 2025. i'm confident i have the full commitment of our executive team for leading drive with purpose and a sense of urgency and with sriram krishnasamy, our chief transformation officer, who's facilitating the program. we've identified 14 specific focus areas, which we call domains, to target for efficiency improvements. each is led by an executive sponsor and is aligned around our strategic vision for the business.
we are measuring success against each domains fy '25 permanent cost savings target, in addition to using clear operational metrics to track financial and service-level progress. our focus within drive is in three main areas: fedex express, fedex ground, and shared and allocated overhead expenses. at express, the team is transforming the network to be more agile, efficient, and digitally led. an initial priority is to optimize the global air network, where we expect to generate approximately $400 million in savings.
this work includes deploying digital assets that allow us to efficiently balance our purple-tail airplanes and third-party lift as we build the network of the future. we are also addressing our express pickup and delivery operations globally to improve efficiency. in february, we will implement a new u.s. network design that will improve p&d efficiency and result in cost savings of approximately $300 million annually.
in europe, where we expect over one-third of express' drive savings, we have spent the last several years bringing the networks together. with integration behind us, we have shifted to optimization. we are adjusting our network, deploying route productivity tools, and investing in digital capabilities for planning and automation. additionally, we are rightsizing our intra-europe air network and improving processes to enhance the end-to-end customer journey.
this will all serve to improve both service and profit of our european business. now, turning to fedex ground. we are focused on every portion of the package lifecycle. for instance, in line haul operations, we are planning new tools, technology, and processes to drive increased packages for trailer.
within ground, we have a dock domain. this team's responsibility is to improve packages for labor hour. in q2, that metric increased 3.5% year over year, and we expect continued improvement as we deploy additional capabilities. across both the express and ground focus areas, we are leveraging our operational insights platform.
this provides the foundational data, tools, and insights critical not only for delivering drive savings goals but also for sustaining those savings and transforming the way we operate. finally, shared and allocated overhead expenses are a significant opportunity. this includes procurement and digitizing and centralizing support functions. one example of digitizing support functions is our ability to reduce customer service calls by redirecting customers to best-in-class digital applications.
a win for fedex and a win for our customers. within procurement, we are reducing spend through our operate collaboratively model and creating a central function to optimize our enterprise spend. for example, we are setting up a cross-opco initiative to consolidate our contract transportation spend to realize value in the second half of fiscal year '23. in conclusion, there is strong momentum underway as our team focuses on cutting costs immediately and structurally transforming our network.
we will continue to provide updates on our drive progress, and we plan to host a drive deep dive call in the first half of calendar 2023 to provide additional details on our ongoing transformation. now, let me turn it over to our chief customer officer, brie carere, to discuss recent market trends and our commercial strategy in more detail.
brie carere -- executive vice president and chief marketing and communications officer
thank you and good afternoon. as expected, the operating environment in the second quarter was challenging. the trends we saw toward the end of the first quarter persisted through november. as a result, we experienced lower demand for fedex products and services.
but we acted with urgency to adjust our network while continuing to deliver for our customers. revenue at fedex express was down 6% year over year, primarily due to volume and yield softness in europe and asia. in europe, we're making steady progress as volume trends improved quarter over quarter. i'm confident in our momentum as we have a robust sales pipeline in europe.
we are leveraging our faster road network and our unique ability to bundle parcel and freight. as we anticipated, the softening demand created yield pressure, especially in asia. despite volume softness, i am pleased with the team's ability to manage volume, share, and margin in our trans-pacific lane. at fedex ground, revenue was up 2% due to higher yield, driven by fuel surcharges, base rate increases, and improved product mix.
it was partially offset by lower volumes. we once again delivered strong service levels and best-in-market transit times. at fedex freight, we delivered solid performance despite the operating environment beginning to moderate. pricing discipline across the ltl industry is strong, and we expect the market to remain rational.
revenue was up 8% as the team remains laser-focused on driving improved revenue quality and profitable share growth. while navigating the current environment, fedex freight continues to innovate. we're expanding dimensional capture and piloting dimensional weight-based pricing. we believe that simplified pricing is the future of the ltl industry, and we're leading in this transformation.
i also wanted to provide an update on our enterprise pricing strategy and the initiatives to improve revenue quality. we remain disciplined. we are focused on growth in the right segments to optimize network profitability. we announced a 6.9% general rate increase in september, and i remain confident in a continued high capture rate.
we are also continuing to leverage surcharges to align our pricing to cost. our recent announcements for demand-based large package and u.s. export fuel surcharge are good proof points. i'm also very pleased with the team's progress to create new capabilities.
a great example is the partnership between pricing and dataworks to build a price anomaly detection engine. the team has had success detecting overbilling and correcting invoices before they are sent to our customers. this is a significant customer experience improvement. we are now adapting these capabilities to identify underbilling opportunities, which will increase revenue quality.
as we look toward the back half, service improvement has translated into good momentum for our sales team. in addition, we have a robust pipeline aligned with our strategy, which includes small and medium and european segment targets. and q4, we will be lapping the impact of the beginning of the war in the ukraine, as well as the air integration disruption we experienced in the region. as a result, our year-over-year volume comps will improve as we move through the back half of this fiscal year.
however, in asia, we do expect to face continued yield pressure due to lower demand for priority services. in the current economic environment, the market is increasingly shifting to deferred services. we have the deferred portfolio to capture the shift in demand, and our drive program will ensure we have the right cost to serve to profitably manage through this market transition. in conclusion, we remain prudent in our expectations for volume and yield in the second half of the fiscal year.
that being said, our service value proposition relative to our competition will remain strong. and in fact, our relative market position will improve in the back half of the year. and with that, i'll turn it over to our chief financial officer, mike lenz.
mike lenz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thanks, brie. i'll start on slide 16. in the second quarter, we delivered improved alignment between variable costs and lower revenue amid a more challenged volume environment that impacted our profitability. second quarter revenue was approximately $700 million below the lower end of the range we expected coming into the quarter.
approximately 300 million of this variance was due to an accelerated decline in forwarding revenue at fedex logistics. the remaining variance versus our q2 outlook was driven about half by express and the balance by ground and freight combined. we have moved faster to offset this shortfall with cost reductions, reducing the lag between incremental volume softness and the savings offsets realized. this, combined with an additional $200 million in discrete cost actions, led to improved earnings relative to our q2 outlook.
turning to the transportation segments. starting with express, profitability continues to be pressured. adjusted operating income declined 65% due to lower volumes as cost reductions lagged accelerating volume declines. volume pressures were partially offset by yield management actions.
package yield grew 8% year over year, primarily driven by higher fuel surcharges and base rates, partially offset by exchange rate impacts. yield improvement slowed from q1 levels across nearly all products and regions. at ground, operating income increased 24% and operating margins expanded 130 basis points to 7.1%, supported by yield growth of 13% as higher fuel surcharges, product mix, and pricing initiatives drove improvement. our cost reduction actions, combined with solid execution by the ground team to adjust near-term variable costs amid greater volume declines, also supported margin improvement.
these factors were partially offset by increased costs, including higher purchase transportation and other operating expenses. and at freight, the team continues to drive strong profitability, with operating income increasing 32%. this was driven by yield improvement, including higher fuel surcharges, partially offset by decreased shipments, as well as higher wage rates. turning to slide 17, i'd like to build on what you heard from raj on our near-term cost savings, reviewing our progress by category.
as mentioned, we've identified $3.7 billion in discrete cost reductions relative to our plans going into fiscal '23, which is $1 billion higher than our prior projection. express is where we have the most work to do and where the majority of the reductions are focused. a large portion of those savings is coming from reduced flight frequencies. year to date, we've reduced eight international routes and 32 u.s.
domestic routes while parking five additional aircraft. this translates into pulling down u.s. domestic flight hours by 6% and international flight hours down 7% in the second quarter year over year. moving to 18, in addition to the expense actions, we are also lowering our fy '23 capital spend forecast by an incremental $400 million to 5.9 billion, which represents an approximate $900 million reduction from our initial plans for the year.
with the lower demand environment, we're deliberately deferring and slowing the pace of projects as we maintain the emphasis on using our assets more efficiently and reducing our overall capital intensity. our liquidity remains a source of strength, and we ended the quarter with 4.6 billion in cash. we continue to generate solid cash flows, supporting our capital return strategy. we executed a $1.5 billion accelerated share repurchase transaction, which will be completed by the end of this calendar year.
our capital return strategy reflects our commitment to reducing capital intensity and creating value for shareholders while continuing to reinvest in fedex for today and tomorrow. provide additional context for the changes in demand during the first half and what we are planning for in our outlook, on slide 19, we've shown first half monthly volume trends for our major product categories. volume declines continue to accelerate across major product categories, both in the u.s. and internationally, throughout the second quarter.
as we look to the second half of the year, we expect volume declines to begin moderating at express and ground by the end of the third quarter, with comparisons easing further in the fourth quarter as we lap the onset of softer volumes. yield growth will be increasingly pressured as year-over-year fuel surcharge comparisons normalize and customer demand shifts, most prominently in asia. this brings me to our outlook on slide 20. while we continue to aggressively drive cost reduction actions, we expect business conditions to remain challenging in the second half of fy '23.
our current expectation for full year adjusted earnings per share is between $13 and $14. on a quarterly basis, we expect results to follow our historical seasonal pattern with lower earnings in the third quarter versus the second quarter and highest in the fourth quarter. second quarter adjusted expenses were essentially flat year over year as inflation impacts particularly fuel offset our activity reductions on an absolute basis. as we move through the second half, we project year-over-year expenses to increasingly decline as our cost initiatives accelerate in conjunction with lapping certain inflationary increases.
in closing, i'd like to reiterate that the entire team continues to aggressively identify and implement both immediate cost reductions, as well as structural cost efficiencies, to drive improved performance. with that, we'll open it up for your questions.

operator
thank you. [operator instructions] and we'll first hear from tom wadewitz of ubs.
tom wadewitz -- ubs -- analyst
yeah. good afternoon. wanted to see if you could give a sense of what drives the additional 1 billion in cost takeout. and then, i don't know if you look at the broader frame.
raj, you talked about some of the split, but can you give like the detail or a bit of breakout from express, ground, and shared services on the $4 billion number also? thank you.
mike lenz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
hey, tom, this is mike. so, first, for the additional $1 billion for fy '23 relative to our plans coming into the year, that's mostly at express. it's a combination of further flight reductions; incremental sort cancels, particularly post-peak; adjustments to our ground operations, primarily in the pickup and delivery space. and then i guess another piece i'd highlight, too, was further reductions at our fedex services -- shared services organization, where they're doing a great job of really clamping down on costs relative to what we were contemplating earlier in the year.
as it relates to the 4 billion in drive that we've highlighted, 1.4 billion is for express, 1.1 billion is ground, and then 1.5 billion is in the shared and allocated expenses. and keep in mind that as we approach those, those are structural cost reductions that are irrespective of the demand environment assumption that you would make going forward so that we can achieve a path toward the fy '25 objectives that we outlined. thanks for the question.
tom wadewitz -- ubs -- analyst
great. thank you.
operator
next, we'll hear from helane becker of cowen and company.
helane becker -- cowen and company -- analyst
thanks very much, operator. hi, everybody, and thanks for the time this afternoon. just one question related to the reduction in capex. mike, you talked you're moving -- just to clarify, you're moving that to the right and you will still spend that money.
you will just not spend it this current fiscal year. is that correct?
mike lenz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
so, we certainly have deferred a number of facility projects and initiatives. so, that is a component there, as well as looking to pause other certain major projects that are at a phase of completion as we evaluate the changed circumstances. another piece of it is a change in our aircraft payment schedule as well. so, we've pushed that out further, but the number of deliveries remains unchanged, just the timing on that sense.
helane becker -- cowen and company -- analyst
ok. and then can i just ask a follow-up on -- with respect to salaries, wages, and benefits? i sort of thought the there was some decline there that looked, you know, kind of ok. could you just explain that because you also said during your prepared remarks that salaries were actually up, so kind of missed that?
mike lenz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
well. so, helane, we will see mitigating in terms of the year-over-year increase in wage rates relative to what we were seeing earlier in the year. and in addition, as we flex down the network -- networks, particularly post-peak, we'll have a ramp down in terms of the resources deployed there, as we typically do, but certainly going to move quickly as we come past the successful peak that we're in the middle of right now. so, expect further progress in that line going forward as well.
helane becker -- cowen and company -- analyst
ok. thanks. thank you.
operator
and next, we'll hear from jordan alliger of goldman sachs.
jordan alliger -- goldman sachs -- analyst
yeah, hi. so, question on the $13 to $14 range. maybe some more perspective. obviously, a beat in the second quarter.
you're upping the cost saves by $1 billion. i mean, how do we think about that from a conservative perspective? is it conservative? and, you know -- or maybe some context in your view of the economy? i mean, are we assuming a recession in those numbers because, you know, it would seem, especially with a moderate decline in volume, that the cost savings are basically all the second half operating profit? so, i'm just wondering if you've kind of taken a very conservative approach. thank you.
mike lenz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
sure. thanks, jordan. well, i would highlight, you know, certainly, the environment remains fluid. we outlined our expectations on the trajectory of volume and yield and considered a range of outcomes within the corridor for both of those.
and in conjunction with the cost takeout you highlighted there, we're very confident with the $13 to $14 range. so, while it's true the volume declines, we expect those to moderate as we move through the rest of the year, particularly in q4, we're going to have more yield pressure relative to the increases we saw in the first half of the year. so, when you bring all three of those elements together, that's what gets you to the bottom-line projection there that we've highlighted. but i guess i would also say that while the declines moderate on the volume, we're, in essence, projecting the same demand profile that we're currently experiencing.
so, hopefully, that puts it in full context for you.
jordan alliger -- goldman sachs -- analyst
yeah. thank you so much.
operator
next, we'll hear from ken hoexter of bank of america.
ken hoexter -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
hey, good afternoon. if we could just take that maybe a step further. it seems like of that -- i think jordan just hit it on the -- that you have 1.2 billion of savings so far. so, of your 3.7 target now, that the 2.5, that means all of the second half savings.
i just want to clarify the $7.30 or whatever, $7 or $8 seems like it's all from cost savings, right? and so, the newfound $1 billion, does that mean you were targeting maybe $10 to $11 of earnings before that given that you -- you know, that gets you the back half? and i guess, mike, if you can kind of specify what of that is then structural versus, you know, adjusting for, you know, takeout given the pace of volumes you're seeing.
mike lenz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
ok, ken. how i would address that is, as you saw in the second quarter, the revenue environment was below our expectations. so, therefore, we are assuming that going forward into the second half of the year, which motivated further near-term takeouts of costs relative to what we had planned for fy '23. though we will project revenues to be down year over year in q1, but we're also going to see a ramp-up in absolute expense reductions as we move through q3 and even more so into q4.
so, that's the absolute basis when you look at it for year over year.
ken hoexter -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
and so, that -- are these -- again, just to clarify that, is that -- does that mean these are just reactions to the slowing revenues? and so, it's cyclical versus -- i'm just trying to understand your -- the -- you know, i think investors want to understand what is structural moves that fedex is making here versus just reacting to the decelerating revenue environment. is there a way to clarify that?
mike lenz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
well, ken, maybe, you know, we talked about permanent reductions of $1 billion from fy '23, and that recognizes we were operating in very unique circumstances over the last year and a half, two years. and so, those takeouts would not return under any range of normalized demand scenarios that you might consider. and of course, most of that, that's at express. you know, i mentioned that we parked five additional aircraft at -- during the second quarter.
by the end of the fiscal year, we're projecting to park 11 additional aircraft. so, hopefully, that gives you a little more context for how we're thinking about, you know, resizing the network. and most of those will be widebodies.
ken hoexter -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
great. condolences on jeff. he will be missed. and good luck to elizabeth.
mike lenz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thank you. we really appreciate it.
operator
next, we'll hear from scott group of wolfe research.
scott group -- wolfe research -- analyst
hey, thanks. afternoon. mike, can you just talk about the margin expectations for the segments in the back half? can ground continue to improve? can freight continue to improve? can express get back to margin improvement? and then, brie, you were -- sound like you were talking about pricing slowing. i wasn't sure if that was a parcel comment, an ltl comment.
so, if you could just give us a bit more color. thank you.
mike lenz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
ok, scott, i will start. express margins will remain pressured in the second half. i would say more so in the third quarter versus the fourth quarter given some of the factors we outlined, including ramping up more of the discrete cost reductions into the fourth quarter. we're fully seeing traction in europe, plus lapping the challenges from last year with the air network integration, as well as lapping the volume inflection there.
so, you know, express remains a -- where we have the most work to do. i would say, at ground, we're past the rapid growth and labor challenges that the ground team was executing on over the last two years. and now, they are laser-focused on driving improved productivity and efficiency within a declining volume environment. and so, we saw great progress in that regard here in the second quarter and expect to see continued going forward in the second half of the year.
so, hopefully, that gives little dimensions to the pieces of it. brie, if you want to take --
brie carere -- executive vice president and chief marketing and communications officer
sure. fair question, scott. so, from a yield perspective, let's talk front half versus back half. when we look at the domestic parcel market, we are still anticipating in the back half that we will have yield growth for both express and ground in the parcel market, although less growth than we did in the first half.
the same holds true for fedex freight domestically. back half, we are still anticipating yield growth and the inflationary environment, although much less than the front half. and then as we go to the international markets, the largest change that we will experience in the back half is we are anticipating that we will see our asia yields decrease in the second half. now, i want to be really clear that we've accounted for that within the range that mike has given us, and we also anticipated this.
and the asia team does a really good job of managing volume, yield, and margin. and our trans-pacific lane is still a very profitable and healthy lane for us. so, it is within the range, but that's how we're thinking about yield front half versus back half.
operator
next, we'll hear from brandon oglenski of barclays.
brandon oglenski -- barclays -- analyst
hey, good evening, everyone. and i second ken's thoughts on jeff and elizabeth. guys, can you just help us understand? i mean, if you're going to achieve 3.7 billion this year, isn't that very similar to the 2025 drive target? i think that might be the confusion that a lot of folks aren't fully understanding here. and, mike, we heard you that a billion are permanent this year, but can you talk to maybe the other 2.7 billion that might come back, but then, you know, you're going to set in an incremental 3 billion between now and then? thank you.
mike lenz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
so, brandon, let me -- first, thanks for the kind comments regarding jeff and elizabeth. we will certainly miss both of them. let me give a little more context about the 3.7 billion reduction. appreciate that's reference to our plans coming into '23.
and the purpose of that was to illustrate the scope and magnitude of the cost initiatives that we have undertaken to address the changed circumstances from where we started the year. so, we highlighted we have $1 billion of the permanent reductions in a demand environment as we are today. you know, much of the structure, the flight takedowns that we have made at express, you wouldn't see those coming back. i think you may recall we said, you know, there were always be -- anticipate that there will be cyclical ups and downs.
but as we come out of the current circumstances, when it comes back, it would come back in a different way, and we would be using less of our own purple-tail lift and more of partner lift in order to flow traffic in the most efficient manner possible. so, you know, again, the 4 billion of drive, think about that in the context of a greater emphasis on cost reduction rather than the degree of modest revenue growth we were assuming back in june when we outlined the goals for fy '25. so, that's what the focus is there to that structural cost reduction across a range of demand scenarios that you could envision.
operator
and next, we'll hear from allison poliniak of wells fargo.
allison poliniak -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
hi. good evening. just want to follow up on the last comment. so, just to clarify, the fiscal '25 target, certainly that balance of revenue and cost, you know, based on sort of the macro deceleration, that algorithm clearly changed in terms of how you reach those targets for fiscal '25 just given some of the structural cost actions and challenging growth right now.
mike lenz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
you hit it absolutely, allison. we are -- that's why we have ramped up the degree and intensity around the structural cost reductions. we made great progress to date in identifying those and are looking to use the insights. as we've made progress on those, to identify even more, and if the environment changes, then we will react as you saw we did in the second quarter here to adjust even further in the near term as well.
operator
next, we'll hear from david vernon of bernstein.
david vernon -- alliancebernstein -- analyst
hey, good afternoon, guys, and thank you for taking the time. so, raj, i was wondering if you could maybe kind of bring this stuff up a level, right? if we're talking about $13 to $14 in adjusted earnings in this fiscal year, is that a base from which you can start to build in fiscal '24 and '25, or are we still got a little bit of risk in terms of chasing the ball down the hill from a from an economy standpoint? and then as you think about the longer-term targets that you put out there, is there any, you know, contemplation of actual changes to the product portfolio or the composition of the many different companies that make up fedex as part of this transformation effort, or are we just kind of doing the same sort of mix of stuff a little bit better?
raj subramaniam -- president and chief operating officer
so, david, thanks for the question. and so, i'll just say that i'm just delighted to see how fast we're performing in terms of taking our structural costs down. so, the -- i'm just going to comment on the drive program here because that's what gets us going to that fy '25 goals. our strategy simply is to drive profitable growth and reduce our structural cost while we innovate digitally that helps us get to those goals.
and all of this is built on a strong foundation of service. drive is how we execute that, and i'm extremely thrilled to see the progress we have made and the level of engagement of the entire executive team. we have shown on the slide earlier the 14 domains, each with an executive sponsor. kpis are identified.
we have about 1,200 people involved. and this is not a one-and-done exercise. you know, this -- all the way from initial idea to an executable plan with kpis, this is like a conveyor belt. and then there's a significant amount of will, skill, and rigor as teams move toward execution.
so, this is very important as we think about our fy '24 and '25. we are fundamentally focused on restructuring our cost base, driving profitable growth, and improving our operating margin performance. so, we can't control what the external environment is. we are focused on things we can control.
and, you know, the base that we have in '23, you know, we will use that to come out of this external environment situation much, much better than we went in. and the drive program is a significant component of that. and we will talk to you more about that, you know, in our drive deep dive update for you in the first half of calendar '23. we are constantly looking at the portfolio to see what opportunities there exist.
and when there's something to talk to you about that, we will definitely communicate. thank you, david.
operator
next, we'll hear from stephanie moore of jefferies.
unknown speaker
hi. good afternoon. [audio gap] many thanks for taking our questions. i guess i want to take maybe a higher-level macro question here.
you mentioned continued yield softness in asia. surprised, i guess, to hear that the china reopening wasn't mentioned at all, the potential tailwinds. i'm kind of curious what your guided thoughts are in terms of what's continuing to drive that asia softening as china is potentialy coming back online as an economy and then maybe noticing that we haven't talked about broader economic outlooks and you guys stop giving the monthly economic updates. maybe if you had any thoughts on just general u.s.
economic conditions here looking over the next 12 months. thanks.
raj subramaniam -- president and chief operating officer
thank you very much. let me hit it high level, and then if brie has additional details, she can jump in right afterwards. on the macro aspects of it, you know, one of -- two things we flagged were that the industrial economy is slowing around the world and with europe being the hardest hit and that there is an e-commerce reset, and both those things happened exactly like we said were going to happen. the good news was we are -- we reacted.
we move faster to adjust to these circumstances, and we are absolutely focused on what we can control. and again, i'm very, very proud of the progress we have made. and -- but, again, we know there's more work to be done. and, you know, we will continue to improve our cost structure.
regarding china, we haven't seen any fundamental change in the volume profile one way or the other in the last few weeks. we are obviously monitoring this very, very carefully, and it's very too early for us to make any further comments on this at this time. brie, anything to add here?
brie carere -- executive vice president and chief marketing and communications officer
no, i think that's exactly right. you know, we have the team poised and ready to benefit from any potential. but right now, the demand signals have been pretty consistent over the last couple of weeks. and so, that's how we're planning for the back half.
operator
next, we'll hear from jack atkins of stephens.
jack atkins -- stephens, inc. -- analyst
ok, great. thank you for taking my questions. so, i guess, raj, this one's for you. and i love mike's thoughts as well.
but i would be curious to kind of get your take on structurally what's changing as you look out over the next several years with how the company is allocating capital. i get that, you know, there's a greater emphasis on capital efficiency overall. and, you know, i think everyone appreciates the fact that you guys are monitoring the capex issue very carefully. but as you think about your decisions to invest for both organic and inorganic opportunities, you know, there have been some challenging sort of investments over the past decade.
how is the sort of the framework around how you're thinking about capital allocation changing, if at all, as you look forward, raj?
raj subramaniam -- president and chief operating officer
ok. thank you, jack. listen, we are -- the drive is the way we work, and every project that we now go through has got to go through a significant hurdle to make sure those plans are approved. and then obviously, that has to make sense from a financial perspective and from our -- from roic perspective.
so, you know, the good news, so far, is that the projects that have come through here have -- you know, were, you know, very high returns. and that changes the fundamental way we think about how we go forward here. so, mike, i don't know if you want to add to that.
mike lenz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
jack, look, the high rate of growth, particularly at ground over the past few years, that's in the rearview mirror. and so, we will not be spending as much on facility expansion going forward. the major replacement initiatives we have in front of us over the next couple of years, which ramp down in fy -- beyond fy '25, are our fleet modernization. we have no firm orders beyond fy '25 for new aircraft and the modernization of our memphis hub, which is, as richard likes to call it, the heartbeat of the express network, that will be completed in a few years as well and that will yield efficiencies over the long term.
so, those are major elements within the capital allocation that we have a clear line of sight of those coming down. and hence, you know, as we outlined, we fully expect to be at the 6.5% in '25 and lower beyond that. and hence, we were committed to improving our payout ratio and up the dividend as a reflection of the trajectory and the path that we're headed down in that regard.
operator
[operator instructions] we'll next hear from chris wetherbee of citi.
chris wetherbee -- citi -- analyst
thanks. good evening. you know, raj, i wanted to get your take on what you think about the domestic economy. it seems like the step down in volume activity in the second quarter seem to be more driven by domestic across the segment.
so, i'm curious if you're seeing some of the softness that you had originally flagged in the late summer and into the fall in international sort of cascading here into the u.s. are there maybe some specific customer actions or revenue quality actions that you're taking here in the u.s.?
raj subramaniam -- president and chief operating officer
well, let me just talk about the macroenvironment. i think the main macro issue in the united states is really the e-commerce reset. if you were to just follow along here, prior to the pandemic, e-commerce represented about 16% of retail. during the pandemic, it peaked at about 22%.
and ever since, it's been kind of going down. we are probably, what, 18% or 19% right now. it's still higher than 16, but not quite as 22. so, that's the part of the reset that's going on in the u.s.
domestic package business. of course, we have also taken certain revenue quality actions on some of the segments of the traffic, specifically fedex ground economy. and that's the only other part that would be unique to fedex. but other than that, you know, this is -- i would say, the biggest macro here is e-commerce reset.
operator
amit mehrotra from deutsche bank has our next question.
amit mehrotra -- deutsche bank -- analyst
thanks. hey, everyone. thanks for taking my question. so, mike, i just wanted to ask maybe a couple of quick ones.
so, i wanted to understand the drag in express coming from the european ground business. so, basically, the legacy tnt business because i understand, you know, there's cyclicality in the air network and you're bringing flight hours down, which is great. but i'm just trying to understand, you know, what the legacy tnt business, what the overall impact that has had or will have on kind of the express proper protocol. i don't know if that means that you can give us an idea of what that business is making or losing or the contribution of that business to the overall express profit.
but i think that would be helpful. and then the follow-up i wanted to ask was on the freight business. and, you know, i don't ask a lot of questions about the freight business, but it's a big piece of the profit pool today. i don't know if lance is on, but what i noticed is that the yields in the freight business were down sequentially, which is something we typically haven't seen quarter on quarter.
and of course, this is in the context of fedex being part of kind of that pricing war 12 years ago in the ltl business. is this an indication that fedex is lowering price to get more volumes in freight? can you talk about the pricing discipline in the freight business, both with respect to fedex and also with the industry as you see it as well?
mike lenz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
sure, amit. thanks. i will address europe first, and then i'll let brie address your question about the ltl business. so, look, the opportunity in europe is a significant driver of the upside potential for express.
and we've highlighted the challenges that we had earlier in the calendar year. we have worked past those. the team has momentum there. the leadership team is very focused on winning business, driving more efficiency and productivity, both in the air and in the ground network, and fully confident that we will see significant contributor to improvement in express profitability going forward, with some initial traction on that coming in in q4 in terms of seeing year-over-year improvement.
so, that is absolutely an opportunity for express, and we certainly are confident of getting there. it's taken longer than we would have anticipated, and we've had some events develop along the way. but we're past those, and we're looking forward. brie.
brie carere -- executive vice president and chief marketing and communications officer
thanks, mike. fair question. from a fedex freight perspective, when we looked at q2, the one thing that we did see that was slightly different from q1 is weights actually were slightly down in q2. from a revenue quality perspective, however, we have to remember, number one, that we are seeing all of the public carriers behave very rationally and the market is very disciplined; number two, within that market, fedex freight has the premium value proposition.
we have two types of service. so, we have a great opportunity that is very profitable for fedex to allow customers to move from our priority to our economy service, and we've got two great growth opportunities within fedex freight. we've got fedex freight direct, which we're still seeing high demand for, and we've got a very profitable service into canada that we're very focused on. so, we are going to continue to be disciplined.
we absolutely know the history, and we are focused right now on doing our part to be very disciplined within the industry.
operator
next, we'll hear from scott schneeberger of oppenheimer.
scott schneeberger -- oppenheimer and company -- analyst
thanks very much. raj, one for you and then one for brie. raj, you've given a good overview with regard to drive. i'm just curious when in the first half we may expect this update call and what type of information we'll receive there.
these 14 domains you're targeting, maybe you could speak to, you know, the top 3 or 5 there? i'd be curious to hear. and then, brie, the question for you is, you spoke about improving service levels and a really good pipeline for small- and intermediate-sized businesses. could you delve into that a little bit more on how that's working for you and the sales team domestically and in europe? thank you.
raj subramaniam -- president and chief operating officer
well, thank you, scott. on the -- yes, on the drive part of the equation, you know, we have -- again, as i said, we are very excited about the progress we're making here. the -- some of the -- you know, there are 14 domains. under express, we have the air network domain.
this is about fundamentally restructuring our express air network to be more agile and flexible to changes in demand and also recognizing that deferred parcel and freight will be a bigger component. so, how do we change our networks, firstly, to improve overload density, and then how do we use partner networks, especially to move deferred traffic? and then also looking at the domestic u.s. network to see what other efficiencies we can get there using technology. the other one is europe is part of the domain here and is clearly a big area for focus for us.
we have, you know, $1.1 billion of this as fedex ground. there are, you know, very interesting opportunities there, whether it is through line haul or dock productivity, things like that. and then, of course, back-office shared services is $1.5 billion with this procurement, you know, and improving our efficiency across the board. so, you know, i don't want to take the time here to go through all the detail, but i will -- you know, we will set up a time.
i know we haven't decided on an exact date yet. but at that meeting, we will be going to give you more detail. we'll talk to you about specific kpis that we will track going forward and, you know, give you a full flavor of what this program is all about. and, brie.
brie carere -- executive vice president and chief marketing and communications officer
thanks, raj. so, i love this question. let's talk about our momentum. here in the united states, as we talked about, we've had a great peak.
the ground team and i, i know the operators who are listening, i know we're not done yet. i know we have a very, very busy week still to execute. but as i sit here right now, we've had just stellar service in the field, and i couldn't be more proud of the team. so, as we kind of turn the chapter on this calendar year to next calendar year, domestically, we have the very best value proposition.
we're faster than our primary competition. we have this great new feature, which is getting great response in the field for picture proof of delivery. we have sunday service. we have brand new digital capabilities called estimated date of delivery, which gives our e-commerce retailers greater accuracy on their delivery times.
and we're getting really great feedback. and as you all know, our primary competitor has to manage through a significant labor conversation. so, we're going to come out of this peak very, very strong, and we are very confident in the momentum that jill and her team are building in january. the same is true as we look into europe.
we have got quarter-over-quarter momentum. we've got three primary lines of business that we sell. in the domestics, we are optimizing -- from a domestic perspective, we are there for the profitability of international, and we have an opportunity to optimize those networks and put some volume in the domestic networks. and service is excellent in the domestic networks in europe, and i'm really pleased with karen and the team there.
from an intercontinental perspective, we have a product called fedex international connect plus, and it has done really well for us, and the team has continued to get the right business from europe into the united states. and then from an intra-european perspective, that has been where we're challenged. but i'll tell you, the brand has done a lot of hard work for us. customers want to do business with fedex, and quarter over quarter, we've seen service improvement.
and with that, we have seen our pipeline and the confidence grow. and i believe that you will continue to see quarter-over-quarter improvement out of our european division. so, yes, i'm looking forward to january, and i think we have the best sales team in the business to go and execute the plan i just talked about.
operator
our final question for today will come from brian ossenbeck of j.p. morgan.
brian ossenbeck -- jpmorgan chase and company -- analyst
hey, good evening. thanks for taking the question. maybe just to follow up with brie. can you talk about your confidence in getting that high capture rate from a domestic price perspective and how you're going to balance that with utilization in the declining volume environment? and maybe you can talk a little bit about competition and if you think there's room to see more of that creep in here as more packages go that are lighter weight and in shorter distance and the e-commerce growth you continue to see.
and then separately, you mentioned the teamsters negotiation. we'd really like to hear more about how you're approaching that, both in the near term to make sure that you're able to protect your own service and longer term if that presents any opportunities to gain share.
brie carere -- executive vice president and chief marketing and communications officer
yeah. so, from a pricing perspective, right now, we do anticipate a high capture on our gri here in the united states and around the world. our gri was 6.9 in the u.s., and it's about that around the world, a little bit higher in some places, a little bit lower. with the inflationary environment, most customers understand the need for a high gri.
that being said, i really got the team focused on two things. one, as i mentioned a moment ago, is differentiation. we command a higher yield when we have a better service and a differentiation, and the marketing team is very, very focused on executing that so we can command a higher yield in the market. two, as i talked about in june and then i also talked about the anomaly price detection engine, we are building new capabilities to make sure that we align cost and price really closely, and we're continuing to build some new features out this year, which will also help us get a lift from a revenue quality perspective.
we want to be really, really balanced. we also acknowledge that some of our customers are going to have to choose our deferred portfolio, and we're working really hard to get the cost and the margins right in that product. as far as how we're going to handle the negotiations, we're going to do it professionally and with grace. we want to bring customers on that want to do business with us for the long term.
and so, of course, for our target segments, small business, healthcare, b2b, we want them to be prepared. we want to protect, first and foremost, our loyal base right now. and, you know, jill and her team will have really thoughtful conversations with those customers and make sure that they know we are here for them if they plan ahead and they want to do business with us in the long term.
operator
this concludes the q&a portion of today's call. i will now turn the call back over to raj subramaniam for closing comments.
raj subramaniam -- president and chief operating officer
well, thank you very much. and i'll just say in closing that our team is moving with urgency to accelerate our ongoing transformation. we have made strong progress to date, and we'll build on this momentum as we move into the back half of the year. we all know there's a significant opportunity ahead, and i'm very confident in our team's ability to execute.
thank you all for your time today. thank you for your interest in fedex. and happy holidays, everyone.

and now, fred smith will share his views on the quarter.
frederick w. smith -- chairman & chief executive officer
thank you, mickey. welcome to our call to discuss earnings for the fourth quarter and the full year, and our outlook for fiscal 2019 and beyond. we're very proud of the financial and operational results fedex delivered in fiscal 2018. let me congratulate our more than 425,000 team members worldwide for a job very well done indeed.
fedex express posted solid revenue growth and is making good progress toward improving operating income by $1.2 to $1.5 billion in fiscal 2020 versus fiscal 2017. the fedex ground modernization and optimization are paying off with more efficient handling of the increasing growth of business-to-business and e-commerce shipments.
fedex freight margins are increasing due to an improved industrial business environment and a better balance of volume, pricing, and capacity. our leading edge technologies now allow customers to conveniently pick up, drop off, or ship at approximately 60,000 locations nationwide in the united states.
fy18 was a year of opportunity and quite frankly, challenges, anticipated and unexpected. fedex emerged more competitive than ever. we're committed to increasing our margins, earnings, cash flows, and returns while investing for long-term, profitable success. we believe our share owners, team members, and customers will reap the benefits of this approach by creating sustainable, differentiated advantages.
in all my years at fedex, i've never been so optimistic and so sure of our strategy and our ability to deliver an exciting future. having said that, we do remain concerned, however, about threats that diminish the free flow of goods among countries. freight is a two-way street and fedex supports lowering trade barriers for our customers, not raising them.
finally, let me extend the best wishes of the corporation, the board, and all of our teammates and most importantly, from me personally, to fedex freight president and ceo mike ducker, as he retires this summer. this will be mike's last call. mike has been our partner for more than 43 years and he always answered the call when asked to lead in each new opportunity. whether in europe, asia, or in the americas, mike has been truly the model of our people-service profit philosophy, and i must tell you he's one of the most outstanding leaders in the executives that i have ever seen in any field. mike, you're retiring with our best wishes and we're going to miss you, but since you only live right down the road, we'll see you a lot. here's to you, mike.
so, with that, let me turn it over to alan for his comments.
alan b. graf, jr. -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
thank you, fred. good afternoon, everyone. for the quarter, adjusted earnings were $5.91 per share, up 41% year-over-year, driven by tax benefits and improved operating results that are covered in the earnings released. our adjusted consolidated operating margin was 11.5%. all three transportation segments achieved the fourth quarter operating margin targets that we provided last quarter.
turning to the full year, we finished the year with an adjusted eps of $15.31, that's up 27% year-over-year. we invested more in our people to share some of the benefits of the u.s. tax cuts and jobs act by advancing our annual pay increases for certain u.s. hourly workers to april 1st from the normal october date for 2018. our capital expenditures were $5.7 billion, or 8.7% of revenues.
we repurchased 4.3 million shares, for approximately $1 billion in fy18. in fy18, we contributed $2.5 billion to our tax qualified, u.s. domestic pension plans. regard pensions, i would like to take a few minutes to explain the effect the new pension accounting rules will have on our financial results for fy19. going forward, only the pension service cost will be included in the operating expenses. all the other elements that make up total pension expense will now be classified as other, non-operating expenses, including the year-end mark-to-market adjustment.
for example, in fy18, our total pension expense, excluding mark-to-market and other pension adjustments, was $224 million, while our service cost was $812 million. while there is no impact in that income from these new rules, they will negatively impact our operating margin by about 90 basis points. of course, prior years will be recast to conform to these new rules, so there will be no year-over-year impact once we have an apples-to-apples comparison starting in the first quarter of fy19.
since our primary pension plans are fully funded under erisa, contributions will not be required for the foreseeable future. as a result, most of the service cost expense is really a non-cash item. that has a material effect when modeling our cash flows. while no cash contributions are required in our primary u.s. pension plans, we will make voluntary contributions during fy19, but they will be at a much lower level than the $2.5 billion that we contributed in fy18.
i would also like to comment on the pension de-risking transaction we executed in q4 to remove approximately 20% of our pension liabilities from the balance sheet through an annuity purchase with metlife. the $6 billion transaction was the largest single transaction in our history and it represents a win for both our shareholders and our retirees. this event follows a long line of de-risking activities, including plan design changes and special lump-sum settlements, all designed to reduce the volatility of our pension liabilities and further strengthen our balance sheet.
for fy19, fedex is targeting revenue growth of approximately 9%. we are also targeting the following before year-end mark-to-market retirement plan accounting adjustments and excluding tnt express integration expenses. an operating margin of approximately 8.5% -- remember, that's being reduced by the service cost, and earnings of $17.00 to $17.60 per diluted share.
additionally, we are anticipating an effective tax rate of approximately 25% prior to year-end mark-to-market retirement plan accounting adjustments, which is higher than our fy18 effective tax rate due to tax benefits from transactions and tcja impacts that will not reoccur during fy19. we expect our fy19 cash tax rate to be lower than the u.s. statutory rate of 21% due to the favorable capital expenses provision created by the tcja. cash flows will improve as earnings grow. for fy19, depreciation and amortization is expected to be approximately $3 billion. so, fedex will generate very strong cash flows.
capital spending is expected to decline slightly to $5.6 billion, or about 8% of projected revenues. our tnt integration expenses are projected to be $450 million, and we expect voluntary contributions to our primary pension plans in fy19 to be significantly lower than fy18. last week, we announced that we are boosting our fy19 dividend by 30% to $0.65 per share per quarter. we are confident that we will achieve the operating income improvement at express at $1.2 to $1.5 billion in fy20 versus fy17, assuming moderate economic growth and current accounting and tax rules.
now, raj will provide more color for our forecast and our strengthening position in the marketplace.
rajesh subramaniam -- executive vice president, chief marketing & communications officer
thank you, alan. i'll open with our economic update and outlook and then discuss our revenue performance and business conditions in each segment and provide some commentary on raw industry trends and our growth priorities.
the economic outlook remains very favorable. the u.s. industrial sector has shifted into higher gear and capital spending is expanding. consumers are benefiting from a strong labor market and tax cuts are supporting incomes. overall sentiment remains near multi-year highs. globally, the structured three-speed world is becoming visible again after a couple of years of synchronous global growth. while the u.s. accelerates, the euro zone and japan are slowing and the emerging world continues to post the fastest rates of growth. on balance, we expect another year of strong global growth as economic momentum runs at a healthy pace. sound fundamentals remain in place to underpin sustained growth in global manufacturing and business investment.
the next few slides show details of revenue, volume, and yield performance by transportation segment. it is clear our pricing strategies that allow us to grow volumes and increase yields across the portfolio show continued success. for our u.s. domestic express business, revenue and yield increased 4% and 3%, respectively, excluding the impact of fuel, yield per package increased 1%.
fedex express international export package revenue increased double digits by 10% in q4, primarily due to yield increase of 10%. excluding fuel and exchange rate impact, yields increased 3%. ground segment revenue also saw double-digit growth at 12% in q4, with volume and yield each up 6%, together the strong volume growth from home delivery and balanced volume and yield growth in commercial. excluding fuel, yield-per-package increased 5%.
at fedex freight, revenue per shipment increased 8%, mainly driven by our revenue quality efforts. excluding fuel, revenue per shipment was up 6%. revenue per shipment growth is driven by stronger weight per shipment and ongoing emphasis on revenue quality improvement.
let me know discuss some exciting new enhancements to the fedex portfolio that will help drive our growth in fiscal year 2019. first, we believe that the realignment of fedex freight networks that we recently announced is a very positive step for fedex. it allows us to leverage the vast array of capabilities, including air and ocean following, supply chain and fulfillment services, cross-border capabilities, 3d printing, and customized transportation solutions across the full global portfolio of fedex.
in effect, ftn becomes a force multiplier for our business, as our customers benefit from differentiated solutions for their supply chain needs. e-commerce continues to grow rapidly around the world and we continue to enhance our global portfolio to offer market-leading capabilities on a global scale. during the last quarter, we acquired p2p mailing ltd., which provides unique, last mile delivery options to more than 200 countries and territories. p2p further expands the capabilities of fedex within the cross-border, e-commerce market segment.
there was experienced significant growth in the usage of fedex delivery management platform, especially in the last year. total new delivery manager enrollments were up 50% year-over-year during fiscal year '18. we had been expanding fedex delivery manager internationally and are now in 42 countries, representing 75% of the world gdp. additional new countries in the middle east, asia, and latin america will be added in fiscal year '19.
e-commerce also brings significantly more returns and we have expanded our returns technology to enable e-tailers and consumers with unique visibility, flexibility, and efficiency around returns management through our fedex office locations. we continue to enhance customers' access to our services with additional fedex office locations, including the first 50 new fedex office locations inside walmart stores opening in time for the upcoming peak season. we anticipate adding a total of 500 fedex office locations inside walmart stores over the next two years.
the fedex onsite program continues to expand with walgreens and other retail partners and we already have almost 11,000 package pickup locations in the u.s. this program is all about convenience and brings fedex ever closer to consumers.
we, of course, are deep into our preparations for the upcoming peak season and we will announce more specific plans and expectations with the peak season in the upcoming months. we are proud of the close collaboration with our customers and the detailed forecasting processes that we use. the final results in peak 2018 were a 99% match to our forecast, which allowed us to very effectively prepare and position people and operational resources and ultimately deliver outstanding service even on the busiest days of the holiday season.
let me now turn the call over to dave bronczek for his remarks. dave?
david j. bronczek -- president & chief operating officer
okay. thank you, raj, and good afternoon to everyone. we are proud to report q4 adjusted operating income of $2 billion for fedex corporation, which is up $255 million year-over-year, or 15%. as alan just said, we told you last quarter we expected operating margins at all three transportation operating companies to improve for the fourth quarter and they all did.
at fedex express, fourth quarter adjusted operating profit hit a record $1.1 billion, up $129 million year-over-year, or 13%. their adjusting operating margin was double digits, at 11.5%. fedex express segment revenue growth was driven primarily by our international business, and we had excellent growth in both international and u.s. freight services, which helped drive better profitability.
as you saw in the release, we are continuing to improve the efficiency and the reliability of the air network with additional orders for new aircraft that will replace older, less efficient aircraft. the deliveries of the additional 767s will begin in fy20, and the deliveries of the additional 777s will begin in fy21. the reliability of our air fleet has improved significantly and will continue to improve in this next phase of the fleet modernization program.
now, with respect to the tnt integration, i am happy to say that at the 2-year mark, the integration is accelerating and that significant expansion in our network dramatically improves our global capabilities and our competitive posture. on june 1st, we continued the integration of our world-class global sales teams. our sales teams will be fully integrated in fiscal year 2019, this year, of course, one year ahead of our original schedule.
the technology and operational capabilities provide us with the ability to flow packages between the legacy tnt and fedex system is processing as planned to allow us to flow volumes to the lowest cost or the highest service fedex express network in fiscal year '19, that's this year.
in june, we launched economy express, one-day transit service in 175 lanes in europe. these lanes were previously operated on a two-day transit time commitment. this is a significant step in demonstrating the power of the tnt european road network and a tangible example of the benefits of our integration for our customers. customers will benefit from more speed, more value, more coverage, and of course, more choice with all of these changes. the successful integration of tnt and fedex express remains a key driver of the fedex express fy20 operating income improvement target of $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion over fy17's results.
now, fedex ground also achieved record fourth quarter operating profit of $832 million. up $125 million year-over-year, or 18%. with double-digit percentage growth in revenue and an operating margin of 17.3%. we are improving revenue quality through a balanced approach to volume and yield growth. we reduced our long-term capital plans for fedex ground to much better match capability expansion with pricing and volume growth. we're optimizing and modernizing in many areas to drive greater profitability.
fedex freight's fourth quarter operating profit was also a record profit of $175 million, up $45 million and an amazing 35%. freight's operating margin was 9.4%, exceeding all the guidance that we gave you in the last quarter. fedex freight continues to show improvement in revenue and profitability, as our pricing strategies drive revenue growth, while investments in the network dramatically improve safety and lowers our cost. we are very pleased with the freight performance in fy18 and look forward to continued success in fy19.
in fy18, we made progress toward our goals of increasing earnings, margins, cash flows, and returns while dramatically enhancing customer service. we expect to do the same thing in fy19. with that, i'll turn it back over to mickey foster.
",":
mickey foster -- vice president, investor relations
so now we'll answer the questions that were submitted.
frederick w. smith -- chairman & chief executive officer
i'll be the qb here, giving the ball off to various people to answer these questions. the first one is from helane becker and ken hoexter of cowen and b of a merrill lynch, respectively. ""could a trade war interrupt global growth or is world trade to entrenched to allow for any disruption?"" i'm going to ask dave bronczek to take this on. if we get a lot of other questions about this, perhaps we'll take a bit more of it at the end because it was such a topic of conversation on the business shows all day long. dave?
david j. bronczek -- president & chief operating officer
okay, thanks fred and thanks ken and helane. it's a great question. we believe global supply chains, especially those of high-value items are well established and it will be very difficult to disrupt. we are hopeful that amenable solutions, of course, to trade policy issues will be found. however, our global assets are at such a large scale now that it's relatively easy for us to reposition our networks really all around the world should any trade patterns evolve. so, hopefully i helped answer your question.
frederick w. smith -- chairman & chief executive officer
question no. 2. this is from the associated press. ""are u.s. customers seeking expedited imports of items from china that would fall under new tariffs on july 6?"" raj?
rajesh subramaniam -- executive vice president, chief marketing & communications officer
we have not seen any changes to the u.s. customer behavior directly related to these new tariffs. now, this is not really surprising, especially since the commodities in question make up only a very, very small portion of u.s./china [inaudible].
frederick w. smith -- chairman & chief executive officer
ken hoexter, again. ""are tech sales a leading indicator you still watch for asia u.s. exports?"" sort of the same line of questioning there, raj.
rajesh subramaniam -- executive vice president, chief marketing & communications officer
yes, ken. the answer to that question is yes. technology sales is clearly one of the key indicators that we monitor. it's very highly correlated to the asia/u.s. exports. now, you have to back out some of the noise from the cellphone [inaudible] to get to the underlying trends. in recent months, industry investment in technology, capital goods, they really help underpin the ongoing growth in asian exports.
frederick w. smith -- chairman & chief executive officer
so, here's a question from david vernon of bernstein and kevin sterling of seaport global. how is the tightening truck transportation market impacting demand and cost at each fedex segment? dave?
david j. bronczek -- president & chief operating officer
okay, great question david. demand continues to be very strong by the strength of industrial production, as raj mentioned earlier, and consumer demand. however, to give you a little bit of color and background to this, i'm going to have the three op co presidents, starting maybe with henry and then mike [inaudible] and then david, who had probably the least effect, to give their points of view and their comments on this. henry?
henry j. maier -- fedex ground -- president & chief executive officer 
thanks. thanks for the question, david and kevin. at fedex ground, 100% of our transportation is purchased, as it has been, for 33 years. the company has contracts with all entities providing transportation services. most importantly, our contract service providers, but you might also be surprised to know we also have contracts with rail truckload and, of course, the united states postal service. these relationships afford the company to access virtually unlimited options in the market and drive our industry-leading flexibility to scale our transportation needs as customer demand warrant.
michael l. ducker -- fedex freight -- president & chief executive officer
i'll just add that we're seeing very strong demand for our services in the freight sector. we remain focused on disciplined growth and margin expansion while providing the best service in the industry. as a proof point, our fourth quarter results were perfectly balanced with 8% on average daily shipments and then 8% revenue per shipment growth. again, while the robust industrial production number is most closely correlated with the ltl market, we really expect a particularly strong ip growth during the first half of fiscal year '19, so that translates into a good growth in shipments.
david j. cunningham, jr. -- fedex express -- president & chief executive officer
this is dave cunningham representing fedex express. we have not experienced any issues with securing third-party trucking [inaudible].
frederick w. smith -- chairman & chief executive officer
""does fedex believe that the growth of e-commerce has changed the seasonality of the global air freight market? if so, how are you adjusting?"" this is david campbell of thompson davis. raj?
rajesh subramaniam -- executive vice president, chief marketing & communications officer
david, yes, indeed. global e-commerce is increasing but you have to remember that the vast majority of the pounds that we carry are business-to-business shipments and, as such, seasonality still continues to follow traditional patterns. i think more importantly, perhaps, is the fact that dave bronczek mentioned earlier, that the scale of our network is combined with the capacity that we have deployed on commercial carriers is so huge now, it makes it relatively easy for us to flex capacity as required by market demand.
frederick w. smith -- chairman & chief executive officer
""how much of the $400 million impact from the cyberattack should we assume comes back in fy19? have you fully recovered all tnt share losses?"" i'll ask david cunningham and perhaps don colleran to deal with that issue. david?
david j. cunningham, jr. -- fedex express -- president & chief executive officer
thanks, fred and thanks, scott. you can see in the results that we experienced year-over-year double-digit revenue growth in our international package and freight services this past quarter. while higher rates were certainly a major contributor, we're also seeing solid year-over-year growth in freight traffic, a piece of our product portfolio that expanded significantly through the addition of tnt. again, the recovery of the business over the past several months has been remarkable and we certainly owe a major thanks to ours sales, customer service, and it professionals who have done an outstanding job of recovering from this attack.
donald colleran -- executive vice president & chief sales officer
thank you, david. i'd just like to add a comment to that as well. we greatly appreciate the loyalty that our customers have shown us as we went through this difficult period. as you noted, i'm also glad to mention that we have resumed year-over-year growth in the impacted segment of that business.
frederick w. smith -- chairman & chief executive officer
so, here are three questions for fedex ground we'll give to henry. question 1: ""how much can you grow fedex ground volumes without adding more facilities?"" helane becker of cowen. second, ""what level of fedex ground margins are possible over the long term?"" jairam nathan of daiwa and david ross from stifel. and ""how much is left to do for full isp model conversion?"" david ross from stifel. henry, can you remember all of those?
henry j. maier -- fedex ground -- president & chief executive officer 
yeah, i think i can, fred. thanks. first of all, thanks for the questions. in terms of adding volume, i would say our investments in automation and technology have led us to have the most automated package sortation network in north america, if not the world. that's enabled us to be able to flex our capability as needed based on market dynamics. probably the best example of that is how we handle record volumes each year at peak.
concerning margins, we expect to continue to deliver strong volume and revenue growth, driven by the trends that everybody here today so far has talked about, about e-commerce. we're intently focused on modernizing and optimizing the ground network to drive profitability and we continue to look for ways to maximize asset utilization by leveraging existing capacity and automation.
in terms of the isp model conversion, we expect to be done sometime in late calendar 2019. we recently announced that we were accelerating that process. thanks for the questions.
frederick w. smith -- chairman & chief executive officer
""will the imo 2020 changes in marine fuel standards impact demand and pricing in the air freight market?"" david vernon of bernstein. raj?
rajesh subramaniam -- executive vice president, chief marketing & communications officer
david, it's a bit too early to tell at this point. it's great to see that thanks to imo 2020 that the marine fuel sulphur will be reduced, which will be positive for the global environment. while the implementation will probably raise fuel prices and we'll have to see what kind of material impact this has on the air freight demand. it's too early to tell. but please note that thanks to our growing fedex freight network's ocean business, we are very close to any pricing developments and in a perfect position to optimize transportation solutions for our customers. thank you, david.
frederick w. smith -- chairman & chief executive officer
so, a couple of questions on freight. ""why are fedex freight annual margins not double digits in such a strong ltl environment? any investments restraining current margins?"" david ross of stifel. and ""are you interested into getting into heavy goods last mile? would that be through your ltl or package division?"" scott group of wolfe research. david vernon of bernstein has a similar question. let me ask mike ducker to answer both of those questions.
michael l. ducker -- fedex freight -- president & chief executive officer
thanks, david. first of all, we're pleased with the profit and margin performance during fiscal year '18 and i would like to give a shout out to our teammates for their great performance. our operating income improved by 33% and the margin by 120 basis points. if you take that on a quarterly basis for q4, it was 35% and 130 basis points. now, while we're pleased with that, we're still not satisfied with those results. our goal remains sustainable double-digit margins, but we're not going to compromise our continued investments, which we believe are critical for our future growth and preparedness. so, we continue to invest in technology that will prepare us better for the rapid modernization of supply chains and to ensure we maintain a market leading position.
the second part of the question for david vernon at bernstein. we already deliver significant volume of goods through both fedex ground and fedex freight -- the last mile goods. so, as demand grows for those shipments, we believe fedex is uniquely positioned on reach and flexibility of our networks to provide outstanding service, even for those larger and heavier deliveries. specifically, for ltl, e-commerce is and will create opportunities for us and while we see opportunity in that large-growing market, we do have plans to leverage those trends to support margin expansion.
frederick w. smith -- chairman & chief executive officer
a question for raj. ""can you detail the issues at fedex supply chain and the turnaround plans? jairam nathan at daiwa and kevin sterling at seaport global. raj?
rajesh subramaniam -- executive vice president, chief marketing & communications officer
jairam and kevin, yeah, we have covered this issue in our may 29 apa disclosure and we are accelerating our efforts to streamline and standardize our operating model and upgrading our technology. these actions will not only increase our flexibility and service for our customers, at the same time, it also improves profitability through lower operating expenses. as i mentioned in the opening, we are very excited about the realignment of fedex freight networks, which will act as a force multiplier for our entire business.
frederick w. smith -- chairman & chief executive officer
let me just add to that. we don't have any systemic problems with fedex supply chain. we have an excellent group working on their basic issue about the goodwill impairment was simply that we had two cellphone repair contracts -- one that went to a different model warranty, a warranty-type model, where they didn't repair them anymore, they just gave them new phones. the second, the customer decided to split the business for strategic reasons. so, we've got a lot of stuff in the pipeline and supply chain will do fine.
on a related area, there's a question about why we moved fedex trade networks out from under fedex express. raj basically mentioned this, but i thought i would just add some color on this. basically, fedex trade networks is now doing things for all of the op cos. fedex trade networks is the largest customs broker in the united states. they clear things for fedex ground going across the nafta borders. we're moving more sea freight and that sea freight is going into the fedex freight network. by putting the other specialty operating companies together, as raj said, we believe that it'll be a force multiplier across our op cos and we felt it was a better fit there.
i have to tell you, we have as sort of a model of that what we did with fedex office. i mean, it has been a fantastic contributor to our operating companies doing all kinds of value-added services and i'm sure that will be the case with the new fedex trade networks with custom critical and supply chain and forward depots and across border as integral parts of it.
now, we turn to a number of financial questions related to capex. we have one from ravi shanker. ""given the new planes and the ongoing hub expenses, is it fair to assume that capex will increase in fy20 and beyond from fy19 levels?"" i'll ask alan if he will take that.
alan b. graf, jr. -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
thank you, fred. we're going to continue to grow our revenues and continue to grow our cash flows and as we see opportunities to invest, whether its expense, capital or acquisitions, if they're going to increase the long-term value of our company, we're going to do that. obviously, we benefited greatly from the tcja tax rate and 100% expensing for the next 5 years. that obviously makes capex investing less risky, although in the case of the aircraft, that was certainly not the driver. when you're presented with opportunities to make asset acquisitions at a really good price and those that are driving tremendous productivity improvements and operating expense reductions, you need to make those moves. so, our capex is going to spike up in fy20 and fy21, mostly as the result of express.
we are significantly reducing our outlook for capex at ground. we won't build a hub for a long time. ground has many innovative and in some ways, revolutionary cost-reduction programs under way right now, all of which involve sweating assets, improving productivity, and lowering costs. the same thing at freight. so, it'll be easily managed. i won't say that we'll be able to stay at the 8% level, but it will be very easily managed and cover with our cash flows and we'll still have excess cash flow.
frederick w. smith -- chairman & chief executive officer
so, in the same vein, david vernon wants to know, as ebitda and cash flows go up faster than the rate of capex, which is what we've been telling was going to happen here for a significant period of time, what's our free cash flow projection for this coming year, alan? can we put that out there?
alan b. graf, jr. -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
no, we're not going to put that out there because we have a different definition of free cash flow, but our ebitda will be very strong, particularly if you consider the service cost of pension. but this is one of my favorite subjects at fedex. the whole concept as you're driving that is the capital allocation. i think we've done a tremendous job of that in the past.
we're balancing it, i think, very effectively with returns to shareholders. i'll just remind you that since fy14, we've bought back 70.5 million shares, with $10 billion and an average price of $147 and based on where it's trading today, i'd say that's a pretty dang good move. we just increased our dividend 30% more. we hope to continue stock buyback and continue dividends. we've managed our pension very effectively. it's now fully funded, over fully funded from an erisa standpoint. so, we'll continue to do what we've been doing and we'll be balancing our opportunities and our shareholder returns. i suspect we'll be improving our credit ratios as we go along.
frederick w. smith -- chairman & chief executive officer
so, that basically answers david vernon's question about what should investors expect fedex to do with the resulting ramp in free cash flow. ""what percentage of your overall domestic package revenue is now b2c? are b2c margins improving?"" scott group, wolfe research. raj?
rajesh subramaniam -- executive vice president, chief marketing & communications officer
well, we don't provide a specific breakdown of b2c revenue or margins, but you have to remember that the b2c e-commerce is still relatively a small percentage of our total global revenues. now, having said that, we all know it's a fast growing segment and we are very excited about the capabilities that we have put in place to grow this business profitably.
frederick w. smith -- chairman & chief executive officer
so, there's a question from ken hoexter of b of a merrill. ""can you review the total of integration since acquisition? and what's left after 2019? do benefits outweigh the cost yet?"" and then matthew russell of goldman sachs asks a similar question. ""after the $450 million in tnt integration expenses in 2019, will you still have $150 million of integration expenses in 2020?"" alan?
alan b. graf, jr. -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
so, we're now a little bit past two years of day one with tnt. we've learned a tremendous amount. you'll recall we also suffered a very nasty cyberattack a year ago, almost, coming up on a year anniversary. and so our integration expenses are going to be a little bit higher than we had originally thought, but that's not bad at all because we'll be tightening our defenses from a cyber standpoint and we're going to invest more than that than we had anticipated, but the results will be a much more productive and much more flexible it network.
additionally, we have found additional productivity enhancers as we go through the integration that are going to really increase our return substantially. i have to say fy19, when we're going to step up to about $450 million worth of integration, is a very big year. we have great plans in placed. we're off to a good start. this is a key year for us in terms of integration. after '19, we'll have somewhere around $250 to $300 million left in fy20, but that'll be around the edges. i think the meat on the chicken is going to be the current fiscal year that we're in.
frederick w. smith -- chairman & chief executive officer
chris wetherbee of citi asks, ""do you expect new aircraft orders to add to total company capacity or will total airlift stay flat as old planes are retired?"" dave bronczek, david cunningham.
david j. bronczek -- president & chief operating officer
let me start off by saying the great thing about these airplanes is we can just completely replace old planes like the md11s. take them out of international and bring them back to the united states and move the md10s out. we can totally do that. we've done mostly that. we've added very few incremental planes along the years here. on the other hand, if we continue to see strong growth like we're seeing how, we could use them to add capacity. so, we can hold and just replace, or we can grow and add the capacity that we currently have. with that, david cunningham?
david j. cunningham, jr. -- fedex express -- president & chief executive officer
i think dave covered it well. the only thing i would add is that we continue to modernize our global network resulting in improved reliability, reduced emissions, and greater operational flexibility.
frederick w. smith -- chairman & chief executive officer
matthew russell of goldman sachs asks, ""can you still achieve 10% corporate operating margins long term with the pension accounting changes?"" the answer to that question is yes. our goal is to have operating margins at the corporate level and at the op co level in the teens.
here's one from outside of last-mile delivery, which i take it is the term that's being applied to the heavy and hard-to-handle. raj? is that right?
rajesh subramaniam -- executive vice president, chief marketing & communications officer
no, i think it's [inaudible].
frederick w. smith -- chairman & chief executive officer
oh, technology, ok. ""are you seeing any increase in competition? can technology disrupt your mode or are hard assets the barrier to entry?"" matthew russell, goldman sachs. raj?
rajesh subramaniam -- executive vice president, chief marketing & communications officer
matthew, fedex has built arguably the most extensive global delivery network probably in the history of transportation. when you combine that with our technology and human assets, it's hard to conceive of a scenario where technology alone could be a disruptor. i mean, there's definitely a trend in popular press to get carried away by the conversations around technology being the answer to every question. but the real answer is how we combine technology with physical and human assets that provide the value propositions that our customers are seeking. if you haven't already done so, i would highly encourage you to watch our short video on the subject at fedex.com/green.
frederick w. smith -- chairman & chief executive officer
raj, while we've got you on the skewer here, scott group wants to know, and kevin sterling, ""when do you think the post office will meaningfully raise rates? is this a risk for you?""
rajesh subramaniam -- executive vice president, chief marketing & communications officer
well, kevin, i don't think we can speculate on what usps might or might not do. however, we do believe that the cost of last-mile delivery will continue to increase in the years to come, which will be an opportunity for fedex.
frederick w. smith -- chairman & chief executive officer
so, a question from bascome majors of susquehanna and helane becker of cowen. ""are customers coming to you to discuss ups strike contingency plans? how much of ups volume could you accommodate if there is a strike?"" dave bronczek?
david j. bronczek -- president & chief operating officer
yes, obviously it's a timely question. however, we never actually comment about our competitors' issues or their business considerations. i do want to say something that's very important for our customers though. we will continue to provide outstanding service for our customers. we have capacity. only then, and only then, if there's additional capacity and if there's a need would we consider other alternatives for other customers. we will take care of our customers first, the way we always do, the way we ramp up for christmas peaks and so forth. we can handle it and we're going to take care of our customers.
frederick w. smith -- chairman & chief executive officer
so, we've got a question from scott schneeberger of oppenheimer for david cunningham. ""could you please cover economic trends you're witnessing in europe and how they're impacting your business?""
david j. cunningham, jr. -- fedex express -- president & chief executive officer
well, as we talked earlier, we've seen good growth and productivity in our results in the fourth quarter. we continue to expect to see the same.
frederick w. smith -- chairman & chief executive officer
""could you please discuss fedex progress in gaining share with small and medium-sized customers?"" also from scott. raj, would you or don colleran take that on?
rajesh subramaniam -- executive vice president, chief marketing & communications officer
scott, thank you for that question. we do not break out the segment performance, but what i can tell you is we're making tremendous progress in the small and medium segment and fiscal year '18 was a very good year, it was a banner year, in fact. we have a fantastic value proposition around the world and are only strengthened by the acquisition of tnt and which allows our commercial team, which i believe is second to none, to win more business every single day. as you can hopefully tell, we are very pleased with the results so far and we expect to accelerate our progress in this segment in the years to come.
frederick w. smith -- chairman & chief executive officer
raj, how about fedex fulfillment service from brian ossenbeck. how about an update on that?
rajesh subramaniam -- executive vice president, chief marketing & communications officer
well, brian, fedex fulfillment now has two major fulfillment centers, as you know, operational in the united states. that business continues to grow as we sign new customers, especially small and medium-sized e-commerce companies who are really looking to scale their business. we continue to enhance our offerings to include additional marketplace integrations, better inventory management, analytics, and so on. customers are responding very well to the service, as fedex fulfillment gives them more flexibility to focus on what they do best, while fedex can focus on the supply chain needs.
frederick w. smith -- chairman & chief executive officer
brian also asked and you might as well take this, raj, what's needed to facilitate a higher utilization rate of your retail and onsite network for customer pickups and returns versus a residential stop. raj?
rajesh subramaniam -- executive vice president, chief marketing & communications officer
well, as i mentioned to you earlier, we are thrilled to have almost 11,000 convenient locations in the u.s. for customers to pick up their packages today. the three factors that drive it, first obviously is convenience. they're right there. locations are open later in the evenings. 700 of them are open, in fact, 24 hours.
the second issue is around porch piracy. a recent survey showed that 75% of online shoppers were concerned about porch piracy and 45% have a package either stolen or know someone who has had their package stolen. so those are two very important factors. the third one probably, or the medium-to-long term is that, as i mentioned to you, is the cost of last mile continues to increase, these locations will not only become a convenient location, but also will become an economic value for our customers.
frederick w. smith -- chairman & chief executive officer
we have a couple of questions here about ground efficiency in the metlife program. they've been asked and answered otherwise. a question about the recent rally in oil prices. ""could it push some shippers to lower service levels with fewer guarantees?"" raj, you want to pick it up?
rajesh subramaniam -- executive vice president, chief marketing & communications officer
well, brian, i don't think so. i think that's going to be there. but again, having said that, we have a full portfolio of offerings, including fedex freight networks that allow us to optimize our offerings to our customer needs.
frederick w. smith -- chairman & chief executive officer
so, from brian ossenbeck of j.p. morgan, ""what does the next chapter of technology and innovation look like? how close to commercial viability are the recently disclosed tracking sensors, blockchain involvement, and small drone test flights?"" rob carter, you want to talk at least about the first two of those?
robert carter -- executive vice president, fedex information services & cio
sure. the impact of innovations in the connected world, whether it's the internet of things and sensor-based logistics, mobility blockchain autonomy, all of those things are accelerating across the enterprise. if you look at sensor-based logistics and the announcements and capabilities that we've shown in our new bluetooth, low-energy sensors, that's resulted in a huge number of patent filings and really is a viable technology in and of itself today. what takes some time to roll out though, is the infrastructure and wi-fi networks and rolling stock and in aircraft in order to marshal all those sensors as they operate in the world. and then the back-end systems that are needed to handle that volume of data.
with regard to blockchain, we're quickly seeing blockchain capabilities moving toward production, primarily through our involvement in bita, the blockchain and transport alliance, with now hundreds of participating companies. fedex freight is leading the charge there and are chairing the committee on standards for bita, and we have several applications that are working their way forward.
then, lastly, with regard to drones, drones are still really specializing in observation and inspection with sophisticated optics and their ability to look at aircraft and air frames. that's a very advanced capability that we're already using today, but things like lift and range are limiting their use in transport, although we're testing them in some of our larger ramp facilities to deliver parts to mechanics and things of that nature.

""so, alan just mentioned that integration costs will be higher than initially expected. he's saying than the $1.4 billion guidance from last year? how much?"" scott group of wolfe research. alan?
alan b. graf, jr. -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
i'd say right now based on what we're seeing, it's more like $1.5 billion. $100 million more. if we find additional opportunities, we'll keep you posted on that. but those are opportunistic, as opposed to its costing us more than we thought.
frederick w. smith -- chairman & chief executive officer
i think that's all the questions that we have. there's one here from ravi shankar about tesla semis. i think we'll defer that. we haven't gotten them yet. we're looking forward to testing them. we test a lot of different things from a lot of different vendors. mickey, that completes all of the questions, so i'll turn it over to you.
mickey foster -- vice president, investor relations
