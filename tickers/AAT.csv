[operator instructions] our first question comes from richard hill with morgan stanley.
ron kamdem -- morgan stanley -- analyst
hey. you got -- you got ron kamdem on the line for richard. just a couple --
ernest rady -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
we can tell richard, we're glad to have you, ron. so, welcome.
ron kamdem -- morgan stanley -- analyst
that's the right. just a couple, couple of quick ones from me. the first is, just going back to sort of the reserves taken on the uncollected rents in the retail portfolio. i guess, the question is trying to get an understanding of how much conservatism is baked into that and how confident do you feel that there is not, maybe more reserves coming down the line as sort of the pandemic unfold? so trying to get a sense of the conservatism in the numbers that you guys took.
robert barton -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah, ron. thanks for the question. we record those reserves in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. and under that there is a section called 842. and what it says is that we have to be 75% confident that we're going to receive 95% of the cash flows. and in layman's terms, what we look at it is, is a tenant going to survive or not survive. and so we have a group of about eight people, including adam who is involved with the leases, chris sullivan, heads up our retail, our controller, it's a whole team effort.
and what we do is, we try to be -- we're not trying to be aggressive at all. what we're trying to do is be conservative and -- but in this pandemic, it changes daily. and what we do is, we continue to evaluate that on a month-to-month basis and as new developments happen, we'll -- with the reserves increase over time, as a pandemic continues to linger there will probably be more fallout. and as a result we'll probably have to add to reserves. but at this point in time, i feel that those reserves that we've put on the books are adequately represented on a conservative basis.
ernest rady -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
our strategy has always been to try and overpromise -- underpromise our overdeliver. and there is no pressure to have those reserves less than they are to be. and so, as bob says that committee has looked at it carefully and that's our best bet under these present circumstances, ron, and thank you for asking.
ron kamdem -- morgan stanley -- analyst
got it. just a couple more quick ones. just on the dividend, i think you decided to raise in 3q about $0.05. i think you cited just better, better rent collections. i'm just trying to get a little more color on what went into that decision because it feels like maybe the board, think that the worst is behind them and you feel like you sort of have a handle on the pandemic and the fallout to be able to sort of do that. so what went into that decision? what gave you confidence to boost? and how should we think about that going forward?
ernest rady -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
no. as i said earlier, ron, going into this pandemic. frankly i was close to panic because i've never seen circumstances like this and i thought that we are in for a catastrophic situation. the situation has not been as bad as our worst case thoughts led us to. and so when we presented to the board, a quarter ago to cut from $0.30 to $0.20 we took into account our view of the unknowns that we were facing. but as we've come face to face with those unknowns while they been very upsetting and very difficult, they haven't been as catastrophic as we expected. so we suggested to the board that they look at this with a more balanced approach and rather the catastrophic approach that we had suggested at the last quarter. and so we would -- we paided the cutting dividend if you want to know the truth.
we would love to have maintain the dividend at the same level we have since we went public and increase it as we have over the 11 or 12 years since we've been public. that is just not in the cards given the circumstances that we're presently facing. and we'll just have to see how it unfolds. the board will make a decision quarter-by-quarter, but i would think that based on the projections we have now and the field we have in the marketplace that the $0.25 should be able to be continued. and with any good luck hopefully, we'll get back to where we'd like to be, which is the same dividend as in prior years and even a small increase, if at all possible feasible.
ron kamdem -- morgan stanley -- analyst
great. and then my last one, if i may. i think one of the questions we're getting the most on the desk is just about sort of work from home and the implications, right. and when they think about your portfolio and just a great amount of demand, the tenants and i think the numbers a sort of shown that. the question is really, what's the possibility of sort of the office market turning into haves and have-nots, right? when you think about some of maybe the older stock out there compared to sort of your -- your sort of class a stuff? is there -- what's the possibility maybe those assets being just before so impacted from work-from-home? and what are you hearing on from tenants on the work from home front. what sort of thinking do you face? thank you.
ernest rady -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
well, i think when this started everybody said well, who needs office. but i'd tell you as somebody who is involved in business on a day-to-date basis. we miss people coming into the office and all the result -- good results that flow from that, the idea flow, the training. and so i know the theory is, you don't need office. the practice is office is a valuable a way to operate the business and i'm looking forward to people coming back. how this is all going to come about? i don't know, but i have confidence that the office portfolio we have in the high quality, high-growth markets where there is innovation and job creation. we will have a market for our office and i hopefully even a growing market. that's my best guess i mean, i don't know what the answer is, but if you probably hear from lots of people if they, if it was new york city, i would be more frightened. [indecipherable] west coast markets are very vibrant, and i think we have a good future with the portfolio we have.
ron kamdem -- morgan stanley -- analyst
thanks. very helpful, thank you. appreciate it.
ernest rady -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
thank you, ron.

our next question comes from todd thomas with keybanc capital markets.
todd thomas -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
hi. thanks. good morning. just first question, i guess, following up on that, just wondering if you had any update specifically from google, regarding their plan to move in and occupancy at landmark just given their latest announcement about not bringing back employees until at least the summer of '21.
ernest rady -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
jerry gammieri is going to answer that. he is in constant contact with them and we'll update you. yeah. and thanks for the question, todd.
jerry gammieri -- vice president of construction and development
yeah. good morning, todd. so, at our landmark project in san francisco in march, we basically stopped construction at that point. and at that point we had two of the seven floors completed. they have remobilized this week and they are proceeding with the work on during the break, i'll call it. there was a lot of discussion about what they would do with the space whether they would reprogram, whether they would change their layout or their floor plan. the decision has been made to proceed with the plans as originally contemplated. so they are moving ahead, full steam now starting again this week and expecting to complete somewhere around the first quarter of '21.
todd thomas -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
okay. and then ernest, i appreciate your perspective sort of longer term, but curious in the interim here, as you're moving forward with a number of leasing initiatives in the office segment. are you seeing any, any changes in demand across your markets, any changes in conversations with tenants about how they're thinking about office space rents or their decision and sort of willingness to sign leases today?
ernest rady -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
i'll tell you, unless somebody's dead, dumb and deaf, they're thinking about the circumstances that they're operating under now, but steve center is in constant contact with the agents and the prospective tenants and you probably best able to handle that, steve.
steve center -- vice president of office properties
yeah. we're seeing tenants proceed with their plans. one example is smartsheet just recently signing a deal to accelerate taking two additional floors at city center bellevue by 14 months. as jerry pointed out google, they are proceeding with their plans. it's not a matter of, and they're moving back in, it's a matter of when. and what i liked about the message from jerry is that they're going with the design that they previously come up with pre-covid. so that's a -- it indicates me if that's a believe that we're going to return to some semblance of normal and get back to business. and so we've got two deals we're in discussions with in portland for 2023 deliveries. and those are businesses looking through the noise and looking into the future and they've got to grow, and they need a home for all those employees. so far so good, especially with our technology and life science companies.
todd thomas -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
okay. and then shifting over to the multifamily segment, the occupancy decline there was a little bit greater than we expected, but it seems like occupancy is going to get a boost with the master lease at pacific ridge. what's the term of that master lease? and is the master lease representative of market rents and then when that kicks in on august 1, where would you expect multifamily occupancy to be?
ernest rady -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
well, if the master leases for two projects along as loma palisades and pacific ridge. and abigail, why don't you take that. abigail and adam did a great job in negotiating this transaction.
abigail rex -- director, multifamily san diego
sure. good morning. so that master lease agreement will span between loma palisades and pacific ridge and consist of about 130 units. a little bit above market rate, because it's an all-inclusive rental rate package for the university that will be for a 10-month term starting august 1 and then go through may 31 of 2021. excuse me, and we anticipate that come august when all of the move-ins take place not only in addition to this master lease but with other renters as well. we'll probably be back to the low to mid '90s, as bob mentioned earlier.
ernest rady -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
but one thing that you have to consider is that the government's now are extending the terms that tenants have to pay the rent with this lease it's collectible and that's a huge difference. so in addition to the rates being acceptable and perhaps even a bit more than acceptable. the quality of the payment is assured and that's a big deal in this crazy market.
todd thomas -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
okay. all right. great. thank you.
ernest rady -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
thank you, todd. thanks for your interest.

our next question comes from craig schmidt with bank of america.
ernest rady -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
good morning, craig.
craig schmidt -- bank of america -- analyst
good morning to you. i was just wondering what you're seeing regarding the california efforts to roll back reopenings on the retail real estate, whether in terms of impact to traffic or possible impact on rent collection?
ernest rady -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
chris, you want to handle.yeah. i mean, this thing changes day by day. so maybe you have a view that you can to share.
chris sullivan -- vice president of retail properties
the largest impact that came back, as you remember right after memorial day that restaurants were allowed to start reopening inside, that only last for a couple of weeks or so depending on what county you are in. and then when they shutdown restaurants to operate inside dining that really threw a wrench in the system. so as you drive around your own town and where you are, you can see the restaurateurs have to try sidewalk dining or patios if they had. and unfortunately, when that lowered the occupancy so much that they're all fighting just to cover their cost and keep their remaining chefs and some staff on.
so that really threw a monkey wrench into it. this is most of our shopping center guys have we might have 10% to 15% foodservice in your properties. the other piece is that really hurt was all of the salons -- nail salons and quite a bit of the service providers that were no longer able to have folks come inside, get a haircut or have their nails done. so it's the constant little chipping away that has certainly had an effect on retail, so that's the biggest piece i've seen besides all the other problems of the tourism and the rest of it, the whole country and world spacing.
ernest rady -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
thanks, chris. thank you, craig. any more questions, craig.
craig schmidt -- bank of america -- analyst
i guess, i know that in terms of university housing for the students, they're changing the densities that they are allowing, is that having any impact positive or negative on you, in terms of your multifamily leasing?
ernest rady -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
yes. i think that was the genesis for the lease that we signed with the local university as they were dedensifying, if that's a word, their dorms and they needed more space. unfortunately that lease expires just at the heavy rental season. so we'll have a better opportunity to fill those leases up. hopefully when the market is more normal, there is a vaccine that world has returned to normal and our properties, we will have the opportunity to fill them up again. but in the meantime, it's a great stop beyond measure collectible.
craig schmidt -- bank of america -- analyst
okay. thank you.
operator
thank you. and i'm not showing any further questions at this time, i'd like to turn the call back over to chairman, ernest rady for concluding remarks.
ernest rady -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
again to sum it all up, this is a very difficult time. american assets trust has great properties, a great team and liquidity. it's certain that we will see the other side of this pandemic and we will come out of this, at least as good as we were coming into this and hopefully better with all of the opportunities that are available to us. so thank you all for your interest and we hope to talk to you 90 days from now.

operator
ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the q2 2020 american assets trust, inc. earnings call. [operator instructions] after the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [operator instructions]
i would now like to hand the conference call to your speaker today, mr. adam wyll. you may begin, sir.
adam wyll -- executive vice president and chief operating officer
thank you. good morning, everyone. welcome to american asset trust, inc. second quarter 2020 earnings call. yesterday afternoon, our earnings release and supplemental information were furnished to the sec on form 8-k. both are now available on the investor section of our website, americanassetstrust.com. a telephonic replay and on-demand webcast will also be available for this call over the next week.
during this call, we will discuss non-gaap financial measures which are reconciled to our gaap financial results in our earnings release and supplemental information. we will also be making forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. these statements are subject to risks, uncertainties discussed in our sec filings. you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. actual events could cause our results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements, which we undertake no duty to update.
and with that, i'll turn the call over to ernest rady, our chairman and ceo to begin the discussion of our second quarter 2020 results. ernest?
ernest rady -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
thank you, adam. that was well done as always. these have been unprecedented times that i've never seen before in my lifetime. when covid-19 began, i honestly didn't know how that it would be. we expect it to be catastrophic, but we just didn't know how bad it would be, now that the second quarter is behind us. i can tell you that it is not as catastrophic as our worst case projections. it's still has been no fun.
office has performed extremely well, unless in the shining light in our portfolio, with high credit tenants in strong markets and that we would like to continue. multifamily has also performed well better than we expected. occupancy has been slightly lower, but collections have been strong in the mid '90s and we expect a meaningful uptick in occupancy in august 1, as a local private university takes possession of approximately 130 units and our san diego multi-family portfolio, at good rents by a master lease that has recently been executed.
retail as expected has been very tough. every deal, feels like a street fight in retail. we try to balance what is best for the company and its shareholders with how to maintain the long-term [technical issues] of these retail tenants that are so important to our shopping centers. we know that some are not going to make it. of course, we are hopeful that most will make it. in that factor, we're hopeful that all will make it. we have a committee comprised of myself, chris sullivan and adam wyll that review every tenant requests. if a tenant ask for deferral, we ask for something from a tenant and return as well. each one is a negotiation and we try to make sure that we're getting something fair in return for anything less 100% on time collection of our contractual rents.
i truly believe that our management team is second to none and has done an excellent job strategically navigating through this pandemic. american trust is reflective of the quality people that we have working as appreciative of the quality people that we have working in our company that are focused on creating value for our shareholders each and every day.
lastly, i want to mention that our board of directors has approved increasing the quarterly dividend 25% over the second quarter 2020 dividend of $0.20 to $0.25 for the third quarter based on higher rent collections in the second quarter than we had expected, combined with the significant embedded growth that we continue to expect in our office portfolio and the recent master lease signed in our multifamily portfolio. a year from now, once there is a vaccine, we expect to look back and we hope this is nothing more than a bad memory. i believe that we came -- we come out of this, we will be as good a company or even better when all this started.
i'm now going to turn the call back over to adam wyll, our evp and chief operating officer, who will give us a quick update on our operations during this pandemic, followed by bob barton, our evp and chief financial officer and we will end with a quick update on the leasing success that steve center, our vice president of office properties is seeing. adam, please.
adam wyll -- executive vice president and chief operating officer
thanks, ernest. from an operations perspective as coronavirus infection continue to increase in many of our markets. we remain hyper-focused on the safety and well-being of our personnel tenants and vendors, as 100% of our properties remain open and accessible by our tenants. we remain committed to ensuring full compliance with the ever-changing regulatory mandates from all levels of government, not to mention, staying in front of and working against proposed regulations that we think would do damage to our industry and economy. like sb 939 in california, which did not pass. in the proposed repeal of prop 13 for commercial properties in california, which we believe is essentially a targeted tax increase on business, which would ultimately be passed on to tenants and customers most of whom can absorb such increases and could lead to even more business failure.
as ernest mentioned, we continue to work with our tenants on rent deferments and other lease modifications to assist those tenants as best we can, whose business have been significantly impacted by covid-19. we've also renegotiated or bid out most of our vendor contracts to meaningfully reduce operating expenses, many of such reductions on a long-term basis, all the while maintaining our best-in-class properties. and we've leverage the high unemployment rates in our markets to hire top caliber associates to fill open positions at aat.
finally, we appreciate more than ever, the positive impact that esg including fostering a culture of diversity and inclusion has on the strengthening of our business, our economy and our society. particularly in light of current events, our focus on human capital and physical and mental well being both within our company and in our communities, has never been stronger and represents the foundation that our culture was built on. for more insight on our esg efforts please take a look at our recently published 2019 sustainability report, which can be found on the sustainability page of our website.
with that, i'll turn the call over to bob to discuss q2 results and the impact from covid-19. bob?
robert barton -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
good morning, and thank you, ernest and adam. last night, we reported second quarter 2020 ffo of $0.48 per share and net income attributable to common shareholders of $0.13 per share for the second quarter. let's look at the results of the second quarter for each property segment. our office property segment continues to perform well during these uncertain times. office properties excluding our one beach street property located on the north waterfront in san francisco which is under redevelopment. we're at 96% occupancy at the end of the second quarter, an increase of approximately 3% from the prior year.
more importantly, same-store cash noi increased 16% in q2 over the prior year, primarily from city center bellevue in washington, lloyd district campus, office campus in oregon and torrey reserve campus here in san diego. our retail properties have not fared as well during the pandemic. retail properties were at 95% occupancy at the end of the second quarter, a decrease of approximately 2% from the prior year. however, retail collections have been difficult during the pandemic, as reflected in our negative same-store cash noi. additionally, due to covid-19, we have taken reserve for bad debts against the outstanding retail accounts receivable and straight-line rents receivable at the end of the second quarter of approximately 14% and 7% respectively.
from a dollar perspective, this translates into approximately $2 million and $1.4 million respectively, for a total of $3.4 million reserve related to our retail sector, which is approximately $0.045 of ffo. we intend to continue evaluating and potentially revising these reserves each quarter as we monitor the ever-changing viability and solvency of each of our retail tenants. our multifamily properties we're at an 85% occupancy at the end of the second quarter, a decrease of approximately 8% from the prior year as also reflected in our negative same-store cash noi. but as ernest mentioned, we expect this to increase back into the low to mid 90% occupancy once our master lease with a local private university commences on august 1.
our mixed use property consisting of the embassy suites hotel and the waikiki beach walk retail is located on the island of oahu. the state of hawaii remains in self quarantine through the end of august, which is significantly impacted the operating results in the second quarter of 2020. the embassy suites average occupancy for the second quarter of 2020 was 17%, compared with the prior year's second quarter average occupancy of 92%. a good rule of thumb in our view is that a hotel without any leverage on it needs to have approximately a 50% to 60% occupancy to breakeven.
our team in hawaii forecasted earlier this month of 46% to 50% occupancy by year-end 2020. to our pleasant surprise, we ended june with a 29% occupancy, much higher than the average occupancy of 17% for the quarter. additionally, in the last 15 days, we have been seeing occupancy ranging from 45% to 55% with our team in hawaii expecting to end the month of july at 62% occupancy. right now, it is our understanding there are only two hotels remained open in waikiki. one of which is our embassy suites hotel, which has been completely renovated and it's like a brand new hotel.
let's talk about billings and collections. on a companywide basis, we collected approximately 83% of the total second quarter billings, which primarily consists of base rent and cost reimbursements. we have also collected approximately 83% of july's billings as of the end of last week. we expect those percentages to increase as we continue to work hard on collection efforts. in q2, our office rent collections were approximately 98%. our retail rent collections excluding waikiki beach retail were approximately 62%. and by the way -- so far in july is about 70%, and our multifamily collections were approximately 95%. waikiki beach walk retail had an approximately 30% collection rate in q2.
as ernest noted earlier, the board of directors has decided to increase the quarterly dividend from $0.20 to $0.25 per share. the board took into consideration, the increase in collections over what was expected during q2, combined with the embedded growth in cash flow from the office sector over the next several years, as well as the master lease in the multifamily sector. using the same 83% collection rate applied to our initial targeted dividend of $0.30 per quarter, it gets you to approximately $0.25 per share per quarter.
as we look at the liquidity on our balance sheet, at the end of the second quarter, we had approximately $396 million in liquidity, comprised of $146 million of cash and cash equivalents and $250 million of availability on our line of credit. and only one of our properties is encumbered by a mortgage. our leverage which we measure in terms of net debt to ebitda was 6.4 times on a quarterly annualized basis, resulting from the lower ebitda from the added reserves that we took in the retail sector during q2. on a trailing 12 month basis, our ebitda would be approximately 5.8 times. our focus is to maintain our net debt to ebitda at 5.5 times or below.
our interest coverage and fixed charge coverage ratio ended the quarter at 3.8 times on a quarterly annualized basis and at 4.1 times on a trailing 12 month basis. and finally with respect to $250 million of unsecured debt maturities that come due in 2021, we expect to extend the $100 million term loan up to 3 times with each extension for a one-year period subject to certain conditions and the remaining $150 million series a notes does not mature until october 31, 2021, which we would expect to refinance at lower rates.
regarding our guidance, as we previously disclosed, we withdrew our 2020 guidance on april 3 due to the uncertainty that the pandemic would have on our existing guidance, particularly in our hotel or retail sector. unfortunately, the economy continues to change day by day and the current outcome remains uncertain as to impact in duration, which is why we will continue to a draw our 2020 guidance.
i'll now turn the call over to steve center, vice president of office properties for a brief update on our successes and opportunities in our office segment. steve?
steve center -- vice president of office properties
thank you, bob. at the end of the second quarter, net of one beach, which is under redevelopments. our office portfolio stood at approximately 96% leased, with approximately 6% expiring through the end of 2021. we were fortunate to renew the irs and veterans benefits administration leases early in 2020, the first & main in portland in a total of 131,000 feet at start rates nearly 20% above the rates of exploration. given the quality of our assets and the strength of the markets in which they are located with technology and life science as key market drivers.
we continue to execute new and renewal leases at favorable run rates delivering continued noi growth. with leases already signed, we have locked in approximately $29.6 million of noi growth comprised of $6 million in 2020, $14 million in 2021 and $9.6 million in 2022 in our office segment. we anticipate significant additional noi growth in 2022 through the redevelopment and leasing of one beach street in san francisco and 710 oregon square in the lloyd submarket portland, along with the repositioning of two buildings at torrey reserve in the del mar heights submarket of san diego.
in addition, we can grow our office portfolio by up to 768,000 rentable square feet or 22% on sites we already owned by building tower 3 at la jolla commons, which is 213,000 feet and blocks 90 and 103 at oregon square totaling up to 555,000 square feet. tower 3 at la jolla commons is into the city of san diego for permits and we continue evaluating market condition, prospective tenant interest and hopefully decrease in construction costs, leading to are upcoming commencing construction.
next, schematic design has completed for blocks 90 and 103 at oregon square with design development of 50% complete. we are scheduled for our first hearing with the design review committee in portland on august 20. we currently have two active request for proposals from prospective tenants for blocks 90 and 103 totaling 422,000 square feet, but again we will be evaluating market conditions, tenant interest and construction cost prior to commencing construction. we have a stable office portfolio with little near term rollover, significant built in noi growth and additional upside through repositioning redevelopment within our existing portfolio plus substantial new development on sites we already own.
operator, i'll now turn the call over to you for questions.
adam wyll -- executive vice president and chief operating officer

operator
thank you. [operator instructions] our first question comes from richard hill with morgan stanley. you may proceed with your question.
ronald kamdem -- morgan stanley -- analyst
hey good morning. you got ron kamdem on for richard hill. couple of quick ones from me. the first is just on the bad debt, i just would like to dig into that one a little bit more. i think i heard correctly that bad debt is at 39% of accounts receivables and 3% of straight-line rent receivables. so, i guess the question number one is, has that been increasing from 2q to 3q? it sounds like it has, but i just want to confirm that and maybe a little bit more color on what's driving that and how are you guys thinking about it and maybe are you being too conservative and so forth. thanks.
robert barton -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
good morning ron. hey, thanks for the question. yeah, so what we said in the script was, it is 39% of total accounts receivable the bad debt, and that's on our allowance for doubtful accounts. so, from a dollar standpoint, that's about $7 million we had about another $2.5 million in straight-line rent receivables or a bad debt reserve against straight-line rent. so, the total of the two of those is about $10 million, just slightly under that. when we look at where we were at the end of q2 that amount was approximately $3.3 million. so on the bad debt reserve -- bad debt expense for accounts receivable that increased from $3.3 million to approximately $7.7 million.
and the reason why is that each quarter that -- until we get this vaccine in, it's difficult on the retail tenants. and so, in each quarter what we do is we go through and we evaluate whether, what is the likelihood that we will receive, what's billed -- we'll take a look at -- if we can receive what's been deferred and we'll make a decision at that point in time as to whether it's probable that whether it's probable that we'll receive 95% of the remaining cash flows.
ernest s. rady -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
thanks bob. and ron this is ernest. as a matter of policy and strategy, we'd much sooner be on the conservative side than the optimistic side. so, bob has made as accurate assessment as possible, but our strategy has always been -- if we're going to err on the conservative side, and thanks for the question.
ronald kamdem -- morgan stanley -- analyst
got it. that's helpful. my other question, i guess it's sort of tied in to the bad debt was just on the guidance, i think historically you've either -- the team has provided sort of guidance for next year at this time. and obviously, i can appreciate there is a lot of moving pieces, but just what was the thought behind, even giving us some broad strokes for the retail portfolio, the office portfolio. it feels like you have pretty good visibility on the office portfolio with the presentation you've put out. so, just curious why not sort of put a guidance number out there and help sort of the street get some broad signpost?
ernest s. rady -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
ron, we'd love to give the guidance that you're asking for. there is just so much uncertainty out there from economic point of view, and a health point of view that we thought that we have very little to gain and a lot to lose by saying something that doesn't turn out to be true. so, we just as soon remain silent until we know exactly how this is all going to play out, but i understand your concern and our concern too, i mean we're monitoring where we are and where we're going and we're doing the best we can. but, i don't want to -- i wouldn't want to mislead anybody including ourselves.
robert barton -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
and ron from time-to-time in our investor presentations, we'll include some foresight as to what we know at that point in time, but we're not issuing guide as ernest said.
ernest s. rady -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
and i think on the office side, we've given some indication of where our sentiment is and that's because of the high quality of the assets and the high quality of the tenants. there is some -- we have some assurance to what we say will turn out to be true. in the rest of the portfolio, it's so covid affected, we're just not certain.
ronald kamdem -- morgan stanley -- analyst
got it. and then my last one, if i may. i think interesting your opening comments about prop 15 and prop 21 and i know the governor of california came out in opposition of props 21. just in your mind, obviously, the goal is for none of them to pass, but is one more likely or you're more concerned of than the other? so, if you're thinking out loud is prop 15 maybe a bigger risk of passing than prop 21 or you guys just sort of see the same across the board? thanks.
ernest s. rady -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
i think prop 15 is a threat to the entire state, not just to us. as adam pointed out in his presentation that those are going to be short term discomfort for us, but long-term pain for the businesses that are involved and for the -- of residents of california. i saw a survey recently that prop 15 was going to pass and now they think it's unlikely to pass -- somewhat unlikely to pass. so, god only knows what's going to happen, but i hope for the sake of california -- californians and us as long-term residents that it fails to pass.
robert barton -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. prop 15 our assessment is that, it's not going to have a huge impact to us initially, but rather to the customers as a pass-through, and then in turn potentially on rent growth in california looking forward. so, we're definitely opposing prop 15.
ronald kamdem -- morgan stanley -- analyst
great, thanks for the time. i appreciate all the color.
ernest s. rady -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
hey ron, make sure and say it'll be rich for us, eh.
ronald kamdem -- morgan stanley -- analyst
sure thing.
robert barton -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from craig schimdt with bank of america. you may proceed with your question.
ernest s. rady -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
good morning craig.
craig schimdt -- bank of america -- analyst
good morning. thank you. in terms of the reserve for bad debt, primarily being at the foot of a couple of properties. i think i understand waikiki and del monte and i'm guessing alamo quarry, if some are to regal centers, but why was carmel mountain plaza pushing that bad debt number?
robert barton -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
well, i think a lot of it that you're seeing at del monte, alamo quarry and carmel mountain plaza, that's where the three theaters are located, so we've gone through and we've put a reserve on those particular ones, and then we've just had a lot of in the apparel industry. adam, maybe you want to talk to some of the -- not the negotiations specifically, but in general.
ernest s. rady -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
some of the collection efforts that houston is spearheading.
adam wyll -- executive vice president and chief operating officer
yeah. sure, just based on our challenges with a lot of these retailers, not just the mom and pop, but some of the national guys, i mean i think we're -- like ernest and bob have said, taking a more conservative view of our probability of collections on those guys. so, we're still all over these guys, and working with them as much as possible, but you want to be more conservative in our presentation and hope to surprise the upside on these guys?
ernest s. rady -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
would it be safe to say adam that everybody is trying everybody on for size to see if there is an opportunity and we are just going to have to speak up on our own behalf, and so far we're being successful.
adam wyll -- executive vice president and chief operating officer
yes. that's right. i mean all these guys are operating, as if, if you don't ask, you don't get it, so virtually everyone is asking for some form of relief from us maybe we've given relief to 20% to 30% of these guys so far, only when needed. but, we're just trying to be smart about it and take our time and not rush into it, but like we also said, those that are unilaterally withholding rents that have the money, those are the ones we're going after. we're not necessarily having to take reserves against those guys, it's the folks that are more challenged financially.
ernest s. rady -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
i think our stakeholders can be assured that we're doing everything we can on behalf of our stockholders to collect every rent -- dollar of rent that we're entitled and if we don't collect it, as adam said in his presentation, we're going to try and get something for what we have to give up and it's a negotiation with a committee that looks at every opportunity to come up with a [indecipherable] that is the best for the company.
craig schimdt -- bank of america -- analyst
okay, thank you for that. and then, i see a somewhat lower rent collection in october versus september for retail. i think, it goes from 82.6% to 77.3%, is that just a matter of timing?
robert barton -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
it's probably just a matter of timing because that's only as of -- i think it's like october 16 -- october -- at a certain point during october. so, a lot of it comes in at the end of the month because it's negotiating and some are slow-paying, but we're getting it.
adam wyll -- executive vice president and chief operating officer
yeah, even those with recurring payments that are making them are starting to pay later in the cycle. so, we do expect that number to increase -- those are our expectation now anyway.
craig schimdt -- bank of america -- analyst
great. and then just finally, it looks like you had 71,000 square feet of renewals. could you categorize those if you'd rank it, what type of tenants they were?
steve center -- vice president of office properties
on the renewals that would be in the back of the supplemental. i don't have the details on that in front of me craig. [multiple speakers]
craig schimdt -- bank of america -- analyst
no, i was talking, sorry -- talking retail. but, ok, let me relook at the supplemental. [multiple speakers]
steve center -- vice president of office properties
yes. it's 71,000, i don't have the sheet in front of me.
adam wyll -- executive vice president and chief operating officer
yeah, it's just a mix of different tenants that have come through the system.
steve center -- vice president of office properties
yeah, i don't have a break-out on it, it's just going be a mix of tenants that have come through.
ernest s. rady -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
that's a good question though craig. thanks for asking.
craig schimdt -- bank of america -- analyst
okay, thanks for that.
ernest s. rady -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
thank you sir.
adam wyll -- executive vice president and chief operating officer
thank you craig.
operator
thank you. [operator instructions] our next question comes from todd thomas with keybanc. you may proceed with your question.
ernest s. rady -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
morning todd.
todd thomas -- keybanc -- analyst
hi thanks, good morning. just a couple of questions on the office segment. curious for an update, i think last quarter there were no changes to the build-out and floor plans for google at landmark. just curious if you can provide an update there, if anything has changed and then whether there are any other tenants in the portfolio that might be looking to either reconfigure or maybe shed some space?
ernest s. rady -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
jerry has told me that google is continuing as per their original plans, and steve are you aware of anything that we should todd -- known to todd?
steve center -- vice president of office properties
i will add to google that autodesk is reconfiguring and investing more in their space. so, we're fortunate in that regard. our bigger tenants are moving forward with plans past this pandemic smoothly.
todd thomas -- keybanc -- analyst
okay. is there any sublease space in the office segment of the portfolio at all today?
steve center -- vice president of office properties
so, it's market by market. so, i'll say starting in san diego sublease is really muted. del mar heights is 0.6% vacancy for sublease space, utc is 0.7% those are our two main markets. san francisco, there is a lot of sublease space right now. there's been a big uptick there fortunately, autodesk and google occupy the entire landmark building and one beach is under redevelopment, we won't deliver that until 2022. so, hopefully we're through the worst of this at that time. portland again, sublease space is muted -- the total sublease vacancy in portland right now is 1.5%. bellevue has significant sublease space, but it's really kind of not an indicator there and that just -- it's currently on the east side market, in bellevue -- part of the east side market, it's a 37 million square foot market, there is 4.3 million square feet of office space under construction on the east side and it's 96% pre-leased, so that's a big block market. amazon, google facebook obviously microsoft and t-mobile has affirmed its commitment to that marketplace on the east side.
so, it's just very, very strong. we've got one floor available for sublease that cisco has up and we just got an rfp yesterday for 52,000 feet with an engineering firm, it's being displaced from a building that's being torn down to build a new building for amazon. so, bellevue is just extremely robust, strong and the sublease space is really isn't a big factor there, so hopefully that answers your question.
ernest s. rady -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
fortunately, being in bellevue, is being in the right place at the right time, and i don't know that we're that smart but we're certainly that lucky. so, we're glad to be there. thanks for the question todd.
todd thomas -- keybanc -- analyst
great. yeah. that's helpful. do you have a sense for what employee occupancy looks like in your assets across the office portfolio?
steve center -- vice president of office properties
it's low. it's probably sub 20% in most.
ernest s. rady -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
it's about 20% to 25%. but as i look at that circumstance, the associates want to come back to work and we want them to come back to work. this working from home is not the fun that everybody says. there will be some work from home going forward, but from an operational point of view and a mental health point of view and a company point of view and an individual point of view back to the office is the way to go with my view, and it will transpire to that -- or transform to that at some point over the future depending on what happens to covid-19.
steve center -- vice president of office properties
to add to that, i've had conversations with tenant rep brokers that represent some of the biggest companies out there, and they said behind the scene ceos are saying, get the heck back to work.
ernest s. rady -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
that's what i see.
steve center -- vice president of office properties
and we feel the same way. so, it's not a matter of -- it's a matter of when and google again is a good example that they did not modify their plans with covid in terms of configuration, so we will get there.
todd thomas -- keybanc -- analyst
okay and then in terms of the embassy suites bob, i was wondering if you had any visibility there on occupancy and adr heading into the fourth quarter and maybe also an update on bookings, as we think about 2021?
robert barton -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah, we ended at 66% occupancy on a weighted average basis for the quarter. we've seen -- during the third quarter, we've seen it tick up to like 75% and we've been trending in the last probably months somewhere between 52% to 65%. as we go into the fourth quarter, we'll probably keep it in that range, somewhere between 50% to 65% and right now, we do have bookings and we're looking forward, but they have the ability to counsel them depending on the -- if the quarantine -- openness of the quarantine in hawaii remains open, then we'll see a difference.
ernest s. rady -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
bob, is it safe to say that the adr is affected by the nature of our tenants now who are mostly government employees and not tourists and that tourists will, once this thing returns to normal our adr will return to normal?
robert barton -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. i think that's been very helpful. we can always lean on the dod -- the dod has been about 80% of our occupancy and then the local hawaiians have been the other 20% and as a result, both of those are at a much lower adr. the adr is probably somewhere between 205 and 225 compared to, i think, we hit 360 last year if not higher, on an average basis. obviously some rooms went much higher, and some were a little bit lower. but we're -- as i understand it, we are one of two hotels that are open on waikiki and we expect more to open as the tourism comes back, but having that open and being able to have a break-even has like been a win for us during this pandemic whereas i think the other eight hotels in waikiki has been completely closed.
todd thomas -- keybanc -- analyst
great.
ernest s. rady -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
not that i can guarantee you, but i think once people can travel they're coming back to hawaii. they're coming back to waikiki. that's a great piece of property and we've used this time to upgrade the property by painting, fixing the spalling, the salt air damage, upgrading the room furniture. so, we're ready to go and this economy -- people will be anxious to travel once this damn thing is over.
todd thomas -- keybanc -- analyst
all right, sounds good.
ernest s. rady -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
thank you.
robert barton -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thanks todd.

thank you. and i'm not showing any further questions at this time, i would now like to turn the call back over to ernest rady for any further remarks.
ernest s. rady -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
i want to thank you all for your patience during this difficult time. i can assure you that everybody at american assets trust is working hard to ensure that when things return to normal the results that we present will be more than adequate, and during this time we're doing the best we can. and it's not easy for anybody, it's not easy for us, but we're going to get there and at some point, we'll look back on this as a terrible memory. thank you all for attending.

operator
ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the third quarter 2020 american assets trust inc earnings conference call. [operator instructions] after the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [operator instructions] i would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, adam wyll, executive vice president and chief operating officer.
please go ahead, sir.
adam wyll -- executive vice president and chief operating officer
thank you, good morning everyone. welcome to american asset trust third quarter 2020 earnings call. yesterday afternoon our earnings release and supplemental information were furnished to the sec on form 8-k. both are now available on the investors section of our website americanassetstrust.com. a telephonic replay and on-demand webcast will also be available for this call over the next week.
during this call, we will discuss non-gaap financial measures, which are reconciled to our gaap financial results in our earnings release and supplemental information. we will also be making forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. these statements are subject to risks and uncertainties discussed in our sec filings. you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. actual events could cause our results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements for a number of reasons, including uncertainty related to the scope, severity and duration of the covid-19 pandemic, the actions taken to contain the pandemic or mitigate its impact, and the direct and indirect economic impact -- effect of the pandemic and containment measures on us and on our tenants.
and with that, i'll turn the call over to ernest rady, our chairman and ceo, to begin the discussion of our third quarter 2020 results. ernest?
ernest s. rady -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
thank you adam. good job. first and foremost, i would like to wish all of our stakeholders and their loved ones continued health and safety during these truly unprecedented times. we remain optimistic that a vaccine will be forthcoming over the next six to nine months and trust me, i'm going to be one of the first in line. but nevertheless, we are prepared to endure a prolonged pandemic with our solid balance sheet world-class properties and tenants, and incredibly dedicated and competent employees. fortunately now, the second and third quarters are behind us and i can tell you that our operations and financial results were nowhere near as catastrophic as my worst case projections that we modeled in april 2020.
as most of you know, for many years -- for many years many outsiders believed our asset diversification was perceived negatively relative to any of our best-in-class peers. however, we now know that our ownership of a combination of irreplaceable office, multifamily, retail and mixed-use properties as opposed to a single asset class provided us with much needed stability and protection from the risks associated with the changes in economic conditions of a particular market, industry or even economy, such as those changes created by covid-19.
we have constantly defended our asset class, diversity to stockholders and naysayers, but not anymore, and thanks in large to our asset diversification i wanted to mention that the board of directors has approved a quarterly dividend of $0.25 for the third quarter, which is supported by our rent collections in that third quarter. would we have declared a larger dividend? yes, probably and i would have benefited more than anywhere, but as fiduciary store stockholders and its staunch defenders of our balance sheet, we felt it's most prudent to remain conservative on our dividend until there is more visibility into a vaccine and an economic recovery.
in any case, a year or so from now, once there is a vaccine, we expect to look back and hope that this will be nothing but a bad memory. adam, bob and steve will go into more detail on our various asset segments and financial results, and i will be available for any questions you may have at the conclusion of the prepared remarks.
i'm now going to turn this call back over to adam wyll.
adam wyll -- executive vice president and chief operating officer
thanks ernest. one of our primary focuses over the past quarter has been collections in our retail segment. we are pleased to have made meaningful progress on that front where we began the pandemic initially collecting approximately 40% of retail rents in april to collecting approximately 80% retail rents in the third, quarter a number that we expect to get better. no doubt this was in large part due to the tireless work of our in-house collection team comprised of our property managers, lease administrators, legal staff and direct engagement by our executives with retailers. and though we remain sensitive and at times accommodating to the financial challenges of certain impact to tenants, we have certainly taken a more aggressive position with better capitalized tenants knowing the high quality of our underlying real estate and the clear rights we have embedded in our leases.
we expect those tenants to adhere to their contractual obligations and we continue to refuse to agree to deals that are not in the best interest of our company and our shareholders. as such, we expect our third quarter collections to improve further as we continue our efforts, and in fact we know more significant checks and wires are currently in transit from tenants on account of third quarter collections. our most notable collection challenges in the retail segment remain with our movie theaters, gyms and apparel stores as well as many of our retailers at waikiki beach walk which until mid-october, had no incoming tourism to sustain meaningful revenue for our tenants.
it is likely going to take several more months or quarters for us to have better visibility -- recovery by these more challenged tenants. that said, our focus continues to prioritize long-term strategic growth over the short term. so, we've entered into lease modifications that have provided certain tenants relief during the pandemic by way of deferrals or other monetary concessions where necessary, provided we obtain something in return whether by lease extensions, waiver, a certain tenant-friendly lease rights or incremental percentage rent. otherwise, we intend to pursue all means to enforce our rights under leases, including litigation as necessary, particularly for those unilaterally withholding rents when we believe they have the funds to pay.
additionally, we are pleased to report that 100% of our properties continue to remain open and accessible by our tenants in each of our markets and anecdotally the majority of our employees are voluntarily working in person at our properties or at our corporate offices each week while taking absolutely all prudent safety precautions, despite having the flexibility to work from home. we continue to firmly believe that post pandemic, being together in person will promote much better productivity, collaboration and innovation and we expect and i've heard similar sentiment from the majority of our office tenants.
finally, on the election front, we are closely following two propositions on the california ballot that take direct aim at commercial real estate. of course, we are firmly against prop 15 which would eliminate prop 13 taxpayer protection. if it passes, we would not expect it to create an immediate, meaningful impact to our company but rather would place a significant pass through financial burden on our tenants at a time when they are already struggling, not to mention the likely negative impact of those property taxes on future rent growth. and also, we are against prop 21 which we believe is a flawed measure that would implement a significant amendment to existing rent control laws on the multifamily side, limiting landlords' rights and likely making the housing crisis in california even worse.
we are contributing, our resources to impose those propositions. while the challenges we face today are complex, whether relating to the pandemic, racial, [indecipherable] technology or legislative matters to name a few, we do believe that we are well positioned to navigate through and manage these challenges with, as ernest mentioned our best-in-class assets, our 200 talented and dedicated employees and the strength of our balance sheet. with that, i will turn the call over to bob to discuss q3 results in more detail.
robert barton -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
good morning and thank you ernest and adam. last night we reported third quarter 2020 ffo of $0.44 per share and net income attributable to common stockholders of $0.08 per share for the third quarter. let me begin with my perspective that i am optimistic with the overall performance of this portfolio, even in light of the pandemic we are all going through. we too are feeling the bumps along the road like everyone else in our sectors. what makes me optimistic about our portfolio and its future are the following. number one, our collections of monthly recurring billings continue to improve in q3 over q2 with total collections of approximately 89% in q3 versus 80% in q2. number two, we believe we have ample liquidity to weather the storm that we are going through.
we prepared for the worst-case scenario by modeling a $50 million quarterly burn rate at the beginning of this pandemic, not knowing what we were going into and in q2, our actual burn rate was approximately $6 million. in q3, we ended up with a cash surplus of approximately $9 million and this is after the operating capital expenditures and the dividend. we started q3 with approximately $146 million of cash on the balance sheet and ended q3 with approximately $155 million of cash on the balance sheet, primarily as a result of increased cash noi, quarter-over-quarter due to our successful collection efforts outlined earlier by adam.
number three, we have additional liquidity of $250 million available on our line of credit, combined with an entire portfolio of unencumbered properties with the exception of our only mortgage which is on city center bellevue. number four, we believe we have embedded growth in cash flow in our office portfolio with approximately $30 million plus of growth in the office cash noi between now and the end of 2022 as steve will discuss later. and lastly, once we get a vaccine, we believe our high quality west coast portfolio will rebound. we believe our embassy suites which is currently at approximately a break-even cash noi will rebound based on its location and tourism. on october 15, hawaii allowed tourists to come back to the island as they can demonstrate that they have had a negative covid tests within the last 72 hours.
on the first day, there were approximately 10,000 tourists that landed in hawaii, we expect that tourism inflow to continue to increase each week and to start benefiting our hawaiian properties over the coming quarters. let's take a moment to look at the results of the third quarter for each property segment. our office property segment continues to perform well, as expected during these uncertain times. office properties excluding one beach street in san francisco, which is under redevelopment were at 96% occupancy at the end of the third quarter, an increase of approximately 2% from the prior year.
more importantly, same-store cash noi increased 13% in q3 over the prior year, primarily from increases in base rent at la jolla commons, torrey reserve campus, city center bellevue and the lloyd district portfolio. our retail properties continue to be significantly impacted by the pandemic, although the occupancy at our retail properties remain stable for the third quarter at 95% occupancy which was a decrease of approximately 3% from the prior year our retail collections have been challenging during the pandemic, as reflected in our negative same store cash noi.
our multifamily properties experienced a challenging quarter, as same-store cash noi decreased approximately 5.4% due primarily from the increase in average occupancy -- or i'm sorry, due primarily from the decrease in average occupancy at hassalo in portland, offset by favorable master lease signed with a private university in san diego area at the beginning of the quarter. on a segment basis, occupancy was at 87.5% at the end of the third quarter, a decrease of approximately 3% from the prior year. we expect our occupancy to return to normal, stabilized levels at hassalo as we have recently adjusted pricing and concessions.
with these adjustments, in the last 10 days we have already seen leasing traffic increase from a weekly average of four to six tour's per week, to 10 to 12 tours per week. we have captured a total of 11 new leases in just the last week. our mixed use property consisting of the embassy suites hotel and the waikiki beach walk retail is located on the island of oahu. the state of hawaii remained in a self-quarantine throughout most of the third quarter, significantly impacted the operating results for the third quarter of 2020.
the embassy suites' average occupancy for the third quarter of 2020 was 66% compared with the average occupancy in the second quarter of 2020 of 17%. the average daily rate for the third quarter of 2020 was $209, which is approximately 40% of the prior year's adr. waikiki beach walk retail suffered considerably with virtually no tourists on the island until recently. we are working daily with our tenants at waikiki beach walk to formalize a recovery plan that benefits both our tenants and the company utilizing all resources necessary, including state and city grant programs and lobbying efforts. let's talk about bad debt expense reserves in the third quarter; as noted in our earnings release in the third quarter, we collected approximately 89% of what was billed in q3 to our tenants.
we had covid-19 adjustments amounting to 2% of what was billed in q3 to our tenants and the balance of approximately 9% is the amount outstanding of what was billed in q3. this is compared to the second quarter collections of 81%, covid-19 adjustments of 5% and q2 amounts that were billed and still outstanding of 14%. also as noted in our earnings release in the third quarter, we incurred an additional bad debt expense of accounts receivable of approximately 21% of the outstanding uncollected amounts at the end of q3, and we incurred an additional bad debt expense of straight-line rent receivables of approximately 11%. this is compared to a bad debt expense accounts receivable of approximately 14% of the outstanding uncollected amounts at the end of q2 and bad debt expense of straight-line rent receivables of approximately 7% at the end of q2.
it's easy to get confused on all these percentages. however, from a big picture perspective, at the end of the third quarter, our total allowance for doubtful accounts, which reflects the cumulative bad debt expense charges recorded totals approximately 39% of our gross accounts receivable and approximately 3% of our straight-line rent receivables. let's talk about liquidity; as we look at our balance sheet and liquidity at the end of the third quarter, we had approximately $405 million in liquidity, comprised of $155 million of cash and cash equivalents and $250 million of availability on our line of credit, and only one of our properties is encumbered by mortgage. our leverage, which we measure in terms of net debt to ebitda was 6.7 times on a quarterly, annualized basis.
on a trailing 12 month basis, our ebitda would be approximately 6.0 times. our focus is to maintain our net debt-to-ebitda at 5.5 times or below. our interest coverage and fixed charge coverage ratio ended the quarter at 3.6 times on a quarterly annualized basis and 3.9 times on a trailing 12 month basis. as it relates to guidance, as previously disclosed, we withdrew our 2020 guidance on april 3 due to the uncertainty that the pandemic would have on our existing guidance, particularly in our hotel and retail sectors.
until we have a clear view of the economic impact of the pandemic or more certainty as to when a vaccine becomes available, we will refrain from issuing further guidance. i'll now turn the call over to steve center, vice president of office properties for a brief update on our office segment. steve?
steve center -- vice president of office properties
thanks bob. as bob said earlier, at the end of the third quarter, net of one beach, which is under redevelopment our office portfolio stood at over 96% leased with just under 6% expiring through the end of 2021. given the quality of our assets and the strength of the markets in which they are located with technology and life science as key market drivers, we continue to execute new and renewal leases at favorable rental rates delivering continued noi growth in our office segment. the weighted average base rent increase for our nine renewals completed during the quarter was 6.7% and it's also as bob pointed out earlier, with leases already signed, we have locked in approximately $30 million of noi growth in our office segment priced at approximately [indecipherable] in 2020, $14 million in $2021 and $10 million in 2022.
we anticipate significant additional noi growth in 2022 and 2023 through the redevelopment of leasing of 102,000 square feet at one beach street in san francisco and 33,000 rentable square feet at 710 oregon square in the lloyd submarket in portland. in addition, we have the ability to organically grow our office portfolio by up to an additional 768,000 square feet or 22% on sites we already own by building tower 3 at la jolla commons, a 213,000 square foot tower that's currently into the city for permits and blocks 90 and 103 at oregon square with two configuration options, one at 392,000 square feet and the other at 555,000 square feet, which we recently received the entitlements on from the portland design review commission.
we continue evaluating market conditions, prospective tenant interest and hopefully decreasing construction costs on these development opportunities. in summary, we have a stable office portfolio, little near term rollover, significant build in noi growth and additional upside through repositioning and redevelopment within our existing portfolio plus substantial new development on sites we already are on. operator, i'll now turn the call over to you for questions.

hello. i guess, good morning.
ernest s. rady -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
good morning, craig.
craig schmidt -- bank of america -- analyst
good morning. i'm wondering what does the retail leasing pipeline look like heading into 2021, and what do you think you'll do relative to the 303,000 you leased in 2020?
ernest s. rady -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
chris, can you answer that? yes.
chris sullivan -- vice president of retail properties
yes.
ernest s. rady -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
i know it's not the -- the pipeline is not as barren as the press says, but it's -- certainly, it's not as brilliant as we'd like.
chris sullivan -- vice president of retail properties
yes, craig, can you repeat the second half of your question? you had a number there. you said 300,000?

i was thinking you're referring to the roll that's going to -- that comes up through 2021. from a pipeline standpoint, you're starting to see retailers pop their head back out. so, given -- activity started picking up a little bit in q4, and it's continuing to roll some momentum coming into first quarter of 2021. i can't give you an exact number, but i am way more bullish that they're starting to look around and starting to do tours again, the phones are ringing with more activity. and then of course as for the roll of our renewals coming up, and i think the majority of those will probably get renewed. as bob said earlier, i think we really hit the trough in q4. there is still some turbulence ahead, but springs coming and you're starting to see talk of going back to school, vaccines are common and retailers getting more optimistic.
craig schmidt -- bank of america -- analyst
great. and then the trend of leasing spreads turned negative in the fourth quarter, but it sounds like you'll see a more positive result on leasing spreads in '21?
adam wyll -- executive vice president and chief operating officer
craig. i hope so. it's combat leasing from what i can tell you. the retailers, i don't know the last time you bought a new suit was or any of us, but the retailers are still -- we're still having their troubles in quite a few categories. so, i don't want to lean to tell you that i'm going to be seeing rates come up. some situations, it's a balancing act between occupancy and rate, and i'm always a fan, let's be there to fight another battle.
ernest s. rady -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
it's hand to hand combat, craig, and the retailers at the moment have the upper hand. i think that the biggest cost in real estate is vacancy, and we're going to focus on keeping our properties well occupied as possible, particularly as we come out of this difficult pandemic.
craig schmidt -- bank of america -- analyst
thank you. that's helpful.
ernest s. rady -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
thank you, sir.

your next question comes from the line of haendel st. juste from mizuho.
ernest s. rady -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
haendel, good morning.
haendel st. juste -- mizuho -- analyst
hey. good morning. good job, everyone.
ernest s. rady -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
thank you. thank you.
adam wyll -- executive vice president and chief operating officer
that's the one thing we all are doing.
haendel st. juste -- mizuho -- analyst
just a question for you, i guess on the dividend. i guess we're all -- some of us are scratching our head here on why you're raising the dividend now versus maybe saving the cash and de-levering a bit more, your leverage is above 7 times. i understand the higher collections and confidence. but there's still a lot of uncertainty, spreads are under a bit of pressure it sounds. hawaii seems like it's going to be soft, the near term. so, i guess why not hold off a bit and de-lever a bit?
ernest s. rady -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
haendel, that's a very good question. i suggested to the board that to increase a $0.01 or $0.02, to indicate that we have confidence in the quality of our portfolio, our financial position and our management, they felt that i was underestimating all those three and they added another $0.01. so, the board made that decision independently, and i think they were fine. i mean, we have a difference by a $0.01, but not much more. i think that this is going to be a significant recovery once we get the vaccine.
robert barton -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes, haendel, let me just add to that. it's -- the methodology is also consistent with our collections, and we try to stay consistent on that, or the board tried to stay consistent on that. and from -- the other thing is, as we mentioned, is that we believe that q4 is the bottom or if not close to the bottom. and what's changed is also too that people are starting to get vaccines. so, there is a lot more data points out there, and we think the board thought that this is the right thing to do.
haendel st. juste -- mizuho -- analyst
thanks a lot, bot. maybe as an add-on for you, you mentioned the mid-5 times debt-ebitda is a long-term target. curious on when do you think we'll get there, and do we start to see some inflection here in the next quarter or two? the last couple of quarters you've been trending up. so, just curious on some perspective on reaching that long term mid 5 target?
ernest s. rady -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
he wants to know when you're going to hit 5.5 times, you say you'd like to get there, and he wants a timeframe.
robert barton -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
okay. well, thanks for that question, haendel. i get paid extra for being amateur for the roll. well, haendel, that's why we also set a framework on how to think about the portfolio. i can't tell you what that percentage is for the second half of this year, but our view or my particular view would be is that, once everybody in america is vaccinated or once we've vaccinated and we get that herd immunity, give us approximately 12 months from that period of time and i think we will trend back down to that 5.5 times, based on the growth, based on -- i mean, think about how much we've lost out of embassy and waikiki beach walk retail. i mean, both of those, each of those, the retail, the waikiki beach walk retail and the embassy are anywhere from $12 million to $14 million each of cash noi. so, that's probably about $0.14 each of them for additional ffo.
so, let us rebound. i mean, let us get to the vaccine. get me to that point, give us 12 months.
ernest s. rady -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
you have no idea how focused is on 5.5. i say, good morning, bob. he replies, 5.5.
haendel st. juste -- mizuho -- analyst
i love it. i love it. and then on hawaii, i guess what are you hearing for tourism expectations for this year? obviously, there's lots of uncertainty, but i guess what's the latest, any -- any stats on the tourism board or anything that you could put some numbers around to help us understand perhaps what the expectation is?
ernest s. rady -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
i don't think we could tell you anything which you could take to the bank. it's just so uncertain. on the other hand, the direction seems to be right with vaccines become available. i feel strongly that there is a pent-up demand for americans to travel and many of us have the resources to travel. we've been pent up and for this last 9 months, and once we get out of out-of-home, we're going to travel. so, i think -- i don't know how, and i don't know when, but i expect it's coming.
haendel st. juste -- mizuho -- analyst
fair enough. thank you, guys. good luck.
ernest s. rady -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
thank you, haendel.

your next question comes from rich hill from morgan stanley.
rich hill -- morgan stanley -- analyst
hey, good morning guys.
ernest s. rady -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
good morning, rich.
rich hill -- morgan stanley -- analyst
ernest, i'm really curious about where you're going to go first when the world does reopen. but we can have that conversation offline. bob, i do have some questions for you. i appreciate the guidance or the non-guidance guidance, is that what we're supposed to call it bob?
robert barton -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes.
rich hill -- morgan stanley -- analyst
as you think about 2021, it occurs to us that there is a lot of noise on straight-line rents and abatements. 4q, the miss versus our numbers was almost all straight-line rents. so, as you think about the leasing environment in 2021, and i appreciate the guidance about how we should think about the velocity in 1q, 2q, 3q and 4q. but can you maybe talk about what -- are all the abatements supposed to go away or all the deferrals supposed to go away? how are you thinking about that as you negotiate with retailers or retailers and office tenants for that matter?
robert barton -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
well, i think that -- yes, i'll try to answer that. i mean, i think, what is out there in terms of straight line, in terms of deferred rents, we expect to collect those. to the extent that we don't collect them, where we don't think that we're 75% or more confident that we're going to collect them, we'll put a reserve up. but right now, i mean we're still confident on what remains on the books in terms of collecting those in 2021, we're hopeful. and i think everybody in the real estate industry is hopeful that once this vaccine comes together, you will start seeing the retail to start opening and you'll start seeing the companies and the tenants that we do have straight-line rent across pursuing their growth in their companies that we've tried to nurse through this ugly pandemic. so, we're still confident on what we got.
rich hill -- morgan stanley -- analyst
got it. so, it sounds like 1q and 2q are going to be still a little bit messy hand-to-hand combat. but then the world would just get back to normal from an abatement and deferral standpoint and rent growth standpoint thereafter, is that a right characterization?
robert barton -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
that would be my perspective, where i stand today. that's our best estimate and we think with the amount of vaccines that are being disseminated across at this point in time, i think ernest had his second shot this last weekend.
ernest s. rady -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
i've been hugging everybody since.
robert barton -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
this world, this pandemic will ultimately come to an end, and things will get better.
ernest s. rady -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
from both your lips to god's ears, let's make it happen.
robert barton -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes.
rich hill -- morgan stanley -- analyst
so, steve, one quick question for you. i'm nitpicking here. but it looks like occupancy maybe declined slightly for la jolla and one beach, if i was looking at it correctly. again, very, very slightly. could you just maybe go into a little bit more detail on any quarter-over-quarter change in demand that you're seeing on those two properties?
steve center -- vice president of office properties
it wasn't one beach. so, you might to think about, one beach is kind of offline right now as we redevelop it. but in utc, we had trinet, who had sublease their space, move out of a 6,000 foot space. that was a blip there, if you will. but we successfully renewed other tenants -- smaller tenants now, that building. so, we've been really successful holding rates. there's no covid discount. we've been more flexible on lease term with smaller tenants who are uncertain about the future. i mean, i've got an engineering firm that's got three people over 65, and so they're kind of -- i don't know that i can commit long term right now.
fortunately, as we pointed out on the call, we've got about 51.5% of our tenants are top-10 and very stable. furthermore, they continue to grow. i mean, vmware, they're coming up one -- they've got 35,000 feet rolling next year and we're already in discussions about trying to find another floor form them in the building, as well as talking renewal.
so, we're fortunate in that regard. i don't know about the other property. and then here in del mar heights, we strategically let a couple of smaller tenants roll to aggregate figure blocks of space. so, that's being smart about commodity space versus big blocks, which are scarce, we're going to get premium rents for. so, the blip that you saw, i mean there is some softness due to covid, clearly. i mentioned the engineering firm.
our teams are doing a great job of taking care of our tenants. they want to stay with us. some just say i don't need 5,000 feet, i need 3,000. and if we're able to accommodate them and keep our existing customers, we're doing it. but we'll get -- '21 is a year for bunch of small tenants, we still have 41 tenants rolling at an average of 3,700 feet in 2021. '22 is a much better story and that about two-thirds of the tenants rolling are big. they're the vmware's, they're other bigger customers.
and then in terms of pricing power, this quarter the ending versus new rate is a bit muted, but it just depends on where. so, going through the portfolio of bellevue, we're 97% leased, but we've got 23.5% rolling through 2022, but those are going to be outsized increases in rent. we've been very successful with rent increases there and that should continue. portland, same story. we're 97% leased there. we've got 8.4% rolling. and again, the rates are holding up there. so, we are doing well.
san francisco, we're out of business there until we have to renew autodesk in 2022; and then san diego, down here the rent increases are 2% to 6% versus 20% portland or 30% and 35% in bellevue.
so, it's kind of lumpy. it just depends on when you're going to make these renewals and reset rents, and what level. so, this was -- this last quarter was just a bit quiet and mainly focused on markets that aren't as hyperinflationary as bellevue and portland.
ernest s. rady -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
one piece to make it clear, we emptied it so that we could reposition it.
rich hill -- morgan stanley -- analyst
okay, that's -- i'll go back and look at the disclosure. hey bob, just one more question for me. given that you're guiding without guiding, can you talk about 2022 to a little bit? is it just going to be back to -- i actually don't -- i'm not sure the market even cares about 2021 at this point. is 2022, business as usual and all the plans that we were previously discussing this time last year fully intact?
robert barton -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes, nothing has changed on that. i mean, we still expect our cash noi to increase in the office sector by, i think, $12 million in '21, $13 million in 2022. we're just -- as we begin our development on la jolla commons iii, which should conclude -- should be completed by the end of '23, i see a big pick up after that. and one beach, one beach should be finished by the end of 2022. so, what we're doing is we're taking advantage of the opportunities that currently exist within our own portfolio. we don't need any acquisitions to create value at this point in time. we're always looking, but we have plenty just within our own portfolio to create significant value.
rich hill -- morgan stanley -- analyst
perfect. thanks, bob. thanks, everyone. i appreciate the additional color.
robert barton -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thank you, rich.
ernest s. rady -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
thanks, rich.

your next question comes from the line of todd thomas from keybanc capital markets.
ernest s. rady -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
hi, todd.
todd thomas -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
hi, thanks. hi, good morning. the first question just around the color in detail for '21 and '22. bob, appreciate those comments, and you mentioned the 4q would likely be the bottom or close to the bottom. is that inclusive of the $0.05 make whole that will be recognized in the first quarter, meaning that excluding that make whole, you would expect to be at around $0.46 as sort of a baseline, is that the right way to think about it?
robert barton -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes, that is. i mean, so $0.41 does not include the make whole. so, that's -- so if you continue that, based on my comments, you would say start with $0.41 in q1. from that, you would deduct $0.05 for that make whole and add -- and deduct another $0.03 for incremental interest expense in q1. so, on the script that we just shared with you, it will give you a road map on how we -- a roadmap for a framework on how i think or we think that you can view '21.
and then in the second half of that, you make your own assessment or determine what you think the percentage should be on the pickup in that. but keep in mind, of that $0.41 for q4 that i am suggesting we start with in q1, that includes $0.10 of reserves, $7.6 million of reserves in the fourth quarter. so, as you start the second half, is that really going to happen? i don't think so.
todd thomas -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
okay, got it. so, $0.41 goes to $0.36 with the make whole in the first quarter, less some incremental interest expense, and then you'd expect to build back throughout the year, obviously adjusting for the $0.05 make whole?
robert barton -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes. yes.
todd thomas -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
that's helpful.
robert barton -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
and then if you have any questions, please feel free to reach out.
todd thomas -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
sure. i appreciate that. and then steve or bob, maybe regarding the $24 million of office cash noi that's locked in, that's expected to commence during ' 21 and '22, how much of that is being straight line today versus what has yet to commence for ffo purposes on a gaap basis?
robert barton -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes, i don't have that in front of me, but really that's been included in our presentation in terms of that cash noi growth. and really what we're showing is the growth in that fad. and that obviously will drop on down, obviously has to be adjusted for anything related to the straight line on that. but i don't have the exact number on that.
ernest s. rady -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
good question. thank you.
todd thomas -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
okay. and in terms of the 14 million in '21, what's kind of the cadence sort of quarterly, how should we think about the timing of the cash commencements throughout the year?
robert barton -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
well, in q1 and q2, we have big tis going out. we have probably $25 million of tis related to a large tenants up in landmark. so, it will probably be more in the second half of the year.
todd thomas -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
okay. and then at the multifamily assets, so it sounds like you saw a bounce in occupancy in january at hassalo. can you just talk a little bit about the pricing strategy there and use of concessions and maybe provide some color on leasing activity in general? it sounds like you're -- it seems like you're holding rates in anticipation of a further return in demand. just curious if you could sort of talk about hassalo a little bit and the portland assets?
ernest s. rady -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
as steve pointed out, our office portfolio in portland is excellent. our portfolio of residential is we had a management issue, which we've now taken care of. so, it's too early to say how much of a recovery we're going to make. but the early indications, as bob pointed out in his report, is that we are leasing up.
we are -- the biggest cost in real estate is vacancy. so, we may do some things in the short run to increase our occupancy, and can eliminate some of the vacancy. so, i don't know how to answer that question properly. it's too early to say. but we'll make it work, i'll tell you that.
todd thomas -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
okay. can you share what the occupancy build look like in january?
ernest s. rady -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
do we have that?
robert barton -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
i don't.
steve center -- vice president of office properties
i think we went from 75% or 85% or 87% occupancy, not that much.
robert barton -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
no 80s.
steve center -- vice president of office properties
no 80s?
robert barton -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
i mean, yes, we don't have that right in front of us.
ernest s. rady -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
let me turn the corner.
robert barton -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
we're in an upward trajectory.
todd thomas -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
okay, got it. and just one last one if i could on the master lease at loma palisades and pacific ridge. can you just remind us when that expires and do you expect the school to reup and renew that master lease or what do you expect to happen there?
ernest s. rady -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
i don't know that we have an expectation. we're certainly working on it. and abigail, do you want to say something when it expires?
abigail rex -- director, multifamily, san diego
hi, good morning. so that master lease for both pacific ridge and loma expires on may 31 of this year.
ernest s. rady -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
and have you had any discussions about renewing it or is that still off the table?
abigail rex -- director, multifamily, san diego
so, off the table, we all hope that with the vaccine, students will be able to return to school in the fall, and that is the hope i think of every university. we'll just have to play it by year and hope that there is a renewal or that there's further partnership. but i don't have any further information at this current moment.
todd thomas -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
okay, all right. thank you.
ernest s. rady -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
thank you.

your next question comes from the line of daniel ismail from green street.
ernest s. rady -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
good morning, daniel.
dylan -- green street -- analyst
hey, guys. this is dylan [phonetic] on for danny. but hey, how are you guys doing this morning?
ernest s. rady -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
nobody here has covid. tested everybody.
dylan -- green street -- analyst
just a few questions on the development of one landmark [phonetic]. you guys mentioned i think it's starting sometime in the next few months. you guys -- is that subject to a pre-lease, are you guys going to start that on-stack?
steve center -- vice president of office properties
which one?
adam wyll -- executive vice president and chief operating officer
you're talking one beach la jolla commons down in utc?
dylan -- green street -- analyst
sorry, la jolla commons.
ernest s. rady -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
there is no pre-leasing. i had lunch yesterday with one of the senior partners in the law firm. and he said, they were considering that site and they weren't sure if we'd started. there's never been pre-leasing in san diego. so, we have a couple of years to build it. during that time, we hope the market recovers. it's a very strong market. and that's kind of the story.
adam wyll -- executive vice president and chief operating officer
yes, hey, dan, i think steve's comments that he shared our very strong reasons why we should pursue that without any pre-lease. for instance like, two remaining lots in oregon square, that's not a -- that is something that you would want to pre-lease.
ernest s. rady -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
you would want to rebuild.
adam wyll -- executive vice president and chief operating officer
[speech overlap] correct, yes, thank you. you'd want to get a tenant before you build that. now, like ernest said, in utc, and for what steve's comments were, those are all the comments why you would want to go forward without a tenant at this point in time. obviously, you would love to have a tenant. but by the time you finish, that's going to be an even stronger market than it is today.
ernest s. rady -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
and we've used this time to buy the project out and i think we've had some savings that we would not have had if we were trying to build a year from now.
steve center -- vice president of office properties
so, we are going.
dylan -- green street -- analyst
perfect. that makes sense. and then just kind of as a follow-up to that, i think our math implies $80 rent per square foot at that property. is that -- i guess, a, is that accurate? and b, how does that compare to where you guys signed the alumina lease back in, i think, late '19 when you guys initially acquired this property over there?
steve center -- vice president of office properties
rents for new product are much higher. we're in the high fours strip on that, with $1.70 in expenses. i'm talking on a monthly basis. i haven't converted into a gross for annual. but the alumina lease started 4.90 full service, and has 3% annual bond. so, and that -- the rents i just mentioned, the triple net rents i just mentioned are affirmed by two recent deals, one in june, one in december for deals new products. so, that's today's rents and that's what we put in the pro forma and we'll how the market goes, but we're bullish.
ernest s. rady -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
bullish, and we're also a printing that the economy recovers. and -- but in the short run, the leasing is less certain than we'd like. in the long run, it's a giant win. it's a great location, great property.
dylan -- green street -- analyst
perfect. that was very helpful. thanks, guys.
ernest s. rady -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
thank you.

and i show no further questions at this time. i will now turn the call to mr. ernest rady, for any closing remarks.

hello and welcome to the q4 2020 american assets trust, inc. earnings conference call. [operator instructions] as a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.
it is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host for today, mr. adam wyll, evp and chief operating officer. sir, the floor is yours.
adam wyll -- executive vice president and chief operating officer
thank you. good morning, everyone. welcome to american assets trust inc.'s fourth quarter and year-end 2020 earnings call. yesterday afternoon, our earnings release and supplemental information were furnished to the sec on form 8-k. both are now available on the investors section of our website, americanassetstrust.com. telephonic replay and on-demand webcast will also be available for this call over the next week.
during this call, we will discuss non-gaap financial measures which are reconciled to our gaap financial results in our earnings release and supplemental information.
we will also be making forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. these statements are subject to risks and uncertainties discussed in our sec filings. you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. actual events could cause our results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements, for a number of reasons, including uncertainty related to the scope, severity and duration of the covid-19 pandemic on us and on our tenants.
and with that, i'll turn the call over to ernest rady, our chairman and ceo, to begin the discussion of our fourth quarter and year-end 2020 results. ernest?
ernest s. rady -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
thanks, adam. great job. first and foremost, i would like to wish all our stakeholders and their loved ones continued health and safety during these truly unprecedented times. now that people are starting to get vaccinated, we are optimistic and even hopeful eventually this pandemic will no longer be a threat, lives will return to some kind of normalcy and the economy will recover.
however, at the present time, this pandemic continues to create challenges within our portfolio, particularly for our three theaters, gym's and our waikiki beach walk properties.
as most of you know, all of our properties in hawaii are owned fee simple and are very valuable. we have a strong view that post-pandemic, waikiki will return to normal, pent up tourism returning and every night being like a friday night.
while this pandemic still remains a threat that we believe we are well prepared to endure a prolonged pandemic with our irreplaceable portfolio, our best-in-class operating platform, our top-notch management team, our disciplined financial strength and a very strong balance sheet.
in such regard, i am extremely proud to announce that our inaugural public offering, which we closed on january 26, 2021, the offering consists of $500 million of 3.38% senior unsecured notes due 2031. and by the way, it was oversubscribed 4 times.
this spot offering provides substantial liquidity, staying power, and provided for the repayment of $200 million -- $250 million of debt and provides all funds needed for the development of la jolla commons iii, which we plan to break ground this april.
success and demand of this bond offering in the midst of a pandemic is truly a testament to our incredible properties, efficient operating portfolio, and our top-notch management team.
bob will provide more financial details on the bond offering.
finally, i'd like to mention that the board of directors has approved a quarterly dividend of $0.28 for the first quarter, an increase of $0.03 from our previous dividend, which we believe is supported by our collection efforts in the fourth quarter, and is an expression of our board's confidence in the embedded growth of our portfolio that we believe will recover post-pandemic. and bob, adam and steve will go into more detail on our various asset segments and financial results, and i will be available for any questions you may have at the conclusion of our prepared remarks.
i'm now going to turn the call back to adam. adam, please?
adam wyll -- executive vice president and chief operating officer
thanks, ernest. good job.
ernest s. rady -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
as you can see, we're mutually cooperative.
adam wyll -- executive vice president and chief operating officer
we remain optimistic with the overall performance of our portfolio, even in light of the pandemic, and we are pleased to report that 100% of our properties are currently open and accessible by our tenants in each of our markets.
of course, we too have felt the bumps along the road like everyone else in our sectors. yet, our collections of monthly recurring billings due continued to improve in q4 over q3 and q3 over q2. the total collections to-date of approximately 92% in q4 versus 90% in q3 and 87% in q2.
january is currently trending consistent with q4, just over 91% to-date, and likely to increase further, all despite the headwinds of governor newsom shutdown restrictions in california that lasted through most of december and january.
collections for essential tenants in our retail portfolio, which represent approximately one-third of retail build rents were almost 100% in q3 and q4. and collections for nonessential tenants continued to improve from 69% in q3 to over 74% in q4.
of note, no tenant in our retail portfolio represents more than 2% of our abr, and less than 6% of our retail portfolio is due to expire in 2021, assuming no exercise of lease options.
and of the approximately 500 tenants in our retail portfolio, since the beginning of the pandemic, we have had 13 retailers file bankruptcy, covering 18 total tenant lease spaces, of which 13 spaces have been assumed or are in the process of being assumed in bankruptcy, which we believe is a testament to us having superior locations that these restructured tenants want to remain in. notably, the rejected leases to-date were less than 13,000 square feet in the aggregate.
as you would expect, our primary collection challenges remain in the retail segment with our movie theaters and gym's, as well as many of our retailers at waikiki beach walk, which until mid-october had no incoming tourism to sustain meaningful revenue for our tenants.
so, we believe the pent-up demand for travel to hawaii is massive. we expect the tourism to rebound to occur at more deliberate pace until a broader vaccine rollout is achieved, hopefully by this upcoming summer. in the meantime, we are working with these challenged retailers who historically have been great operators to bridge them through to the recovery. this is part of our recurring thesis of prioritizing long-term strategic growth over the short term.
despite the uncertainty, we remain optimistic that we will continue to see sequential improvement spurred by the vaccine's distribution, government stimulus and anticipated pent up travel demand in regions that have yet to fully reopen their economies.
as ernest mentioned, we believe that we are well positioned to navigate through and manage these challenges. we have been through challenging times before and each time we have emerged stronger, given our long-term focus on high quality, diversified asset base. we expect this time will be no different.
with that, i'll turn the call over to bob to discuss q4 and year-end results in more detail.
robert barton -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
good morning and thank you, ernest and adam. last night, we reported fourth quarter and year ended 2020 ffo per share of $0.41 and $1.89 respectively, and fourth quarter and year ended 2020 net income attributable to common stockholders per share of $0.05 and $0.46 respectively.
the lower ffo in the fourth quarter, which is approximately $0.05 lower than the bloomberg consensus is primarily the result of additional reserves for our theaters, gym's and waikiki beach walk retail. nevertheless, we remain optimistic of this portfolio, even in light of the pandemic.
the highlights of this quarter are, one, we have ample liquidity. as ernest previously mentioned, we recently completed our inaugural public bond offering. in the midst of this unprecedented pandemic, we closed on $500 million of 3.38% 10-year senior unsecured notes. with the proceeds from the offering, we repaid $150 million senior guaranteed notes series a and repaid the $100 million outstanding on our revolving line of credit. we expect to use remaining $236 million of proceeds to fund our la jolla commons iii development in the utc submarket of san diego, as well as continue our renovation of one beach street in san francisco, with the remaining amounts for general corporate purposes and potential accretive acquisition opportunities.
at the beginning of this week, we had approximately $380 million of cash on the balance sheet with zero outstanding on our $350 million line of credit. we chose to access the public debt markets now because of the low treasury yield and strength of the credit markets that we've been seeing during this pandemic. we had the ability to access the public debt market several years prior to this, but we weren't ready to commit to being a regular issuer on a frequent basis until now. what's changed is that we have the ability to ladder our existing debt maturities today, so that we have close to, if not more than $400 million in future debt requirements on a recurring basis over an 18 to 24-month period, while at the same time being laser focused on a 5.5 times net debt-to-ebitda or less. a conservative balance sheet is very important to us.
during this pandemic, our ebitda has been challenged, like others with exposure to retail and our hotel, resulting in lower ebitda. we believe that our high-quality portfolio and superior close to west coast locations will begin to return to normal post-pandemic, and our expectation is that our net debt-to-ebitda will begin working its way back down to 5.5% or less, based on the corporate model that i'm looking at.
number two, we have embedded contractual growth and cash flow in our office portfolio, with approximately $24 million of in-place growth in just the office cash noi in '21 and '22.
number three, our same store cash -- office cash noi came in at just 3% due to abatements that were provided to our gsa tenants at our first & main in portland, oregon, as part of their lease renewal package during q1 2020. these abatements continued through february '21. absent these short-term abatements, office same store cash noi growth in q4 '20 compared to q4 '19 would have been approximately 7%.
number four, multifamily properties incurred mixed results based on their geographic locations. for our multifamily properties located in portland, occupancy was down 17% compared to the same quarter last year, while the weighted average monthly base rent increased approximately 1.4%. for our multifamily properties located in san diego, occupancy remained stable at approximately the same over the prior year, while the weighted average monthly base rent increased 7.3% over the prior year.
of note, our occupancy levels in portland have been trending much higher since the beginning of the year with our recent leasing momentum, bringing optimism that we will return to a more normalized pre-pandemic occupancy level.
number five, let's talk about guidance. as previously disclosed, we withdrew our guidance in april 2020, due to the uncertainty that the pandemic would have on our existing guidance, particularly in our mixed use and retail sectors. until we have a clear view of the duration of the economic impact and the economy shows signs of recovery, we will refrain from issuing formal guidance. however, what we can do is provide you a framework on how to think about our portfolio.
we believe that q4 '20 was close to, if not the bottom of the economic impact for us. we have taken approximately $18 million in combined bad debt expense reserves in 2020, including turning up most of the straight line rent for which reserves have been taking. included in this number is approximately $7.6 million or $0.10 of bad debt expense reserves that were included in our ffo number of $0.41 for q4 '20.
from my perspective, i believe $0.41 of ffo for q4 '20 is the bottom. i would suggest that you conservatively use that as a starting base. assume that continues for the first two quarters. beginning in q3 '21, assuming most everyone in america has been vaccinated, i would expect theaters restaurants and especially waikiki beach walk retail and the embassy suites waikiki to begin their recovery. i would apply some percentage growth to the $0.41 of the q4 2020 ffo beginning in q3 '21 and continuing into q4 '21.
adjustments that also would need to be made include, in q1 '21, approximately $0.05 related to the yield maintenance make whole payment on the series a note prepayment will be a non-recurring expense in q1 '21. also in q1 '21 through q4 '21, the additional proceeds from the public bond offering are expected to increase our interest expense by approximately $0.03 per quarter.
as we look beyond '21, we expect to see the following. first, we expect to see the embassy suites waikiki coming back in full strength in '22, adding approximately another $0.13 of ffo. secondly, the waikiki beach walk retail coming back in partial strength in '22, adding approximately another $0.08 of ffo. also, in our supplemental this quarter, we have included our estimated development yield for la jolla commons iii, which is expected to take between 24 and 30 months to develop. the estimated yield for this development is approximately between 6.5% and 7.5% based on the market conditions today. we expect this project to be completed by the end of 2023.
a 6.5% yield on $175 million is approximately another $11 million of noi or $0.14 of ffo. in the meantime, the cash on the balance sheet earmarked for this development will be a short-term drag on earnings. and lastly, we expect our one beach property on the north waterfront of san francisco to complete its renovation by the end of 2022, and we expect this property to produce approximately $0.05 plus of ffo upon stabilization in 2023.
for now, this is our informal big picture framework of what we conservatively expect in '21. but it is not considered or it is not to be considered as formal guidance. as we have more clarity and conviction on the back half of '21, we will share it with you. we will continue our best to be as transparent as possible.
i'll now turn the call over to steve center, our vice president of office properties, for a brief update on our office segment. steve?
steve center -- vice president of office properties
thanks, bob. at the end of the fourth quarter, net of one beach, which is under redevelopment, our office portfolio stood at approximately 95% leased, with just under 5% expiring at the end of 2021.
our top-10 office tenants represents 51.5% of our total office based rent. given the quality of our assets and the strength of the markets in which they are located, the technology and life science is the key market drivers and we continue to execute leases at favorable rental rates, delivering continued noi growth in our office segment even in this challenging environment.
the weighted average base rent increase for the seven renewals completed during the fourth quarter was 5%. with leases already signed, we have locked in approximately $24 million of noi growth in our office segment, comprised of approximately $14 million in 2021 and $10 million in 2022. we anticipate additional noi growth in 2022 and 2023 through the redevelopments and leasing of 102,000 rentable square feet at one beach street in san francisco and 33,000 rentable square feet at 710 oregon square in the lloyd submarket of portland.
with the recent entitlements for two blocks at oregon square in portland, we can add up to an additional 555,000 rentable square feet to the portfolio. however, we continue evaluating market conditions and prospective tenant interest before commencing development of that project.
in the next few months, we will commence construction of tower 3 at la jolla commons, a 213,000 rentable square foot, 11 storey class a plus office tower in the utc submarket of san diego. with expected completion in q2 or q3 of 2023, la jolla commons tower 3 will grow our office portfolio by 6.1%.
we're moving forward because we believe in the long-term fundamentals of the market, especially in utc. direct vacancy remains low at 6.5% and the inventory is aging with just 26% or three out of 22 class a office buildings being built since 2008, two of which are our own towers at la jolla commons. these 3three newer towers are 97% leased.
the existing office inventory is actually shrinking due to conversion to life science and lab usage in and around utc. and record-breaking venture capital is flowing into the region.
san diego companies raised a record-breaking $2.6 billion of venture capital funding in q4 of 2020. the 2020 total reached $5.2 billion. life science companies brought in a record $1.8 billion. the 2020 volume from life science investment reached a record shattering $3.8 billion, and tech investment hit a record high of $762.1 million for the quarter and $1.3 billion for the year.
utc is adjacent to ucsd, which pulled in $1.35 billion in research contracts and grants during the fiscal year that ended june 30, once again shattering our funding record and maintaining the university standing as one of the 10 largest research school in the u.s.
la jolla commons is just a few blocks away from the utc mall, which has undergone a $1.2 billion redevelopment, including 90 new tenants and is westfield's top performing center. in the san diego trolley operations serving ucsd and utc are expected to begin operations in 2022.
and as for the impact of work-from-home on our portfolio, based upon discussions with many of our tenants, not to mention significant expenditures, our larger tenants are currently investing in their existing spaces. we expect the impact to be relatively short term in nature.
beyond our portfolio, even though the tech giants had established long-term work-from-home protocols, they are massively increasing their office footprint by expanding, acquiring buildings and land and leasing significant space across the country, all during covid.
facebook has expanded by 2.2 million square feet, microsoft by 1 million square feet, amazon by 1.5 million square feet; and google now plans 3 mixed-use projects on google owned land, 40 acres in 1.3 million square feet in mountain view, san jose and sunnyvale. further, in november, google bought a 10-acre plot close to its existing campus in kirkland, washington, and plans to use it to expand in the area. also, apple just acquired a large land site in culver city, which is los angeles. for a large office development for at least 1,000 people, at least an additional 336,000 feet in new york city.
in summary, we have a stable office portfolio with a strong tenant roster, no or little near term rollover, significant built in noi growth and additional upside through repositioning and redevelopment within our existing portfolio, plus substantial new development on sites we already own.
operator, i'll turn the call over to you for questions. good job.
",2020-Q4,AAT
,0.93425,,,":
operator
thank you. [operator instructions] our first question comes from craig schmidt with bank of america. your line is now open.
craig schmidt -- bank of america -- analyst
thank you.
ernest rady -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
good morning, craig.
craig schmidt -- bank of america -- analyst
hey, how are you? i wonder [speech overlap] good. how has the retail leasing environment been since the end of march? so the first four weeks or so of april. can you describe where [indecipherable] is? what's -- i guess much of california [indecipherable].
ernest rady -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
i think -- i mean, we're going to ask chris sullivan to answer that. he has been in the midst of it and he us our internal expert and external as well.
chris sullivan -- vice president of retail properties
good morning, craig. leasing has definitely picked up, exactly picked up since the 4th march in respect to the -- more phone calls [indecipherable] of our retailers starting to look for space, starting to show a step up. it's -- now it like obviously in 2019. it is starting to pick up toward and starting to go on. so i'm way more optimistic now than i was a year ago. does that help answer your question.
craig schmidt -- bank of america -- analyst
right. so i mean, it still sounds like it's generally improved since the beginning of the year.
chris sullivan -- vice president of retail properties
yeah. it's generally improving. it really got focused back california didn't pop open with indoor dining. and if you look at so many of the shopping centers throughout the country now, quite a bit of dining, you can almost consider that category at anchor tenant. but in california that didn't pop back open to indoor until middle of march. so if that's opened up the registers are starting to [indecipherable]. especially here in san diego, you see a lot of weekend tourism. so you see --- you're starting to see the more aggressive retailers or the savvy retailers and restaurant tours are now on around looking for space. and i think the results of that when you actually see that getting maybe four to six months from now. but the graph to starting to sprout back up on the deals [indecipherable] i describe it.
craig schmidt -- bank of america -- analyst
great. and then, i was wondering if you're experiencing much in terms of cost increases on your development and redevelopment projects. are they possibly impacting the yield.
ernest rady -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
i'm going to ask jerry gammieri to handle that. he handles our construction and he is involved on a day-to-day basis with [indecipherable].
jerry gammieri -- vice president of construction and development
sure. craig, thank you for the question. we're seeing cost increases in the construction industry as a whole. year-over-year it has gone up, we were very successful in the buys that we made in our three major projects with the 710 oregon square building, the one beach project and la jolla commons. i think ernest had asked me a question yesterday that, if i had to go out and buy la jolla commons today in today's dollars. how much more would it cost us to build it versus when we started negotiating those fees a year ago during the pandemic. and i would venture to say that it would probably be as much as about 15% above what we have bought today. so i hope that answers your question.
chris sullivan -- vice president of retail properties
great. and then just finally on the asian lifting tourism, is that -- it really what required to return hawaii to help or can an increase in the domestic travel somewhat mitigate the disruption?
ernest rady -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
domestic travel would help for sure. but i've -- that's the cake, the [indecipherable] on the cake is the asian travel.
chris sullivan -- vice president of retail properties
okay, great. thank you.
ernest rady -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
thank you, greg. thanks for your interest.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from todd thomas with keybanc capital markets. your line is now open.
ernest rady -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
good morning, todd.
todd thomas -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
hi, good morning. just first question on the multifamily segment. you saw a nice increase in occupancy in portland. has that continued into april? and can you comment on the decrease in rents and the use of concessions to drive traffic there?
ernest rady -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
that's been very tough, frankly, in portland. and we had a management issue, which we solved immediately when it came to our attention. we are now having to give concessions, which are painful. but the biggest cost of operating real estate is vacancy and we'd sooner have somebody in there, then have it vacant. but we hope that portland will return to normal, but if you read the newspapers, you'll see turbulence portland has been subject to and we have not been an exception.
todd thomas -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
okay. should we expect to see the concessions burn off in the second and third quarters and drive the face rents higher? and is the occupancy increase, is that continuing?
ernest rady -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
todd, i'd like to tell you, i know, but i really don't know i've ever been through a circumstance like portland before. i'll tell you this though, we'll do as well as anybody in the market. we have a team in place, they are who have been with us for a number of years, we've just hired a new project manager, she comes very, very experienced, and we will do as well as anybody. and portland will have to return to normal before our rental income returns to more normal levels. that's what i believe.
todd thomas -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
okay. and then --
ernest rady -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
[indecipherable] disagree. go ahead.
todd thomas -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
okay. i also -- i wanted to ask about the retail segment and the 2022 noi bridge that you provided in your latest corporate presentation. the retail cash noi in the quarter was a little over $60 million, so $65 million annualized, i think, and that's ahead of the 2022 projection for retail cash noi, which was $63 million. i don't know if there is some deferred rent that was collected in the quarter, which i think was referenced in the prepared remarks. but bob, can you help us sort of unpack the retail noi in the quarter a little bit and maybe help us understand how that's tracking relative to prior projections?
robert barton -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. i mean, i think we're pretty close to what our presentation is -- our quarterly presentation, todd. and i think really what it points to is that and the way we look at it is that, '22 is really the recovery year, because in '22 you continue to outperform and the growth of the office cash noi plus the mixed-use, which we think is going to be strong in '22. which should take you from a total cash noi of around $211 million increasing up to a total of around $250 million plus. so we think '22 is recovery year. but in terms of unpacking '21 or this quarter, i think we're still on track. i think, if not, even more so.
todd thomas -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
right. okay. because it seems like the retail this quarter is already ahead on an annualized basis of where you expect it to be in '22. so i didn't know if you're anticipating some move-outs or a decrease in cash noi for retail that might take some time to recover than -- over the next several quarters.
robert barton -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
no, we're just going to have to play that out, but i think we're still on track with the unofficial guidance in q4 that we issued. if you go back and take a look at that, but there's nothing that really stuff that points to anything different than that. obviously, some of the collection like adam had mentioned on his script, that 88% of the deferred rent has been collected, which is positive. so that's starting to come in as well, which i think is additive to that.
todd thomas -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
okay. all right, great. just one last question if i could. i'll hop off. i was just wondering if there was an update at landmark related to the autodesk expirations that occur later in '22 and '23. not sure if it's too early, but if there is any update there that would be great.
ernest rady -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
no update at this time, except they just gone through extensive renovation at their second and fourth floor. the second floor is a space that expires at the end of next year, with the remainder in '23. and what was the investment there...
robert barton -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
we are investing upwards of $450 a foot.
steve center -- vice president of office properties
like $15 million,
ernest rady -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
and we just toured it on last tuesday and site. so they're investing in their space, which i think is a good indicator of their commitment to the building. because of landmark and one market and we wanted to see what our tenants are spending. and one of the task there is spending almost a $100 million, their own money on the building and the other one is spending over $15 million. so we're pretty happy with that investment in the short run and the long run. i wish we had five of them.
todd thomas -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
all right, thank you.
adam wyll -- executive vice president and chief operating officer
it's a great building. thanks for the questions. thank you, todd.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from richard hill with morgan stanley, your line is now open.
ernest rady -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
good morning, richard.
ron kamdem -- morgan stanley -- analyst
hey, you got ron kamdem on for richard hill. okay.
ernest rady -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
well, tell, richard, we think we're better off with you than him.
ron kamdem -- morgan stanley -- analyst
that's right. just -- the first question was just going to the office portfolio. maybe could you touch on the same store noi this quarter. i saw it was down maybe what happened there? and actually just a bigger picture question, which is, just what are you hearing from sort of the office tenants and return to the office?
ernest rady -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
well, to answer your first question, that negative was due to one deal, and it was a business decision to keep us a law firm in 17,000 feet. there are 24,000 foot full floor law firm, they had subleased about 7000 feet of their space to somebody else, and that's subtenant have moved out, so there lease was coming up and they went to the market and found a competing space about the same size for $3.10 a foot. we looked at the price -- comments was false. we looked at the prospect of losing a 17,000 foot law firm and we decided to keep them where they are, not put in the corridor, no tis and the competing space was a $3.10 a foot, they agreed to stay at $5 a square foot. so that was a victory for us. we had to take a hit on square footage. that's what happened.
now just to add to that, they're paying 35.6% more in rental rate than they were at lease expiration. so we think it's a good business decision for full building to keep 17,000 foot law firm.
chris sullivan -- vice president of retail properties
excuse me. ron, in terms of your question on the same store cash noi for the office. that's primarily because of our government tenants up in 1st in may, we still had through q1 abatements that were incurred there. so that reduce your cash noi by close to $1 million bucks. to answer your question on back to work. we've got a number of firms coming back. we have a life science firm right across from us here that they came back this past monday. and others are making plans to come back in the next few months. so we're encouraged by that. and then you can read what google is doing and other big technology firms are doing. sure what we're hearing is that there is a big push to get back to the office.
ron kamdem -- morgan stanley -- analyst
great. that's helpful. and then if i could sort of -- the second question was just on sort of the mixed used assets and hawaii and so forth. obviously, the noi is still sort of flat to slightly negative in the quarter. i remember, i think three months ago, you sort of felt that there was a decent shot at a recovery in the second half of the year, just curious how you guys are feeling or thinking about waikiki and the recovery there on the mixed-use.
ernest rady -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
you know, ron, everybody i talk to is looking forward to the end of this pandemic and getting back to a normal life. and particularly people feel deprived that they can't travel. now if you're going to travel, you're going to go to someplace safe and hawaii is safe. so i'm as confident as i can be that hawaii is going to return to pre-pandemic levels. i just don't know exactly when, but it's going to happen. if i had the opportunity i'd buy everything in hawaii all over again. it's a great property in a great location and i'm looking forward to the recovery.
chris sullivan -- vice president of retail properties
yeah. ron, just to add to earnest comments. we are -- in terms of our estimation, it's not the timing, but we do believe that the back half of '21 we're going to see an increase over the first half. i know that when i look at the embassy suites, our booking pace, when i take a look at that, our expectation is that, we will be 79% or higher in june. people are ready to travel.
ernest rady -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
ourselves included.
chris sullivan -- vice president of retail properties
yeah.
ron kamdem -- morgan stanley -- analyst
great, that's helpful. that's all my questions. thank you.
ernest rady -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
great. thanks, ron. say a word to richard.
operator
i'm not showing any further questions at this time. i would now like to turn the call back over to ernest rady, chairman and ceo for closing remarks.
ernest rady -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
to sum it all up, we've come through this terrible [indecipherable] in excellent shape, everything considered. and i know that you're all familiar with the fact that we used to borrow money on a private placement basis and private placements became more expensive than public issuance. so we thought we'd try the public issuance market. we offered $500 million of 10-year bonds and we were 4.5 times oversubscribed. and so we now have the proceeds of that issue and after paying off some debt and earmarking some of that proceeds for the improvement of the properties which we've discussed. we're looking forward to investing that money in additional assets, which we are going to do our best to make sure they're accretive for our stockholders. so i know that you can count on it, but one thing you can count on. we'll do our best for you and we appreciate your confidence. and thank you for your interest.

operator
good day, and thank you for standing by. welcome to the q1 2021 american assets trust, inc. earnings conference call. [operator instructions] after the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [operator instructions].
i would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, adam wyll, evp and coo. please go ahead.
adam wyll -- executive vice president and chief operating officer
thank you, operator. good morning, everyone. welcome to american assets trust first quarter 2021 earnings call. yesterday afternoon our earnings release and supplemental information were furnished to the sec on form 8-k. both are now available on the investors section of our website, americanassetstrust.com. a telephonic replay and on-demand webcast will also be available for this call over the next week.
during this call we will discuss non-gaap financial measures, which are reconciled to our gaap financial results in our earnings release and supplemental information. we will also be making forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. these statements are subject to risks and uncertainties discussed in our sec filings. you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. actual events could arise -- could cause our results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements for a number of reasons, including uncertainty related to the scope, severity and duration of the covid-19 pandemic on us and on our tenants.
and with that, i'll turn the call over to ernest rady, our chairman and ceo, to begin the discussion of our first quarter 2021 results. ernest?
ernest rady -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
thank you, adam. first and foremost, once again we hope that this letter finds you and your loved ones safe. thankfully, as several vaccines have been broadly administered and as we begin to reach herd immunity, we are very optimistic that the pandemic is nearing the sand and our lives will soon return to normalcy. and our financial results will continue to improve into 2021.
over the past year the covid-19 pandemic severely affected most industries, commercial real estate being no exception. we knew at the onset of the pandemic that american assets trust would not be impervious to this economic impact, but we were confident that the high quality, irreplaceable properties and asset class diversity of our portfolio combined with the strength of our balance sheet and ample liquidity would pull us through this.
as we've worked our way through these past 12 months, however, we realized that it is the resiliency of our properties and our company's employees that has enabled us to weather this storm. and fortunately, to embark on the path to recovery. we are proud of our response to the challenges presented to us in 2020 and our ability to successfully operate for our company, while keeping our employees and customers as safe as possible. we've been through hard times before and each time we have emerged stronger, which is our expectation now.
as we celebrate our 10th anniversary of being a new york stock exchange listed company, we are reminded that our commitment to our stockholders has always remained front and center. we will continue to do our best to accretively grew our asset base and shareholder wealth, focusing on both organic growth and development opportunities as they present themselves within our existing portfolios as well as acquisitions in our targeted coastal west coast markets with a primary focus on the office sector going forward at this time.
finally, i want to mention that the board of directors has approved a quarterly dividend of $0.28 a share for the first quarter, consistent with our previous dividend, which is, we believe is supported by our collection efforts in the first quarter. the border is -- board is looking for the rebound in waikiki which impacts our embassy suites and our -- and retail on waikiki beach walk. once the mandatory quarantine has been eliminated we [indecipherable] see the beginning of a recovery in waikiki which will about -- allow the board to consider an increase in the dividend. we are hopeful that this will recur in the third quarter and hopefully sooner.
adam, bob and steve will go into more detail on our various asset segments, collections and financial results. and i will be available for any questions you may have at the conclusion of prepared remarks. on behalf of all of us at american assets trust, we thank you for your confidence in allowing us to manage your company and for your continued support. now more than ever. i'm going to turn the call back over to adam.
adam wyll -- executive vice president and chief operating officer
thanks, ernest. we are feeling more bullish than at any time over the past 12 months, now that the vaccine is widely available, the covid 19 governmental restrictions in our coastal markets have lightened considerably and we are seeing firsthand the consumer behavior has begun reverting closer to pre-pandemic levels. perhaps most significantly in california governor newsom announced recently that the state will fully reopen its economy on june 15th, lifting substantially all the restrictions that have guided daily life for more than a year in california, where currently two-thirds of our annualized base rent is derived. we would expect our other coastal markets to follow similarly in the months to come.
meanwhile, we are encouraged and seeing our shopping center parking lots full, our office tenants returning or scheduling their return to office, tourism ramping up in hawaii and public schools in our markets are starting to open back up, allowing parents to return to work, shopping and the like. our collections have continued to improve each quarter since the pandemic began and improved each month in q1 with the collection rate north of 93% for the first quarter. we expect this collection trend to continue to improve going forward with april at approximately 90% to date. furthermore, we had approximately $800,000 of deferred rent due from about 100 tenants in q1 based on covid-19 related lease modifications entered into in 2020 and we have collected approximately 88% of those deferred amount, we believe this further validates our strategy of supporting our struggling retailers through the government mandated closure.
today, we have avoided any material impact from retailer bankruptcy having lost only 13,000 square feet in the aggregate out of our over 3 million square foot retail portfolio, which we believe is a testament to us having superior locations at these restructured tenants want to remain in. as we mentioned before, we continue working with challenge retailers with a heavy focus currently on those in waikiki, who historically have been solid operators to bridge them through to the recovery as tourism continues to ramp up, which is primarily from the us mainland at this point as asian countries have not yet relaxed covid restrictions and their travel to hawaii yet.
additionally, we are seeing significant positive activity and engagement with new retailers for vacant or distressed spaces in our retail portfolio as we negotiate new retail leases and term sheets, which we will keep you posted on. on the multifamily front, we have hired a new community manager at our hassalo on eighth property who we -- who we expect will lead hassalo to increased occupancy and better financial results over the remainder of the year. furthermore, the 133 unit master lease with the private university in our san diego multifamily portfolio expires at the end of may and our san diego multifamily team led by abigail rex is fully engaged on additional marketing and advertising campaigns to entice students to remain in expiring units and to attract new prospects. to date we have leased approximately 20% of those expiring units and expect to have the majority of them released by the end of summer.
finally, i want to mention that last week we issued our 2020 sustainability report which covers our 2020 operations and highlights our initiatives and commitments across a range of topics, including health and safety, environmental, social responsibility, corporate governor and was prepared entirely in-house at aat. these initiatives were a massive collaborative effort from our employee base, led by our sustainability committee with representatives from virtually every department in our company and oversight from our executive management team and board of directors. we are proud of our efforts to-date, particularly our focus on human capital, but we know we have a lot more work to do going forward on all fronts. we welcome you to visit the sustainability page of our website to download our 2020 sustainability report for more details. please reach out to any questions.
with that, i'll turn the call over to bob to discuss q1 financial results in more detail.
robert barton -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
good morning, and thank you, ernest and adam. last night we reported first quarter 2021 ffo per share of $0.38, first quarter 2021 net income attributable to common stockholders per share of $0.02. i believe it is important to note that the ffo in the first quarter includes a charge of approximately $4.3 million for the early extinguishment of our $150 million senior guaranteed notes, series a, which were due on october 31, 2021. without the charge for the early extinguishment of debt, our first quarter 2021 ffo per share would have been approximately $0.44.
from a financial perspective, it was a relatively quiet quarter. i'm not going to spend a lot of time on anything that is already either been discussed or is in the earnings release and save time for the follow-up questions.
we did end up close to our expectations. based on the current environment same-store metrics are down in retail as expected and office was also lower for the quarter, but it is expected to end with 8% or greater same-store cash noi for the year ended 2021.
i'll now turn the call over to steve center, our vice president of office properties for a brief update on our office segment. steve?
steve center -- vice president of office properties
thanks, bob. at the end of the first quarter, net of one beach, which is under redevelopment, our office portfolio stood at approximately 94% leased, with just 3.4% expiring through the end of 2021. our top 10 office tenants represented 50.2% of our total office base rent. given the quality of our assets and the strength of the markets in which they are located with technology and life science as the key market drivers. our office portfolio has weathered the crisis well.
current status by region are as follows: bellevue is 96.5% leased; portland is 97.1% leased; san francisco is 100% leased, net of one beach; and san diego is 89.1% leased with two buildings under renovation at torrey reserve making up 5.8% of san diego's vacancy and 2.6% of the office portfolio's vacancy. our strategy of offering lease term flexibility while preserving pre-covid rental rates produced 36 comparable new and renewal leases over the last 12 months, totaling 182,000 rentable square feet with a weighted average increase of 8.9% over prior rents on a cash basis and 16.9% on a straight-line basis. the weighted average lease term was 3.3 years with just $8.7 per rental square foot in tis and incentives.
we experienced limited small tenant attrition due to covid and other business challenges during the quarter resulting in a net loss of approximately 31,000 rentable square feet, none of which was lost to a competitor. however, smaller tenant activity has picked up significantly with tenants willing to commit to longer-term leases at favorable rental rate. even more encouraging is the push to return to the office and the emerging large tenant activity and competition for quality larger blocks of space in select markets including san diego and bellevue. we continue to strategically invest in our current portfolio through renovation, redevelopment and ground-up development.
the renovation at two of the 14 buildings at torrey reserve should be complete this summer. in the process, we are enhancing the campus amenities and aggregating large -- large blocks of space in the del mar heights submarket to meet demand and take advantage of pricing power. construction has commenced on the redevelopment of one beach street in san francisco with delivery in the first half of 2022 and construction is nearly complete on the redevelopment of 710 oregon square in the lloyd sub-market of portland. one beach will grow to over 102,000 square feet and 710 oregon square will add more than 33,000 square feet to our office portfolio.
construction is also commenced on tower 3 at la jolla commons, a 213,000 square foot, 11 story class a plus office tower in the utc submarket of san diego with expected completion in q2 or q3 of 2023. we are encouraged by the emerging large tenant activity and competition for quality large blocks of space in utc. we are optimistic about our office portfolio as we move forward into the rest of 2021 and beyond.
operator, i'll now turn the call over to you for questions.
",2021-Q1,AAT
0.9813,,1.0,1.0,":
operator
[operator instructions] our first question comes from haendel st. juste, with mizuho.
lydia -- mizuho -- analyst
hi, this is lydia on behalf of haendel. congratulations, adam. my first question is, can you discuss the status of la jolla commons, your new utc development and also the decision to build spec? and how are you thinking about the utc market and expected returns?
adam wyll -- president & chief operating officer
why don't you handle the construction? and then steve will handle the leasing opportunity.
robert f. barton -- executive vice president, treasurer & chief financial officer
sure i think -- so right now, we are at the bottom of the hole, as ernest mentioned earlier, and we are beginning the first phases of pouring our mat foundations. to ernest's point, we remain on schedule and on-time and on budget. our first concrete pour is going to be over 3,500 cubic yards of concrete and almost 430,000 pounds of rebar. so there's a lot of work to do between now and august 14th, but we remain pretty confident in our ability to execute this. so --
adam wyll -- president & chief operating officer
and i think as we pointed out before, we were fortunate enough to buy it during, buy it out during the last quarter of last year, and construction costs have escalated since, so that it would cost us more substantially if we were to buy it today. and steve, why don't you describe your strategy of holding out for the right tenant?
steve center -- vice president of office properties
well, as we've said before, you have not only life science venture capital flowing into san diego at record rates, but also technology venture capital is flowing in as well. you've got apple, amazon, google, facebook, you've got the big tech companies taking advantage of the quality student population that's -- we've been net exporters of talent for years and now these big companies are coming to take advantage of that. the market dynamics are in our favor. we're the only pure office development coming out of the ground. the rest of the new developments are life science or lab targeted buildings. furthermore, in the three adjacent submarkets of del mar heights, utc and serena mesa, approximately three million square feet of office product has been or is being converted to lab. so that's taking away competing inventory. so we think we're well positioned to take advantage of that. the market demand continues to be strong for those big users and there's not going to be much available product as the prediction for 2023 when we're delivering this building to the marketplace. so we're confident we're going to do well in leasing that building.
lydia -- mizuho -- analyst
and as a quick follow-up with office being the largest percent of abr and noi, are you at all worried about work from home and adding to your offices exposure at this time?
adam wyll -- president & chief operating officer
i think our strategy is to be in markets that are buoyant. i think if we were in markets that were not buoyant, i would really have more concerns than we do now. but i think our strategy of having top-notch office in the best -- in some of the best markets in the country will allow us to perform better than many of the markets that will not perform as well because growth is growth, and we're in the path of growth. anybody want to add anything to that?
robert f. barton -- executive vice president, treasurer & chief financial officer
i think you covered it well.
adam wyll -- president & chief operating officer
yeah. it's a good question, though. everybody is asking what's going to happen when people return or don't return to office. it will be different, but i think that a well-located office in the path to growth will do extremely well, and that's our strategy.
operator
great, your next question comes from todd thomas with keybanc.
todd thomas -- keybanc -- analyst
hi, thanks.
adam wyll -- president & chief operating officer
morning, todd.
todd thomas -- keybanc -- analyst
good morning. first question i have is on the mixed-use on the hotel and hotel retail. bob, i appreciate the color on june, and it sounded like performance has continued into july. can you just provide some additional detail around july and maybe talk about the outlook for august and september in terms of bookings and i guess the outlook for occupancy and rates?
robert f. barton -- executive vice president, treasurer & chief financial officer
yeah, good morning todd. in terms of the data points for july, we're still getting that in. but what we can see is we can see the pent-up demand. we can see the pace of bookings that are generally -- we can see -- we have a vision into about 90 days out. so july, august, september is the high season for the embassy suites hotel. so it is seasonal, so then it will generally go down a little bit in the fourth quarter and then pick up at the end of december. but for july, august and september, we are expecting a similar, if not greater breakout at the embassy that we've seen in just the last half of june.
adam wyll -- president & chief operating officer
just as additional color, if you recall, todd, we used the pandemic downtime to refresh the rooms, paint the exterior and deal with its falling. so we're ready when the tourism market does recover, and we expect a strong recovery.
todd thomas -- keybanc -- analyst
okay. and i guess, how should we think about the results in the quarter? and i guess, sort of thinking about what you're experiencing there relative to what you were expecting for '21 or '22, when we look at that noi bridge that you've provided, has the outlook for the mixed-use asset changed as we've moved further into the year?
robert f. barton -- executive vice president, treasurer & chief financial officer
well, on that bridge that we've shared with our investors and research analysts over the last year or so is that -- we intend to update that at the next conference or the next presentation. but basically, my comment in there, todd, was that if you look at the cash -- total cash noi and you just use that to -- as a run rate, and you're about 238, and you can adjust that down for some nonrecurring collections that occurred in the second quarter. so even then -- even after the adjustments to that, you're still significantly higher than our 2019 cash noi that we ended with. so really, all we're doing is say, hey this -- we are seeing the recovery. we are now ahead of 2019 pre-covid cash noi. and from here, we expect to build upon that.
adam wyll -- president & chief operating officer
bob's bridge has given me great confidence in saying that we're going to come out of this better off than ever. so here we come.
todd thomas -- keybanc -- analyst
all right. and then on the -- in the retail portfolio, i was wondering if you could comment on the negative leasings. spreads in the quarter and talk about the outlook for leasing going forward?
robert f. barton -- executive vice president, treasurer & chief financial officer
so, do you want to handle that.
adam wyll -- president & chief operating officer
no. i just went out for a cup of coffee. now go to the mens room.
robert f. barton -- executive vice president, treasurer & chief financial officer
can you hear that tom? cause hes quiet away from the microphone.
todd thomas -- keybanc -- analyst
yeah. i was just looking for a little bit of detail in the negative [indecipherable] retail segment of the quarter and if you can talk about the outlook there
adam wyll -- president & chief operating officer
majority of those numbers are -- as you know, because you're not buying that much quicksilver these days. quicksilver has had some struggles out there at -- beach walk with us. so there lease was coming to an end, and we were having troubles with them. we replaced them with the first hawaiian bank and so there was a drop in the lease rate between those, because those rates were done at a time they were historically very high and so as we brought in the new lease rate with first hawaiian bank, there was a drop there. we also -- as i know you know beach walk in the middle of beach walk, we have peter lick art gallery there. that was also under historically a pretty high lease rate, and we had an opportunity to bring another quality gallery in to cover that space at a good market rate.
i don't remember exactly what it was, but to cover that whole, it would have been in our 50 yard line and we occupied it. so unfortunately, as leasing has picked up and things have definitely gotten better, when you take out a couple of key deals or lease rates, it can leave a mark. i was surprised at the market it left. but fortunately, i think that's a temporary event just because of the two being the [indecipherable]. also to what chris was saying, todd, is that when we replaced quicksilver on the endcap of kalakaua and waikiki beach walk and waikiki -- the net impact of bringing in the bank was less than $0.005 of ffo. and the reason for that is because by replacing quicksilver, we also terminated our -- i think our -- we terminated the sublease that we had with the bank at that point in time, the sublease rent on that was $1.7 million a year. so that goes away.
so it's actually a win-win on that transaction. just from a macro point of view, we've always said that 75% of all the properties in hawaii are subject to a ground lease. we had one ground lease about the size of the room we're in now. now 100% of our property has -- we have fee simple and titled. so a very high-quality portfolio.
todd thomas -- keybanc -- analyst
okay. and just looking ahead, are you expecting more roll downs within retail? or do you think you're through that? it sounds like in retail, just more broadly, rents have firmed up and fundamentals have firmed up quite a bit. are you seeing that across your retail portfolio as well?
robert f. barton -- executive vice president, treasurer & chief financial officer
yes, todd, for the most part, things are starting to stabilize. they're still going to be hit and miss. there's still some categories that are still suffering as we're going through the turbulence of covid, which unfortunately is not over. but looking out, we're in pretty good shape, but there's still going to be a little bit of turbulence wnd i know you've been to our beach walk property and out there in hawaii, but it really is an impressive rebound that we're seeing. i'm pretty bullish. i will say as we sit in this new conference room when i look out on that freeway, and i see it get more and more jammed with school coming back on and back-to-school is coming up. it's going to be a very big quarter for retailers. so i'm very bullish compared to what i've seen a year ago.
todd thomas -- keybanc -- analyst
all right. thank you.
robert f. barton -- executive vice president, treasurer & chief financial officer
thank you todd. thank you for your interest.
operator
our next question comes from craig schmidt with bank of america.
adam wyll -- president & chief operating officer
good morning craig.
craig schmidt -- bank of america -- analyst
thank you. good morning. i was wondering when you think occupancy may return to 4q '19 levels by the different sectors?
robert f. barton -- executive vice president, treasurer & chief financial officer
for which property you're talking about?
craig schmidt -- bank of america -- analyst
i just meant from the retail multifamily.
adam wyll -- president & chief operating officer
all the properties --
robert f. barton -- executive vice president, treasurer & chief financial officer
well, multifamily is going to be there. it's almost there now as a matter, now. yes. one of our properties, which we're repositioning, is 100% leased. we have the move-ins at pacific ridge, portland, your guess is as good as mine, but things are getting better and not worse, which is the right direction. as far as office goes, we've never had a decline really in occupancy to speak of. if anything, it's on the upswing. we've had some attrition over the last year, and i can go into detail on that, but if you want. so looking from q2 '21 to q2 '20, it was about 139,000 feet of attrition, about 21,000 feet or amenity spaces that will be absorbed, if you will, in the next two quarters, we're taking spaces and adding amenities to buildings. but we've remeasured buildings as well. we just remeasured two projects in our portfolio. one is growing by 26,000 feet, and the other is growing by 11,000 feet.
so that will work itself out, some was just transition or strategic. but in terms of losing tenants, we had 23 tenants averaging 4,000 feet that either downsized in place or left, about a third was related to covid, but two-thirds was what i'll call cycle, it's part of the office cycle. so we had a big institutional financial firm at city center bellevue, that had been a 4.5 for over 20 years. they renewed their lease at rents that were 65% higher on one floor, and they just gave back in june, a 9,400 foot suite on the 20th floor, and we're actively touring that space right now. and we think we're going to achieve the $65 rent versus a $39 ending rent. so these vacancies, part of the business cycle provide opportunity to ratchet rents up further. that's why you see our noi continue to grow, even though we've had some attrition and square footage leased. so that's kind of the take line. it's been largely smaller tenants.
we had another law firm, the two named partners decided to retire after 40 years. the silver lining of that is they vacated 16,000 feet and we did a new 5,000-foot lease with their younger partners. so our portfolio is solid. we have great assets, and we continue to generate increasing rents even through covid. and it's -- as i said in our remarks, i expect net absorption in our office portfolio moving forward, substantial net absorption. so we're bullish.
ernest sylvan rady -- chairman & chief executive officer
i think that strategy is going to produce substantial shareholder accretion to value, and that's our strategy. in order to achieve these increased rents, we have improved the properties and we manage the properties better, thanks to steve's leadership. so we're optimistic about our office and are putting our money where a [indecipherable], as they say in french. and sulli, you want to answer something on retail?
christopher e. sullivan -- vice president of retail properties
i mean it's a steady client. but i can't say when we're going to recover to where we were in q4 '19. it could be a year out, a year and a half, sometimes it's one step forward, two steps back, three steps forward, one step back. just it's going to revolve on consumer spending, which i think will be good. but it will get there.
ernest sylvan rady -- chairman & chief executive officer
our retail properties are well positioned. our management in spite of trip, is excellent. and i say that in retail, we'll do as well as anybody because of a, the management and b, the locations. so if you look at the industry, and we'll do as well as anybody in the industry. and of course, you know as well as i, that there's a fair amount of uncertainty.
craig schmidt -- bank of america -- analyst
and then just maybe just a little more color. is there enough pent-up demand on domestic travel to hawaii to make up for japan, which doesn't sound like it could get really started until november or later. but it sounds like just given the short time of the reopening, you've done so well. i'm just wondering if you think there is enough domestic demand to compensate for the absence of japan?
ernest sylvan rady -- chairman & chief executive officer
well, that embassy suites has been a very pleasant surprise. during the covid, it broke even. and that was so much better than all of us expected. there has been a rebound now from domestic demand. but the way i describe domestic demand, that's the cake. the icing on the cake is asia. and so as that unfolds, we will return to pre-covid levels.
steve center -- vice president of office properties
yes. let me add to that, craig, is that yes, to answer your question, yes, there is sufficient demand on u.s. west and canada to maintain a high 80% occupancy. our strategy at the embassy is to keep it around 87%, 88% occupancy, and then we push rate and there's less -- what i want to call it -- it's less worrying on the host, if you have 100% occupied. if you have something 100% occupied, whether it's a hotel or apartments, you're not charging enough and so we keep it at 88%, for the most part and then push the rate, but june was all u.s. west. and i can see on our star report, and i can see in our bookings, 90 days out, that's where it continues to be.
craig schmidt -- bank of america -- analyst
great. thanks for the color guys. bye.
adam wyll -- president & chief operating officer
thank you, craig.
operator
and i'm not showing any further questions at this time. i'd like to turn the call over to our chairman, ernest rady, for any closing remarks.
ernest sylvan rady -- chairman & chief executive officer
again, thanks for your patience. we're glad to have the dividend back to where it was pre-covid. we wish we didn't have to go through this covid and reduce that dividend. we're glad to have it back. we were upset that we had to, but we thought that survival was -- and conserving the cash was most important. as you all know, we had a bond offering, which is 4.5 times oversubscribed. we now have substantial liquidity. we look forward to employing it in projects that will continue to increase our net asset value and shareholder wealth. thank you for your confidence, and we look forward to a great future. thank you.

operator
ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the q2 2021 american assets trust, inc. earnings call. [operator instructions] i would now like to turn the call over to your host, adam wyll, you may begin.
adam wyll -- president & chief operating officer
thank you, operator. good morning, everyone. welcome to american assets trust, inc. second quarter 2021 earnings call. yesterday afternoon, our earnings release and supplemental information were furnished to the sec on form 8-k. both are now available on the investors section of our website, americanassetstrust.com. a telephonic replay and on-demand webcast will also be available for this call over the next week. during this call, we will discuss non-gaap financial measures, which are reconciled to our gaap financial results in our earnings release and supplemental information. we will also be making forward-looking statements based on our current expectations, which statements are subject to risks and uncertainties discussed in our sec filings. you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. actual events could cause our results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements for a number of reasons, including, as it may relate to the continuing impact from covid-19. and with that, i'll turn the call over to ernest rady, our chairman and ceo, to begin the discussion of our second quarter 2021 results. ernest?
ernest sylvan rady -- chairman & chief executive officer
thanks, adam. and good morning, everyone. we are making great progress on all fronts as we focus our efforts on our rebound from covid-19's impact, by enhancing and amenitizing existing properties, acquiring new accretive properties like eastgate office park in bellevue, which the team will talk about more in a bit, retaining and adding new customers to our portfolio, furthering our development of la jolla commons of which we recently bottomed out our excavation and otherwise remain on time and on budget and of course, growing our earnings and net asset value for our stockholders. we have been through hard time before, and each time we have emerged stronger, which remains our expectations in mind now. i want to mention that the board of directors has approved the quarterly dividend of $0.30 per share for the third quarter, an increase of $0.02 per share or 7% from the second quarter, which is, we believe, is supported by our increased collection efforts in the second quarter, improving traffic in waikiki at our embassy suites and our expectation for operations to continue trending favorably in the near term.
i'm also pleased to announce that the board has appointed adam wyll, to the position of president in addition to his chief operating officer role and title. as many of you know, adam is a valuable and hard-working member of our executive team. and this title describes the breadth of responsibilities and leadership that he has successfully taken on, prior to and during the pandemic. as well as the confidence, our board and myself and our management team has in him to manage, in partnership with our excellent executive team, the day-to-day operations of aat. i personally am blessed with excellent health, and this company is very important to me. i intend to continue my role as chairman and ceo for the foreseeable future.
however, it is very important to our board, myself and shareholders that you know this company will always remain in very capable hands and that we are fortunate to have such a great management team and group of associates at aat, all of whom work together as we continue on as a best in classes, class reit. adam, bob and steve will go into more detail on our various asset management segments, collections and financial results and will be available for any questions you may have at the conclusion of our prepared remarks. on behalf of all of american assets trust, we thank you for your confidence in allowing us to manage your company and for your continued support, now more than ever. and now i'm going to return it back to our newly elected president, adam.
adam wyll -- president & chief operating officer
thanks, ernest. i very much appreciate the kind words and leadership opportunities, none of which would have been possible without your mentorship, not to mention the daily collaboration with such an incredible management team and top-notch team members and colleagues. we continue to feel bullish about our portfolio, particularly with government restrictions lifted in all of our mainland markets in hawaii, having lightened its reopening restrictions considerably. and we are seeing firsthand consumer behavior reverting to pre-pandemic levels with packed parking lots and tons of shoppers at all our retail properties. we're already seeing many of our retailers with gross sales above pre-pandemic levels in our restaurants recovering, which is obviously very encouraging. our collections have continued to improve each quarter with a collection rate north of 96% for the second quarter. furthermore, we had approximately $850,000 of deferred rent due from tenants in q2 based on covid-19 related lease modifications.
and we have collected approximately 94% of those deferred amounts, further validating our strategy of supporting our struggling retailers through the government-mandated closures. remaining collection challenges at this point are primarily with a handful of local retailers at our waikiki beach walk property. but with hawaii tourism back in large numbers, we think we'll have an opportunity to rebound, to be viable long term, even more so once asian countries relax their travel restrictions to hawaii later this year or early next. additionally, we are seeing positive activity engagement with new retailers, including mid box retailers. about half of our over 250,000 square feet of vacant retail space or in lease negotiations or loi stage, deals that we believe we have a good likelihood of being finalized. and the vast majority of our retailers are renewing their leases at flat to modest rent increases.
on the multifamily front, with new management in place at hassalo, we are currently 99% leased and asking rents are trending up almost 20% since december 2020. the multifamily collections have been more challenging in portland due to eviction protection still in place through the next month or so. but we are doing everything we can to stay on top of that, which include government rental assistance programs that we expect meaningful disbursements from soon. in san diego, our multifamily properties are currently 97% leased, and we have leased approximately 90% of the 133 master lease units that expired less than two months ago and expect the remaining to be leased over the next few weeks. asking rents at our multifamily properties are trending up as well in san diego, almost 10% since december 2020. with that, i'll turn the call over to bob, to discuss q2 financial results in more detail.
robert f. barton -- executive vice president, treasurer & chief financial officer
good morning, and thank you, ernest and adam. last night, we reported second quarter 2021 ffo per share of $0.51 and second quarter '21 net income attributable to common stockholders per share of $0.15. from my perspective, i believe we are seeing the beginning of the recovery story for aat that we have been talking about for the last six months with embedded growth into 2022 and beyond, as we have previously shared with you on our bridge in our investor presentations, which you can find on our website. let me share with you several data points that support my belief. first, as ernest previously mentioned, the board has approved an increase in the dividend to its pre-covid amount of $0.30 per share based on the continued improvement in our collections as expected, but the overriding factor was the strong results we are seeing at the embassy suites hotel in waikiki beginning in mid-june and increasing into july with a strong pent-up demand. q2 paid occupancy was 67%, and the month of june by itself reached approximately 83%.
the average daily rate was $274 for q2 and approximately $316 for the month of june. revpar or revenue per available room was $184 for q2 and approximately $262 for the month of june. it is definitely heading in the right direction. effective july 8, all travellers entering into hawaii who are vaccinated in the u.s. can skip quarantine without getting a pre-travel covid test by uploading proof of their vaccination to the state of hawaii safe travel website. the oahu is still under tier five of its reopening plan until hawaii's total population is 70% fully vaccinated, which should occur in the next month or two. bars and restaurants in oahu can be at 100% capacity as long as all customers show their vaccination card or a negative covid test on entry. the japanese wholesale market had accounted for approximately 35% to 40% of our customer base pre-covid. japan is currently just 9% fully vaccinated. though with its current pace of over one million vaccines a day, japan is expected to be completing vaccinations by this november and to start issuing vaccine passports in the next 30 days, in anticipation of opening up international travel. in the meantime, there is a pent-up demand from u.s. west and canada that is expected to keep the hotel occupied and on track with this recovery.
secondly, looking at our consolidated statement of operations for the three months ended june 30th, our total revenue increased approximately $7.8 million over q1, which is approximately at 9.3% increase. approximately 37% of that was the outperformance of the embassy suites hotel as california and hawaii began to open up travel. additionally, our operating income increased approximately $6.3 million over q1 '21, which is approximately an increase of 31%. third, same-store cash noi overall was strong at 23% year-over-year. with office consistently strong before, during and post covid and retail showing strong signs of recovery. multifamily was down primarily as a result of pacific ridge apartments at 71% leased at the end of q2 due to the recurring seasonality of students leaving in may, including the expiration of the usd master lease and new students leasing over the summer before school starts in late august. generally, approximately 60% of our 533 units at pacific ridge are leased by students, with the usd campus right across the street.
as of this week, we are approximately 90% leased at pacific ridge with approximately 150 students moving in over the next several weeks in august. hassalo on eighth in the lloyd district of oregon is a 657 multifamily campus. at the end of q1, occupancy was approximately 84% due to the lingering impact of covid and political challenges in the prior months. as of q2, we have increased the occupancy to approximately 95%. but in doing so, we had to adjust the rent and increase concessions. pacific ridge and hassalo on eighth are the two factors that impacted our multifamily same-store this quarter. as adam mentioned, asking rates have been trending favorably on our multifamily properties recently, which we expect to provide meaningful growth going forward. note that our same-store cash noi does not include our mixed-use sector, which will return with q3 and q4 2021 after completing the renovation of the embassy suites hotel during covid.
and fourth, as previously disclosed, we acquired eastgate office park on july 7th, comprised of approximately 280,000 square foot multi-tenant office campus, in the premier i-90 corridor submarket of bellevue, washington, one of the top-performing markets in the nation, the eastside market is anchored by leading tech, life science, biotech and telecommunication companies. the four-building eastgate park is currently greater than 95% leased to a diversified tenant base with in-place contractual lease rates that we believe are 10% to 15% below prevailing market rates for the submarket. additionally, eastgate park recently obtained municipal approval for rezoning, increasing the floor area ratio from 0.5 to 1.0, which will allow for additional development opportunities. the purchase price of approximately $125 million was paid with cash on the balance sheet.
the going-in cap rate was approximately 6% with an unlevered irr north of 7%. we believe this transaction will be accretive to ffo by approximately $0.05 for the remainder of 2021 and $0.10 for the entire year of 2022. these four items are the data points that are pointing to the beginning of aat's recovery story starting to unfold. one last point of interest is that on page 16 of the supplemental, total cash net operating income, which is a non-gaap supplemental earnings measure, which the company considers meaningful in measuring its operating performance is shown for the three months, ended june 30, at approximately $58.7 million. if you use this as a run rate going forward, it would be approximately $234 million, which would exceed 2019 pre-covid cash noi of approximately $212 million. a reconciliation of total cash noi to net income is included in the glossary of terms in the supplemental.
moving on. at the end of the second quarter, we had liquidity of approximately $718 million, comprised of $368 million in cash and cash equivalents and $350 million of availability on our line of credit. our leverage, which we measure in terms of net debt-to-ebitda was 6.0 times. our focus is to maintain our net debt-to-ebitda at 5.5 times or below. our interest coverage and fixed charge coverage ratio ended the quarter at 3.7 times. as far as guidance goes, we are in the middle of budget season now for 2022. we hope to begin issuing formal guidance again for 2022 on our q3 '21 earnings call. i'll now turn the call over to steve center, our vice president of office properties for a brief update on our office segment. steve?
steve center -- vice president of office properties
thanks, bob. at the end of the second quarter, excluding one beach, which is under redevelopment, our office portfolio stood at approximately 93% leased with less than 1% expiring through the end of 2021. our top 10 office tenants represented 51% of our total office-based rent. given the quality of our assets and the strength of the markets in which they are located with technology and life science as the key market drivers, our office portfolio is poised to capitalize on improving dynamics, especially in bellevue and san diego. q2 portfolio stats by region were as follows, our san francisco and portland office portfolios were stable at 100% and 96% leased, respectively. city center bellevue was 93% leased, net of a new amenity space under development, and san diego is 91% leased, net of new amenity spaces being added to torrey reserve. we had continued success in q2 preserving pre-covid rental rates with, 13 comparable new and renewal leases, totalling approximately 50,000 rentable square feet, with an over 9% increased over prior rent on a cash basis, and almost 15% increase on a straight-line basis.
the weighted average lease term on these leases was 3.6 years, with just over $7 per rentable square foot in tis and incentives. we experienced a modest small tenant attrition during the quarter due to covid, resulting in a net loss of approximately 16,000 rentable square feet or less than 0.5 point of occupancy, none of which was lost to a competitor. our outlook moving forward is one of positive net absorption with 200 proposal activity picking up significantly. at this point in time, we are seeing smaller tenants willing to commit to longer-term leases at favorable rental rates. even more exciting is the push to return to the office in the emerging large tenant activity and competition for quality larger blocks of space in select markets, including san diego and bellevue, of which we have current availability and active prospects. our continued strategic investments in our current portfolio will position us to capture more than our fair share of net absorption as the markets improve.
the renovation of two buildings at torrey reserve is near completion. we have aggregated large blocks of space to meet demand and take advantage of pricing power, and we have active large deals and negotiations on both buildings. the final phase of the renovation will include a new state of the art fitness complex and conference center, both serving the entire 14 building torrey reserve campus. construction is in full swing on the redevelopment of one beach street in san francisco, delivering in the first half of 2022, and construction is nearly complete on the redevelopment of 710 oregon square in the lloyd submarket of portland. one beach will grow to over 103,000 square feet and 710 organ square will add another 32,000 square feet to the office portfolio.
as ernest mentioned, construction is well underway on tower three at la jolla commons with expected completion in q2, q3 of 2023, and we are encouraged by the emerging large tenant activity and competition for quality large blocks of space and utc. finally, leasing activity is robust for our upcoming availabilities at eastgate office park in suburban bellevue, even prior to executing the exciting renovation plans under development to take this special property to the next level of quality and customer experience. in summary, our office portfolio is on offense as we move forward into the rest of 2021 and beyond. operator, i'll now turn the call over to you for questions.
",2021-Q2,AAT

[operator instructions] our first question comes from the line of todd thomas from keybanc capital markets. your question please.
ravi vaidya -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
hi, good morning. this is ravi vaidya on the line for todd thomas. it seems that the multifamily portfolio continues to recover. rents were up nicely on a sequential basis and occupancy has also rebounded. annualized multifamily noi is still just a touch under the 22 noi forecast that you recently disclosed. is it fair to assume that multifamily is tracking ahead or do you expect it to pull back a bit in the near term?
ernest rady -- chairman and chief executive officer
this is ernest. actually, multifamily is looking like it's on an uptrend. so the rental market is tight in san diego. abigail is nodding her head in affirmation. and portland, which adds a degree of uncertainty is still doing much better than it did during the height of the pandemic or the pit of the problems it went through. so we're very optimistic on our multifamily portfolio, and thank you for asking.
ravi vaidya -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
thank you, just one more here. can you please comment on one beach street, noticed the percent lease rate dropped from 15 to zero, was there a 10 fallout? and can you discuss the leasing environment a bit more broadly? have you seen any delays in lease signings or are companies indicating at all to you that they are rethinking their office needs?
adam wyll -- president and chief operating officer
that was a strategic lease termination. we had an existing tenant on the third floor that the construction activity is so significant. it was just too disruptive. and rather than fight over it, we came to a mutual agreed upon termination settlement, moved them out and that accelerates construction and also lowers cost because we were having to work around that tenant in place. so that was a strategic termination.
ernest rady -- chairman and chief executive officer
i hope that answers your question. if you -- do you want any more detail?
ravi vaidya -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
no, that's fine. thank you, appreciate it.
ernest rady -- chairman and chief executive officer
okay. it's going to be a beautiful building, by the way, and we're really excited about it, and it's the right thing for the market. and you have to see it to see how well it's turning out relative to what it was.
adam wyll -- president and chief operating officer
i would add to that, that having the full building versus a big block of space with another 10 in the building is more desirable.
operator
our next question comes from the line of haendel st. juste from mizuho.
yufei jiang -- mizuho -- analyst
this is lydia jiang for haendel. thank you for taking my question. can you provide more detail on what is driving the changes in rent collections, particularly retail increasing from 93% in july versus 96% in october as well as mixed-use which dropped meaningfully from 85% in july to 72% in october?
ernest rady -- chairman and chief executive officer
you know, you're not coming through clearly. so i don't know how to handle this, but maybe you can answer it generally.
adam wyll -- president and chief operating officer
in general -- in general, retail is turned back on, the critical thing i always preach is school going back. people are spending money in our collections have come back up significantly with the majority of our tenants paying the rent without a fight. i didn't really -- you asked a lot of other questions in there on some numbers. i have to rely on bob to chime in on that.
ernest rady -- chairman and chief executive officer
or if we can't, we're just going to guess at the answers you're looking for. but if you don't receive them, please do call bob barton. and hopefully, the transmission will be clear, and we'll be able to understand the question. bob, do you want to just give some overview?
robert barton -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes. this is lydia, right?
yufei jiang -- mizuho -- analyst
yes. hi, this is lydia. sorry about the connection.
robert barton -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes, i'm not sure, it's on your end or our end, but we've got a lot of echo. so we're, kind of, at a loss here. but generally, what you're saying is -- correct me if i'm wrong, is you're asking about the change in the percentage occupancy from q2 to q3. is that correct?
yufei jiang -- mizuho -- analyst
yes.
adam wyll -- president and chief operating officer
in collection.
robert barton -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes. i mean, if you look on the earnings release, page four, i mean, office is flat, but i don't know if there's much room to go. it's from 99.5% to 99.5%, i mean i think it's -- i think office is strong. retail is on track. we're having much better collections. and i think in -- if you read through adam's comments, he mentioned many of the tenants that we have recently signed in the retail. so retail is coming along. it's still a tough go from some perspective only because we're coming out of covid.
so we have some modifications, but i think we're past a negotiation standpoint. now everybody is coming back to the -- to each of our centers. we're starting to see the theaters start to have people back in them, especially with the issuance of the bond movie recently. and multifamily, i think abigail and ernest spoke on that. so that continues to be on an upward trend overall. and mixed-use the highs and the lows over q3, we -- that's the high season for the embassy suites.
so we always expect to be up over -- in q3 about $0.02 of ffo. our occupancy, we manage toward 88% year-round. and we adjust the rate accordingly based on the demand and the season that we're entering into. so i hope that answers your questions.
ernest rady -- chairman and chief executive officer
lydia, i've always said when it comes to retail, we're going to do as well as anybody. and that's how it's playing out. we're doing as well as anybody, period. so the quality of our portfolio is coming through. and since we're having trouble communicating, please, if you have any additional questions call bob directly. we want to answer all your questions as clearly as we can.
operator
our next question comes from the line of richard hill from morgan stanley.
adam kramer -- morgan stanley -- analyst
hey, you have adam kramer on for richard. good morning guys, i hope you're all well. so look, we appreciate, kind of providing the '21 guide, but kind of wanted to discuss your expectations for '22. and obviously recognize that you haven't provided formal guidance at this point. but in the most recent investor deck, it seemed like expectations for '22 noi were lowered slightly versus the prior presentation. so i just want to ask about that change in '22 noi expectations. and then kind of related to that, your thoughts around the recovery to pre-covid noi in multifamily and retail.
ernest rady -- chairman and chief executive officer
this is ernest. from my point of view, 2022 is going to be a formative year. and we are confident, if not hopeful, that 2023 is going to provide some significantly good news, which we can't comment on now because they're in process. bob, do you want to add anything?
robert barton -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes. first of all, to your question on the bridge that we've tried to keep people informed about and be as transparent as possible through this covid period, i think we're still on track for that bridge. i don't think we're too far off. we made some adjustments in the third quarter on that, which we did publish. but some went down, some went up. it's more of a timing issue than anything. and when you drop in the g&a and interest expense, which is not on the bridge and come down to an ffo, i think we're still on track. so while you have a little bit of noise in the third quarter and the fourth quarter, trying to come out with a run rate, that's what we're just finalizing that now. and we think that it's likely that we'll issue the guidance for 2022 on the fourth quarter earnings call. so it shouldn't be too far off of what you've seen so far.
ernest rady -- chairman and chief executive officer
from a macro point of view, at the moment, there is significant inflation in the cost of construction. if our portfolio were to be valued at four billion dollars or five billion dollars and you add the 14% inflation, the replacement cost of this real estate has increased. the timing of that translating into increased rents is your guess is as good as mine. but we are really happy with what we own.
adam kramer -- morgan stanley -- analyst
got it. no, that's really helpful. and then just, ernest, you kind of mentioned about the kind of inflation in cost of construction. and it's a really good point. so maybe if i could just kind of press you guys on that a little bit. i think you mentioned kind of the development projects are on schedule. what are you seeing in terms of cost of labor, cost for construction, cost for materials, raw materials? is that kind of having an impact and maybe if you can quantify what that impact has been so far or what you're seeing for expectations for these projects?
ernest rady -- chairman and chief executive officer
we were fortunate in that we bought out most of what we're spending this year, last year at the height of pandemic. we are seeing on a go-forward basis significant inflation in construction costs, and i'm going to ask jerry gammieri, who heads that department to cover it in more detail if you prefer.
jerry gammieri -- vice president of construction and development
yes. and to ernest's point, we were very successful in buying out the majority of these projects pre this construction inflation, which has occurred over the last year. it is a real problem industrywide, but i think on the two development projects that we have under construction now, one beach and lo jolla commons iii, we were very successful in making a good buy. and as ernest alluded to earlier, those costs today are up in excess of probably close to 15% beyond what we bought it at. so we feel pretty good about where we are.
ernest rady -- chairman and chief executive officer
and grateful.
adam kramer -- morgan stanley -- analyst
got it. got it. and then just a final one for me. obviously kind of congrats you guys on closing those two deals in bellevue. just wanted to ask about kind of the outlook for further acquisitions. i recognize the liquidity bridge that you kind of gave earlier, which is really helpful, but just kind of outlook for further acquisitions, appetite for further acquisitions and what you're kind of seeing in the market now?
ernest rady -- chairman and chief executive officer
what you're asking us to expose is the debate that goes on continuously within the company. bob doesn't want to spend any money because he wants us to have liquidity. i want to buy assets because i think inflation is going to create value for our stockholders. so we're on the hunt. anything that we buy is going to have to be compelling and accretive, and we're looking every day. and every day bob tells me that our net debt-to-ebitda, our cash, etc, etc. so we'll keep you informed as the debate continues. is that a good way of putting it? let me clarify that. is there -- my view...
adam kramer -- morgan stanley -- analyst
we've got a buying demand there.
ernest rady -- chairman and chief executive officer
[indecipherable]. i love this guide. i love to spend money when it's accretive for the investors. and we do focus on a conservative debt profile. that's a fair summary. thank you, bob.
adam kramer -- morgan stanley -- analyst
got it. really appreciate the time, really appreciate the time. thank you guys.
ernest rady -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you. thanks for the question.
operator
our next question comes from the line of victoria francis from bank of america.
victoria francis -- bank of america -- analyst
good morning, my question is on your multifamily leasing strategy. occupancy was up nine percent this quarter to 97%, but average rent was still down year-over-year. are you focused on regaining occupancy? and do you think you can push rents from here and to what extent do you think your multifamily portfolio has pricing power?
ernest rady -- chairman and chief executive officer
you want me to handle it, abigail, or should i handle -- or should you want to handle? okay. yes. i'm good to go. you want to go?
abigail rex -- director, multifamily, san diego
how about you going?
ernest rady -- chairman and chief executive officer
okay. well, first of all, last year, the rental increases were constricted by the government regulation. those are now coming off gradually. last year, collections were aided by government payments. those will probably come to an end. but in the market in san diego, there is a very tight rental market, a very tight housing market, which provides us an opportunity provided there's no more government regulation to increase rents more than certainly they did last year. in addition to that, we're spending money on our projects to take them to another level. i think those two, and i hope those two factors will allow us to give -- provide a pleasant surprise as far as rental income. abigail, do you want to add something to that?
abigail rex -- director, multifamily, san diego
sure. hi, victoria. i think our strategy for multifamily, both in san diego and in portland is not only how the high occupancy, but also to ensure that the rental rates are comparing or trending upwards with not only the county and the state, but also in the local region. so i think effectively for us occupancy is a determining factor. but obviously, our rental rates are what we want to push upwards. when we look at san diego, the multifamily portfolio here is actually trending higher than that of the county's market rates. our loss to lease is actually pretty low in comparison in the market, and we just continue to push forward. and i think i'd say the same for portland as well. i think our strategy is to capitalize on what renters are looking for. we're obviously looking to amenitize, reposition and offer great experiences to the residents to prove value for them.
ernest rady -- chairman and chief executive officer
that's very well put, abigail. and i think the long and the short of this, we're going to get what we can, and we're going to earn it by improving the properties we have and abigail has put it and portland has put in place excellent management. so we're optimistic. actually more than optimistic if you want to know the truth.
victoria francis -- bank of america -- analyst
great, thank you very much.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of tammy feet from wells fargo securities. your question please.
tammy feet -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
thanks, good morning. maybe just going back on the $70 million of cash on the balance sheet i guess i'm just wondering, is that your mark for the development program or what do you think is the capacity for acquisitions on the balance sheet today?
ernest rady -- chairman and chief executive officer
well, this -- we had a question comparable to that earlier. and there's a constant debate. obviously, we have more than enough cash on the balance sheet to complete our construction. and then we would love to acquire something, both bob and i would love to acquire something that's accretive for our stockholders. we do have in mind our liquidity as being a significant factor in the valuation of our securities. so with that in mind, we're going to do what we can to enhance the value. real estate, the replacement cost of real estate is -- i hate to use the word, but it's going up dramatically, maybe even going through the roof. so anything you can buy today is going to cost us a lot more to replace tomorrow. and that's what drives me. and of course, bob provides a balanced approach and that liquidity is important also. so we weigh those two factors going forward, and we hope that we make the right decisions for all our stockholders.
tammy feet -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
okay. great, thanks. and then maybe just sticking with the balance sheet. the leverage net debt-to-ebitda ticked up slightly in the third quarter versus the second quarter, presumably, as you put some of the cash on the balance sheet to work. i guess i'm wondering, bob, when do you think you can get to that 5.5 times target that you outlined?
ernest rady -- chairman and chief executive officer
we had trouble hearing you. did you hear it, bob?
robert barton -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes. tammy, we've got that echo going on here. yes, when it will happen, that's -- we'll try to give some more insight on that in our 2022 guidance. we're going through that at this point in time. where we are now, we may tick up a little bit and then will start coming down. keep in mind, we have cash that's been put to work on la jolla commons redevelopment, on one beach. and we don't have offsetting earnings coming in at this point in time. so where we are now is that we expect that one beach will be completed in '22, and we're expecting to see revenue from one beach coming in '23 or la jolla commons iii and university town center here in san diego, which is a dynamic, a very strong market, we expect that to be finished, completed in '23 with revenue coming in '24. so while it may tick up a little bit, it's going to come back down and we do see in our corporate operating model where we will hit that 5.5%. so i just can't give you the -- i'd rather give that to you later in our '22 guidance next quarter.
ernest rady -- chairman and chief executive officer
this is a macro strategy. you will recall that we offered -- when private placement debt became more expensive than public issuance, we offered $0.5 billion of bonds, which were 4.5 times oversubscribed, and that was -- that interest rate is locked in for -- at three and three for 10 years. i think that is going to prove to be a really good move as inflation becomes more of a factor. and if feds have to tighten interest rates, we're going to be very glad we have that fixed rate for 10 years, also as the replacement cost of our real estate increases significantly.
tammy feet -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
got it. maybe just one more. bob, you mentioned i think that higher g&a and interest expenses were contributing to sort of the drop in q3 -- in q4 versus q3 ffo. i guess i'm just wondering if you can elaborate on what's driving that?
robert barton -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes. working with covid, we're expecting higher costs in the fourth quarter on g&a. and just to replace some of our people, it's -- the market is strong out there, to say the least. in terms of interest, we have the rate and even on our line of credit, i mean, costs are going up. so what we're seeing all in all is that we expect some of these costs to increase in the fourth quarter. hopefully, it's not as much as that. we always want to under-promise and over-deliver. so we'll do the best we can to keep our g&a down and get the best cost of capital as we go forward.
ernest rady -- chairman and chief executive officer
what we're going through is no different than what the economy is going through. the -- it's an inflationary environment. inflationary environment works against us in the short-term expenditure, but works for us in the long-term replacement cost of our properties. and that's a good question.
tammy feet -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
that makes sense. thank you very much for your time.
operator
thank you. this does conclude the question-and-answer session of today's program. i'd like to hand the program back to ernest rady, chairman and chief operating officer, for any further remarks.
ernest rady -- chairman and chief executive officer
okay. thank you all for your interest. we've all been through a very difficult period. i've always hoped and i've said that we've had difficult times before, and we will come out at the other end of this better off than we went in. i'm still hopeful that's the case, if not confident that's the case. with the properties we have, the projects we have in place. and what we see in the economy and the strong markets we have, i'm really -- i'm really excited and glad where -- with what we have, where we have and the team we have working on. so thank you all very much for your interest.

operator
thank you for standing by, and welcome to the third quarter 2021 american assets trust, inc.'s earnings conference call. [operator instructions]
i would now like to introduce your host for today's program, adam wyll, president and chief operating officer. please go ahead, sir.
adam wyll -- president and chief operating officer
thank you. good morning, everyone. welcome to american assets trust third quarter 2021 earnings call. yesterday afternoon our earnings release and supplemental information were furnished to the sec on form 8-k. both are now available on the investors section of our website, americanassetstrust.com. a telephonic replay and on-demand webcast will also be available for this call over the next week.
during this call we will discuss non-gaap financial measures, which are reconciled to our gaap financial results in our earnings release and supplemental information. we will also be making forward-looking statements based on our current expectations, which statements are subject to risks and uncertainties discussed in our sec filings. you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements.
actual events could cause our results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements for a number of reasons, including, as it may relate to the continuing impact of covid-19.
and with that, i'll turn the call over to ernest rady, our chairman and ceo, to begin the discussion of our third quarter 2021 results. ernest?
ernest rady -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks, adam. and good morning, everyone. i am pleased to report that we continue to make great progress on all fronts as we rebound from the impact of covid-19. we knew at the onset of the pandemic that we would not be impervious to its economic impact, but we were confident that the high-quality, irreplaceable properties and asset class diversity of our portfolio, combined with the strength of our balance sheet and ample liquidity would help us pull through and maybe even come out on the other side better off than at the beginning.
we continue to be optimistic as we meaningfully rebounded in 2021 and anticipate further growth in 2022 and beyond. that's why we've aggregated the portfolio comprised of a well-balanced collection of office, retail, multifamily and mixed-use properties located in dynamic high barrier to entry markets, where we believe that the demographics, pent-up demand and local economies remain strong relative to others.
our properties are more resilient in our view to economic downturns as they are in the path of growth, education, and innovation and importantly can likely withstand the impact of long-term inflation, perhaps even benefit from the benefits of long-term inflation. along those lines during the past quarter, we used our liquidity to acquire two complementary and accretive office properties in bellevue, washington, a market that we remain very bullish on and in which we expect continued rent growth.
meanwhile, our development of la jolla commons iii into an 11 story, approximately 210,000 square foot class a office tower remains on time and on budget for q2 or q3 2023 delivery. we are encouraged about the leasing prospects in the utc submarket for high-quality, large blocks of space, where both tech and life science funding continues at record levels and same tenants continue to expand. but we don't have specific news to share on that front at this time.
the same holds true for our one beach street development on the north waterfront of san francisco, which we believe to be a unique opportunity for a full building tenant with delivery expected in q2 or q3 of 2022. additionally, i'm happy to inform you that our board of directors has approved the quarterly dividend of $0.30 a share for the third quarter, which we believe is supported by our expectations for operations to continue trending positively. it will be paid on december 23 to shareholders of record on december nine.
adam, bob and steve will go into more detail on our various asset segments, collections and financial results and guidance, and i will be available and we'll all be available for any questions that you may have at the conclusion of our prepared remarks. on behalf of all of us at american assets trust, we thank you for your confidence in allowing us to manage your company and for your continued support now more than ever as we aim to grow our earnings and net asset values for our shareholders on an accretive basis.
i'm now going to turn the call back over to adam. adam, please.
adam wyll -- president and chief operating officer
thanks, ernest. as we look at our portfolio, we are always reminded of the importance of owning and operating the preeminent properties in each of our markets. that's why we focused on continuing to enhance our best-in-class community shopping centers to promote a better experience for our shoppers with the expectation that this will further strengthen our properties as the dominant centers in our submarkets. and we understand the importance of modern state-of-the-art amenities in our office projects, which assist our tenants in the hiring and retention of talent in what is currently a very competitive job market.
we feel strongly that consistently improving and monetizing our properties, including incorporating sustainability and health and wellness elements is critical to remaining competitive in the marketplace in order to attract the highest quality and highest credit tenants. meanwhile, we are encouraged by our approximately 97% collection percentage in q3, increased leasing activity across all asset classes, fewer tenant failures and bankruptcies than we expected and many modified leases hitting percentage rent thresholds sooner than expected and are collecting of approximately 96% of deferred rents due during the third quarter, all validating the strategies we implemented during covid to support our struggling retailers through the government-mandated closures as we are fortunate to have the financial ability to do so.
briefly on the retail front, we've seen an improved leasing environment over the past few quarters with positive activity engagement with new retailers for many of our vacancies, including recently signed new deals with columbia sportswear, williams-sonoma, total wine and first hawaiian bank to name a few, and renewals with nordstrom's, petco and whole earth among others as well as many other new deals and renewals in the lease documentation process. retailers are choosing our best-in-class locations to improve their sales, all the while we remain selective in terms of merchandising our shopping centers for the longer term.
chris sullivan and his team have done a tremendous job on that front despite some of the continuing headwinds at our waikiki beach walk retail. on the multifamily front as of quarter end, we were 96% leased at hassalo in portland, and 98% leased in san diego multifamily portfolio. all of the master lease units in san diego that you've heard us discuss previously were absorbed by early august.
though multifamily collections have been particularly challenging in portland due to covid-related government restrictions, we have started receiving meaningful checks from government rental assistant programs to drive down our outstanding amounts owed and expect more checks to come. we are confident that abigail's strong leadership at san diego multifamily and tania's new energy at hassalo will drive improvements at our multifamily properties, both operationally and financially.
with that, i'll turn the call over to bob to discuss q3 financial results in more detail.
robert barton -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thanks, adam. good morning, everyone. last night we reported third quarter 2021 ffo per share of $0.57, and third quarter 2021 net income attributable to common stockholders per share of $0.17. third quarter results are primarily comprised of the following: actual ffo increased in the third quarter by approximately 11.4% on a ffo per share basis to $0.57 per ffo share compared to the second quarter of 2021, primarily from the following four items: first, the acquisitions of eastgate office park in corporate campus east iii in bellevue, washington, on july seven and september 10, respectively, added approximately $0.023 of ffo per share in q3.
second, alamo quarry in san antonio added approximately $0.017 of ffo per share in q3, resulting from 2019 and 2020 real estate tax refunds received during the third quarter of 2021, which reduced alamo quarry's real estate tax expense. third, decrease of bad debt expense at carmel mountain plaza added approximately $0.005 per ffo share in q3. and fourth, the embassy suites and waikiki beach walk added approximately $0.012 of ffo per share in q3 due to the seasonality over the summer months.
let me give you an update on our waikiki embassy suites hotel. due to the impact of the delta variant, hawaiian governor ige made a formal announcement on the third week in august that if you have plans or are thinking of coming to hawaii, please don't come until we tell you otherwise. it was not a mandate, but it did create a detrimental impact to our visitors to hawaii and resulted in huge cancellation starting in august and into september. our results for q3 at embassy suites hotel were expected to be much higher.
overall, occupancy, adr and revpar continued to increase on heading in the right direction. as of october 19, governor ige made another formal announcement to begin welcoming all essential and nonessential travel, starting november 1, 2021. we look forward to welcoming the fully vaccinated individuals and ramping up our visitor industry. on our q2 earnings call, i mentioned that japan, who was then approximately 9% fully vaccinated, is now over 65% fully vaccinated and is expected to hit 80% by november.
all emergency measures in japan were lifted on september 30 and lifted the intensive antivirus measures. it marks the first time since april that japan is free of corona virus declarations and intensive measures. we expect to start seeing the japanese tourists beginning to slowly start revisiting the hawaiian islands beginning in november, including waikiki. now as we look at our consolidated statement of operations for the three months ended september 30, 2021, our total revenue increased approximately $6.5 million over q2 '21, which is approximately a 7% increase.
approximately 43% of that was from the two new office acquisitions. same-store cash noi overall was strong at 14% year-over-year, with office consistently strong before, during and post-covid and retail showing strong signs of recovery. multifamily was flat primarily year-over-year as a result of higher bad debt expense at our hassalo on eight departments in portland, but it was still approximately 5% higher than q2 2021.
as previously disclosed, we acquired corpus campus east iii on september 10, comprised of an approximately 161,000 square foot multi-tenant office campus located just off interstate 405 and 520 freeway interchange, less than five minutes away from downtown bellevue, washington. the four building campus is currently 86% leased to a diversified tenant base, which we saw as an opportunity when in-place rents were compared to what we were seeing in the marketplace. the purchase price of approximately $84 million was paid with cash on the balance sheet. the going-in cap rate was north of 3% as a result of the existing vacancy. our expectation based on our underwriting is that this asset will produce a five year average cap rate over 6% and a strong unlevered irr of 7%. let's talk about liquidity.
at the end of the third quarter, we had liquidity of approximately $522 million, comprised of approximately $172 million in cash and cash equivalents and $350 million of availability on our line of credit. our leverage, which we measure in terms of net debt-to-ebitda was 6.4 times. our focus is to maintain our net debt-to-ebitda at 5.5 times or below. our interest coverage and fixed charge coverage ratio ended the quarter at 3.9 times.
as we approach year-end, we are providing our 2021 guidance. the full year range of 2021 is $1.91 to $1.93 per ffo share with a midpoint of $1.92 per ffo share. with that midpoint, we would expect q4 2021 to be approximately $0.46 per ffo share. the $0.11 estimated difference in q4 ffo per share would be attributable to the following: approximately a negative $0.025 of ffo per share relating to nonrecurring collection of prior rents at one of our theaters in q3 that will not occur in q4 2021.
secondly, our mixed-use properties are expected to be down approximately $0.037 of ffo per share relating to the normal seasonality of the embassy suites hotel and the related parking. third, alamo quarry is expected to be down approximately $0.02 of ffo per share relating to the nonrecurring property tax refund that was received in q3 2021 for 2019 and 2020. and we expect g&a and interest expense to increase and therefore, decrease ffo by approximately $0.02 per ffo share.
additionally, we plan to issue 2022 full year guidance subject to board approval when we announce year-end 2021 results in february of 2022. historically, we have issued our full year guidance on the q3 earnings call. we believe resetting the issuance and cadence of our guidance to the q4 earnings call going forward is more in alignment with our peers and also gives us more clarity as to the following year guidance. as always, our guidance in these prepared remarks exclude any impact from future acquisitions, dispositions, equity issuances or repurchases, future debt refinancings or repayments other than what we've already discussed. we will continue our best to be as transparent as possible and share with you our analysis, interpretations of our quarterly numbers.
i'll now turn the call over to steve center, our vice president of office properties for a brief update on our office segment. steve?
steve center -- vice president of office properties
thanks, bob. our office portfolio grew by approximately 440,000 square feet or nearly 13% in q3 with the two new office acquisitions. we brought up these assets on board at approximately 92% leased with approximately 20% rolling through 2022, which provides us with the opportunity to deliver start rates from approximately 10% to 30% over ending rents. at the end of the third quarter at one beach, which remains under redevelopment, our office portfolio is approximately 93% leased with 1.5% expiring through the end of 2021, approximately 9% expiring in 2022 with tour and proposed activity that has increased significantly.
our office portfolio has weathered the storm well. in the second and third quarters, we executed 57,000 annual square feet of comparable new and renewal leases with increases over prior rent of 9.2% and 14.5% on a cash and straight-line basis respectively. new start rates for the 2021 rollover are estimated to be approximately 17% above the ending rates. in fact, we are at least documentation for over half of the space rolling in 2021 as start rates nearly 28% over ending rates.
new start rates for the 2022 rollovers are estimated to be approximately 18% above the ending rates. we are employing multiple initiatives to drive rent growth and occupancy, including renovating buildings with significant vacancy, adding or enhancing amenities, aggregating and white boxing larger loss of space where there is a scarcity of such blocks and improving our smaller spaces to be move-in ready. by way of a few examples, we are just completing renovations of two buildings at torrey reserve in san diego. those two buildings represent 80% of the total project vacancy.
we now have leases signed or in documentation for over half of that vacancy at premium rates. we will be completing similar renovations eastgate office park where leasing activity is already robust, but we anticipate taking this property to the next level of quality. we are adding new fitness and conference facilities at torrey reserve, city center bellevue and corporate campus east iii and will be further enhancing the employee's amenities building at eastgate.
we believe that our continued strategic investments in our portfolio will position us to capture more than our fair share of that absorption at premium rents as the markets improve. and we have more to look forward to with redevelopments and development. in addition to one beach street and la jolla commons previously mentioned by ernest, construction is nearly complete on the redevelopment of seven tower square in the, on our market at portland, which will add another 32,000 rentable square feet to the office portfolio. in summary, our office portfolio is on us as we move forward into the rest of 2021 and beyond.
operator, i'll now turn the call over to you for questions.
