i would now like to turn the call over to ankur shah, manager of investor relations. you may begin your conference.
ankur shah -- manager, investor relations
good morning, and welcome to autonation's first quarter 2022 conference call and webcast. [operator instructions] leading our call today will be mike manley, our chief executive officer; and joe lower, our chief financial officer. following their remarks, we will open up the call for questions. i will be available by phone following the call to address any additional questions that you may have.
before we begin, let me read our brief statement regarding forward-looking comments. certain statements and information on this call, including any statements regarding our anticipated financial results and objectives, constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal private securities litigation reform act of 1995. such forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks that may cause our actual results or performance to differ materially from such forward-looking statements. additional discussions of factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially are contained in our press release issued earlier today and in our sec filings, including our most recent annual report on form 10-k and subsequent quarterly reports on form 10-q and current reports on form 8-k.
and now i'll turn the call over to autonation's chief executive officer, mike manley. 
mike manley -- chief executive officer
yes. thanks, ankur. well, good morning, everybody, and thank you for joining us. firstly, i am pleased to report that the momentum with which autonation ended 2021 continued through to the first quarter of this year.
from our view, consumer demand for personal vehicle ownership remained strong across both our new and our used channels and our service and parts business is clearly showing the benefits of both increased miles traveled and our focus on increasing our penetration into the after-sales market. and really, as a result, today, autonation reports record first quarter performance with earnings per share of $5.78, which is an increase of 103% and revenue of $6.8 billion, which increased $849 million or 14% compared to prior year. now from a new sales perspective, our performance reflects the effect of continued tight supply basically with volumes down and new margins stable from the end of last year. the year to date, i can say, compared to prior year, we have not seen any reduction in lieu of demand for new vehicles or really any perceivable segments shifting as a result of current economic conditions.
and our used car performance reflected good volume growth on a same-store basis and the continued expansion of our autonation usa business. and this helped maintain our revenue and total gross profit. now during the quarter, we sharpened our analytic capabilities, which are increasingly educating our buying, placement and pricing decisions in the used market. and these disciplines are a work in progress, but i think you can clearly see they're going to have a beneficial impact on our business.
for example, during the quarter, we recognized the need to rebalance some of our used vehicle inventory to help improve turn and margin. and as a result, in the quarter, we saw a temporary reduction in used margin per unit sold. but because of these actions, as we enter the second quarter, margin return have already improved. as we all know, success in the used car market is basically dictated by your ability to manufacture great quality, well-priced desirable used cars.
and this clearly covers key elements of the business, including efficient and effective reconditioning, for example, but it all starts fundamentally with your ability to competitively acquire used inventory. and with strong consumer demand, we continue to focus on our self-sourcing capabilities for used vehicles, which i think further strengthened both our franchise dealerships, but also our autonation usa businesses. and as i've mentioned before, nearly all of our preowned vehicles retailed are self-sourced, which includes our growing rebuy your car channel, which purchases directly from consumers. and when i look back at the first quarter, we self-sourced 94% of our preowned vehicles that we acquired.
now as previously announced, the company entered two new markets this quarter with autonation usa charlotte in north carolina and autonation usa in charleston in south carolina. and our autonation usa stores continue to exceed our expectations, and these two new stores were both profitable during the first four months of operation. and we remain on plan to open 12 additional stores over the year. and our target, as you know, is to have over 130 of these stores in operation from coast to coast by the end of 2026.
now, these stores will continue to leverage the autonation brand, the scale that we have, and our proven customer-centric processes to capture a larger share of the used vehicle market. moving on to after-sales. as i mentioned earlier, our team delivered, what i consider to be, a tremendous quarter, with an increase in after-sales gross profit of 19%, and i'm going to come back to this a little bit more in my closing comments. we continue to build our compelling customer value proposition through the combination of our digital tools and physical assets and going to leverage not just our existing business, but also autonation usa growth plan and our embedded structure improvements, coupled with the rich data and analytical capabilities that we continue to build, and this is going to help grow and strengthen our business and the autonation brand.
but before i hand over to joe, who's going to take you through our results in more detail, i'm going to briefly touch again on a topic that we did discuss last quarter when we reviewed our year-end results. and during that time, i talked about a number of key profit drivers and disciplines that now are structurally embedded into the group, such as our used to new sales volume focus, our customer financial service performance, our after-sales penetration, and margin and expense control. and i'm pleased to recognize that when i review the results for q1, you can again see the benefits of this focus and discipline coming through strongly. great performance from our sales and cfs teams growing our used business and our per unit cfs performance.
our service and parts teams led by our technicians, service lane advisors, and our parts teams delivered strong performance improvement. and as you see, all of our associates, and frankly, that's whether they work in our dealerships, collision centers, auction or support functions around the country, demonstrated the continued clear focus on margin, but also expense control discipline. i think these things are important, and i'll touch on them again because performance efficiency and effectiveness in these areas, in my view, is sustainable and as such, really do help decouple our company from the more circumstantial elements that could be viewed as transitional, such as supply and demand-driven constraints. now, these embedded structural improvements in our performance should not be discounted because ultimately, they do translate into long-term sustainable value.
and they provide us with more control over where we're going and the opportunity to focus on expanding and developing our customer-centric personal transportation solutions, while driving results for our manufacturer partners. so i just want to end this introduction by congratulating all of the people that work at autonation for the results they delivered in the quarter, thanking them for what they do. and with that, joe, i'm going to hand over to you.
joe lower -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thank you, mike, and good morning, everyone. today, we reported first quarter total revenue of $6.8 billion, an increase of 14% year over year. this increase was driven largely by used vehicle revenue up 47% over the same period. supply chain disruption continues to govern new vehicle availability as we saw a 6% decline in new vehicle revenue as we effectively sold every new vehicle received, with inventory falling below year-end levels.
we continue to see demand exceed supply during the first quarter. with this, we remain focused on optimizing new vehicle margins and sourcing used vehicle inventory to support sales in our autonation usa expansion. for the quarter, total variable gross profit increased 31% year over year, driven by an increase in total variable pvr of $1,671 or an increase of 38%. a decline in new units of 19% was partially offset by growth in used units of 11%.
our after-sales business continues to gain momentum with after-sales gross profit increasing 19% on a year-over-year basis. taken together, total gross profit increased 27% compared to the prior year. shifting to cost. we continue to deliver significant sg&a leverage due to strong cost discipline and robust vehicle margins.
first quarter sg&a as a percentage of gross profit was 56.6%, a 610 basis point improvement compared to the year-ago period. as measured against gross profit, our metrics improved across all key categories, with overhead decreasing 210 basis points, compensation decreasing 340 basis points, and advertising decreasing 60 basis points. the combination of strong growth in gross profit, strict cost discipline, and opportunistic share repurchase generated net income for the quarter of $362 million or $5.78 per share. eps was up 107% versus prior year adjusted eps of $2.79.
this reflects our eighth consecutive quarter of all-time high adjusted eps. turning to the balance sheet and liquidity. our cash balance at the end of q1 was $608 million, which mainly consisted of proceeds from our recent notes offering. combined with our additional borrowing capacity, total quarter-end liquidity was $2.4 billion.
we continue to deploy capital to grow our business and drive long-term shareholder returns. during the first quarter, we entered two new markets with our autonation usa stores, as mike mentioned earlier. we've also continued to repurchase our own shares. during the first quarter, we repurchased 3.5 million shares for an aggregate purchase price of $381 million.
we purchased an additional 1.4 million shares thus far in q2 for a total year-to-date repurchase of $518 million or almost 8% of our shares outstanding at the beginning of this year. the company has $376 million available for additional share repurchase under our current authorization. and as of april 19th, there were approximately 58 million shares outstanding. we continue to maintain ample capacity on our balance sheet.
at the end of the first quarter, our net leverage ratio was 1.3 times net-debt-to-ebitda, slightly lower than at the end of the fourth quarter and well below our historical range of approximately two times to three times leverage. we continue to demonstrate strong operational execution and disciplined capital allocation. going forward, we remain focused on leveraging our balance sheet and strong cash flows to drive long-term shareholder value. with that, i'll turn the call back over to mike.
mike manley -- chief executive officer
thanks, joe. just a couple of comments or maybe before we get into q&a session, and that's around our structure and the people that we have. you'll have seen some announcements as we got into ahead -- while we already finished last year when got into the first quarter of basically the -- some realignment of our existing businesses. the couple that i want to touch on is obviously the two new chief operating officer roles that we have with dave koehler coming in.
dave is going to look after our nonfranchise businesses so that we can make sure we have appropriate focus on that. there's going to be significant growth opportunities, some of which already identified, some of which is work in progress. but dave and his teams will be making sure that that gets the focus that it needs. and then steve kwak will look after our franchise businesses.
and that, again, remains our core business naturally. and we'll get the additional focus of new roles that we brought into the organization, which basically are market brand president roles. that's going to strengthen our relationships with our manufacturers, but really get the focus so that we can work really alongside our manufacturers, partners across our three automotive segments of domestic, import and premium luxury. so what i think this will do is it will bring significant focus based upon individual brands within our overall autonation group, but also now tease out areas of the business that really do offer, i think, significant growth with the right level of focus and dedication.
so -- and with that, i think, joe, we can open it up for questions.
joe lower -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
please.

[operator instructions] our first question comes from the line of rajat gupta from j.p. morgan. rajat, your line is now open.
rajat gupta -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
great. thanks for taking the questions. just had a first question on the used car business. just curious, they're normalized faster than maybe what we saw at your peers, lithia still had pretty good margins there.
just curious as to what drove that normalization? was it more a prioritization on growth versus margins? or was there something else to highlight there that was more temporary? maybe if you could start there. thanks.
mike manley -- chief executive officer
yeah. sure. rajat, this is mike. no, it's completely temporary, as i mentioned in my comments.
towards the end of last year and progressively through q1 we've been, i think, strengthening our data analytics with regard to used vehicles, not just in terms being more precise in what vehicles, what segments, what geographies are moving and in which direction, but also how that applies to our inventory levels. and frankly, i didn't like some of the -- as a result of that, frankly, i didn't like some of the profile that we have. and i wanted to make sure while we were -- [inaudible] in a very strong quarter that we took the necessary action to realign it. and i'm pleased to say that was completed in the quarter.
our return rates have improved and our margins are rebounding in the way that i hoped they would. so i just think it was appropriate action based upon a continued focus on us in terms of data and data analytics.
rajat gupta -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
understood. so do we expect margins to move back higher here going forward? and obviously, like there are other governers around like used car pricing and some factors that -- they're probably not in your control. but maybe like if you could help us understand, like where do we expect those used car gpus to settle relative to what they were pre-pandemic?
mike manley -- chief executive officer
that already moved up as a result of the actions. we completed what i wanted them to get done in the quarter. so they've already moved up. i think -- when i think about gpus, even though we have seen some movement from pre-pandemic levels, the actual margin on the basis of sales prices remained relatively flat.
what i expect as we bring additional efficiencies in the business, in terms of the conversion of a raw purchase of a used vehicle to get it pressed and ready for sale and the speed of getting it to market, that there's actually opportunity to us -- to improve margins beyond what you saw pre-pandemic in used. so that piece is very much a focus internally, and it talks to some of the things that i commented on in terms of some of the structural changes that we're making. but the raw margin that you see reflected in the quarter was driven by exactly what i said. it was a -- it really was a realignment of some inventory that was completed in the quarter.
the guys have delivered margins that are much better and heading in the right direction. but as i mentioned, i still think there's even further upside. thank you.
rajat gupta -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
got it. got it. great. thanks for the color.
and maybe you mentioned last quarter that you have a captive finco in your mind that you plan to maybe build at some point. curious, like, if your thoughts on that has evolved at all over the last couple of months? where are you in that planning process? when could we expect to see that? and maybe like if you could comment on just the broader auto lending environment today, is there any stress that you're seeing in terms of ability -- just ability for lenders to pass on some of the interest rate increases that you're seeing on the benchmark side? just maybe if you could frame that as well along with just updated thoughts on the captive?
mike manley -- chief executive officer
yeah. look, like you said my thoughts evolved on the need for us to have a captive finco, no. but they're certainly solidified. i view it as an important piece of the business for us going forward for our autonation usa stores.
i think -- when i think about our business, one of the reasons why i wanted to slightly restructure it was to enable us to put in place the tools that autonation usa needs to be successful going forward. obviously, on the franchise side, we have relationships with our oems, and that's slightly important, but we have a business that is in a growth phase. it will continue to grow. it's proven that the model is working, and it needs, in my view, to have the flexibility of a timed finco.
that finco, like most successful fincos, will not be responsible for picking up the whole book. naturally, you're going to remain in partnerships with people that have been supportive during your period of growth before, and i expect that to happen going forward. you will absolutely hear more on this subject as the year develops. but one of the things that we will do is i think, the group has always done, is not rush the purchase.
i think that there are opportunities in the market that may -- that are interesting at this moment in time. and as we find what is the right opportunity and the board agrees with that, we'll make the appropriate move. in terms of our conversion rate on used, i can tell you it remains strong. at this moment in time, we are not seeing a drop off in terms of conversion.
you can see from our cfs, our customer financial services performance, that in fact, that's improving. it's been a strength of ours and continues to be a strength of ours. so at this moment in time, what i can tell you is when i look at both the top level of inquiries and also some of the conversion rates by mix, we're not really seeing any dramatic shift except in the sub, i would say, $22,000 mark, where we are seeing a drop off of not raw inquiries, but really a drop-off of conversion, and that's more to do with inventory. as you know, that inventory is relatively tight across the industry, and we're seeing the same thing, but it's been more than supplemented by an increase in plus $40,000 inquiries.
so did that help paint some color for you?
rajat gupta -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
yeah, absolutely. thanks so much for all the color and good luck. i'll get back in the queue.
mike manley -- chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from adam jonas of morgan stanley. adam, your line is now open.
adam jonas -- morgan stanley -- analyst
hey, mike. is there a precedent for oems to raise msrps intra-model year that you've seen?
mike manley -- chief executive officer
i have seen oems make, what i would call, inflationary price adjustments during model years. it's certainly something that i have seen on multiple occasions. they're typically in response to, as we see, inflationary pressures in the marketplace. but some of those may not be a pure msrps or maybe incentive adjustments as certain things change in the marketplace.
so that is not unprecedented in my view or my experience.
adam jonas -- morgan stanley -- analyst
thanks, mike. another one on ford and jim farley, i believe you have 42 ford stores. i hear ford made some comments in february saying -- and i'm kind of paraphrasing here, mike, bear with me, that dealers that would charge significant markups on the lightning won't be allocated. now i'm not a lawyer, but that sounds like getting close to disenfranchisement talk.
is he able to -- is that legal? is ford actually able to unallocate someone that charges over msrp for product in the current franchise agreement?
mike manley -- chief executive officer
what i would say is that -- and i'm not an attorney, so i'm going to give you my view. what i would say is that there are mechanisms -- and this isn't a ford thing, by the way. and i would tell you that jim's sentiment in this area is probably going to be echoed by most of the oem ceos. what i can tell you is that the oems in the current franchise agreement need to treat their dealers, whether it's a large group or individuals, broadly, in a similar manner that's in keeping with state franchise board.
now having said the obvious, which that was, obviously, there are mechanisms that oems want to and do employ to try and make sure that the value they perceive in their vehicles is passed on to their customers. so jim's reacting to a huge amount of demand for lightning, which is in the marketplace. and as you know, they've now shut off reservations for that vehicle. and what he's trying to do, which i think is reasonable, is to make sure the vehicle hits the market at a price point that is supportive of the brand of the f-150.
and there are many ways that he can influence that, and a lot of those ways are within the franchise regulations, some of which may be outside, but there are a lot within.
adam jonas -- morgan stanley -- analyst
ok. mike, if i can just squeeze in one more, please, i appreciate it. agency model. it seems like, from my perspective, that seems like a good development for a company like autonation, kind of -- just let you focus on the areas where you are -- have greater capability and where you win on service and efficiency.
i would love your thoughts on that at a high level. am i wrong that if we are in some circuitous way, ending up in some kind of fixed commission and/or fixed percentage or whatever, that's not necessarily a bad thing? i know there's a lot of details there, but i would love your thoughts high level. thanks.
mike manley -- chief executive officer
yeah, no problem. so you can throw whatever words you want at it, whether you call it an agency or whether you -- a dealership agreement or a dealer agreement, one of the things that, in my mind, is absolutely certain as we move forward is that there needs to be a much less friction in the sales process than has historically been, and there needs to be more price transparency. and i think that the reset that we have been through over the last two years is a good opportunity, particularly with the transition to new powertrains to make sure that, that continues in the marketplace. and for me, what we've recognized is that there is opportunity to remove cost from the distribution channel, and there is opportunity for us to encourage customers to maybe preorder more than they've done in the past, which also adds some efficiency.
i think given the increased price of electric powertrains that should be passed on to the customer to make sure that this transition is as smooth as possible, and autonation will be a part of that. and that means reasonable margins for the work that we do, and it means we'll continue to compete as a customer-focused business. so in principle, i'm agreeing with what you said. i just don't particularly want to label it an agency model or anything else because frankly, i think it's good business.
adam jonas -- morgan stanley -- analyst
appreciate it, mike. thanks.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from john murphy of bank of america. john, your line is now open.
john murphy -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
hi. good morning. good morning, mike. maybe just to follow up on the pricing and maybe the more important question is are you seeing oems increase invoice pricing to you? i mean, msrp is a suggested price in the market, but what you get charged is the invoice.
so it seems like that might be a more important thing to focus on because they're looking at the grosses that you're making and you're making big grosses on new. so is there any increase there to maybe kind of claw back some of that and share a little bit in the wealth on gpu a little bit more?
mike manley -- chief executive officer
so, john, i apologize. we have 30 brands. i'm going to have to talk a little bit more general and if you want to circle back with it, feel free to do so. yeah.
when the oems make the interim -- and adam asked the question, interim model year changes that are due really to inflationary pressures typically in the past, that result's obviously in an increase to us or they don't get any benefit from it. and ultimately, therefore, a portion of that gets passed into the marketplace. it's interesting, isn't it? because what was actually happening today is vehicles have been sold at msrp and the margins that we are getting are as a result of vehicles being sold at msrp. and i thought that fundamentally, that was the business model we were supposed to be achieving.
and i never was able to achieve it as a ceo of an oem for a whole host of reasons, partly because the levels of inventory that were in the retail network had to be turned and they had to be turned in a fashion that meant heavy discounting. we're not in that position anymore. the last time i looked, many oems were also benefiting from improvement in terms of their margin. and i think that's -- i think, frankly, that's going to continue.
so if you want more specific details, then feel free, as i mentioned, to reach out to us. but if i look generally at our new car pricing now, our new car pricing is autonation. the quarter was very stable, very stable. so i, in fact, saw a downward in terms of our average price on new vehicles, which was driven by mix, not driven by incentives or further discounting.
so i think we've now seen the level of stability in new car pricing that we didn't have through the early part of last year. so obviously, the year-over-year comps are quite large at this moment in time. but as we get into the second half, you're going to see them stabilize down significantly.
john murphy -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
yes. i'm sorry, mike, maybe to be clear, i mean, right -- i mean, your gross is a function of what you charge the consumer less your invoice price from the automaker that you're charged, net of any kind of floorplan financing assistance. so i'm just curious, have you seen any actions by the automakers on the pricing to you on invoice that would change that seems like it's an increase relative to the msrp? meaning, are they narrowing the gap between the msrp and the invoice they charge you, right? the msrp is what's in the market, the invoice is what's charged to you? i'm just curious if they're changing that gap?
mike manley -- chief executive officer
yeah. now i understand your question, john. so i'm -- i'm not --
john murphy -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
yes. second question and because i can only do simple math, let's just think about this in simple terms. i mean the buyback basically improved your eps by 5.4% in the quarter, if you look at the 66 million versus the 62.6 million from the fourth quarter to the first quarter. i mean if you kind of drew a linear sort of math on that, that would be the equivalent of you acquiring 18.3 franchises or $1.4 billion in revenue in the quarter.
obviously, it's a similar pe, about 5x to where your stock is trading right now. i mean, it just seems like buying back your stock all day long, makes so much more sense to making any acquisitions. and you bought it back at roughly $109 on average through the quarter. you're below that now.
do you just stay very aggressive -- i mean not aggressive. i mean it's a balance, right? it's the right thing to do on buying back your stock and not making new vehicle acquisitions and then pressing the used growth. i just -- it just seems like the exact right strategy and you're executing on it. and if you comp it versus what the splashy announcements are made on the acquisition side by some other competitors with smaller networks, it just seems like you're having a much bigger impact and immediate return on your earnings per share structurally over time.
mike manley -- chief executive officer
yeah. i think as we've seen over the last 24 months, and we'll continue to see, the way that people are valuing companies is changing and will continue to change. but the math that you did broadly was right with the exception of one thing, and that is that some of the acquisitions that we're looking at and frankly, are pursuing, will give us, i think, a multiple higher than the historical business has been able to generate because our industry is going to change. and with that change is going to come opportunities that, frankly, will be more under our control as a retailer than we've been in the past and bring more incremental benefits to our shareholders in terms of value.
but one of the things that autonation has done is, i think they've not -- there has been a strategy to try and maximize the benefit to the shareholders where capital has been. and certainly in the first quarter with everything that was going on and the fact that we are reviewing and have reviewed some of our strategic priorities, it was best for us to maintain that activity, and you've seen the results come through. but that doesn't mean to say there aren't attractive acquisition opportunities for us. there are.
and as the year goes through, you'll hopefully see some.
john murphy -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
and then just lastly on the autonation usa stores, 130 by 2026. i mean you're making good progress there. it seems like the business is working well. why is 130 the right number? could it be significantly higher?
mike manley -- chief executive officer
yeah. i think when the 130 was done, it was really looking at two things: one was which are the most attractive markets that we are not necessarily in with our existing footprint. and by that, i'm talking about franchise business as well. and then the second thing was, as the group is thinking about is capital allocation, what would be a reasonable allocation of capital over that period.
i can tell you that our thoughts on that have continued to mature, partly because as they were putting -- and we -- now obviously we're putting in autonation usa stores, the model was being tweaked and made more efficient. and so today's autonation usa stores are slightly different than the past. and secondly, i also think about these stores not just purely as a place where used cars are sold. these stores in the future can do many other things for us.
so that 130 is our baseline today. it may well grow, and we may get more aggressive for other reasons.
john murphy -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
ok. very helpful. thank you so much.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from bret jordan of jefferies. bret, your line is now open.
ethan huntley -- jefferies -- analyst
hey. good morning. this is ethan huntley on for bret. thanks for taking our questions.
maybe just going back here to supply and maybe the cadence of supply. i know new inventory sort of came down to eight days from nine; and used, to 30 from 40. but can you maybe just provide a little bit of color on sort of the cadence of supply and whether things might have improved at all? or are you sort of bouncing along the bottom here?
mike manley -- chief executive officer
frankly, i think what we are doing is bouncing along the bottom, but i don't think it is as you said. one of the things that i wanted to do with our team is to increase our turn rate. it's -- and we've been able to do that. and i think that's why you've seen our days of supply really level out.
what's been interesting for me is as we've come into this year, obviously, none of us could really foresee the ongoing impacts of things that are happening around the world, and they are going to have impact on people's original plans in terms of their production levels. but what i do know is, given this market, it's a key market for all the oems. and i do know that the intent is there to improve it as soon as possible. from my point of view, you're not really going to see anything until the third or fourth quarter, but i know you're asking individual oems.
so our focus is let's sell more aggressively at the pipeline, which is a new skill for the industry in the us. and let's make sure we're turning the inventory as fast as possible when it lands. and they are the two key things that are in our control, and they are the things we're focused on.
ethan huntley -- jefferies -- analyst
ok. great. that's helpful. thank you.
and then maybe just here on the floorplan, did floorplan subsidies exceed expenses for the quarter?
mike manley -- chief executive officer
i can give you my gut reaction, but joe is just double-checking to make sure that we don't give you the wrong data point.
joe lower -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
it did slightly.
mike manley -- chief executive officer
it did slightly.
joe lower -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
i mean, obviously, now floorplan is relatively low from an expense perspective. because obviously, you can see by the days turn that our actual expense is relatively modest, but incentive has also come down marginally for the same reasons.
mike manley -- chief executive officer
thanks, joe.
ethan huntley -- jefferies -- analyst
ok. and then just sort of lastly, here on the service category, a 15.5% comp was solid there. can you just sort of help break out the difference in traffic versus average ticket?
joe lower -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes. can you just say a bit more specific with your question, please, ethan?
ethan huntley -- jefferies -- analyst
sorry?
mike manley -- chief executive officer
could you be more specific with your question? are you asking me through our service department, how is that changing and growing? what is it specifically you're looking for?
ethan huntley -- jefferies -- analyst
yeah. just in the service category, did you see the comp of 15.5%, was that primarily driven through inflationary pricing and increased prices? or is it a pickup in sort of traffic?
mike manley -- chief executive officer
well, we're seeing two dynamics there: firstly, we are seeing an improvement in traffic from a customer perspective and an improvement in internal work, slightly offset by a decrease in warranty because obviously, the vehicle -- new vehicle warranty [indiscernible] is dropping, but it's been more than offset by an increase in consumer, both volume and a slight increase in per ticket and internal work as our used volume increases.
ethan huntley -- jefferies -- analyst
ok. great. thank you very much.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from stephanie moore of truist. stephanie, your line is now open.
stephanie moore -- truist securities -- analyst
hi. good morning. i wanted to touch on the new vehicle side of your business. and maybe you can speak to if you're seeing any change in the consumer profile of your new vehicle buyer either from a credit quality standpoint or median average income? and kind of thinking forward, as we go through what could be a potential recessionary environment, certainly a rising interest rate environment, how do you think your new vehicle business is positioned now versus prior cycles? thank you.
mike manley -- chief executive officer
no. i'm not seeing any perceivable change in terms of the profile of customers coming through new vehicles. in fact, if you look at our -- if you look at the traffic, both coming through our digital -- and all of our web pages as well as walking into our stores, it is, in fact, up and continues to grow year over year. our conversion rates, obviously with the level of inventory and the demand that we've got, are remaining strong.
so outside of that, it's difficult because of the environment that we're in to really pinpoint if there is something underlying that's happening. in terms of why, i think that was new vehicles going forward, if you look at the saar in the first three months of this year, it's bouncing around 13 million, 14 million. and typically, those numbers would have been associated with a recessionary period, obviously. so even if you see us because of economic conditions, consumer confidence, whatever, see a reduction in that demand.
i think the levels that we're at now would still be maintained going forward because, as i said, they are historically more associated with periods of recession and where we sit right at this moment in time.
stephanie moore -- truist securities -- analyst
got it. so i guess maybe said another way, given the rise we've seen in just new vehicle msrps, are you seeing just an affordability issue with the average consumer? or do you find that they're trading up for the benefit of the vehicle? or do you think it's more of a shift to the used market, i guess, is the angle i'm looking for?
mike manley -- chief executive officer
ok. well, i'll try and give you an angle on the answer then. if you look at the increase in used vehicle wholesale prices and the increase in new vehicle prices, the gap between them actually narrowed over the period of last year. so that's the theoretical cost to change, in my mind.
so if you were trading in a vehicle, then your position really has been not materially impacted by rising prices because you've got it on both sides. that obviously doesn't apply to people that are buying a vehicle for the first time in the marketplace. outside of that, i can't really give you much color because our turn rates are so high, it's difficult to perceive what may be a slight movement in terms of affordability as we, frankly, have customers for basically everything that's coming.
stephanie moore -- truist securities -- analyst
got it. that makes sense. i appreciate it. thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from colin langan from wells fargo. colin, your line is now open.
colin langan -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
great. thanks for taking my question. just wanted to follow up on the finco. i thought in your comments, you said something you're in no rush to purchase.
i mean is the plan to acquire a finco? or is this something about -- or are there thoughts really more to it organically?
mike manley -- chief executive officer
from my perspective, if there is a right target in the marketplace, that will be, by far, my preferred route to do it. by far my preferred route to do it.
colin langan -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
got it. ok. and then you also -- in your intro comments talking about costs and sg&a was quite low in the quarter. are there any notable actions that we should be aware of that are going to drive that structural cost? i mean what really are some of the key drivers that you're kind of getting at in terms of structural costs coming down coming out of this crisis?
joe lower -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. i'll address that. it's really the same we've talked about in the past. it starts with really starting to leverage the digital capabilities we have, both in the sales and store operations as well as the back office.
so you go back to the beginning of 2020, i mean, we're 13% down on headcount on a same-store basis, right? that has continued to kind of drive through the operations. our digital tools have allowed us to be more efficient in advertising. and so these are, in my perspective, structural changes we've made that have reduced if you will, the fixed cost structure of the business, which we're maintaining the discipline going forward. so we expect that we will continue to have a much more favorable sg&a as a percentage of gross going forward by maintaining that discipline and ensuring that we continue to leverage the tools most effectively, and we continue to invest in those tools to make sure that they're state of the art.
colin langan -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
great. right. thanks for taking my question.
operator
thank you. [operator instructions] our next question comes from david whiston of morningstar. david, your line is now open.
david whiston -- morningstar -- analyst
thanks. good morning. first, on the usa stores, as you go into new metro areas, from a marketing perspective, how are you introducing the stores and the brand to consumers? is it mostly internet or radio or tv?
mike manley -- chief executive officer
frankly, it's a combination of all of the above. i think what joe didn't touch on is one of the efficiencies that marc cannon and his team have been able to generate is the way that they are communicating in the use of different media channels. and i think that that -- typically, what we would do is really use the data that's available to see how the demographic that we're targeting in that particular area is consuming information. and then he just basically built an optimum plan to try and make sure that we hit communication goals and marketing goals in the time frame that we need to launch it.
and he does that individually by each and every market, even though there's obviously a lot of commonality. and then effectively he rolls it out.
david whiston -- morningstar -- analyst
and on sg&a, if we were to have a recession later, obviously, a lot was already cut in 2020 other than reducing advertising in a downturn, are you guys already close to the bone? or do you think there's more cuts you could come up with if you had to?
joe lower -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
we are continually evaluating the cost structure, and we have a number of initiatives underway to continue to operate the stores more efficiently. so we, today, have a large shared service center in dallas. we continue to look at ways to optimize that and make our stores more and more efficient. and that is an ongoing journey that will have ongoing benefits.
so the answer is, i don't like to think of cutting to the bone, i'd like to think about optimizing the organization, and that's clearly something we see additional opportunity going forward.
david whiston -- morningstar -- analyst
ok. and finally, on -- with inflation, perhaps sticking around short term or even long term, if it were to be a longer-term problem, would that change your m&a strategy at all in terms of would you want to be more toward volume brands due to their lower prices? or more -- focused more on the premium side because those customers perhaps aren't as bothered by inflation?
mike manley -- chief executive officer
i mean, frankly, we're in a cyclical business, right? so obviously, for me, i like the blend that we have in terms of brands. i think it's a really good blend, particularly when i think through the plans that the individual oems have put in place because ultimately, the product that they're working on today really is going to dictate the success on the new car side of the business going forward. and having reviewed now across many of our oems, their product plans, firstly, i'm encouraged by the level of investment that's been made; and secondly, it doesn't really change my view on the balance that we have in our portfolio today. i think it just reinforces we have a good balance.
david whiston -- morningstar -- analyst
ok. thank you.
operator
thank you. there are no further questions at this time. mr. manley, i turn the call back over to you.
mike manley -- chief executive officer
thank you. again, thanks for being on the call today. as i said before, i think it's good that the momentum that we had finishing off last year continued into the first quarter. i'm really going to just end by saying, and we touched on it in some of the questions as well, i think that there are a number of changes that have been structurally made to the group that will continue to be in place.
that, for me, will make us more efficient. i think a focus on costs that we discussed with joe and his answer to the question, will continue going forward. and i look forward to seeing how q2 ends for us. and hopefully, you'll all be on our call in a few months' time.
so thank you for your time this morning.

operator
good morning. my name is candice, and i will be your conference operator today. at this time, i would like to welcome you to the autonation second quarter 2022 earnings conference call. [operator instructions] i would now like to turn the call over to ankur shah, director of investor relations.
you may now begin your conference.
ankur shah -- director, investor relations
good morning and welcome to the autonation's second quarter 2022 conference call and webcast. please ensure that your lines are muted until the operator announces your turn to ask a question. leading our call today will be mike manley, our chief executive officer; and joe lower, our chief financial officer. also joining the call is derek fiebig, vice president of investor relations.
following their remarks, we will open up the call for questions. we will be available by phone after the call to address any additional questions you may have. before beginning, let me read our brief statement regarding forward-looking comments. certain statements and information on this call, including any statements regarding our anticipated financial results and objectives constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal private securities litigation reform act of 1995.
such forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks that may cause our actual results or performance to differ materially from such forward-looking statements. additional discussions of factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially are contained in our press release issued earlier today and our sec filings, including our most recent annual report on form 10-k, subsequent quarterly reports on form 10-q and current reports on form 8-k. with that, i'll turn the call over to autonation's chief executive officer, mike manley. 
mike manley -- chief executive officer
thanks, ankur. good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. firstly, i really do want to just spend a little bit of time to thank all of the team at autonation. we're continuing to deliver great results in the quarter, which obviously enabled joe and i to report another record performance.
as usual, joe is going to take you through the numbers in detail, and i'll begin with a general overview of performance. so from a substantially flat year-over-year revenue of $6.9 billion, we were able to increase our operating income by 5% to $558 million, which, as i already mentioned, is a record for the group. our earnings per share for the quarter was also a record of $6.48, a year-over-year increase of 34%. as you can see, total new volume was down 25%, which when you consider our low level of new inventory and our high inventory turn rates was, in my view, purely a result of continued constrained supply.
as you can see, volume was substantially offset with strong margins up 47% compared to the prior year and stable quarter over quarter. again, i think an indication that demand for new vehicles remains strong. used revenue in the quarter was 13% above the prior year. however, from a volume perspective, total used sales were down 4% and down 9% on a same-store basis.
and all of the volume reduction was in our entry selection of vehicles which are priced at $20,000 and below. and when you look at our performance, our mid and premium used vehicle categories, both increased in volume year over year which i think indicated the strength in demand in those price bands. what is clear to me, though, is that our year-over-year volume change, even though it was basically in line with the industry, i do believe we had some volume upside, which, frankly, we left on the table in the quarter. historically, about 40% of our sales have been in the entry category.
and clearly, that is a segment that's under pressure. we've already shown we can improve our mix, particularly in the mid-priced brands, and the teams are now very focused on that. and as i said, these segments increased year over year. now you may remember, during our last call, i talked about our focus on improving used margins.
and as you can imagine, i'm pleased with the progress we have made since the end of that quarter, and this continues to be a daily focus. our f&i teams continue to prove they are the best in the business with another strong performance this quarter. i think what is important to note is the main driver of our performance is the penetration we achieved with optional products such as service plans and extended warranty. and as a result, the announcement we made today regarding our agreement to acquire cig financial is not only complementary to what we're doing today, but will also, over time, bring significant upside.
in previous calls, i've made a point to talk about the structural changes we've made in our business. but in my opinion, i don't really think we get sufficient recognition for. and the first is our ability to generate used vehicles. i think this is a considerable strength and an advantage over some of our single-focused competitors.
during the quarter, we self-sourced either from trade, lease returns, or our very successful we'll buy your car program, over 90% of our used vehicle inventory. and this strength continues to put more of our destiny in our own hands. other areas of structural change include our aftersales operation, our intent to focus on our customers to create double-digit growth of 11% and aftersales gross profit, 11%, and this is part of our business that i think we have further upside in. in the past, we've also discussed our disciplined approach to cost management.
and as you can see again in these results, the benefit, this continues to bring to the business. moving on to autonation usa business. today, we announced our plans to open a new autonation usa store in georgia. this will happen in the third quarter.
this will be our 12th store. and just to remind everybody, our objective remains to have over 130 of these stores in operation from coast to coast by the end of 2026. as i briefly touched on earlier, today, we announced that we've entered into an agreement to acquire cig financial. and subject to normal closing conditions, we expect to close in the next 90 days.
the acquisition of cig financial aligns with our strategic business model and singular focus on personalized finance and mobility solutions that are easy, transparent and customer centric. this acquisition provides capabilities, footprint, technology and most importantly, a proven motivated team with great leadership. cig has everything we need to scale and improve our financial performance with modest upfront investment and little risk. while this is an important addition to our growth strategy, we have no present intention to displace or replace existing captive financing with our oem partners.
our intention is that we'll focus our new captive finance house on our autonation usa business, and the great book of business that cig has developed with its many retail partners. now, from an usa perspective, there's already a strong overlap from a fico point of view, from a geographic perspective, and the business development focus that has ensured the success and growth of cig over about the last two decades. this will be a great addition to the group. and as i mentioned earlier, well, over time, unlock significant upside in our already industry-leading f&i performance.
so i want to formally welcome 160 new members to the autonation family. i can tell you we have very much been looking forward to this day. and with that, joe, i will hand it over to you.
joe lower -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thank you, mike, and good morning, everyone. before i get into my prepared comments, i would like to welcome, derek, our new vice president of investor relations. i think he will be an excellent addition to our team and someone you will enjoy interacting with moving forward. now on to the results.
today, we reported second quarter total revenue of $6.9 billion, a decrease of 2% year-over-year driven by a 14% decline in new vehicle revenue due to the continuing supply chain disruption to new vehicle production. mitigating this decline was total used vehicle revenue growth of 13% and aftersales revenue growth of 9% year over year. strong consumer demand and tight new vehicle inventories continue to support new vehicle margins in the second quarter. we expect demand to continue to outpace supply into the back half of 2022.
additionally, as mike touched upon, our used vehicle margins improved sequentially from the inventory rebalancing efforts in the first quarter with total used pvr increasing by $349 per unit or up 22% when compared to the first quarter of this year. for the quarter, total variable gross profit decreased 2% year-over-year despite total variable pvr growing to $6,436 per unit or up 17%. our sustained strength in cfs product penetration and attachment rates helped drive this improvement. we also demonstrated strong growth in aftersales gross profit, which increased 11% year over year.
taken together, our total gross profit increased 3% compared to the second quarter of 2021. moving to costs. second quarter sg&a as a percentage of gross profit was 55.4%, a record low and a 110 basis point improvement compared to a year ago period. as measured against gross profit, compensation decreased to 190 basis points, advertising was essentially flat, and overhead was higher by 70 basis points, primarily reflecting investments in acquisitions and the expansion of an usa.
this overall improvement is the result of structural changes that we have made to our business model. taken together and combined with fewer shares outstanding, we reported net income of $376 million or $6.48 per share, a 34% increase year over year and an all-time quarterly earnings per share result. our operating performance and cash flow generation continue to remain strong with cash from operations totaling nearly $900 million for the first half of the year. this performance continues to provide a significant capacity to deploy capital.
to this end, we announced today an agreement to acquire cig financial, as mike referenced. we agreed to acquire the business for $85 million and assume certain liabilities, a portion of which will be repaid at closing. we are excited to add captive finance capabilities to this acquisition and look forward to working with the cig management team to grow and integrate the business into the autonation family. we also continue to invest capital to grow our business with the expansion of autonation usa and remain on target to operate over 130 stores by the end of 2026.
we also continue to repurchase our own shares. during the second quarter, we repurchased 3.7 million shares or 6% of shares outstanding for an aggregate purchase price of $404 million. further, we announced today that the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $1 billion of autonation common stock. as of july 19, there were approximately 56 million shares outstanding.
we ended the second quarter with total liquidity of approximately $2.1 billion, and our covenant leverage ratio of debt-to-ebitda of 1.5 times, remains well below our historical range of two times to three times. looking ahead, we will continue to focus on operational excellence and a disciplined capital allocation to drive long-term shareholder value. with that, i will turn the call back over to mike.
mike manley -- chief executive officer
yeah. thanks, joe. ankur, i think, let's get straight into q&a.
",":
operator
thank you. [operator instructions] our first question comes from the line of rajat gupta of j.p. morgan. your line is now open.
please go ahead.
rajat gupta -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
hi. good morning. thanks for taking the question. maybe a first one just on the captive finco, cig.
can you tell us a bit more about the company, what their customer or loan book looks like today? and maybe what is the integration time line we should be expecting? how is the accounting going to work? when can you see this moving the needle on earnings, etc. thanks, and i have a follow-up.
mike manley -- chief executive officer
joe?
joe lower -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
sure. let me give you -- rajat, good talking to you. let me just give a few points of reference and a little bit about our thoughts. so if you look at -- again, mike emphasized, our focus in this acquisition was on capabilities, was on a management team.
and specifically, frankly, we were not looking to acquire a big book of existing business. so the loan receivable today is just about $325 million, $300 million of that has already been securitized. so the residual is relatively modest. they originated about $195 million of loans last year, about 12,000 loans.
they have an existing large network of primarily independent dealerships, about 80 of which are independent. our intention is to continue to serve those institutions. and our integration plan is one that will be very deliberate. there's strong overlap in the credit profile, particularly within an usa.
they have a very strong, proven record in both underwriting and in servicing, which was a real attraction to us. and so obviously, our first focus is closing, which, as we indicated, we expect within the next 90 days. and then it will be a very deliberate integration focused initially on an usa that will roll out over the next 6, 12 months as we integrate that and looks to build the business in a prudent fashion in the context of our existing business.
rajat gupta -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
got it. great. great. thanks for the color.
maybe shifting gears. ford this morning announced their updated electric vehicle ambition. can you give us a sense of how the conversations are with ford and other oems on how these vehicles will be sold, the floor planning, invoicing, any implications for gpus? and relatedly, in your service base, what's the oem involvement looking like with respect to training, tooling facilities, technicians? and how far are you in that upgradation process? thanks.
mike manley -- chief executive officer
it's mike. well, i would tell you that obviously, we're having conversations with every oem and it's absolutely clear the transition is completely inevitable. our role in this, i think, is twofold. firstly, to not just use our size and strength to be a really strong partner for our oems.
but we also think that there's an opportunity to build out on our mobility side that we're focused on in tools to come in here, more about that as part of the business model that we're developing. so when i think about it, we're heavily working, and i'll take it chunk by chunk, and if i've missed something, then you can obviously redirect. from an infrastructure perspective, i've already talked about the fact that we're making significant investments to have buildings ready from a charging point of view. now that's going to create two things.
firstly, in each individual location, we will have opportunity for customers to charge that will create naturally our own network of charging stations effectively within autonation. and we are doing that in many instances, in line or in advance of some of the requirements. we're working already in terms of training because we recognize that the sale of an electric vehicle on paper looks as if it may go through the same steps, but the reality is, we think and we have experienced from talking to european dealers that have already had advanced experience with this, that the sales process itself is much more involved and much more educational. so we're making sure that we are trained both on the front end with our sale executives.
and we're at the very beginning of this and on the technician side as well. there's a lot of discussions about will service migrate. yeah, tell me when you've heard enough as well. but you can tell we're in big discussions because the fact of the matter is that the hurdles for the oems, i think, are high in terms of penetration rates.
they've got to reach by the time they get to 2026 and 2027. and the best way to get there is to be part of the solution for them and that's our intention. so.
rajat gupta -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
got it. great. that's helpful. maybe just last one on f&i.
obviously, we hear more around cig, and the impact to the finance business. but i just had a question on service contract penetration. it's gone up quite a bit since pre-covid. if you can give us a sense of where we are today? and how do you see that sustaining once consumers maybe start to get a little more disciplined with their spending? thanks.
joe lower -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thanks, rajat. well, candidly, we continue to see success primarily in the product side. and so if you look back historically, at one point, we often talked about 60% of the composition of our cfs being product that's now up above 70%. we see the penetration increasing on average in excess of two products per customer, and we see the profitability increasing as well.
so it appears from everything we see on really a sequential year-over-year basis, the demand continues to be strong because i think people see the value in it. we obviously are continuing to look at ways to continue to improve that portfolio. and as we mentioned, the acquisition of cig is just complementary to an already strong piece of business. so we see it as a very positive trend and one that is growing because the customer does see value in the offerings we have.
mike manley -- chief executive officer
and i'll just add just a couple of points on that. as we've talked about before, i think one of the biggest assets that autonation has is we have a very detailed and growing customer base of over 13 million customers. we know which of those customers are active. and as you can imagine, with predominantly franchise businesses, we would see a similar decay that you see in the industry as customers migrate to different channels.
what we are able to do in terms of that customer base is to use some of the offerings that joe talked about to retarget some of our customers and make sure they stay in our family with a known cost associated with it for their vehicles. so that represents a very partially tapped opportunity, and a great way to grow this business even further from the product side.
rajat gupta -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
understood. that makes sense. thanks a lot for all the color and good luck. i'll get back in the queue.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of john murphy of bank of america. your line is now open. please go ahead.
john murphy -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
good morning, guys. just three quick ones. first, on the cig acquisition. i'm just curious what kind of competition this may create for your existing lender partners? and if there're maybe any kind of pushback there? and ultimately, is this more of an autonation usa used vehicle underwriter or is this kind of a full-service company that you're intending to really build? and what kind of sort of size or penetration level do you think you'll get to a cig? is it sort of a 5%, 10%, 15%, 20% penetration of vehicles sold? i'm just curious how you're thinking about this.
mike manley -- chief executive officer
yes, we've been very clear internally as we thought about this, the focus initially for this organization is to be part of the growth story for autonation usa. as you know, our rollout plan for that business is aggressive. it's already growing significantly. i said we're going to open another store in the third quarter.
and when i think about the scale and overlap of this organization, it brings everything that we need for it to be a strong partner for the growth of an usa and let me say, non-cpo used vehicles. i think one of the things that i touched on before is our partnership with our oems and the use of their finance companies is going to continue and be a focus for us in our franchise business. this is a separate business line, and that will be -- that for sure will be our approach. and my view is that, we should be able to build to penetration levels of around 40% plus in an usa.
once we do two things, the first thing is today we have about a 70% coverage in terms of licenses and footprint. we're going to build that out in the balance of the year. and then the second thing is that we have a great partnership with existing businesses in an usa, which we will want to support. so as joe said, i think we've got a phenomenal asset that has the technology you want, which obviously is very scalable.
it has the experience, not just in terms of underwriting, but also securitization, which was important to us. it has the processes. it has been around through cycles because it's now 18, 19 years old from memory. so it has seen cycles.
and very importantly, it's got a great team of skilled people and great leadership, and all of that, as joe mentioned, comes at what i think is a really good entry ticket. so it is primed perfectly to scale with an usa initially. and then as things develop, we'll obviously talk about that in the future.
john murphy -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
ok, that's helpful. and then just a second question around sg&a. performance was very good in the quarter. it's been very good for a while.
i'm just curious, as volumes ultimately recover, whenever that is, probably late this year or sometime next year because of supply coming on, do you think you can hold sort of these levels in the mid-50s? or are we kind of going to drift back? and joe, you may have commented on this, i may have missed it earlier in the call, you are back to the sort of 60% range plus or minus. i mean what is sustainable on sg&a as a percent of gross. or is there a number that we should think about that's more of just an absolute dollar number to model going forward. it's just -- it's a big leverage point that's been very positive for a while.
mike manley -- chief executive officer
yeah. and that's, i think, as a result of joe and many of the leadership team in the business. this has been an incredible positive trend for the organization, really starting pre-covid. thankfully, i get the benefit of it being in place and it being a strategic focus.
one of the things i would say is if you look at our retail businesses and joe, i might be marginally off on my numbers, but correct me. if i look at the biggest cost in those business, which is obviously our biggest asset, our people, about 70%, 75% of that is variable. so as our business scales, a big portion of the cost in the business will scale in that nature. and that obviously also works if we do, at some point, hit a downturn in the opposite direction.
i think they're part of the business that represent opportunity for us. i've talked about aftersales and the fact that i would like to see improved penetration at the right time in the right leaderships. we will be adding resources into that on a more fixed basis. but i'm a great believer in, let's stretch the system first and then when we're fully confident that we're in the right direction to put the resource in.
so my expectation is you will see some slight growth as a percentage as we do some of that structural stuff. but joe is very, very focused to keeping it under that number he keeps talking about. so anything you want to add?
joe lower -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
i think you summarize it well. we're finding a balance. we have made structural changes to the business, which will clearly sustain through any changes in kind of the market, if you will. and we have a very fixated mindset on how we continue to leverage business.
so we are going to make investments, as mike indicated, that will cause a modest amount of pressure but i think you will see us on a very sustained basis, well below pre-pandemic levels.
john murphy -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
ok. and then just lastly, on the consumer, i mean, obviously, there's lots of crosscurrents and conflicting signals of the health of the consumer. you guys are dealing with these folks on a daily basis in your dealerships. i mean mike and joe, what do you -- i mean what would you call the health of your consumer? and if you were to kind of think about sort of your backlog of orders or wait times on vehicles, maybe you could give us some metrics or even anecdotal data to understand how tight the market is and how strong or not strong the consumer may be?
mike manley -- chief executive officer
yeah, i'll start on that. i think there are different pockets that i would talk about. if you take new vehicles across our three, let me call it, divisions of domestic, import and premium luxury. obviously, demand is strong, as we mentioned.
inventory levels still incredibly low, high turn rates and really sustained margins over the last few quarters. in the first quarter from memory, i reported something like 50% of our incoming three months inventory was sold. i would say that on the domestic side, that is now down to about 35%. and on imports, it is sustained.
and on premium, it is also largely sustained. and i think on the domestic side, it's really as a result of some improved flow that we saw, whether that continues or not, we will have to see because i think supply is still one of the big variables where we're not entirely stabilized, even stabilized at a lower level. on the used side, as i mentioned, our used volume was down. we weren't down as much as the industry was, but still i wasn't particularly pleased with that.
and when we look at that in detail, all of it is in sub-$20,000. and in fact, $20,000 to $45,000 is flat with high close rates, above $45,000 is still from a demand perspective, slightly up year over year and again, with high close rates. for us, historically, that $20,000 price range has been about 40% of the business, which is more really than you see in some of our competitors. i think we can rebalance and push some of that with a better performance in our mid-price brand and really trying to address what i think will be continued pressure on that price point.
we are seeing also the increased interest rate being passed on to consumers because that's obviously been a question that we've been asked. and i would guess about 50 basis points has been passed on at this moment in time. but to mitigate that, what we've also seen is the average length of loan has already extended by one month. now that may not seem a lot but that is the average length of loan across our portfolio.
so i think what's happening is, you're getting other levers pulled to keep monthly payments in balance, but notwithstanding that, as i said, there's pressure on sub-$20,000 vehicles, which i'm confident the team are very focused on, as i said, to change our mix so that we can mitigate some of the impact on us. joe, do you want to add any more flavor on that? obviously, on aftersales, very pleased. they're 15% up. i think miles driven has gone up and that combined with the focus of the team did help us there.
and i think that will continue for sure. sorry, joe, you were saying?
joe lower -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
no, i think -- and that's clearly driven by customer pay, which has done very well. and the only thing i would just put in context, and mike talked about the preorder levels just perspective, pre-pandemic, that was 5% to 10%. so we still are at extremely and are at extremely high levels, indicating both, i think, the demand as well as the reinforcing the availability. so hopefully, that provides some pretty color on some of the...
john murphy -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
so would it be fair to say that you see a tiny sequential erosion in the strength of the consumer, but the consumer is still wildly strong relative to pre-pandemic and sort of relative to supply. is that a fair way to characterize that?
joe lower -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
i think it is. i think that's very fair.
john murphy -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
ok. all right. thank you very much, guys. appreciate it.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of daniel imbro of stephens. your line is now open. please go ahead.
dan imbro -- stephens, inc. -- analyst
yeah. good morning, guys. thank you for taking our questions and congrats on the quarter. i wanted to follow up on the used business and really the trade-off between inventory and gpu.
after 4q, you guys sacrificed some gpu in 1q and you drove stronger comps. this quarter, it looks like comps you said were a little bit lighter than expected, but gpu stepped up, but we ended the day back at 40 days of supply. so i'm curious what is the optimal day supply you're targeting there? would you expect to work that back down in 3q, if you give back some gpu or kind of how are you thinking about that trade-off in this environment?
mike manley -- chief executive officer
yes. this is mark, daniel. for me, it's really simple. it's about your turn rate.
it's how fresh you're able to keep your day supply. so with the demand levels that we've got, i'm comfortable with where our day supply is right now. we constantly work on our, obviously, analytics to try and make sure that it's in the right place from both a price and a product and a geography perspective, but without incurring too much logistics costs. we mentioned in q1 one of the things that we were working on was actually aging because we have pockets of aging, which we completely removed in q1, and we've got the benefit of, i would say, fresher inventory in q2 that's going to flow over now into q3.
and in fact, if we look at the momentum, we ended q2 where it continued so far into the month. but obviously, that is the biggest focus. and i think sequential comps are more limited this year rather than year-over-year comps because last year, we were -- as you know, we were in a very unusual situation where used car prices were actually increasing. so the value of the inventory on our lots was going up.
and obviously, the cost was fixed. and therefore, our margins found above as a result of that. we're not in the same dynamic now. we're seeing a more traditional, even though slightly delayed movement of prices both up and down in the used market.
i'm saying much more traditional than a year ago.
dan imbro -- stephens, inc. -- analyst
that's helpful. and then maybe moving to the new side. i had a question just on the supply backdrop. within premium luxury, you guys have decent exposure to some of those german brands.
are you hearing anything from them around how this energy shortage potential issue is going to impact production? seeing headlines of 15% national reductions in energy use. could that be another headwind to vehicle production and inventory building or any change in visibility from those oem partners?
mike manley -- chief executive officer
no. is it enough?
dan imbro -- stephens, inc. -- analyst
and then last follow-up on cig. it sounds like it's small today but growing. as this grows, will it tie up more capital as you build the loan book? and does that impact your ability to do share repurchase or deploy capital in other parts of the business? what are the capital needs of that as it grows?
mike manley -- chief executive officer
well, firstly, it is interesting. we spent some time talking about how we think people should think about the scale with regard to this. what we did want to do is a big book. we bought all of the capability needed, right? and a relatively low entry ticket that comes with low risk.
so i think about scale, we bought in a very different way. what we wanted, as i said, was proven team, capability, technology, experience, been through the cycles with great coverage that matches ours at the lowest possible entry ticket because we're obviously very focused on capital deployment. and i think joe and the teams did a great job, frankly. joe, do you want to take the technology question?
joe lower -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes, i guess, i would refer to a number of points we've tried to make in the course of this call and the announcement that kind of hopefully indicate a little bit of our intention. one, mike has obviously reinforced the size of the book, also reinforced their ability to have a proven securitization process. we would fully intend to do that to minimize the amount of capital that we're deploying. we also were very deliberate in the share repurchase announcement, which hopefully reinforces our commitment to a balanced deployment.
and obviously, share repurchase has been very valuable to us, i think, very much appreciated by our shareholders, and we continue to have that balanced approach going forward. so i don't expect to see significant changes in that.
dan imbro -- stephens, inc. -- analyst
that's great. mike, joe, thanks for the color and best of luck going forward.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of evan silverman of morgan stanley. your line is now open. please go ahead.
adam jonas -- morgan stanley -- analyst
hey, it's adam jonas actually on for evan. i believe it's silverberg, but i like silverman, that sounds nice. how's everybody? i just got a couple of questions. mike, i'm curious what percentage of your sales across all your stores are preordered right now and how that's trended? and i'd love any color on where you see the -- that order to delivery time.
are your customers having to wait longer than they did a few months ago? shorter? or is it kind of stabilized in terms of that order to delivery time?
joe lower -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
actually adam, we're going to do the same as you did in your intro. it's actually joe on for mike. hey, adam. how are you? 
adam jonas -- morgan stanley -- analyst
hey, joe. you don't sound like mike. but anyway, how are you.
joe lower -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
i'm working on the exit. so let me give you some perspective on the buckets in the preorder and then i'll give you a little bit whatever i can on the timing. so preorder, if you go back, domestic q1, we said it was about 50%. and as mike referenced, that's probably 35% to 40%, that was going to vary.
but again, you see a little bit of contraction there. import, we mentioned q1 was 50% it's about 50% today. so we really have not seen a significant deterioration there. luxury was up 70% at q1.
it's 60%, 65%, i mean it's in range down just a tick. and as i mentioned and as you know, those are all significantly above kind of pre-pandemic levels. so again, demand remains. i think the comment made earlier, it may be slight downtick, but still remarkable in the absolute sense.
as far as delivery times, i would say, and it's obviously going to vary, not just by brand and by model. i would say there's been some slight improvement. but nothing that i would want to highlight and probably feel longer than people appreciate. so have not seen a notable change there that i would want to call out.
mike manley -- chief executive officer
adam, i just want to add one thing. if you look at our closing inventory sequentially, it's up slightly. and that when you dig into it, it was purely a timing thing from our perspective because we've got some inventory delivered to our dealerships that there was not enough time for us to prep them properly, get them prepared and get them out to our customers. i can tell you that, they were delivered very early in the following months.
so i don't think anything really to read into that at this moment. and if it changes, obviously, in the next call, we can talk about it.
adam jonas -- morgan stanley -- analyst
great. mike, i just want to follow up. you can take a stab at it, you can give it to joe, do whatever you want. but given your experience at the oems, i would value your insight, your margins and margins of your peers on the new have kind of round number tripled over the last couple of years.
the operating margins in north america of the producers of the vehicles have been kind of stable, maybe up a bit. so why aren't the oems increasing invoice prices? when i talk to dealers and i said, why don't these guys -- why don't the oems got to pay a massive uaw bill next year, it's going to be like a historic increase. you guys are crushing it. they're kind of hanging on.
they're going to start cutting tabs soon. why aren't they take -- why aren't they kind of repricing some of the stuff on those preorders. and the answer i tend to get is they don't know what they're doing. they can't do it or there's like a wall or just they're not organized enough.
i don't really buy that, but i'd love your view, mike, what's going on or are they repricing a bit?
mike manley -- chief executive officer
well, what i see is something slightly different. the net price back to them has increased because of the work that they've been doing on the incentive front. and my -- the last time i looked to that, a couple of things have happened. so a lot of the incentive subsidies on leases has not been completely taken away, but it's been reset effectively increasing our lease msrp.
and a number of the programs that we're supporting retail business were also either reduced or removed and increased the net price back to the oems. that should be pretty easy number to look at. that's the first place that i would go to, but that's my view. i think what they did was they took the opportunity to reset the net transaction price of their vehicles, which will have a consequential impact on the residual values and that under long-term is a very strong move from the oems, notwithstanding your point is well made regarding some of the costs that are going to hit the business.
so i haven't looked at it in that detail from their point of view in a couple of months, but next time you're in town we're going to look at it together.
adam jonas -- morgan stanley -- analyst
look forward to that. thanks, mike. thanks, joe.
operator
thank you. that's all the questions we've got time for now. so i'd like to hand the conference over to mr. manley this time for closing remarks.
mike manley -- chief executive officer
great. thank you. and again, thanks for your time and thanks for coming to the call. i really just want to end with one of the comments that i made.
it's great for joe and i to be able to come and talk about a record quarter. and the fact of the matter is with the large number of dealers that we -- dealerships that we've got and the large group of people that are working every day, it's down to them. so i'm actually going to end by thanking them again. all of the 22,000 people that work at autonation.
i think notwithstanding the fact that obviously, there are things that have been happening in the industry and the economy. this is the eighth consecutive record quarter for the team. and that deserves my recognition every single day. so i know a lot of the guys and girls are listening to this.
i want to thank you for your commitment to our customers, each other and particularly the communities with our drive pink campaign and thank you for what you do. let's keep it going.

operator
good morning. my name is candice, and i will be your conference operator today. at this time, i would like to welcome you to the autonation second quarter 2022 earnings conference call. [operator instructions] i would now like to turn the call over to ankur shah, director of investor relations.
you may now begin your conference.
ankur shah -- director, investor relations
good morning and welcome to the autonation's second quarter 2022 conference call and webcast. please ensure that your lines are muted until the operator announces your turn to ask a question. leading our call today will be mike manley, our chief executive officer; and joe lower, our chief financial officer. also joining the call is derek fiebig, vice president of investor relations.
following their remarks, we will open up the call for questions. we will be available by phone after the call to address any additional questions you may have. before beginning, let me read our brief statement regarding forward-looking comments. certain statements and information on this call, including any statements regarding our anticipated financial results and objectives constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal private securities litigation reform act of 1995.
such forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks that may cause our actual results or performance to differ materially from such forward-looking statements. additional discussions of factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially are contained in our press release issued earlier today and our sec filings, including our most recent annual report on form 10-k, subsequent quarterly reports on form 10-q and current reports on form 8-k. with that, i'll turn the call over to autonation's chief executive officer, mike manley. 
mike manley -- chief executive officer
thanks, ankur. good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. firstly, i really do want to just spend a little bit of time to thank all of the team at autonation. we're continuing to deliver great results in the quarter, which obviously enabled joe and i to report another record performance.
as usual, joe is going to take you through the numbers in detail, and i'll begin with a general overview of performance. so from a substantially flat year-over-year revenue of $6.9 billion, we were able to increase our operating income by 5% to $558 million, which, as i already mentioned, is a record for the group. our earnings per share for the quarter was also a record of $6.48, a year-over-year increase of 34%. as you can see, total new volume was down 25%, which when you consider our low level of new inventory and our high inventory turn rates was, in my view, purely a result of continued constrained supply.
as you can see, volume was substantially offset with strong margins up 47% compared to the prior year and stable quarter over quarter. again, i think an indication that demand for new vehicles remains strong. used revenue in the quarter was 13% above the prior year. however, from a volume perspective, total used sales were down 4% and down 9% on a same-store basis.
and all of the volume reduction was in our entry selection of vehicles which are priced at $20,000 and below. and when you look at our performance, our mid and premium used vehicle categories, both increased in volume year over year which i think indicated the strength in demand in those price bands. what is clear to me, though, is that our year-over-year volume change, even though it was basically in line with the industry, i do believe we had some volume upside, which, frankly, we left on the table in the quarter. historically, about 40% of our sales have been in the entry category.
and clearly, that is a segment that's under pressure. we've already shown we can improve our mix, particularly in the mid-priced brands, and the teams are now very focused on that. and as i said, these segments increased year over year. now you may remember, during our last call, i talked about our focus on improving used margins.
and as you can imagine, i'm pleased with the progress we have made since the end of that quarter, and this continues to be a daily focus. our f&i teams continue to prove they are the best in the business with another strong performance this quarter. i think what is important to note is the main driver of our performance is the penetration we achieved with optional products such as service plans and extended warranty. and as a result, the announcement we made today regarding our agreement to acquire cig financial is not only complementary to what we're doing today, but will also, over time, bring significant upside.
in previous calls, i've made a point to talk about the structural changes we've made in our business. but in my opinion, i don't really think we get sufficient recognition for. and the first is our ability to generate used vehicles. i think this is a considerable strength and an advantage over some of our single-focused competitors.
during the quarter, we self-sourced either from trade, lease returns, or our very successful we'll buy your car program, over 90% of our used vehicle inventory. and this strength continues to put more of our destiny in our own hands. other areas of structural change include our aftersales operation, our intent to focus on our customers to create double-digit growth of 11% and aftersales gross profit, 11%, and this is part of our business that i think we have further upside in. in the past, we've also discussed our disciplined approach to cost management.
and as you can see again in these results, the benefit, this continues to bring to the business. moving on to autonation usa business. today, we announced our plans to open a new autonation usa store in georgia. this will happen in the third quarter.
this will be our 12th store. and just to remind everybody, our objective remains to have over 130 of these stores in operation from coast to coast by the end of 2026. as i briefly touched on earlier, today, we announced that we've entered into an agreement to acquire cig financial. and subject to normal closing conditions, we expect to close in the next 90 days.
the acquisition of cig financial aligns with our strategic business model and singular focus on personalized finance and mobility solutions that are easy, transparent and customer centric. this acquisition provides capabilities, footprint, technology and most importantly, a proven motivated team with great leadership. cig has everything we need to scale and improve our financial performance with modest upfront investment and little risk. while this is an important addition to our growth strategy, we have no present intention to displace or replace existing captive financing with our oem partners.
our intention is that we'll focus our new captive finance house on our autonation usa business, and the great book of business that cig has developed with its many retail partners. now, from an usa perspective, there's already a strong overlap from a fico point of view, from a geographic perspective, and the business development focus that has ensured the success and growth of cig over about the last two decades. this will be a great addition to the group. and as i mentioned earlier, well, over time, unlock significant upside in our already industry-leading f&i performance.
so i want to formally welcome 160 new members to the autonation family. i can tell you we have very much been looking forward to this day. and with that, joe, i will hand it over to you.
joe lower -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thank you, mike, and good morning, everyone. before i get into my prepared comments, i would like to welcome, derek, our new vice president of investor relations. i think he will be an excellent addition to our team and someone you will enjoy interacting with moving forward. now on to the results.
today, we reported second quarter total revenue of $6.9 billion, a decrease of 2% year-over-year driven by a 14% decline in new vehicle revenue due to the continuing supply chain disruption to new vehicle production. mitigating this decline was total used vehicle revenue growth of 13% and aftersales revenue growth of 9% year over year. strong consumer demand and tight new vehicle inventories continue to support new vehicle margins in the second quarter. we expect demand to continue to outpace supply into the back half of 2022.
additionally, as mike touched upon, our used vehicle margins improved sequentially from the inventory rebalancing efforts in the first quarter with total used pvr increasing by $349 per unit or up 22% when compared to the first quarter of this year. for the quarter, total variable gross profit decreased 2% year-over-year despite total variable pvr growing to $6,436 per unit or up 17%. our sustained strength in cfs product penetration and attachment rates helped drive this improvement. we also demonstrated strong growth in aftersales gross profit, which increased 11% year over year.
taken together, our total gross profit increased 3% compared to the second quarter of 2021. moving to costs. second quarter sg&a as a percentage of gross profit was 55.4%, a record low and a 110 basis point improvement compared to a year ago period. as measured against gross profit, compensation decreased to 190 basis points, advertising was essentially flat, and overhead was higher by 70 basis points, primarily reflecting investments in acquisitions and the expansion of an usa.
this overall improvement is the result of structural changes that we have made to our business model. taken together and combined with fewer shares outstanding, we reported net income of $376 million or $6.48 per share, a 34% increase year over year and an all-time quarterly earnings per share result. our operating performance and cash flow generation continue to remain strong with cash from operations totaling nearly $900 million for the first half of the year. this performance continues to provide a significant capacity to deploy capital.
to this end, we announced today an agreement to acquire cig financial, as mike referenced. we agreed to acquire the business for $85 million and assume certain liabilities, a portion of which will be repaid at closing. we are excited to add captive finance capabilities to this acquisition and look forward to working with the cig management team to grow and integrate the business into the autonation family. we also continue to invest capital to grow our business with the expansion of autonation usa and remain on target to operate over 130 stores by the end of 2026.
we also continue to repurchase our own shares. during the second quarter, we repurchased 3.7 million shares or 6% of shares outstanding for an aggregate purchase price of $404 million. further, we announced today that the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $1 billion of autonation common stock. as of july 19, there were approximately 56 million shares outstanding.
we ended the second quarter with total liquidity of approximately $2.1 billion, and our covenant leverage ratio of debt-to-ebitda of 1.5 times, remains well below our historical range of two times to three times. looking ahead, we will continue to focus on operational excellence and a disciplined capital allocation to drive long-term shareholder value. with that, i will turn the call back over to mike.
mike manley -- chief executive officer
yeah. thanks, joe. ankur, i think, let's get straight into q&a.
",":
operator
thank you. [operator instructions] our first question comes from the line of rajat gupta of j.p. morgan. your line is now open.
please go ahead.
rajat gupta -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
hi. good morning. thanks for taking the question. maybe a first one just on the captive finco, cig.
can you tell us a bit more about the company, what their customer or loan book looks like today? and maybe what is the integration time line we should be expecting? how is the accounting going to work? when can you see this moving the needle on earnings, etc. thanks, and i have a follow-up.
mike manley -- chief executive officer
joe?
joe lower -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
sure. let me give you -- rajat, good talking to you. let me just give a few points of reference and a little bit about our thoughts. so if you look at -- again, mike emphasized, our focus in this acquisition was on capabilities, was on a management team.
and specifically, frankly, we were not looking to acquire a big book of existing business. so the loan receivable today is just about $325 million, $300 million of that has already been securitized. so the residual is relatively modest. they originated about $195 million of loans last year, about 12,000 loans.
they have an existing large network of primarily independent dealerships, about 80 of which are independent. our intention is to continue to serve those institutions. and our integration plan is one that will be very deliberate. there's strong overlap in the credit profile, particularly within an usa.
they have a very strong, proven record in both underwriting and in servicing, which was a real attraction to us. and so obviously, our first focus is closing, which, as we indicated, we expect within the next 90 days. and then it will be a very deliberate integration focused initially on an usa that will roll out over the next 6, 12 months as we integrate that and looks to build the business in a prudent fashion in the context of our existing business.
rajat gupta -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
got it. great. great. thanks for the color.
maybe shifting gears. ford this morning announced their updated electric vehicle ambition. can you give us a sense of how the conversations are with ford and other oems on how these vehicles will be sold, the floor planning, invoicing, any implications for gpus? and relatedly, in your service base, what's the oem involvement looking like with respect to training, tooling facilities, technicians? and how far are you in that upgradation process? thanks.
mike manley -- chief executive officer
it's mike. well, i would tell you that obviously, we're having conversations with every oem and it's absolutely clear the transition is completely inevitable. our role in this, i think, is twofold. firstly, to not just use our size and strength to be a really strong partner for our oems.
but we also think that there's an opportunity to build out on our mobility side that we're focused on in tools to come in here, more about that as part of the business model that we're developing. so when i think about it, we're heavily working, and i'll take it chunk by chunk, and if i've missed something, then you can obviously redirect. from an infrastructure perspective, i've already talked about the fact that we're making significant investments to have buildings ready from a charging point of view. now that's going to create two things.
firstly, in each individual location, we will have opportunity for customers to charge that will create naturally our own network of charging stations effectively within autonation. and we are doing that in many instances, in line or in advance of some of the requirements. we're working already in terms of training because we recognize that the sale of an electric vehicle on paper looks as if it may go through the same steps, but the reality is, we think and we have experienced from talking to european dealers that have already had advanced experience with this, that the sales process itself is much more involved and much more educational. so we're making sure that we are trained both on the front end with our sale executives.
and we're at the very beginning of this and on the technician side as well. there's a lot of discussions about will service migrate. yeah, tell me when you've heard enough as well. but you can tell we're in big discussions because the fact of the matter is that the hurdles for the oems, i think, are high in terms of penetration rates.
they've got to reach by the time they get to 2026 and 2027. and the best way to get there is to be part of the solution for them and that's our intention. so.
rajat gupta -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
got it. great. that's helpful. maybe just last one on f&i.
obviously, we hear more around cig, and the impact to the finance business. but i just had a question on service contract penetration. it's gone up quite a bit since pre-covid. if you can give us a sense of where we are today? and how do you see that sustaining once consumers maybe start to get a little more disciplined with their spending? thanks.
joe lower -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thanks, rajat. well, candidly, we continue to see success primarily in the product side. and so if you look back historically, at one point, we often talked about 60% of the composition of our cfs being product that's now up above 70%. we see the penetration increasing on average in excess of two products per customer, and we see the profitability increasing as well.
so it appears from everything we see on really a sequential year-over-year basis, the demand continues to be strong because i think people see the value in it. we obviously are continuing to look at ways to continue to improve that portfolio. and as we mentioned, the acquisition of cig is just complementary to an already strong piece of business. so we see it as a very positive trend and one that is growing because the customer does see value in the offerings we have.
mike manley -- chief executive officer
and i'll just add just a couple of points on that. as we've talked about before, i think one of the biggest assets that autonation has is we have a very detailed and growing customer base of over 13 million customers. we know which of those customers are active. and as you can imagine, with predominantly franchise businesses, we would see a similar decay that you see in the industry as customers migrate to different channels.
what we are able to do in terms of that customer base is to use some of the offerings that joe talked about to retarget some of our customers and make sure they stay in our family with a known cost associated with it for their vehicles. so that represents a very partially tapped opportunity, and a great way to grow this business even further from the product side.
rajat gupta -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
understood. that makes sense. thanks a lot for all the color and good luck. i'll get back in the queue.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of john murphy of bank of america. your line is now open. please go ahead.
john murphy -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
good morning, guys. just three quick ones. first, on the cig acquisition. i'm just curious what kind of competition this may create for your existing lender partners? and if there're maybe any kind of pushback there? and ultimately, is this more of an autonation usa used vehicle underwriter or is this kind of a full-service company that you're intending to really build? and what kind of sort of size or penetration level do you think you'll get to a cig? is it sort of a 5%, 10%, 15%, 20% penetration of vehicles sold? i'm just curious how you're thinking about this.
mike manley -- chief executive officer
yes, we've been very clear internally as we thought about this, the focus initially for this organization is to be part of the growth story for autonation usa. as you know, our rollout plan for that business is aggressive. it's already growing significantly. i said we're going to open another store in the third quarter.
and when i think about the scale and overlap of this organization, it brings everything that we need for it to be a strong partner for the growth of an usa and let me say, non-cpo used vehicles. i think one of the things that i touched on before is our partnership with our oems and the use of their finance companies is going to continue and be a focus for us in our franchise business. this is a separate business line, and that will be -- that for sure will be our approach. and my view is that, we should be able to build to penetration levels of around 40% plus in an usa.
once we do two things, the first thing is today we have about a 70% coverage in terms of licenses and footprint. we're going to build that out in the balance of the year. and then the second thing is that we have a great partnership with existing businesses in an usa, which we will want to support. so as joe said, i think we've got a phenomenal asset that has the technology you want, which obviously is very scalable.
it has the experience, not just in terms of underwriting, but also securitization, which was important to us. it has the processes. it has been around through cycles because it's now 18, 19 years old from memory. so it has seen cycles.
and very importantly, it's got a great team of skilled people and great leadership, and all of that, as joe mentioned, comes at what i think is a really good entry ticket. so it is primed perfectly to scale with an usa initially. and then as things develop, we'll obviously talk about that in the future.
john murphy -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
ok, that's helpful. and then just a second question around sg&a. performance was very good in the quarter. it's been very good for a while.
i'm just curious, as volumes ultimately recover, whenever that is, probably late this year or sometime next year because of supply coming on, do you think you can hold sort of these levels in the mid-50s? or are we kind of going to drift back? and joe, you may have commented on this, i may have missed it earlier in the call, you are back to the sort of 60% range plus or minus. i mean what is sustainable on sg&a as a percent of gross. or is there a number that we should think about that's more of just an absolute dollar number to model going forward. it's just -- it's a big leverage point that's been very positive for a while.
mike manley -- chief executive officer
yeah. and that's, i think, as a result of joe and many of the leadership team in the business. this has been an incredible positive trend for the organization, really starting pre-covid. thankfully, i get the benefit of it being in place and it being a strategic focus.
one of the things i would say is if you look at our retail businesses and joe, i might be marginally off on my numbers, but correct me. if i look at the biggest cost in those business, which is obviously our biggest asset, our people, about 70%, 75% of that is variable. so as our business scales, a big portion of the cost in the business will scale in that nature. and that obviously also works if we do, at some point, hit a downturn in the opposite direction.
i think they're part of the business that represent opportunity for us. i've talked about aftersales and the fact that i would like to see improved penetration at the right time in the right leaderships. we will be adding resources into that on a more fixed basis. but i'm a great believer in, let's stretch the system first and then when we're fully confident that we're in the right direction to put the resource in.
so my expectation is you will see some slight growth as a percentage as we do some of that structural stuff. but joe is very, very focused to keeping it under that number he keeps talking about. so anything you want to add?
joe lower -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
i think you summarize it well. we're finding a balance. we have made structural changes to the business, which will clearly sustain through any changes in kind of the market, if you will. and we have a very fixated mindset on how we continue to leverage business.
so we are going to make investments, as mike indicated, that will cause a modest amount of pressure but i think you will see us on a very sustained basis, well below pre-pandemic levels.
john murphy -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
ok. and then just lastly, on the consumer, i mean, obviously, there's lots of crosscurrents and conflicting signals of the health of the consumer. you guys are dealing with these folks on a daily basis in your dealerships. i mean mike and joe, what do you -- i mean what would you call the health of your consumer? and if you were to kind of think about sort of your backlog of orders or wait times on vehicles, maybe you could give us some metrics or even anecdotal data to understand how tight the market is and how strong or not strong the consumer may be?
mike manley -- chief executive officer
yeah, i'll start on that. i think there are different pockets that i would talk about. if you take new vehicles across our three, let me call it, divisions of domestic, import and premium luxury. obviously, demand is strong, as we mentioned.
inventory levels still incredibly low, high turn rates and really sustained margins over the last few quarters. in the first quarter from memory, i reported something like 50% of our incoming three months inventory was sold. i would say that on the domestic side, that is now down to about 35%. and on imports, it is sustained.
and on premium, it is also largely sustained. and i think on the domestic side, it's really as a result of some improved flow that we saw, whether that continues or not, we will have to see because i think supply is still one of the big variables where we're not entirely stabilized, even stabilized at a lower level. on the used side, as i mentioned, our used volume was down. we weren't down as much as the industry was, but still i wasn't particularly pleased with that.
and when we look at that in detail, all of it is in sub-$20,000. and in fact, $20,000 to $45,000 is flat with high close rates, above $45,000 is still from a demand perspective, slightly up year over year and again, with high close rates. for us, historically, that $20,000 price range has been about 40% of the business, which is more really than you see in some of our competitors. i think we can rebalance and push some of that with a better performance in our mid-price brand and really trying to address what i think will be continued pressure on that price point.
we are seeing also the increased interest rate being passed on to consumers because that's obviously been a question that we've been asked. and i would guess about 50 basis points has been passed on at this moment in time. but to mitigate that, what we've also seen is the average length of loan has already extended by one month. now that may not seem a lot but that is the average length of loan across our portfolio.
so i think what's happening is, you're getting other levers pulled to keep monthly payments in balance, but notwithstanding that, as i said, there's pressure on sub-$20,000 vehicles, which i'm confident the team are very focused on, as i said, to change our mix so that we can mitigate some of the impact on us. joe, do you want to add any more flavor on that? obviously, on aftersales, very pleased. they're 15% up. i think miles driven has gone up and that combined with the focus of the team did help us there.
and i think that will continue for sure. sorry, joe, you were saying?
joe lower -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
no, i think -- and that's clearly driven by customer pay, which has done very well. and the only thing i would just put in context, and mike talked about the preorder levels just perspective, pre-pandemic, that was 5% to 10%. so we still are at extremely and are at extremely high levels, indicating both, i think, the demand as well as the reinforcing the availability. so hopefully, that provides some pretty color on some of the...
john murphy -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
so would it be fair to say that you see a tiny sequential erosion in the strength of the consumer, but the consumer is still wildly strong relative to pre-pandemic and sort of relative to supply. is that a fair way to characterize that?
joe lower -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
i think it is. i think that's very fair.
john murphy -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
ok. all right. thank you very much, guys. appreciate it.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of daniel imbro of stephens. your line is now open. please go ahead.
dan imbro -- stephens, inc. -- analyst
yeah. good morning, guys. thank you for taking our questions and congrats on the quarter. i wanted to follow up on the used business and really the trade-off between inventory and gpu.
after 4q, you guys sacrificed some gpu in 1q and you drove stronger comps. this quarter, it looks like comps you said were a little bit lighter than expected, but gpu stepped up, but we ended the day back at 40 days of supply. so i'm curious what is the optimal day supply you're targeting there? would you expect to work that back down in 3q, if you give back some gpu or kind of how are you thinking about that trade-off in this environment?
mike manley -- chief executive officer
yes. this is mark, daniel. for me, it's really simple. it's about your turn rate.
it's how fresh you're able to keep your day supply. so with the demand levels that we've got, i'm comfortable with where our day supply is right now. we constantly work on our, obviously, analytics to try and make sure that it's in the right place from both a price and a product and a geography perspective, but without incurring too much logistics costs. we mentioned in q1 one of the things that we were working on was actually aging because we have pockets of aging, which we completely removed in q1, and we've got the benefit of, i would say, fresher inventory in q2 that's going to flow over now into q3.
and in fact, if we look at the momentum, we ended q2 where it continued so far into the month. but obviously, that is the biggest focus. and i think sequential comps are more limited this year rather than year-over-year comps because last year, we were -- as you know, we were in a very unusual situation where used car prices were actually increasing. so the value of the inventory on our lots was going up.
and obviously, the cost was fixed. and therefore, our margins found above as a result of that. we're not in the same dynamic now. we're seeing a more traditional, even though slightly delayed movement of prices both up and down in the used market.
i'm saying much more traditional than a year ago.
dan imbro -- stephens, inc. -- analyst
that's helpful. and then maybe moving to the new side. i had a question just on the supply backdrop. within premium luxury, you guys have decent exposure to some of those german brands.
are you hearing anything from them around how this energy shortage potential issue is going to impact production? seeing headlines of 15% national reductions in energy use. could that be another headwind to vehicle production and inventory building or any change in visibility from those oem partners?
mike manley -- chief executive officer
no. is it enough?
dan imbro -- stephens, inc. -- analyst
and then last follow-up on cig. it sounds like it's small today but growing. as this grows, will it tie up more capital as you build the loan book? and does that impact your ability to do share repurchase or deploy capital in other parts of the business? what are the capital needs of that as it grows?
mike manley -- chief executive officer
well, firstly, it is interesting. we spent some time talking about how we think people should think about the scale with regard to this. what we did want to do is a big book. we bought all of the capability needed, right? and a relatively low entry ticket that comes with low risk.
so i think about scale, we bought in a very different way. what we wanted, as i said, was proven team, capability, technology, experience, been through the cycles with great coverage that matches ours at the lowest possible entry ticket because we're obviously very focused on capital deployment. and i think joe and the teams did a great job, frankly. joe, do you want to take the technology question?
joe lower -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes, i guess, i would refer to a number of points we've tried to make in the course of this call and the announcement that kind of hopefully indicate a little bit of our intention. one, mike has obviously reinforced the size of the book, also reinforced their ability to have a proven securitization process. we would fully intend to do that to minimize the amount of capital that we're deploying. we also were very deliberate in the share repurchase announcement, which hopefully reinforces our commitment to a balanced deployment.
and obviously, share repurchase has been very valuable to us, i think, very much appreciated by our shareholders, and we continue to have that balanced approach going forward. so i don't expect to see significant changes in that.
dan imbro -- stephens, inc. -- analyst
that's great. mike, joe, thanks for the color and best of luck going forward.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of evan silverman of morgan stanley. your line is now open. please go ahead.
adam jonas -- morgan stanley -- analyst
hey, it's adam jonas actually on for evan. i believe it's silverberg, but i like silverman, that sounds nice. how's everybody? i just got a couple of questions. mike, i'm curious what percentage of your sales across all your stores are preordered right now and how that's trended? and i'd love any color on where you see the -- that order to delivery time.
are your customers having to wait longer than they did a few months ago? shorter? or is it kind of stabilized in terms of that order to delivery time?
joe lower -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
actually adam, we're going to do the same as you did in your intro. it's actually joe on for mike. hey, adam. how are you? 
adam jonas -- morgan stanley -- analyst
hey, joe. you don't sound like mike. but anyway, how are you.
joe lower -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
i'm working on the exit. so let me give you some perspective on the buckets in the preorder and then i'll give you a little bit whatever i can on the timing. so preorder, if you go back, domestic q1, we said it was about 50%. and as mike referenced, that's probably 35% to 40%, that was going to vary.
but again, you see a little bit of contraction there. import, we mentioned q1 was 50% it's about 50% today. so we really have not seen a significant deterioration there. luxury was up 70% at q1.
it's 60%, 65%, i mean it's in range down just a tick. and as i mentioned and as you know, those are all significantly above kind of pre-pandemic levels. so again, demand remains. i think the comment made earlier, it may be slight downtick, but still remarkable in the absolute sense.
as far as delivery times, i would say, and it's obviously going to vary, not just by brand and by model. i would say there's been some slight improvement. but nothing that i would want to highlight and probably feel longer than people appreciate. so have not seen a notable change there that i would want to call out.
mike manley -- chief executive officer
adam, i just want to add one thing. if you look at our closing inventory sequentially, it's up slightly. and that when you dig into it, it was purely a timing thing from our perspective because we've got some inventory delivered to our dealerships that there was not enough time for us to prep them properly, get them prepared and get them out to our customers. i can tell you that, they were delivered very early in the following months.
so i don't think anything really to read into that at this moment. and if it changes, obviously, in the next call, we can talk about it.
adam jonas -- morgan stanley -- analyst
great. mike, i just want to follow up. you can take a stab at it, you can give it to joe, do whatever you want. but given your experience at the oems, i would value your insight, your margins and margins of your peers on the new have kind of round number tripled over the last couple of years.
the operating margins in north america of the producers of the vehicles have been kind of stable, maybe up a bit. so why aren't the oems increasing invoice prices? when i talk to dealers and i said, why don't these guys -- why don't the oems got to pay a massive uaw bill next year, it's going to be like a historic increase. you guys are crushing it. they're kind of hanging on.
they're going to start cutting tabs soon. why aren't they take -- why aren't they kind of repricing some of the stuff on those preorders. and the answer i tend to get is they don't know what they're doing. they can't do it or there's like a wall or just they're not organized enough.
i don't really buy that, but i'd love your view, mike, what's going on or are they repricing a bit?
mike manley -- chief executive officer
well, what i see is something slightly different. the net price back to them has increased because of the work that they've been doing on the incentive front. and my -- the last time i looked to that, a couple of things have happened. so a lot of the incentive subsidies on leases has not been completely taken away, but it's been reset effectively increasing our lease msrp.
and a number of the programs that we're supporting retail business were also either reduced or removed and increased the net price back to the oems. that should be pretty easy number to look at. that's the first place that i would go to, but that's my view. i think what they did was they took the opportunity to reset the net transaction price of their vehicles, which will have a consequential impact on the residual values and that under long-term is a very strong move from the oems, notwithstanding your point is well made regarding some of the costs that are going to hit the business.
so i haven't looked at it in that detail from their point of view in a couple of months, but next time you're in town we're going to look at it together.
adam jonas -- morgan stanley -- analyst
look forward to that. thanks, mike. thanks, joe.
operator
thank you. that's all the questions we've got time for now. so i'd like to hand the conference over to mr. manley this time for closing remarks.
mike manley -- chief executive officer
great. thank you. and again, thanks for your time and thanks for coming to the call. i really just want to end with one of the comments that i made.
it's great for joe and i to be able to come and talk about a record quarter. and the fact of the matter is with the large number of dealers that we -- dealerships that we've got and the large group of people that are working every day, it's down to them. so i'm actually going to end by thanking them again. all of the 22,000 people that work at autonation.
i think notwithstanding the fact that obviously, there are things that have been happening in the industry and the economy. this is the eighth consecutive record quarter for the team. and that deserves my recognition every single day. so i know a lot of the guys and girls are listening to this.
i want to thank you for your commitment to our customers, each other and particularly the communities with our drive pink campaign and thank you for what you do. let's keep it going.
