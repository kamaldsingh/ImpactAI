ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. welcome to the at&t 4q 2020 earnings call. [operator instructions] as a reminder, this conference is being recorded. i would now like to turn the conference over to your host, amir rozwadowski, senior vice president, finance, and investor relations.
please go ahead.
amir rozwadowski -- senior vice president, finance, and investor relations
thank you, and good morning, everyone. welcome to our fourth-quarter call. i'm amir rozwadowski, head of investor relations for at&t. joining me on the call today are john stankey, our ceo; and john stephens, our chief financial officer.
before we begin, i need to call your attention to our safe harbor statement, which says that some of our comments today may be forward-looking. as such, they're subject to risks and uncertainties. results may differ materially. and additional information is available on the investor relations website.
and as always, our earnings materials are on our website. i also want to remind you that we continue to be in the quiet period for the fcc spectrum auction 107. so, unfortunately, we can't answer your questions about that today. with that, i'll turn the call over to john stankey.
john? 
john stankey -- chief executive officer
good morning, everyone. happy new year to all of you, and i hope this moment finds you all in good health. with that, let's go ahead and get started on slide 3. there are a lot of words to describe 2020, most of which wouldn't be nice to say in public, but when i look at how we executed on our priorities in the midst of this pandemic, i keep coming back to one word and that's resilient.
we added 1.5 million postpaid phones during the year, our most net adds in a decade, and our highest-value subscribers. we reduced churn, streamlined operations, and had the nation's fastest wireless network. for the second year in a row, we added more than 1 million fiber subscribers, as customers move to our higher-speed services. and perhaps most remarkable during this pandemic, we launched hbo max.
and about seven months later, we had more than 41 million hbo max and hbo domestic subscribers, two years ahead of the plan we shared with you in october of 2019. our resilient portfolio of subscription businesses continued to generate strong cash flows, more than $27 billion, to support our ability to invest in our growth areas and sustain the dividend. in fact, we finished the year with our total dividend payout ratio at a very comfortable level. and on debt management, we made material progress in 2020 by reducing debt maturities over the next five years by about 50% and lowering our weighted-average interest rate on debt to about 4%.
we continue to transform the business to drive efficiencies. our cost-cutting initiatives generated about $2 billion in savings in 2020, dollars we invested back into the business to drive subscriber growth and move our transformation initiatives forward. in mobility, we streamlined distribution, shifted some stores to third-party dealers, and closed others. total calls into our call centers are down by 30 million as we saw dramatic shift to online transactions by our customer base.
we retired more than 30 products in our portfolio and consolidated operations to capitalize on reduced complexity. we took our first steps and reduced our real estate footprint by more than 9 million square feet with more work under way in our longer-term operating model. we also realigned and streamlined our warnermedia operations to better deliver on hbo max and the future of how consumers want to view content. those are a few of our 2020 highlights.
let's talk about our 2021 priorities on slide 4. we have three priorities this year. number one is straightforward, grow our direct customer relationships. that begins with the vital connectivity services we provide and the strength of our network.
we've had the overall fastest wireless network in the nation every quarter for the last two years according to ookla, and the fastest nationwide 5g network in the second half of 2020, after our nationwide 5g launch. it shows the strength of our low-band spectrum portfolio. our fiber net promoter scores continue to be materially better than cables and are helping drive strong subscriber trends and higher penetration rates. there is strong demand for the reliability and speeds our fiber product provides.
beyond our core connectivity services, we're focused on our goal to establish relationships with most us households and hbo max is the key here. through our software-based entertainment platforms, we can learn more about our customers and create long-lasting emotional connections with our award-winning storytelling capabilities. our second priority is the same as last year, and that's continuing to transform our operations to be more effective and efficient. we're restructuring businesses, sunsetting legacy networks, reducing corporate staffing levels and overall benefit costs.
as a result, we're positioned to enter the post-pandemic world as a more agile and efficient company. our third priority is about continuing to be deliberate and strategic with how we allocate capital. we plan to use free cash flow after dividends for the next couple of years to pay down debt. we remain focused on monetizing non-core assets and using those funds for debt reduction as well.
we're committed to sustaining our dividend at current levels and we'll give top priority to debt reduction at this time. in summary, i'm pleased with the progress we've made the last two quarters. despite covid-19 challenges, we're seeing growth where we want to see growth and we're successfully redirecting our investments to support those areas. we have more work to do but i'm confident we're on the right path.
before i hand it over to john, i want to acknowledge that i'm sensitive to the reality that there's much going on in and around the business. i know inside at&t we're working hard to reposition the company so i can imagine you're working equally hard to keep up with us. to that end, i want to let you know we plan to host a virtual investor event in the second half of the quarter, where our leadership team will provide more insight into our business plans and we'll have a lot of time for discussion and your questions. look for more to come on that soon.
with that, i'll turn it over to john to discuss the more detailed results from the quarter. john?
john stephens -- chief financial officer
thanks, john, and good morning, everyone. let me start on slide 6 with a quick look at our fourth-quarter subscriber metrics. wireless subscriber growth was the best it has been in years. we had 1.2 million postpaid net adds, including 800,000 postpaid phones.
postpaid phone churn was the second-lowest quarter on record, coming in at 0.76%. our fiber momentum also continues. we added more than 270,000 fiber subscribers in the quarter. hbo max subscriber growth continues to outpace original estimates.
we added nearly 7 million total subscribers for hbo max and hbo in 2020 alone. the trend of premium video declines continues to improve. if you exclude the impact of keep america connected on third-quarter net adds, our premium video net adds improved sequentially for the fifth quarter in a row. let's now look at our consolidated and segment results starting with our financial summary on slide 7.
adjusted eps for the quarter was $0.75. that included covid impacts to revenues from lower television licensing and production, changes to the theatrical release slate, and lower international roaming. combined, covid had an estimated $0.08 of eps impact to fourth quarter which we did include in our adjusted results. we made the decision to operate our broadband and legacy voice operations separate from our video business unit and have recast our entertainment group results accordingly.
in conjunction with this change in operations, we have reassessed the book values of our video assets, including goodwill and other long-lived assets. as a result, we recorded a pre-tax non-cash impairment of $15.5 billion. additionally, we adjusted for an actuarial loss to our benefit plans and a write-off of production and other content inventory at warnermedia, stemming from the continued shut down of theaters and film releases going on hbo max. we'll provide more information in our sec filings and in our website, and in our annual report.
revenues were down from a year ago with gains in mobility partially offsetting pressure from warnermedia and video, but revenues were up sequentially. foreign exchange had a negative impact of about $200 million in revenue primarily in our latin america segment. cash flows for the quarter and the year underscore our resilient customer base and liquidity. cash from operations came in at $10.1 billion for the quarter and $43.1 billion for the year.
free cash flow was $7.7 billion for the quarter and $27.5 billion for 2020. for the full year, our total dividend payout ratio was just under 55%. gross capital investment was about $20 billion in 2020 and we continue to invest heavily in our growth areas even during the pandemic. in addition, we invested about $800 million in hbo max in the fourth quarter and about $2.1 billion for the full year.
let's now look at our segment operating results starting with our communications segment on slide 8. our communications business showed revenue growth this quarter, thanks to a strong performance in mobility. we told you we intended to give our best customers our best prices and offers and you're seeing the benefits of that logic. strong subscriber gains and people moving to unlimited plans helped drive service revenue growth in the quarter, even with continuing pressure in international roaming.
more than 60% of our postpaid phone base is on an unlimited plan. churn has been impressive. the last two quarters have been our lowest postpaid phone churn quarters on record. and for the full year, a remarkable 16 basis point improvement in postpaid phone churn.
our successful retention approach does require some upfront investment, but the lower churn levels and improved subscriber counts make this the right economic trade. as i mentioned, we have split the entertainment group into two reporting units: broadband and video. and a full reconciliation of the two units is in our support documents. but for comparative purposes, here are the trends in entertainment group the way you have been used to seeing them.
we had our best at&t fiber fourth-quarter net adds even with more challenges associated with the pandemic, and penetration continues to grow. it's now at 34%. in our video unit, premium video losses were improved year-over-year, thanks to lower churn and our focus on high-value customers. we continue to drive arpu growth in both video and ip broadband.
in fact, premium video arpu was up more than 5%. our business wireline team continues to effectively manage the transition of the business and deliver solid results amid the pandemic. solid cost management has been key to delivering solid ebitda all year long. let's move to warnermedia and latin america results, which are on slide 9.
warnermedia continues to be impacted by the pandemic as we've seen across that entire industry. we did see solid gains in subscription revenues, thanks to the rapid growth of hbo max. we now have 41 million domestic hbo max and hbo subscribers and about 61 million worldwide as we prepare for the international launch of hbo max later this year, and we now have more than 10 million customers who combine one or more of our connectivity products with hbo max or hbo. advertising revenues also grew, driven by political advertising and cnn, which was number one in all of cable viewership, not just news, in the fourth quarter.
because of the pandemic, we introduced a unique one-year plan in which warner brothersbros will continue to exhibit films theatrically worldwide while adding an exclusive one-month access period on hbo max, simultaneous with the films' domestic release. our goal is to make the best of a very challenging situation for all involved. that includes filmmakers and talent, theater owners, and most importantly, the movie-going public. our latin america operations continue to work to recover from the pandemic.
we added more than 500,000 subscribers in mexico and almost 50,000 subscribers in vrio, helped in part by our over-the-top offering in brazil. latin america revenues continue to be challenged by fx, slow economies, and covid. even with this, mexico ebitda improved year-over-year for the second quarter in a row and vrio continues to generate positive ebitda and cash flow on a constant currency basis. now, let's go to slide 11 for our 2021 guidance.
last year was a difficult year for us to forecast for obvious reasons. there remain uncertainties in 2021 with the rate and pace of recovery for the pandemic around the globe impacting media, travel, and employment. against that backdrop, our current outlook for 2021 is as follows. we expect consolidated revenue growth of about 1% with wireless service revenue growth of 2% and a gradual improvement in warnermedia's top line.
as noted previously, we plan to reinvest all of our savings from our transformation efforts to support our customer count momentum and our growth businesses. combined with ongoing declines in our premium video segment, this could lead to adjusted ebitda declining slightly in 2021 versus this year. adjusted eps is expected to be stable with 2020. we expect gross capital investment in the $21 billion range and net capex of about $18 billion.
the primary difference between the two is from vendor financing initiatives we have in place and anticipated firstnet reimbursements. free cash flow has been resilient for us, even during the pandemic, and we expect that resiliency to continue in 2021 with a $26 billion range target for free cash flow. we'll also continue to focus on bringing down debt. as john mentioned, we expect to use free cash flow dollars after dividends to pay down debt.
we continue to look for opportunities to monetize assets and apply those proceeds to paying down debt, including crunchyroll, which we expect to close later this year. we do plan to provide an update on our leverage outlook and longer-term debt ratio target once the auction quiet period ends. as 2020 showed us things can change quickly. however, we are encouraged by our ability to adapt to those changes while driving increased customer counts, generating strong cash flows, investing in areas of strategic focus, all while maintaining a disciplined approach to our capital allocation and shareholder return strategies.
and as john mentioned, we plan to have a virtual analyst event later in the quarter to talk about this more. amir, that's our presentation, we're now ready for q&a.
amir rozwadowski -- senior vice president, finance, and investor relations
operator, we're ready to take the first question.
",":
operator
thank you. [operator instructions] your first question comes from the line of simon flannery from morgan stanley. please go ahead.
simon flannery -- morgan stanley -- analyst
ok. thank you very much. good morning. so, i'm looking forward to the analyst day.
and perhaps you could start with the macroenvironment. what are you assuming in terms of the backdrop? are you really assuming that things continue to be much as they are or -- or do you have a pickup in the second half on things like roaming and advertising? any comments just about trends with what cios are seeing, et cetera, that -- that underscores that? and then within the capex budget, are there any material changes within your priorities there, for example, your fiber buildout? i know that's a big priority. is there an opportunity to ramp that up or additional spend on 5g rollout? any color there would be great, thank you.
john stephen -- chief financial officer
so, simon, this is -- this is john. let me -- let me take that. on the macro side, the one thing we saw at the end of last year was customers' willingness to pay. our bad debts were really quite solid, quite -- quite positive trends both on the consumer and the corporate side.
so, while we're not getting overly excited, it was a positive sense. what we have built into our plans are, if you will, more of the kind of current environment for the next six months with some second half and really closer to the fourth-quarter pickup in pandemic relief activities. so, we'll see more theater-going probably in the fourth quarter than we did this year, we'll see some more travel. but in no way did we envision a -- a hockey stick or any kind of dramatic increase.
it's really much more of a general staying the course. there is some slight improvement but staying the course. secondly, with -- the one thing i'd add though is the cash collections have been strong and -- and have been resilient, i feel really good about that, so it gives us some -- some comfort. secondly, with regard to the capex, i -- i'd say it this way.
as you look at the kind of the gross capital being put in the ground, it's up $1 billion. there will be some changes in what we spent last year, i.e., i continue to expect the -- a little bit lighter on the video satellite-type side of the business because of the success of at&t tv and our focus on churn reduction as opposed to gross adds. so, there will be some more money there. i think you'll see us -- we continue to spend money on wireless but we're well into and well-completed with the firstnet build, so we'll have some ability to manage there.
the next piece though is we will see an increase in the fiber build, and the opportunity to add some more sales opportunities to that inventory. i don't know, john, did i miss anything from your perspective?
john stankey -- chief executive officer
yeah. i'll be more precise than john. we'll be building somewhere around 2 million fiber residential locations in that neighborhood. that's kind of what we got the team tasked to do to give you a sense of what that increase will be.
and i think the only other thing i would comment on relative to the wireless spend overall, the shift that's occurring, we -- we put in a tremendous amount of capacity out over the last several years in combination with a lot of the work we spoke to you about with the firstnet upgrades and there's -- there's a kind of a shift in mix going on within the wireless build and we're now moving away from what i would call capacity that's on existing spectrum bands and starting to see ourselves prep for possibly using other spectrum that may come into service at some point in time, et cetera. so, we got a little bit of a dynamic going on in the shift that's in the overall wireless program.
simon flannery -- morgan stanley -- analyst
ok. and so, that suggests capex --
john stephens -- chief financial officer
thanks for your question.
simon flannery -- morgan stanley -- analyst
ok. is capex second-half loaded then?
john stankey -- chief executive officer
we -- we don't have anything that i would tell you is any different than what you've seen. you know, we're actually -- we started doing engineering. if you're worried about fiber, simon, we started doing engineering on the fiber build this year. and i told you we were getting ready to go and it was my intent to get going and the teams are already out turning things up.
we had the conversation last quarter. i don't want to repeat myself, but we shared with you that this build is a little bit different than when we initially started because we have wire centers that are already fiber-capable, the infrastructures in place. we're going back in and picking up the next adjacent neighborhood or the next successive area. and as a result of that, the, you know, the speed to get up and moving is not the lift that it was the first time we started ramping up on this.
so, we've got a little smoother dynamic around it than what you might think because of the increase in the fiber dynamic.
amir rozwadowski -- senior vice president, finance, and investor relations
thanks very much for the questions, simon. if we can get the question.
operator
your next question comes from the line of john hodulik from ubs. please go ahead.
john hodulik -- ubs -- analyst
great. thanks, guys. first of all, a related question. what's driving the -- the 22% decline in the -- the broadband segment? were there, you know, additional costs associated with splitting it out from -- form video and sort of, you know, how do you expect that to -- to progress through the year, especially with the -- with the increased fiber build you --you expect as we go on? and then secondly, any update on the timing of the avod launch or anything you can tell us on -- on new content or reliance on sports and news? thanks.
john stephens -- chief financial officer
john, let me take the first one. with regard to the broadband piece, quite frankly, it's really the efforts we've had to increase our sales capabilities, add new customers, the amounts that we've built out in the prior years. this also has to do with, you know, the recognition that we are providing hbo max for all of our gig customers. and so, there's an intercompany charge there.
it's within the umbrella of at&t and the economics are there so we feel good about it but that's also in there. i -- i would tell you, as you all know, the network infrastructure, customer service like fiber is a long-term game and we've, you know, gone through the process many times, i feel very good about the long-term returns and the efforts. but yeah, we're going to be spending some money as we did last year to invest in that customer growth. you saw the 600,000-plus, 650,000-or-so net adds the last six months and we feel very good about that, particularly when we look at the churn numbers, particularly when we look at the customer satisfaction and the nps scores.
so, you know, completely or complete support the fact but yes, there is some investment there. with regard to the avod, we are expecting to launch our international version of the hbo max later this year as well as the avod. i'm not ready to give any dates. john, i don't know if you want to say anything more --
john stankey -- chief executive officer
we're -- we're still shooting for second-quarter launch on avod. and -- and i think i would point out equally as important as the latin america launch of hbo max that we've been working really hard on and will be an important driver for us on future growth and getting ourselves embedded into the international front on -- yeah, unified platform and approach to things. so, you should expect as we get into the second quarter there's going to be a lot of activity and change going on here. one of the reasons we're kind of trying to pinpoint the exact date on it is, as you know, we've been working through pandemic-related production issues, and ramping that back up has been, you know, a pretty significant task.
the team has done a remarkable job getting ourselves back into that business and working through the dynamics safely. it puts a little bit of overhead on things in terms of speed of production and what we're able to do and there's a, you know, a bit of rework that goes on with trying to work-around the limitations of a pandemic-based environment. as a result of that, you know, we're still fighting through, getting the pipeline dropping the content at the right rate and pace that we want it to, and -- and the first quarter this year continues to be a bit of a stretch in that regard as we cycle back into production. our expectations are that we start to hit our stride as we get into the second quarter and it's really important as we -- we put these new iterations of the product out that we -- we have ourselves in a good position in terms of the content inventory.
and so, as we're kind of going hand-to-mouth on these right now, john, we'll be a little bit more discrete on when we announce what's coming out and exactly what month, simply because it's just that tough, and -- and that much of a battle literally show-by-show to get this stuff done and get it into the funnel and we're working hard to do that. and we hope we're past any of the unexpected dynamics like the california, you know, closures that went on over the last several weeks that, you know, put a couple twists and turns in the road and we've got the worst behind us, but i'm a little chaste right now with everything on the pandemic, so i don't want to over-promise anything.
john hodulik -- ubs -- analyst
got it. thanks, guys.
john stephens -- chief financial officer
thanks, john.
operator
your next question comes from the line of phil cusick from j.p. morgan. please go ahead.
phil cusick -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
hey, guys. so, much to ask, thank you. so, in wireless, john, you talked about growing customer relationships overall as a priority for the company. should we assume that means the current level of promotion and upgrades, that effort continues? and then second, to follow up, for john stephens, just really quick.
you -- you mentioned an updated leverage target that you would talk about at an analyst day. i know you can't really talk about, you know, where leverage goes around an auction, but do you anticipate changing the target from the current 2.5 turns? thanks very much.
john stankey -- chief executive officer
so, phil, the, you know, look, we're in a dynamic market, things change all the time. we're going to look at our promotion strategies and adjust them accordingly, and determine what we need to do to continue to be in a position to maintain and grow share, and its -- i think it's really important we continue to have a growing business. there's, you know, the management team is focused on two things. we like the momentum.
i think we'd like to be a little bit more efficient with the momentum. we've done some really good stuff and had some really good progress on self-funding a lot of what we've been doing in the market but we're not self-funding all of it yet. and so, our continued work on trying to manage the efficiency and effectiveness of this business, so that we can be in a more aggressive posture in the market is something that this team is working on every quarter and we've tried to be diligent and reasonable in our guidance to you and make sure that we have high confidence in what we share. but what i'm turning back to the management team is, you know, a task that i'd say is --is more aggressive than that.
and to the extent that this management team delivers and they have been doing a remarkable job of doing that over the last several quarters, you know, does that mean that that's going to give us more room to do more in the market and continue to maintain a posture that i think is totally appropriate, bringing in high-value customers, the right kind of customers we want, going down the swim lanes that we set up for ourselves that we think we have a unique place to be, which is winning in the public sector with our firstnet abilities, using our deep enterprise-customer relationships to go deeper into the customer base, with affinity programs, ensuring that we're getting the mass market with attractive offers like hbo max and what's associated with that -- that is -- it's brought in a really attractive gross add pool and treating our embedded base well. you know, that --that is, you know, that is the strategy and we're going to continue to do that. i think you're seeing it. to be the industry leader in churn this quarter, you know, i think we called it right.
we said that we don't have customers that are upset about our network. they like it. we don't have customers that are upset about our service. they're -- they're satisfied with our service.
we had customers who are interested in finding new devices. we shared with you that we had a little bit more agent population on device longevity than the rest of the industry. we've been targeting how we do that. i think, you know, getting the new 30-year lease on life -- the 30-month lease on life with these customers, i wish it was 30 years, is a very appropriate exchange for the franchise right now given everything we have in front of us.
john stephens -- chief financial officer
phil, with regard to the update at the, you know, the update at the analyst conference. first and foremost, you know, what we've said and we'll continue to say is free cash flow in excess of dividends is going to go to pay down debt. proceeds from the sale of assets is going to pay down debt. but the reality of it is, you know, we would prefer to be able to give you more information about a leverage target.
we can't do that at this time because of the status of the c-band auction and our inability to comment on it. that's all we're trying to tell you is that we understand that we -- we would normally give that to you. that would be appropriate. but because of the fcc rules, we can't, so, we will commit that we will update it when.
it's possible. that's -- that's the story. i think the one thing that i will repeat though is, you know, $27.5 billion last year, $26 billion we're guiding for next year, $15 billion dividend, a lot of money to use to pay down debt. that's what the message we want to give you and the proceeds from things like crunchyroll we're going to use to pay down debt.
so, we feel good about what we've done over the last three years with regard to managing the debt and we feel really good about our ability going forward. but the comment about leverage is just we, you know, it's appropriate for us to get to -- we can't because of the rules around the c-band auction.
phil cusick -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
ok. so, that's a -- maybe this year leverage target, not a permanent changing the 2.5 leverage target?
john stephens -- chief financial officer
i'd say we'll give you all that at the -- at the analyst conference when we can -- when we can talk about it, quite frankly. i just got to be, you know, you got to be really careful. we'll -- we'll -- we'll go from there and -- and move forward, but our guidance on this, the real piece is, cash flow in excess of dividends, and proceeds from asset sales go to pay down debt. and if you look at our net debt at the end of the year, i think we've shown a -- a -- we've got a good record to prove that we're doing what we said we're going to do.
phil cusick -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
thanks, guys.
operator
your next question comes from the line of michael rollins from citi. please go ahead.
mike rollins -- citi -- analyst
thanks, and good morning. just wanted to follow up on the wireless business just with a couple questions. so, with the guidance to grow service revenues at about 2%, can you frame the opportunity to improve arpu for your wireless customers over the next 12 to 24 months? and then also with that target and given where the fourth-quarter service revenue growth was, does that mean that at&t may be exiting the fourth quarter of '21 with service revenue growth above that 2% for the whole year and relative to maybe where you're starting earlier in the year from? thanks.
john stephens -- chief financial officer
yeah, mike, let me -- let me take a quick -- just to the math, point out that i think you're -- you're aware of. it. but the first quarter of 2021, this quarter we're in now, last year we still had international roaming. and so, you know, that compares -- that compares -- i mean itis going to be compared to if you will, 2.5 months of international roaming.
so, that will be one set. the next -- the next, you know, three quarters will presumably be without the international roaming, so, the numbers will be different. that's one and i just say that to you, so i don't want to get into quarterly analysis because i just don't want to confuse things when we talk about the full year. secondly, the real story on the service revenue is customer growth and, quite frankly, we talk about the -- the 1.2 million of postpaid net adds, the 1.5 million of -- 1.2 million postpaid adds last quarter, the 1.5 million of voice net adds, mostly in the last six months, all of that.
but the reality is, too, we had close to 16 million total wireless connection net adds during the quarter -- during the year when you include all connections. and we're seeing -- and we believe that our strategies, the ones john just talked about with treating our best customers with the best offers and things like that have the opportunity to win for us the best network and so forth. and so, we're optimistic about the ability to continue to grow that customer base. that's what's driving the service revenues.
with regard to the arpu growth, the continued opportunities go into the upscaling of these packages with a great opportunity to offer hbo max which has, you know, certainly got the tailwinds behind it and the success of it, you saw the 7 million hbo adds. the best we've had in not only 10 years but the best in the total 10 years, better than the total last 10 years. that is going to, you know, we -- we believe that that kind of packaging with wireless is going to help, and such that we're going to be able to grow it and then grow the arpu from getting people to buy up, not just from the mobile share plans into unlimited but to buy up from the basic unlimited all the way up to the elite. that's the story.
we're not giving specific percentages, you know, dollars, but that's what builds that confidence in wireless service revenue growth which really drives the overall growth of the company's 1% guidance on revenue growth. that -- that -- that and some tailwinds from the comeback of warnermedia.
mike rollins -- citi -- analyst
thank you.
operator
your next question -- your next question comes from the line of david barden from bank of america. please go ahead.
dave barden -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
hey, guys. thanks for taking the question. and, john, i guess this is going to be your last quarterly conference call, so, we'll see you at the analyst day but congrats on everything you've gotten done.
john stephens -- chief financial officer
thanks, david.
dave barden -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
i just wanted to -- two questions. one is separating, you know, out the video business, taking the $15.5 billion writedown is going to fan the flames of the conversation around divesting that satellite business. could you kind of, either john or john, could you elaborate a little bit on -- on kind of what that might look like? and what in the $26 billion of free cash flow guidance is -- is coming from the satellite video business today? and then the second conversation, we've just finished the first month of the, you know, hbo max experience with wonder woman commensurate with the theatrical release, and -- and this is obviously going to happen like 11 more times over the course of 2021 as you kind of do the day date thing with the movie slate. you know, if we multiply what happened with wonder woman times 11 over the course of 2021, what does that look like for warner brothersbros from a revenue and profit standpoint relative to what maybe 2019 would have looked like in a more-normal year? thank you.
john stankey -- chief executive officer
so, let me try to deal with the front-end of that, david, and then john can give you a little bit of context on the -- the cash flow. you know, obviously, what i'll say on that is we assume that, you know, we're running the business as we portrayed it to you. and we have been debating how we wanted to set up our operations for video for some time. and, you know, i think part of this when we step back and think about why we made this change, is we figure we're at a lifecycle change in these products, that getting management teams focused in this way will be the best way to maximize value in the discrete product lines.
and so, in the video case, you know, we've seen a pretty dramatic change in what's occurring in the market and there's a variety of things driving it. you all know about the declines in the pay-tv lifecycle. but we also have the dynamic that's starting to occur, which i think is a really important one to understand, where we're starting to see pay-tv disconnect a little bit from broadband. as virtual mvpds start-up, our own product itself, in many respects, has a virtual characteristic to it and, you know, it's a fairly mature offering.
and so, getting the management team really focused on what to do in the latter stages of the lifecycle of a mature product and ensuring that we manage it effectively i think is the wise thing to do for that product on a stand-alone basis and that's -- that's one driver behind why we made that decision. the second driver behind why we made this decision is i believe we're at the front-end of a dynamic of customers wanting to ensure that they have connectivity and broadband access no matter where they go, and they want a simpler model around that. and i think about our business being in a very unique position for both businesses and consumers to deliver on that promise. and the innovation that's going to be necessary from a product perspective, and then pairing that with what are the new complementary products and services that customers might want to bundle or use with that connectivity, i think, is a -- is a new play and that's a new growth for us.
and to get another part of the management team really focused on that aspect of our businesses, how we simplify unified connectivity for our customer base, whether a consumer or business, whether fixed or mobile, starting to think about what those virtual-type add-ons are to that product that come with a very different delivery mechanism than what we've historically seen when we've been bundling what i would call these high-overhead, premise-intensive visit-type services that we've traditionally had in the bundle and play into that as the strength and position for growth is the second part of why we want the management team set up the way we have it right now and focused on that going forward. and that just makes sense for how we're operating the business because of the time and place and where we are and we are absolutely comfortable that that's the right call for how to operate our business moving forward. and i -- i will tell you, i'm not going to speculate on anything structural or m&a-oriented. we never do.
i'm not going to now. but, you know, i believe that what we're doing here is if the goal is to always run an asset for maximum value creation, this is the right strategy to run the asset for maximum value creation. john?
john stephens -- chief financial officer
yeah, and both -- both the asset of video and both the asset of broadband is so critical going forward.
john stankey -- chief executive officer
let me just quickly touch on the hbo max and theatrical piece, if i could. so, i -- i think, you know, where we are is that there's a difference between a what i'll call a tentpole release and a non-tentpole release. and wonder woman and the nature of that production value and what occurs in it is -- is different than, you know, the balance of many of the other movies in our slate. we have other tentpole releases that occur throughout the 2021 release schedule that are going to be equally as buzzworthy as wonder woman.
and we have in between those other high-quality offerings to fill that in that cater to maybe, sometimes, a less-broad audience. and that's the power of doing what we did and bringing the entire slate out to our end-user base. so, we're going to see a little bit of spikiness in -- in what occurs and i don't think it's fair to say if we're going to put, you know, call it 17, 18, whatever movies we ultimately settle on in the release structure for the year, we're not going to see the kind of subscriber spikes that maybe we saw in december and early january every time we put a movie out. that really isn't the design intent of the plan.
we have, you know, but we do have an opportunity to build marketing and promotion opportunities around those bigger releases that have broader buzz and broader application across the customer base and we're going to take every advantage of doing that and, you know, we're going to work filling in the niche between it. this, i think i want to stress, this is a unique year and we did this as a unique year. and -- and probably appropriate to make a comment that, you know, in some cases, i'll say, maybe the dynamic of the media and the press was a little over-sold or a little intense on both ends of the spectrum around this, from my point of view. you know, we told you when the team decided to make this move, that we thought it was appropriate for this moment in time.
and the team made the call, and i think it was a bold and aggressive swing. it was done with a lot of thought as to what needed to occur in the subscriber base and the balance of the value of the franchises between our theatrical and our streaming business. it was certainly nice to have a streaming business to present us this option of how we use this content. but part of that call was just built on the dynamic of what we thought the theatrical movie-going audiences were going to look like in 2021.
and since we articulated that, i would say the data points have come in that have been very consistent with the set of assumptions that we had at the front end of that. i mean, just the last several weeks, you've seen other studios continuing to snowplow releases, moving them out of the first half of the year, moving them into the second half of the year, which further cements our point of view that we're going to see a very crowded theatrical field as we get into late 2021 and early 2022. and we don't believe that, you know, magically, just because there's more content showing up in theaters all at the same time that that's going to dramatically increase the size of the movie-going population at that time. and so, as we indicated by making the write-off, we -- we felt like we had a little bit of a spoiling asset here that needed to be moved -- used more effectively.
and this was the right economic call to balance this across both sides and we think using it to balance out long-lived subscribers that build out a scaled platform that allow us to have auctions in our distribution and using this -- this unfortunate set of circumstances around the pandemic for an opportunity, make, you know, lemonade out of lemons, was the right call in this case. and you know, i -- i think we all have to understand, we step back and think about the theatrical business. i mean, nobody went to theaters in 2020 for the most part. it was a pandemic.
just like nobody got on airplanes and nobody went to hotels and nobody goes to restaurants. and all of those businesses had a little bit of dislocation because of that, and the theatrical business had a little bit of dislocation. and i applaud the team for the move they made in -- in trying to make the best of the circumstance, for our circumstance, around having a really strong theatrical slate that can help our streaming product. could we have maybe done some things a little bit differently in how we got to the front end of it? anytime you're first in something, there's no match, you're a trailblazer, there's nothing perfect for you to read.
and i think that -- that there was some things on the margin that maybe we'd do a little bit differently. but at the end of the day, it's going to get down to making sure people are fairly compensated and treated well. and i think we know how to do that. i think we've been good to the theater owners in the perspective that the exhibitors now have a plan and routine set of releases coming to them in a time when they really, as we've talked about, have other studios snowplowing.
i think in the end, this will ultimately shape up to be a good thing across the board as we get through the emotional aspects that are -- that are bound to be there in a high-anxiety environment like the pandemic. and, you know, all things having been said with what we've seen on the front end of the numbers, what our experience has been, we are delivering on this in a way that we expected. it's pretty consistent with the value shifts that we expected and feel pretty good about where we are in the early innings of this. so, john, why don't you go ahead and --
john stephens -- chief financial officer
yeah. i'll say a couple things. one, i'd-- i'd point out first and foremost from my perspective 7 million net adds is pretty -- pretty stout, and the strategy is, you know, working. secondly, it's still early.
we're 31 days out from wonder woman's release, i think. and so, we'll continue to follow it. more importantly, for everybody on the call i think, at the analyst day, we'll get the team, jason and his team will get the opportunity to talk to you about of the further plans and -- and go through that. dave, your other question i think was with regard to, you know, the planning process.
the guidance we're giving here today, but for the exclusion of any commentary on c-band, is -- is what we have as assets in our portfolio as of january 1st, and owning them for the full year, other than crunchyroll, other than the already held-for-sale termination of crunchyroll. and so, yeah, there is free cash flow in here from the video business. i won't give you a specific -- i won't give you a specific number on that, dave, but you can assume based on the results of the business last year it's probably going to be a lower number inclusive next year than it is this year for the changes in customer base and so forth. but it is a business-as-usual what i would call kind of business planning approach.
all that being said, feel really good about the -- the free cash flow position and, you know, particularly as i mentioned in an earlier question, cash came in strong at the end of the year in the fourth quarter with regard to customer activity both on the corporate business side as well as the consumer side, and you guys can see it in our bad debts, which are remarkably low. the team did a really great job of -- of weeding out fraud and weeding out -- focusing on the best customers and it's showing up in our numbers. so, i -- i think, hopefully, that answers your question, david. thanks for your earlier comment about my retirement.
it will be a change, but it will be interesting.
dave barden -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
good luck. thanks.
john stephens -- chief financial officer
thank you.
operator
your next question comes from the line of brett feldman from goldman sachs. please go ahead.
brett feldman -- goldman sachs -- analyst
yeah, thank you for taking the question. and if you don't mind, i'd like to follow up on some of the fiber commentary. it's obviously encouraging to see that you're really taking up the pace of the buildout this year. but, you know, even after building out 2 million additional homes passed, that would still be a -- a small subset of the number of customer locations in your total wireline footprint.
how do you think about what portion of that footprint, which i think has 60 million households in it, is potentially attractive in terms of being a -- a great demo, and having economics to reach them, that -- that generate a compelling return for you? in other words, for how long can you keep adding 2 million homes a year to your footprint? and am i even asking this question correctly because as you build out your 5g footprint which is really a national 5g network using layers of spectrum across multiple bands, it would seem like wireless will increasingly be a viable technology for reaching households beyond your traditional footprint? how do you think about the fixed wireless opportunity? and maybe how do you just think about the ability to be a provider of high-speed residential broadband across the country? thanks.
john stankey -- chief executive officer
so, brett, the -- i'm going to sound like a broken record, but it's really important on these long-lived investments that we be pretty consistent internally so that the management team can get to a consistent level of execution year over year. if i think about what has traditionally happened in --in outside plant, access technology upgrades, i've been through a series of them over my career and i don't think this one's going to be a whole lot different. there's always the first third of the customer base that's kind of the low-hanging fruit, slam dunk, that is the part of the customer base that you cut your teeth on, get your -- your processes squared away on, get the vendor community up the first part of the cost curve, and, you know, it's like the no-brainer economically and you kind of make your decision that that's where you're going to start. and i would say we went through that largely through that first third in the investment we've made over the last several years.
then what happens is as you get your, you know, up the learning curve and the vendors start to scale, and you start to get confidence in your economics and your -- your business processes start to improve, and you start to see the marginal economics improve on the subscriber which is what you're going to start to see happen on some of those broadband numbers on the fiber base that we've broken out for you as we move forward here over time, the next third becomes the opportunity and we're into that segment, you know, the middle innings of the game if you want. it's the next 30% to 60% of the customer base that we can work our way through, and you look at the economics around it, it makes sense. then you get into the last third and it's always the hardest part. and i mean in many instances you're still sitting with the last third that in parts of the rural america that still really don't have, you know, effective broadband options.
and oftentimes it's -- it's policy. sometimes it's a -- it's a technology breakthrough that gets that last third. and i would tell you right now if you wanted me to prognosticate, are you going to build fiber to that last third? i don't think i'd want to prognosticate that that's a place that we're likely to go in the near-term absent some kind of major subsidy construct that comes into place. and i actually believe candidly, you know, even if there was subsidy put in, it would be a better use of taxpayer money to do something that was more hybrid-oriented in the technologies -- technologies that are applied and not exclusively lean on fiber in that space.
but we're several innings out from that actually coming to pass, and we'll have time to work through it and right now working in the middle innings of the game and the next, you know, 30% of the customer base is where our focus is at. and as i shared with you on the previous call, it's 2 million this year. the team executes well. we can do more than 2 million and start to ramp that up.
and when we demonstrate to the investor base that we're getting the kind of returns that you all like, then you should cheer us on to do that, and be very supportive of us moving down that path and it's my intent to characterize that and show that to you. in terms of how i think about the wireless and fixed base, you know, i've got maybe a little different view on this and i'll maybe step back and think about it from a macro level. if you go back and you look at consumption that's curved and customer bases, whether it be wireless-centric data use, or fixed-centric data use, they've all been growing, and they grow at a pretty consistent level. and if you go and you talk to experts around consumer behavior over the next 10 years and you look at what's going on inside the household of -- for example, just one major trend of people moving away of what used to be broadcast or multi-cast streams efficiently delivered to unicast streams, discrete streams to one device and you just look at what's happening in consumer behavior over that, there is a substantial amount of video traffic to be moved to unicast that's going to drive up a massive amount of consumption.
and this ratio between mobile and fixed consumption has been at about 10 to 1 for -- for many years. this is not new, and i believe that that ratio, it may not be perfectly 10 to 1 but there's still going to be a pretty consistent gap between mobile and fixed consumption. in other words, there's still a lot of traffic to be moved given consumer shifts and how they're using products and services. and so, you know, as i sit back and think about things, i think about hybrid access technologies as being important but i don't know that the most ideal way to build a network is going to be to use fixed wireless to take on the bulk of what occurs in the four walls of a business or a home, given the consumer behavior trends we're going to see over the next 10 years.
and i -- i think still having a very dense and rich fiber infrastructure is going to be necessary to be an effective network provider over time. now, it doesn't mean there won't be some segments of the population, and my son who lives on his own in an apartment, you know, in a metro urban area that might actually be an individual that would work on an all-wireless portion of his life in his 20s when, you know, he's independent and single and in a single-dwelling unit household. and, you know, maybe that's a little bit different serving arrangement that has a wireless tail on it or is a robust, you know, wireless lan inside of a managed dwelling unit, but i still think reach and penetration of fiber is going to be important as we move forward.
john stephens -- chief financial officer
john, the only thing i'd add in your -- in your -- putting a fence around this issue, john made this comment earlier and it's really important. we have fiber to the neighborhood in many, many locations, and taking fiber-to-the-home is a -- the second step. we haven't done that yet so think about our vdsl, if you think about our new greenfield builds if you think about the neighborhoods next to the vdsl or the neighborhoods next to where we've got fiber-to-the-prem. those are the opportunities.
and that vdsl footprint is 35 million and when you add the fiber to it it's greater than that. that will give you a kind of a framework for something that we could officially do, just what john said about building out the 2 million this year. that's where a lot of the focus is going to be. so, i -- i think of that as the way to think about the opportunity for us.
and yeah, we have that ability, we need to -- we need to continue the sales momentum. that's going to be really critical and important to make it work. but in line with that, that's i think the focus on. easy capability for us.
brett feldman -- goldman sachs -- analyst
thank you.
john stephens -- chief financial officer
thanks.

your next question comes from the line of frank louthan from raymond james. please go ahead.
frank louthan -- raymond james -- analyst
great. thank you. can you comment on -- on any potential regulatory changes with -- with title ii, potentially coming back over the, you know, over the next 12 months? and -- and -- and can you give us a little bit more detail on as far as the fiber-to-the-home, you say you're doing another 2 million homes this year? to what extent can we expect, you know, that to continue at that sort of pace or is that just sort of a year-by-year kind of a decision?
john stankey -- chief executive officer
so, i said in the neighborhood of 2 million homes. i -- i -- i would tell you that as i just said, frank, i -- i want to be able to demonstrate to you that -- that 2 million pace is a -- is a no-brainer and a slam dunk and a great value driver for our business and a great subscriber count driver for our business. and i think this business can build more than 2 million a year in a very profitable fashion, but we're going to demonstrate to you we can do that, and then we'll come back to you and tell you about what that rate is. so, if we execute well -- when the management team execute well, do i expect it that i'll be back talking to you about a '22 build that maybe leans in heavily to that? that's what i'd like to see the management team step up to and be able to work its way through.
the where i think -- i'm sorry, the first part of your question --
john stephens -- chief financial officer
title ii.
john stankey -- chief executive officer
oh, title ii. how can i forget? look, i think it's inevitable that we're now back into the whipsaw approach of the new administration and a new belief that despite four years of not a single data point to suggest that we have a problem to solve, you know, nobody blocking anybody, nobody throttling anybody, nobody doing anything inappropriate in terms of use of service and disclosing how they're offering services to customers, we're going to go through another regulatory bloodletting over this. i expect it to happen and we're going to watch the cycle repeat itself. and, you know, one would hope at some point that there's a reasoned discussion around a policy that gets us away from this whipsawing and allows everybody to kind of have a -- a more consistent, and stable approach.
i -- i don't know that that's going to happen but we're certainly going to try and push and discuss it. where i think the third rail is on this issue is the dynamic around what happens to the freedom of people who invest in competitive markets to price their products and services appropriately. and if -- if we stay away from that third rail, if the kind of latitude is in there to be able to price and do the right things in the market where, you know, competitive markets exist, then i think everything will probably, at the end of the day, be ok. but if for some reason policy goes down a path where that isn't the case, it hasn't in the past even when title ii is in place, we had the latitude to do what i felt like we needed to do.
but if for some reason policy went further to try to solve a problem that doesn't exist, i'd have to step back and ask ourselves how we're allocating capital around that and evaluate where that comes out and ask if it's the right place for us to go for our shareholders based on, you know, that dynamic and that very important lever for us being taken away, so -- or variable, i'd say, in the market, not lever. so, that's -- that's how i think about it right now. you know, i actually step back and -- from a policy perspective, ironically think about what's happened over the course of the last year or two and the dynamics that are going on right now, where the issue is, you know, looking at metering and monitoring speech and what's occurring for people's access to platforms. you know, that's -- there are more real and significant data points in how that's affecting society than anything to do with how internet service providers are delivering bandwidth in the homes, but i'll leave it to smarter people than me to figure that one out.
john stephens -- chief financial officer
frank, i think you know where the industry is real proud of what's happened during the course of the pandemic and the way we've allowed people to continue to work from home. i'm sure many of you are taking this call from home, and the industries, the investments they've made under the, you know, prior regime is working. we're, as a company, more focused on broadband. not just to the availability because it's out there but people's actually taking advantage of it for the homework situation, for others, and we're working on those aspects of it as well as following all of the other aspects of the infrastructure bill, another stimulus bill, tax legislation, we're following all those things, frank.
so, we'll -- we'll continue to follow those closely as you can imagine. amir, do we have time for one more question?
amir rozwadowski -- senior vice president, finance, and investor relations
yeah. we've got time for one last question. operator?
operator
ok. that question comes from the line of tim horan from oppenheimer. please go ahead.
tim horan -- oppenheimer & co. inc. -- analyst
thanks, guys. john, i -- i know you said the move to virtualization of content is kind of accelerating and that seems to be happening with gaming, compute, even communications with microsoft teams and zoom. how -- how are you positioned to take advantage of that? are you better-positioned as a company that owns the pipes and some of the content or do you think it makes more sense to, you know, separate these assets? or you're in a really unique seat, i mean how do you really take advantage of this accelerating move at this point?
john stankey -- chief executive officer
tim, our -- our biggest and single most important bet in that regard is, you know, hbo max. and i think about that broadly as while today we talk about it as an svod evolving to an avod offer, i've mentioned this before, i -- i view it as a really important foundation for broader customer relationships. i mean, this is -- this is the first big foray in maybe legacy at&t thinking about having broader relationships with the customer base at a relatively low price point sku that isn't exclusively dependent on infrastructure. and, you know, to the extent we are successful at having that relationship in most us households, you know, if we don't use that as an opportunity, as a springboard for us to start thinking about how we extend those customer relationships across other opportunities either to own and operate content or engagement with a customer or to use the platform as a means for others to distribute, we'd be losing a huge opportunity.
and -- and so, i think there are all kinds of things we want to do around the edge of making sure that we work with the right hyperscalers to virtualize and give our customers the opportunity to gain access into infrastructure, so that they can run their compute environments and their application environments effectively. that's all-important and that's all meat and potato stuff we need to do on a network. but i'd think about owning some degree of engagement with a customer, a relationship, a means to build with them, having them interact with your service so that you have insights as to who they are, what they like, what they do, what their proclivities are, being able to emotionally attach with them, having a software platform that allows you to build the next building block of a product that extends into engagement, that talks about dynamics of changing consumption in social and interactive, i think this is a really important dynamic for the health of our business. and i know it's -- it's longer-term in nature and i'm well aware that folks who have maybe a tighter orientation, the financial return question, why would you be pushing as hard as you are in this area, it's because i feel pretty strongly about that.
and i think building large subscription bases of customers that pay us every month for something has been kind of a hallmark of this business. we have a -- a really attractive dynamic in that in our overall revenues and profitability today. we need to evolve that into what the next step is and this is just one of those steps in making that happen.
amir rozwadowski -- senior vice president, finance, and investor relations
thanks very much, tim. that's all the time for questions that we have. and with that, want to turn it over to john stankey for final comments.
john stankey -- chief executive officer
so, i have one last order of business before i let you go, and dave kind of hinted at it with his compliment to john. i -- i do want to point out that it's with very mixed emotions that we recognize that this is, i believe, john's 40th and last earnings call that he'll be doing with all of us. and he's been a very valued and longtime co-worker of mine. i think if you think about the fact that he sat in this role as cfo of this company for nine years, that speaks volumes in and of itself about his character and abilities.
that's a tremendous level of longevity for somebody who occupies a role as significant, as pressured and as dynamic as the one that he's had. i've worked with john for 23 years of his career, which has been a long time, and it has been a pleasure all along the way. i could say a lot of things. you know, obviously, high integrity, high impact, high functioning, and incredibly high regard as a person.
we're going to miss him at at&t. i know you're going to miss him in support of all of you, but we're delighted about what lies ahead for him and his family and michele and his next chapter. and as you would expect, the professionalism and navigating the hand-off to what's going to be a very capable successor, i'm just delighted to have pascal coming in and -- and look forward to all of you getting to know him. it's gone incredibly smoothly.
it's been first-rate. and i think as we join you a quarter from now and -- and pascal takes the reins, you'll see what a nice, smooth, and even keel transition that's been when we reconvene. so, i hope you join me in giving best wishes to john and his next chapter and thank him for everything you've done for us. thank you, john.
john stephens -- chief financial officer
thanks, john, and -- and thanks for the kind words. thanks to all of the other members of the management team here who've been a family for me. specifically, thanks to my team, the finance team, just remarkable people across the board. pascal is going to do a great job and you guys are going to be thrilled.
we're upgrading. and i would tell you i just want to wish everybody on the call good luck, godspeed, stay safe. and remember, don't text and drive. thank you, all.

operator
ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. and welcome to at&t's second-quarter 2021 earnings call. [operator instructions] as a reminder, this conference is being recorded. i would like to turn the conference call over to your host, amir rozwadowski, senior vice president, finance and investor relations.
please go ahead.
amir rozwadowski -- senior vice president, finance, and investor relations
thank you, and good morning, everyone. welcome to our second-quarter call. i'm amir rozwadowski, head of investor relations for at&t. joining me on the call today are john stankey, our ceo; and pascal desroches, our cfo.
also joining us for the q&a portion of our call are jeff mcelfresh, the ceo of our communications group; and jason kilar, ceo for warnermedia. before we begin, i need to call your attention to our safe harbor statement. it says that some of our comments today may be forward-looking. as such, they're subject to risks and uncertainties described in at&t's sec filings.
results may differ materially. additional information is available on the investor relations website. and as always, our earnings materials are on our website. i also want to remind you that we are in the quiet period for the fcc spectrum auction 110.
so unfortunately, we can't answer your questions about that today. with that, i'll turn the call over to john stankey. john? 
john stankey -- chief executive officer
good morning, everyone, and thanks for being with us. at the risk of being repetitive, or i guess, consistent, depending on your take, the framework for what i want to cover today should be familiar to you. it's been four quarters since we articulated a simplified strategy and how we plan on evaluating our success going forward based on three priorities. first, we wanted to grow subscriber relationships through our three market focus areas of 5g, fiber and hbo max.
second, we initiated an effort to transform our business to be effective and efficient in everything we do so that we could allocate increased resources to support these focus areas. and third, we committed to deliberate capital allocation to support increased investment in growth, improve returns, narrow our operating focus and restore flexibility to our balance sheet. to achieve these priorities, we made some difficult near-term decisions to set our businesses up for success in the coming years. and that success is defined by improving our competitive position to the investment in best-in-class products and experiences for our customers.
by doing so, we believe the execution of this strategy will drive better returns and profitable long-term growth. let's look at what we've achieved in the past year on slide 4. we made notable progress in each of our priorities. in wireless, we're gaining share, lowering churn and had our best 12 months of postpaid phone net adds in more than a decade.
we just posted record quarterly wireless ebitda. in fiber, customers have similarly responded to the combination of a premium service at attractive prices, and we've grown our base by more than 1 million subscribers. by year-end, we have expanded our fiber footprint by 3 million consumer and business customer locations. and just over a year after launch, we've grown our domestic hbo max and hbo subscribers by 10.7 million.
we transformed hbo from a $6 billion business that was not growing to an $8 billion run-rate business that grew at nearly 40% this quarter. we've also made solid initial progress in our cost-transformation efforts, which have produced $2 billion in savings that we've reinvested into our core growth areas. we're streamlining our operations and effectively growing digital fulfillment channels. our nps scores have improved significantly, and our fiber customers continue to rate us no.
1 in customer satisfaction. churn levels have dropped substantially, too. our second-quarter postpaid phone churn matched a record low. and in broadband, we had our lowest churn on record and the highest second-quarter fiber gross adds ever.
at warnermedia, we continue to deliver great content. in the first half of the year, we introduced hit series, such as mare of easttown and hacks. and our lineup in the back half of the year is even stronger with new seasons of popular series such as succession, raised by wolves, curb your enthusiasm and love life. that's on top of the day and date movies we'll have on the platform, such as space jam: a new legacy, the suicide squad, dune and matrix 4.
when the emmy's were announced last week, hbo max and hbo led the field with 130 nominations, the most of any network or platform. in total, warnermedia received more than 180 nominations. i'm really proud of the way the team is executing. and speaking of good execution, we're seeing indications that our directv deal with tpg might close in the next few weeks ahead of what we expected.
also, we're pleased with the new management team's ability to exceed operational expectations since we announced the transaction. our intention with warnermedia is the same. we want to hit a strong exit velocity for both of these businesses, at which point the combination with the right partner only expands the respective opportunities for success going forward. and we continue to invest at strong levels.
more than $60 billion in the last 12 months in 5g wireless, including spectrum, fiber and premium content. finally, we announced or closed a number of noncore asset dispositions, supporting our path to balance sheet flexibility. at the same time, we've positioned each of our three major businesses, at&t communications, warnermedia and directv, the right capital structure, the right assets, the right management team. and in the case of the latter two, the right partners to optimize their returns to drive material value creation going forward.
these decisions were not easy. and in some cases, they compelled us to rethink how to best deliver returns to our shareholders, leading us to balance long-term value creation with an attractive dividend. as our second-quarter results demonstrate, the momentum in our strategic areas of focus is real, supporting our view that we have the right business strategy and capital structure in place for longer-term success. today, we're updating our 2021 outlook for our consolidated business, but our work is far from over.
we know that consistent execution is the only way to win and keep our investors' confidence in the strategy we put forth. i couldn't be more pleased with the progress we're making. i'll turn it over to pascal to discuss the details of the quarter. pascal?
pascal desroches -- chief financial officer
thank you, john, and good morning, everyone. in the second quarter, we saw impressive growth across mobility, fiber and hbo max. we added nearly 800,000 postpaid phones. that's our best second quarter in more than 10 years.
subscriber momentum continues to be strong, and we continue to take share. the gross adds are up, churn is at record low levels, and our average promotional spend per net add is significantly lower than a year ago, thanks to the consistency in our offerings. the story with fiber remains much the same. we continue to see solid subscriber growth with most of those customers new to at&t.
and broadband revenues grew more than 8%. hbo max continues to exceed our expectations. having surpassed the lower end of our global subscriber target six months ahead of plan, we are now raising our expectations to 70 million to 73 million global subscribers by the end of the year. we also launched our domestic ad-supported version of hbo max, as well as our international offering in 39 latin american territories at the end of the quarter.
that sets us up for additional customer growth as our addressable market expand. let's now turn to slide 7 for our consolidated financial results. last year, we saw the brunt of the pandemic's impact on our q2 results. while the pandemic is still having some impact on our results, we're seeing our businesses emerge stronger than before, with growth accelerating in our market focus areas.
revenues were up more than $3 billion or 7.6% from a year ago. gains in warnermedia, mobility and consumer wireline more than offset declines in video and legacy business services. adjusted ebitda declined mostly due to pandemic impacted timing of sports cost in last year's second quarter. we'll talk more about that in a moment, but we expect most of that to reverse itself next quarter.
in fact, we expect consolidated ebitda to be flat to up modestly next quarter and improving thereafter. adjusted eps for the quarter was $0.89. that's up more than 7% year over year. this includes about $200 million of pre-tax gains, principally from mark-to-market gains on benefit plan investments.
adjustments for the quarter included a $4.6 billion pre-tax noncash write-down of the vrio assets based on our sales transaction announced yesterday. cash flows continue to be resilient. cash from operations came in at $10.9 billion for the quarter. free cash flow was $7 billion, even with a $2.4 billion increase in warnermedia cash content investment.
our dividend payout ratio was about 55%. cash flows this quarter were also impacted by the capitalization of interest of about $250 million associated with our recent c-band spectrum purchases, which are recorded as investing activities. this accounting treatment stops once the spectrum is deployed. let's now look at our segment operating results, starting with our communications business on slide 8.
our communications segment grew revenues, driven by gains in mobility and consumer wireline. mobility growth continues to accelerate, and we delivered another terrific quarter. our simple postpaid phone offers continue to resonate with customers. revenues were up more than 10%, with service revenues growing 5%.
postpaid phone churn marked a record low, and we continue to have strong customer growth, especially in our postpaid phone base. our postpaid phone customer net adds improved by nearly 1 million year over year. and ebitda is up $200 million, our highest-ebitda quarter on record. this growth came without a material return in international roaming revenues and a difficult comparison to last year's q2 that included more than $100 million of gains on tower sales.
as you think about the balance of the year, keep in mind, we are expecting a normal handset introduction cycle in the third quarter versus last year's fourth-quarter launch. also, on the timing front, we expect our recent agreement with dish to provide a boost to wireless service revenues in 2022. business wireline continues to deliver consistent margins and solid ebitda, even as customers transition away from higher-margin legacy services and products. we saw a sequential improvement in both ebitda and ebitda margins.
year-over-year comparisons were impacted by benefits related to the pandemic in the year-ago quarter. we expect similar challenging comps in the third quarter. however, with continued product rationalization and cost management, we're very comfortable with maintaining business wireline margins in the high 30% for the remainder of the year. our fiber growth continues to be solid.
we added 246,000 fiber customers in the quarter. broadband arpu grew by 6.1% year over year. our aggregate fiber penetration rate is now more than 36%, up from about 31% a year ago. and nearly 80% of net adds are new at&t broadband customers.
we've reached a major inflection point in our consumer wireline business. broadband revenue growth now surpasses legacy declines. this helped drive consumer wireline revenues up 2.9%. we expect broadband revenues to continue to outpace legacy decline.
ebitda trends are also expected to continue improving as we make our way through the second half of the year. let's move to warnermedia's results, which are on slide 9. we feel really good about our execution at warnermedia coming out of the pandemic. subscription, advertising and content revenues have accelerated.
customers love hbo max, and subscriber growth is exceeding expectations. and we had a successful launch of both our ad-supported and international hbo max offerings late in the quarter. revenues were up more than 30%, thanks to higher subscription, advertising and content revenues. direct-to-consumer subscription revenues grew nearly 40%, reflecting the success of hbo max.
advertising revenues were up nearly 50%, driven by sports. and upfront negotiations so far have been really strong. content and other revenues were up 35%, reflecting the recovery of tv production and theatrical releases. the return of sports had a big impact on advertising revenues and ebitda in the quarter.
in fact, sports contributed more than $400 million of advertising revenues, and we incurred sports costs of $1.1 billion in the quarter. so discrete losses from sport increased more than $600 million year over year due to last year's suspension of sports in the second quarter. we expect most of that to reverse itself in the third quarter as the prior-year third quarter included the restart of the nba season. we now have 47 million domestic hbo max and hbo subscribers and more than 67 million worldwide subscribers, and domestic arpu is just a little less than $12.
our ad-supported international offerings were launched too late in the quarter to have much of an impact on the second-quarter results, but we're enthusiastic about their prospects, given the initial receptivity. as mentioned earlier, we are raising our subscriber growth expectations for the year. we're seeing good momentum, especially in our latin american markets. we expect most of our subscriber growth for the remainder of the year to be from lower arpu subscribers in that region.
to lean into hbo max fast start in latin america, we may push back our launch in some european markets until early 2022. this shift is factored into our revised hbo max subscriber guidance for the year. now let's shift to guidance. as john mentioned, we updated our consolidated guidance for the year.
let's discuss that on slide 10. as a reminder, our guidance for 2021 is on a business-as-usual basis and includes a full-year contribution from directv. based on the momentum we're seeing across our operations, we now expect consolidated revenue growth in the 2% to 3% range, up from the initial 1% guidance. we also expect wireless service revenue growth of 3% for the year, up from about 2%.
adjusted eps is now expected to increase in the low to mid-single-digit range. that's up from our earlier guidance of stable with 2020. gross capital investment expectations remain in the $22 billion range, and we now expect about $27 billion in free cash flows for the year. also, we now have better clarity on the projected close of the directv transaction.
we expect the transaction to close in early august. here is the expected impact from excluding five months of directv on the consolidated financial guidance we just laid out. revenues are expected to be lower by $9 billion. ebitda is expected to be lower by $1 billion.
free cash flow is also expected to be lower by about $1 billion, equating to $26 billion for the full year. we expect no change to our updated adjusted eps guidance as benefits from the accounting treatment related to the nfl sunday ticket are largely expected to be offset by certain fixed costs that were previously allocated to directv. capital investment guidance is also expected to remain the same. obviously, the actual financial impact could vary depending upon directv's performance, the actual close date and other considerations.
we recognize the financial structure of the directv transaction is complex. that is why we included some incremental details on cash and dividend distribution terms in our press release. shortly after we close the deal, we plan on providing pro forma historical financials to help your modeling going forward. amir, that's our presentation.
we're now ready for the q&a.
amir rozwadowski -- senior vice president, finance, and investor relations
thank you, pascal. operator, we're ready to take the first question.
",":
operator
of course. and our first question today comes from the line of john hodulik with ubs. please go ahead.
john hodulik -- ubs -- analyst
ok, great, thanks. good morning, guys. anything you could tell us about the details of the wholesale deal with dish? specifically, just any thoughts. i, know pascal, you mentioned that it would affect revenues in '22.
but just do you guys expect to take all of that traffic onto your network? and maybe if you could give us a sense on when it should start to migrate or over what time frame you would see that? and then also, as part of that announcement, there was -- there's some details about some key spectrum that you guys could utilize from dish. is that the 700-megahertz spectrum that you would have access to? and maybe if you could give us some details on how quickly that could be put into -- could be letup and sort of used by at&t mobility, that would be great. thanks.
john stankey -- chief executive officer
sure, john. so first, let me just kind of start out and step back and say having watched some of the comments over the last couple of days, let me frame one thing. we have been in the wholesale business since as long as i've been working for this company, and the wholesale business has been very good to our company, and it's a very important element of how we manage our returns and how we kind of think about attracting the right kind of scale in our business moving forward. and that is both true in the fixed and wireless business.
and we've been cognizant of percentages of traffic that we have in various aspects of our business and always try to maintain a balance. and i would say my experience with this company and looking at the relationships we've had from a wholesale perspective, we've always managed to strike relationships that we think are win-win relationships for the parties involved. second thing i would say is i believe that dish is gonna be a company that, in their business model, what they choose to do moving forward is gonna be successful, one way or the other. and my point of view, when we start thinking about the wholesale business is, when somebody is gonna be successful, it's always nice for us to be successful along with them.
we think there's an accretive way to do that drives a reasonable return back into the business and, again, manages the balance of that traffic in the aggregate of the business. and i think we've achieved that in this case. and frankly, given the nature of their business and where they are in its maturity and what our interests are and ultimately aggregating as much traffic on our networks is possible, i'm looking forward to demonstrating to dish that we can be a good partner, that we can carry the right kind of traffic, and we can do things to help them grow their infrastructure over time on parts of our network where they may not have ready access to infrastructure that we can ultimately support them with. and i think that's a good thing for at&t over the long haul, given the nature of our business and what we've done and the balance that we like to keep between retail and wholesale traffic.
the construct around this particular agreement, as you should think about it is, as you know, it was set up so that, as dish continues to build their own infrastructure for own and operate, they need places to put traffic. and so while this is a 10-year agreement that's discussed, i think, in the disclosures,it's a minimum commitment per year, one should think about this as probably being something that's more front-end loaded than back-end loaded in terms of how that commitment retires. and i think you should also think about it in terms of dish has established with us a minimum annual commitment. that's not the necessarily the annual commitment or the maximum annual commitment.
and a lot of this will be based on our effective performance with them and ultimately what they choose to do in the market. but frankly, we aspire to possibly see that be something greater than what those minimum levels are that have been put in place, but this was a comfortable construct that i think both parties could agree to get started and establish all the practices and processes that are necessary to have an effective wholesale arrangement like this. and i think that we need to demonstrate that we can do well and ultimately see that grow. and i don't want to speak on behalf of dish or charlie.
i'm sure he will, when he has a chance to comment on that. but i believe one of the reasons they view this as being a good move for them is their assessment of where things were in the industry is. they felt like we could be a very capable and more capable partner than their current arrangement. and they have motivations for a business reason to continue to deepen that relationship with us.
i would go on to say, as we think about what we do with them on this relationship going forward, there are a lot of options that we can explore. spectrum is certainly one that's open. we have a variety of spectrum licenses where our existing radio infrastructure can ultimately deploy and put to use some of their spectrum. that's been done through the pandemic.
we have options to do some of that, as well as we move forward. and look, i don't think any of us know over the course of a longer-term relationship what's going to happen to other regs and specs on spectrum. and i think parties will keep their mind open as those evolutions occur and look for some other options to pursue. but right now, we know what we need to do with the wholesale agreement.
but frankly, it's really no different than any other wholesale agreement that's in the market like what maybe verizon does with cable or what we've done with other entities that have elected to use this on a wholesale basis. jeff, do you want to add anything to that? your team did a great job pulling it together. is there anything you would add? 
jeff mcelfresh -- ceo-at&t communications
john, i think you covered the broad strokes of it. and i would just say the cadence between the two organizations and getting ready to begin migrating this traffic toward the latter part of this year and ongoing into 2022 has been very positive. i think the comments from the operation have been that the at&t network has got the capacity and the coverage. with all of the investments that we have made over the last several years, we can actually afford to do something like this and not worry so much about our spectrum position.
and our technology migration that we've got experience in and upgrading from 4g to 5g and making those transitions seamless is something i think the dish organization is looking forward to working with us on.
john stankey -- chief executive officer
i don't think anybody around here is upset about taking $500 million a year out of a competitor's pocket either so.
john hodulik -- ubs -- analyst
gotcha. ok, it sounds good, guys. thanks.
john stankey -- chief executive officer
thanks very much. operator, we can move to the next question.
operator
and we do have a question from the line of simon flannery with morgan stanley. please go ahead.
simon flannery -- morgan stanley -- analyst
yeah, thank you very much. good morning. i wonder if we could get a quick update on the warnermedia-discovery deal. any updates on timing, regulatory process, tax status, structure, etc.? and then, for jeff, you did an interesting deal around the 5g core with microsoft azure.
it would be great just to learn more about the details of that. any numbers you can give us and the opportunities that that gives you? thanks.
john stankey -- chief executive officer
is that a legal name change, simon? or you know, is it simon 2.0?
simon flannery -- morgan stanley -- analyst
we'll figure that out on the transcript, yes.
john stankey -- chief executive officer
i think the net of where we are in the discovery process is no news is good news. we're basically tracking through the process as we would expect to do. and i think you're probably familiar enough with these things. but right now, it's a lot of work with the regulatory agencies and document production, and providing information that's responsive to their request so that they can begin their reviews.
and all that is underway. there's nothing we see in that that's been particularly problematic nor is it far enough along, where i think you can effectively say that anybody has developed any position or point of view on something. so we continue to move through, and i would tell you, internally, all the normal steps are going on to be prepared operationally for when we would expect an approval. i think, as i indicated when we announced the transaction, simon, we expected it was gonna be next year and probably close to a full-year review to get this done.
and i don't have any reason to suggest it's gonna be anything other than that at this point. we've had some interesting and pleasant surprises. in some cases, i think we moved through the directv process a little bit faster than what we had expected. it's not a complicated transaction.
i think that certainly supports it. and if we were to be fortunate enough to do that because of the straightforward nature of the transaction. we'll take it, and we'll be prepared for that if that were to happen. but at this point, i'm expecting it's gonna be a full and fulsome review.
and we'll run through the process as we normally do and get to the end of it and probably have, as we approach the latter part of it, a little bit more insight for you as to what's going on. it's just a little early. jeff?
jeff mcelfresh -- ceo-at&t communications
yeah, simon, on the microsoft transaction, i think it's appropriate to point out that at&t and microsoft, we've got a very deep and wide-ranging strategic relationship between the two firms. and this particular deal that you referenced is just another example of how we choose to partner with companies like microsoft who have expertise in doing things. they do this day in and day out for a living, and that is scaled compute. and as you know, over the last several years, our labs, organizations and our network team has been hard at work virtualizing our core network functions.
what this deal essentially does is it brings microsoft to the edge of our network and supporting our network workloads at a scaled level for efficiency. and as a partner in this, our engineers and their engineers are developing this solution on a broad scale across the business, across the network. we're going to enjoy some anchor tenant benefits from that. we're not disclosing any specific financial details.
but one thing that we are not doing, and i've kind of read this in the trade and the press a bit, is we're not outsourcing our core network functions. we are relying upon microsoft to develop scale compute and storage capabilities at the edge, while we retain control of our network stack and the kinds of services and products that we are going to offer to the market. and as john has shared over the last four quarters, our focus here is to put our energy on the things that differentiate our service. and by doing this, it enables us to reallocate resources that we want or attempting to build.
scale, network, cloud compute capabilities, we rely on microsoft for that in their azure for operators capability going forward. and our product development teams, our engineers really work on a service layer and the kinds of products and services that we intend to provide with our fiber and 5g network to consumers and to our enterprise customers.
simon flannery -- morgan stanley -- analyst
any color on timing?
jeff mcelfresh -- ceo-at&t communications
no, we've not disclosed our product launches or capabilities. this deal just got announced, and it's in the process right now of the integration of the two teams.
john stankey -- chief executive officer
we'll know more at the appropriate time.
simon flannery -- morgan stanley -- analyst
thanks a lot.
jeff mcelfresh -- ceo-at&t communications
thank you.
john stankey -- chief executive officer
thanks very much. operator, we can move to the next question.
operator
and we do have a question from the line of david barden with bank of america. please go ahead.
dave barden -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
hey, guys, thanks so much. maybe two, if i could. the first question is, pascal, thanks for the information about what the prospective impact to the dtv disposition might be. i guess, a helpful mirror image of that would be, what kind of ebitda and free cash flow from dtv is baked in your current outlook as you've laid it out here today? and the second question is, obviously, two new factors impacting the earnings outlook.
one is changing vrio from operational to assets held for sale and the benefit from depreciation there, and then, the new kind of approach toward capitalized interest and having taken down the interest expense. can you talk about what those two factors are doing to inform the new earnings growth outlook? thanks.
pascal desroches -- chief financial officer
sure thing, dave. on dtv, we have not provided detailed guidance yet. but as we said, once we -- once the transaction closes, we will provide details to help with your modeling. in terms of vrio, you said that -- you asked about the impact of stopping depreciation and amortization.
think about it as $0.01 to $0.02 for the balance of the year, so not significant. and capitalized interest, we -- as you saw in my remarks, i said that it's about $250 million in q2. so think about that as being the zone you should model going forward. 
dave barden -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
thanks. and so if i do that math, it kind of suggests that the -- that for the balance of the organization, it's still kind of more stable is eps while you kind of drive the top line. is that fair?
pascal desroches -- chief financial officer
i think that's fair. but remember, we are stepping up our investments significantly across the board in mobility, fiber and hbo max. so that -- some of this is self-imposed by the investments we're making. and you're seeing the delivery of the return through the top line over time.
over time, we expect the continued transformation effort and continued revenue growth. we're going to drive operating leverage, which should translate into ebitda improvement. and i said this in my comments, we expect next-quarter ebitda to be flat to up modestly. and so this is really, really a good outcome.
the business is -- we are investing fully in our businesses, and we're delivering returns as evidenced by the revenue growth. and we're optimistic that all of that is going to translate into profit growth and cash going forward.
dave barden -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
great, thanks.
john stankey -- chief executive officer
thanks very much. operator, we can move to the next question.
operator
and we do have a question from the line of phil cusick with j.p. morgan. please go ahead.
phil cusick -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
hi, guys, thanks. first, john, there are a lot of questions about the retention promo you launched last year, and it keeps running. but maybe talk about what else has changed in the wireless go-to-market strategy aside from the retention promos in the last year. and then, what do you see driving the industry strength this quarter as well? and then, a quick follow-up.
do those boost customers, will most of them need new phones to come to your network? or can you just convert them without a new phone? thank you.
john stankey -- chief executive officer
so phil, since i have jeff right here, i'm going to go ahead and just have him address it since he lives this day in and day out.
jeff mcelfresh -- ceo-at&t communications
yeah, hey, phil, appreciate the question on the wireless business. we've been operating in this go-to-market model for the past four quarters. and i've got to tell you, it just continues to prove to be sustainable. when i think about it, and i'd encourage you to think about it as three simple elements.
and the first is we have simplified our offers in the market, and we remained consistent in our offer constructs over the last four quarters, despite really a highly active and a competitive environment. but the second element that i think is sometimes overlooked is our persistent focus on the customer experience. and that is execution across our sales and distribution channels, our newly formed a year ago customer advocacy teams working the grind on, improving the experience of our products and our services. and then, our network organization, it just continues to put the capital into the ground and drive, for a third year in a row, the nation's best network.
and those two things combined have responded and continued positive responses from the market and the end customers, both our existing subscriber base, as i think all are aware of, but also those of other competitors who are choosing to join the at&t network. and we've been able to achieve and sustain taking share in multiple segments. it's across the board. it's not in any one particular segment.
we're growing in consumer. we're growing in small business. we're growing with our firstnet position. we're growing in enterprise.
and as pascal mentioned earlier, we've set a 10-year record for net add growth here in the second quarter, but we've also set a record for our churn and the nps results that customers are giving us for our wireless products and services. and so in short, the customers themselves are telling us that we are doing something right. when you grow the top-line revenue growth through the subscriber growth, remembering that we are third place in market share. we've got just a little over 27.5% of the market.
our growth trajectory right now is roughly 35%, 36% share of net adds. we're doing it also efficiently. and through our transformation program and our distribution optimization, we're able to mine dollars out of the operations to support this growth and drive ebitda growth at record levels here in the second quarter, year over year, as well as sequentially. and so this operating leverage that we've achieved gives us confidence that this model is sustainable but we've got a lot of work to do.
so i mentioned, we sole have a third place share position in the market. we haven't made our way fully through upgrading our existing customer base on unlimited plans. we still are early in the cycle of upgrading our base on to the 5g devices. and so teams are doing a great job, we are satisfied, very -- i feel very strong about our position in the market, but we're staying focused on what customers want.
and as long as we're getting the positive response, we're going to stick with it. 
john stankey -- chief executive officer
and in terms of the overall strength in the market, phil, i probably -- i don't think there's any one particular thing i'd look at, but there's a number of factors. one, obviously, many people are flushed with probably incremental cash than what they might have otherwise have had for a variety of different reasons. and they look for things to spend the money on. and i would say that, generally speaking, these are high-value, high-utility services that we sell.
and i can understand why on the margin people may make a decision around that. i think, secondly, the postpaid strength, clearly, there's been some suppression in the prepaid market as i think value when things occur, there has been some movement in that direction. third, look, you got to adjust some of these numbers in the industry when you think about how many customer lines are actually what i would call an economic decision to pay for versus not pay for. and that probably is having a little bit of an impact on the aggregate numbers.
jeff, i don't know if you think there's anything else that you would point to.
jeff mcelfresh -- ceo-at&t communications
no, i wouldn't. i think you covered it.
john stankey -- chief executive officer
ok. 
phil cusick -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
and then, on the boost conversion? thanks.
john stankey -- chief executive officer
yeah, there is -- obviously, there -- i think boost, and we've got a situation where dish will work through whatever the arrangement is commercially with t-mobile on this. and i think there's been some public discussion around what that entails and what's happening. and we're not in the middle of that debate and what's occurring. and i think it still has a little bit of path to play.
but yes, there is a segment of those customers that, ultimately, if they were to come over to our network, will require a device change out. exactly what the pace of that is and when that's necessary and how it occurs and the total numbers of that, i think, is yet to be played out. jeff, is there anything you would add on that? 
jeff mcelfresh -- ceo-at&t communications
yeah, not 100% required device conversion. some require sim swaps, and they're a little easier transition, but you've covered it appropriately.
phil cusick -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
thanks, guys.
john stankey -- chief executive officer
thanks very much, phil. operator, we can move to the next question.
operator
and our next question comes from the line of michael rollins. please go ahead.
mike rollins -- citi -- analyst
thanks, and good morning. two questions, if i could. first, when you take the planned investments in 5g and fiber altogether, can you share the percent of homes over the next three to five years in the u.s. where at&t can deliver better than dsl performance in the home? and secondly, just going back to the dish transaction that you were describing earlier.
as i think about from the history, john, that you were sharing, when at&t entered into some of those larger wholesale deals years ago, it felt like it was more resellers and mvnos that were complementary to the at&t focus. a lot of it on prepaid before at&t was a larger provider in the prepaid category. so when you evaluated the deal this time with dish, how did you consider whether or not dish would be a competitor that may be more complementary to the addressable market that you're going after, relative to a competitor that may be going directly after this same broad set of customers and revenue that at&t currently pursues?
john stankey -- chief executive officer
hi, michael, so why don't i have jeff go ahead and answer your question on how we think about footprint for coverage of broadband, and then, i'll come back and touch on your point of view on the wholesale piece.
jeff mcelfresh -- ceo-at&t communications
yeah, mike, we've disclosed we've got investment plans over the long term to reach 30 million homes passed with fiber, which is clearly in excess of speeds capable by copper, cable or dsl. i would point to today, our 5g network delivers speeds over 250 million pops covered that exceed that of dsl. we have not made the choice or decision to launch wide-scale fixed wireless internet, but rest assured that the strength of our wireless network is providing options for us as we migrate some of our legacy wireline dsl customers off of that technology over to a better technology, served up with fiber or wireless. and where it doesn't make sense for us to invest in fiber for the long term in certain demographic areas or market areas, we choose to serve that with wireless, and we'll leverage the 5g existing network that we've got with our sub-six spectrum strength.
outside of that, we are not disclosing the number of homes covered by the wireless network. we generally measure that in terms of pops.
john stankey -- chief executive officer
so mike, on your comment, i think i probably disagree at the front end of your premise. i think we do things that are complementary in terms of we think they're accretive opportunities to bring profitable traffic on the network. but our portfolio of owned and operated services, frankly, covers the breadth of whatever a customer needs. i mean, there isn't really a customer base that we couldn't go out and sell an owned and operated service to.
and we've been in that position for some period of time. we have a very strong prepaid business, which plays in the value segment. we have a variety of different prepaid offers that are out there. we have great postpaid offers that cover a full gamut of things.
so yes, there are other operators out there that on a resale or mvno basis go and attack other market segments, but i'd like to compete for those customers on an owned-and-operated basis as well. and that's always been the case. now i think where we're at in the u.s. market maybe a little bit different than others is there is kind of a direction toward more owned and operated competition and resale and mvno operation.
and as a result of that occurring, the number of wholesale options, i would say, moving forward in the future, are gonna become a little bit more concentrated. and so you're probably going to see where you choose to put that wholesale traffic on your network to be fewer options to go out and pursue different partners. and as a result of that, if you want to continue to have an element of wholesale consistency in your market -- and to jeff's point, if you have some excess capacity that you can put to use and use it for either a fixed cost coverage or driving up incremental traffic in a place where you have some valid capacity, you're going to, obviously, choose to do that. and i think that's the case here.
and as i would also tell you, when you think about this relationship, a broader wholesale capability beyond just the wireless business is a part of this, which is really attractive to us as an infrastructure provider. it's something we do in our core. and there are opportunities for us to think about, again, as we deploy -- as dish deploys network infrastructure and where they go, for us to do some things that i think are complementary and helpful to both businesses.
jeff mcelfresh -- ceo-at&t communications
yeah, i would just only add, john, to your earlier comment during the call that we expect dish to be successful in the market. and so the competitive dynamics are unchanged here. and rather, we get to participate in their success at this point. so that's how we analyze it strategically.
john stankey -- chief executive officer
thanks very much, mike. operator, we can move to the next question.
operator
and next question comes from the line of doug mitchelson with credit suisse. please go ahead.
doug mitchelson -- credit suisse -- analyst
thanks so much. one for jeff and one for jason, actually. jeff, you we refocused so much on promotions and subscribers and revenues in wireless. and you mentioned on a few occasions the ability to mine for cost efficiencies to support acquisition.
what specifically are you addressing in the cost structure? how much is less there? would be interesting to hear. jason, i know you were super excited about the latin america launch for hbo max. what are the learnings from the launch in latam so far? what percentage of existing hbo subs have moved over to hbo max? and as we track the app downloads, i think it's upwards of 6.5 million since launch. and we're just trying to figure out how much of that is new subscribers versus hbo max existing customers pivoting over.
thanks so much.
jeff mcelfresh -- ceo-at&t communications
doug, in terms of our transformation agenda, i'd say we're roughly about a third of the way through. we've got two-thirds of the way to go. so we're in the early innings of it. key themes around our transformation and cost takeout are things like optimizing our distribution elements, be it stores and retail locations and indirect agents, as well as our digital and our online buy flows.
second area, the transformation is we are now at a point in time where we're managing a higher percentage of our volume through digital than we ever have. and because we perfected some of the elements in our product experiences of the past, we're able to enjoy a lot more self-install and customer self-serve capabilities. and that's required us to work through not only the buy flow experiences online, but also some of the platforms and the technologies that are behind the scenes supporting our frontline resources. third, our call center operations and our it organization are hard at work at just getting plain and simply more efficient per transaction.
and as i said, i think we've got probably two-thirds of the way left to go. it will take time. these initiatives are funded. they're inside of our outlook and inside of our guidance, and the teams are just hard at work, in the grind, day in and day out to drive it.
john stankey -- chief executive officer
jason?
jason kilar -- ceo-warnermedia
well, doug, thanks for the questions. in terms of learnings from latam so far, at an overall level, we're feeling very good about the launch, albeit it was only two days before the end of the quarter. and so, obviously, we are not sharing details for this call. but in terms of the biggest lessons, number one is the content and the stories that we have on the service.
the team did a remarkable job in terms of planning for this launch and making sure that we put our best foot forward in terms of not only original new productions, but also an incredible library. and then, the other three things i'd mention is distribution, obviously, is key. and we certainly lined up a healthy distribution partnerships ahead throughout latin america. the tech and product works, and it's a modern experience that we're very proud of.
and finally, you've got to have the value. it's the value proposition, it's a very strong one in latin america. and so to your last question, doug, in terms of incrementality in hbo migrations. we're seeing material incremental subscriber additions.
and so again, not for this call and not at this moment, but certainly for the next quarter.
doug mitchelson -- credit suisse -- analyst
thank you, both.
john stankey -- chief executive officer
thanks very much. operator, we can move to the next question.
operator
of course. and our next question is from the line of brett feldman with goldman sachs. please go ahead.
brett feldman -- goldman sachs -- analyst
thanks. two, if you don't mind. first on fiber, you've had pretty consistent net adds, but you're still underpenetrated. you're gonna be meaningfully expanding the footprint.
you've got a better service. you can match anybody's bundle. can you help us think through whether there's an opportunity or the time line for an opportunity to maybe step up that cadence of fiber net adds? because it certainly seems like that's an opportunity for the company. and then, just as a follow-up on the warnermedia side, you're six months into going day and date with the theatrical slate on hbo max and in the theaters.
i know that was a strategy that was unique to this year, but i was hoping you could give us some insight into what you've learned from that and how that might shape your view on what a more permanent strategy should be in terms of thinking about the theatrical release slate going forward. thank you.
john stankey -- chief executive officer
jeff, go ahead. why don't you tackle the first one?
jeff mcelfresh -- ceo-at&t communications
yes, brett, so the first two quarters of this year have essentially been built selling into our aged fiber footprint from the prior bill. we are currently deploying some of the early stages, our next 3 million bill that we've disclosed for this year. as we cited earlier at analyst day, the bulk of that inventory is going to come online toward the back half of the year. and so my expectations are that our net add performance takes a step up as that inventory comes online.
having said that, the thing that's really strong for us and exciting is: one, product continues to be durable, as you point out. it's the best technology. it's a great price value proposition. it's got the highest nps scores in the industry.
two, 80% of our net performance here in the first half of the year is actually new relationships to at&t. and that's given us an opportunity to move into those households with the best-in-class fixed broadband service, as well as offer up some of the other products and services like wireless. and so each of these execution elements, we believe, are going to continue to perform and continue to improve. this is not a quarterly game.
this is a long-term plan, and we're just building momentum quarter to quarter.
john stankey -- chief executive officer
jason, do you want to touch on the day-and-date issue?
jason kilar -- ceo-warnermedia
sure thing. brett, thanks for the question. in terms of what we've learned, there's probably two things i'd highlight. one is that the motion picture format absolutely matters, and it matters in a number of ways, but i'll highlight two.
it matters in theaters. godzilla vs. kong, which we released this quarter, it's done over $463 million in revenue at the theaters. and so clearly, motion pictures matter and will continue to matter when it comes to theatrical exhibition.
they also matter at home. and absolutely, in terms of the response that we've gotten not just from that title, but from all of our day-and-date titles. we feel very good about the response that consumers have given it in the home. in terms of the things in terms of where things go in the future, i think it's fair to say that -- and i've said this before publicly.
i certainly don't anticipate us going back to the way the world was in 2015 or '16 or '17, where windows were quite lengthy between theatrical and home exhibition, whether it was an a la carte transaction or something else. so we'll have shorter windows for a portion of our slate, 45 days specifically. but then warner bros. is also gonna be producing for 10 motion pictures that will be on hbo max on day 1.
and so i think that what you're going to see is this industry continue to evolve and to continue to innovate in ways that not only works for consumers and fans, but also works for our business partners.
brett feldman -- goldman sachs -- analyst
thank you.
john stankey -- chief executive officer
thanks very much for the questions, brett. operator, we can move to the next caller.
operator
your next question comes from frank louthan with raymond james. please go ahead.
frank louthan -- raymond james -- analyst
great, thank you. maybe just to follow up a little bit more on the consumer wireline. at what point do we think that can really start to see the consistent top-line growth with basically on all the fiber and broadband you pushed out? and secondly, on firstnet, where are we on penetration there? and can you comment on the firstnet base and what percentage of that are -- have been net new customers to at&t? thanks.
jeff mcelfresh -- ceo-at&t communications
hey, frank, we have achieved revenue growth in our consumer wireline business. and as pascal pointed out, we expect that to continue to accelerate, already looking at the 8% to 9% only in the broadband business. and so we've got confidence we've made that pivot now. in terms of firstnet, we are over 17,000 agencies.
we're ahead of all of our commitments with firstnet authority and all the ioc build-out commitments and payments as a result of that. and the subscriber base has peaked over 2.5 million. i'm not going to comment on what percent of that base is incremental or new to at&t. i would just leave you with we are growing market share in a highly competitive wireless business.
and firstnet has been a critical element for us to take share and unseat possibly other carriers who have long held a strong position in public safety and as part of the community. and so that program continues to perform very strong, and we don't see any signs of that slowing down.
pascal desroches -- chief financial officer
hey, frank, one other thing that i would add on consumer wireline. as we -- as i said in the first quarter, we expect profitability trends to improve. we saw they improved from q1 to q2, and we expect that to continue as we make our way through the back part of the year. and we will -- similar to what we've done with revenues, we will make the pivot on profits as we get through the back half of the year.
john stankey -- chief executive officer
thanks very much for the question.
frank louthan -- raymond james -- analyst
thank you very much.
john stankey -- chief executive officer
operator, if we can move to the next caller.
operator
and our next question comes from the line of colby synesael with cowen. please go ahead.
colby synesael -- cowen & co. -- analyst
great, thank you. i think one of the debates for investors coming off the warnermedia announcement was how you actually get to that $20 billion in free cash flow in, i think, 2023 that you've guided to. and when you just run the ebitda on the businesses that remain, you don't quite get there. and i think that the two things that you guys have outlined is number one, the cost synergies you've talked about, i think, $1.75 billion to $2 billion by that time.
and now you've also mentioned the $1 billion plus in distributions from directv. i guess, two questions there. number one is that, as it relates to jeff's response in response to doug's question being a third through the cost transformation, is that effectively a third through getting the $1.75 billion to $2 billion and -- any color there? and then, secondly, i guess, as it relates to the components, is there anything else worth flagging besides those two things, the cost synergies and the distribution that helped to kind of bridge that gap to that plus $20 billion? thank you.
pascal desroches -- chief financial officer
yeah. a couple of points to keep in mind. one, when you look at interest, once the warnermedia transaction closes, our net debt will go down significantly, and the interest savings for that are fairly meaningful. you can do the math.
just think roughly $45 billion of cash coming in, and that's after our directv cash that we expect to come in beginning of august. so overall, we expect a meaningful savings in interest, one. two, currently -- and we've said this on a number of occasions, currently, we are -- the contributions from warnermedia are not as meaningful as you may believe right now, given the step-up that we are experiencing in our content spending. so those two factors, i think, are things you have -- when you consider those factors relative to where we are today and the other factors you mentioned, i think that should get you to how we get to $20 billion.
john stankey -- chief executive officer
i'll just reinforce the things that we shared previously, colby, that we're on a $6 billion march on the cost structure, of which, as we've described to you just -- correct, we're about a third of the way through that. we've been reinvesting a lot of the improvements that we've been able to drive into the operations so that we can accelerate our market momentum. as we go through the back half of this margin at the second third, and then, the final third, we do expect some of that's going to start hitting our bottom line. we have some of it targeted for how we want to continue to move into the market, but some of it is going to move through our bottom line.
and it's going to ultimately be accretive to what we do on cash as we move through that. and that's part of our calculus on this. and jeff gave you a little bit of a description of some of the things that we are working on, but i would also tell you that a major part of these efforts and some of the stuff that comes on the back end is restructuring parts of the fixed asset inventory of our company. if you want to think about it in terms of the geographic footprint that we cover on the products that were associated with it, the operations that are necessary to keep those products up and running, these are pretty fundamental hard things to do.
they take a little bit of time. the business is doing them. and when they're done and we move through them, they have a meaningful impact on the cost structure as we move forward. and that's an element.
and then, i -- look, we have some market momentum in places as we just described to you. you heard our comments about where we are in the consumer space and the pivot we've made there. we like what we're seeing in the wireless business and think we have the sustainable equation that we can take forward that's going to drive growth in those things, and that's what's going to get us out to those numbers. 
pascal desroches -- chief financial officer
yes. remember, the guidance is for two years from now, so the first full year after the warnermedia transaction closes. so we believe we will grow our remaining business between now and then, given the dynamics that we're seeing in the marketplace.
colby synesael -- cowen & co. -- analyst
great. and then, just one quick point of clarification. you were saying then that the one third done, that's off the $6 billion broader cost savings target?
pascal desroches -- chief financial officer
that's right. 
colby synesael -- cowen & co. -- analyst
ok, thanks.
john stankey -- chief executive officer
thanks very much for the questions, colby. operator, we have time for one last question.
operator
and that question comes from the line of tim horan with oppenheimer. please go ahead.
tim horan -- oppenheimer & co. inc. -- analyst
thanks, and john, congratulations on some pretty radical transformation of the company and strategy. and i just in the same vein, would it be possible for dish to light up their spectrum on your passive as well -- sorry, nonpassive infrastructure wireless fees, the rams and the antennas relatively quickly, if they wanted to do so and if you thought that needs some sense?
jeff mcelfresh -- ceo-at&t communications
yeah, that is technically possible. as john pointed out, the industry, during the pandemic shared in spectrum to bring it to life to support the needs for broadband. and so there are certain spectral assets that are already engineered with our antennas and our radios that are deployed today.
tim horan -- oppenheimer & co. inc. -- analyst
and would that meet the fcc requirements on build-out that dish has at this point?
jeff mcelfresh -- ceo-at&t communications
i'm not going to comment on that.
tim horan -- oppenheimer & co. inc. -- analyst
and then, lastly, just on the whole go-to-market strategy, there's something that they may partner with aws and other hyperscale has just done a phenomenal job digitizing the customer experience. have you thought about the point of the same type of radical digitization for customers? aws can do same-day delivery, obviously, and it would really reduce the need for the number of stores that you have and a lot of other processes you have.
jeff mcelfresh -- ceo-at&t communications
we have done much of the very same thing in our operation over the last 18 months. in fact, i call it to a higher percentage of our volumes are flowing through digital. we are getting higher gross adds than we ever have before with fewer doors as a result of our operations and our transformation of our distribution channels. and so yes, we've got teams that execute against those opportunities day in and day out. 
john stankey -- chief executive officer
yeah, tim, i would tell you there is a fundamental reengineering going on right now of our supply chain and how we think about the logistics around that supply chain. and an element of that is, of course, as we've learned during the pandemic, folks have changed behavior. we've accommodated a lot of that, frankly, in terms of how effective we are in our omnichannel approach, but we also realize that probably elements of more in-home servicing and day-and-date kind of approach to it are gonna be what we need to address going forward, and there's a lot of work underway with that.
tim horan -- oppenheimer & co. inc. -- analyst
thanks very much for the questions.
amir rozwadowski -- senior vice president, finance, and investor relations
thanks very much for the question. i'll turn it over to john for final comments.
john stankey -- chief executive officer
look, i'll be real brief. i would say this, i think, with yesterday's announcement on vrio and those that came before it, i would say we put the bulk of the framework in place to optimize our execution and performance in the business. and it's as simple as that, and that's what we are focused on. and i'm pleased with the momentum as we begin this chapter.
i'd like to thank you all for joining us this morning and your interest in the business. i hope you enjoy the rest of your summer. and i look forward to speaking with all of you very soon.

operator
ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. welcome to at&t's fourth quarter 2021 earnings call. [operator instructions] and as a reminder, this conference is being recorded. i would like to turn the conference call over to our host, amir rozwadowski, senior vice president, finance and investor relations.
please go ahead.
amir rozwadowski -- senior vice president, finance, and investor relations
thank you, and good morning, everyone. welcome to our fourth quarter call. i'm amir rozwadowski, head of investor relations for at&t. joining me on the call today are john stankey, our ceo, and pascal desroches, our cfo.
before we begin, i need to call your attention to our safe harbor statement. it says that some of our comments today may be forward-looking. as such, they're subject to risks and uncertainties described in at&t's sec filings. results may differ materially.
additional information is available on the investor relations website. and as always, our earnings materials are on our website. in addition, the fcc spectrum auction 110 results have been announced, but we're still in the quiet period, so we're limited in what we can say. with that, i'll turn the call over to john stankey.
john? 
john stankey -- chief executive officer
thanks, amir, and good morning, everyone. i hope you're all doing well, and a belated happy new year to all of you. 1.5 years ago, we began simplifying our business strategy to reposition at&t for growth. as you can imagine, this was a significant undertaking requiring us to not only focus our operational efforts toward growing customers, but also doing so in a manner that set us up for an improved profit trajectory in the coming years.
simultaneously, we took on the task of structuring our communications, video, and media businesses in a manner that ensures their future success with the right capital structures, access to capital, and most importantly, the ability to drive better returns in a manner consistent with their respective market opportunities. i'm pleased with the results our teams delivered last quarter, last year, and for the last six quarters while this repositioning was underway. we finished last year with strong momentum in growing customer relationships, achieving outstanding yearly subscriber growth across mobility, fiber, and hbo max. in mobility, strong network performance and a consistent go-to-market strategy helped us lead the industry with about 3.2 million postpaid phone net adds.
that's more customers than we added in the prior 10 years combined. we achieved this growth the right way with full year mobility ebitda up about $1 billion. in fiber, we ended the year with a great build velocity, passing more than 2.6 million additional customer locations. we added more than one million fiber subscribers for the fourth consecutive year, and full year broadband revenues were up 6.5% as we returned our consumer wireline business to revenue growth.
we also surpassed our high-end guidance for global hbo max and hbo subscribers, adding 13.1 million subscribers in 2021, more than any year in hbo's history. hbo max and hbo now reaches a base of 73.8 million subscribers globally. warnermedia is well positioned as a dynamic global business. in addition to growing customer relationships, we also continue to make great progress in repositioning our operations to be more effective and efficient.
we achieved more than half of our $6 billion cost savings run rate target, which we've reinvested into operations supporting our growth. this includes simplifying and enhancing our customer experience, which has resulted in higher customer self-service, lower customer churn and greatly improved mobility nps and industry-leading fiber nps. we also continue to rationalize our low-margin business wireline services as we reinvest savings into segments that support improving returns. and you're familiar with the significant steps we've taken to reposition the company's assets for future success from our u.s.
video assets in vrio to our pending warnermedia transaction. together, these and other asset monetizations will generate more than $50 billion, and at&t shareholders will own 71% of one of the world's foremost media companies in the new warner bros. discovery at close. we also continue to generate meaningful levels of free cash flow, nearly $27 billion in 2021, a number we feel good about when looking at our business after the warnermedia transaction.
so to summarize, we did what we said we were going to do last year. i'm really proud of what our team has accomplished, and we're very pleased with the momentum we have. turning the page to this year, we'll be consistent in focusing on these same three operational and business priorities. now that our asset disposition initiatives are largely complete, i expect we'll take our execution to the next level.
to that end, we're encouraged with how the process for the warnermedia deal is progressing and now expect the transaction to close in the second quarter. going forward, we aim to be america's best broadband provider powered by 5g and fiber, and defined by greater ubiquity, reliability, capacity, and speed. we're confident we can achieve that because in wireless, our focus will be continuing our subscriber momentum while increasing the pace of our 5g deployment. we're confident in our ability to compete with 5g and our disciplined approach to selectively targeting and taking share in underpenetrated segments of the consumer and business marketplace.
while we're still in the quiet period, i can share that we're very pleased with the results of spectrum auction 110. we received 40 megahertz of quality mid-band spectrum that we can begin to put into service this year, and we plan to efficiently deploy it with our c-band spectrum using just one tower climb. we're on track to cover 200 million pops using mid-band spectrum by the end of 2023. and our network is only going to get better as we effectively deploy our new spectrum holdings.
in wired broadband, we have the fastest-growing fiber network and expect to capitalize on the expansion of our fiber footprint and accelerate subscriber growth. the best-in-class experience we provide is getting even better with our multi-gig rollout, which brings the fastest internet to at&t fiber customers with symmetrical 2-gig and five-gig speed tiers. this will truly differentiate how our customers experience the internet. coming off an outstanding year with hbo max, we plan to hand off the business with a strong exit velocity, and we look to further our international momentum and deliver more world-class content for viewers.
when the deal closes, the investments made in both content and hbo max growth, coupled with strong execution by the team, will ensure warner bros. discovery is positioned as a leading global media company with the depth of content and the capabilities required to lead in the next era of media. as we expand our customer base, we'll continue to responsibly remove costs from the business. we have a clear line of sight to achieving more than two-thirds of our $6 billion cost savings run rate target by the end of this year.
and importantly, we expect the cd savings start to fall to our bottom line beginning in the back half of the year. our increased ability to reinvest in our business will fuel growth and allow us to deliver an even better customer experience as we further improve nps and sustain low churn levels. as we expand our fiber reach, we'll be orienting our business portfolio to leverage this opportunity and stabilize our business wireline unit by growing connectivity with small to midsized businesses. we also plan to use our strong fiber and wireless asset base, broad distribution and converged product offers to strengthen our overall market position.
we're now at the dawn of a new age of connectivity where customers want more consolidated and integrated offers, and we're well positioned to meet that demand. our 5g network is already the best and most reliable. and it will be enhanced by our accelerated fiber expansion in 5g spectrum deployment, a great reputation for advanced and reliable networking and our expertise to bring it all together for the customer. we remain laser-focused on reducing debt, and we'll strengthen our balance sheet by using proceeds from the warnermedia transaction to achieve a 2.5 times net debt to adjusted ebitda by the end of 2023.
we also expect to remain a top dividend-paying company after deal close, with a dividend payout in the $8 billion to $9 billion range where anywhere in that range should rank us among the best dividend yields in corporate america. we're now in the middle innings of our transformation, and the momentum we have is real and sustainable. we're well positioned post deal close to have a capital structure and balance sheet that puts us in an attractive position relative to our peers. in addition, we believe it provides us with the financial flexibility to invest significantly in our business and the flexibility to pursue additional shareholder value creation initiatives over time.
we look forward to giving you more detail at our virtual analyst event, which we expect to host in march. now i'll turn it over to pascal. pascal?
pascal desroches -- chief financial officer
thank you, john, and good morning, everyone. thanks for joining us. slide 6 should look familiar. as our pre-release earlier this month already indicated, we continue to deliver growth in postpaid phones, fiber, and hbo max.
john just highlighted our full year results. we're really pleased with them and expect the momentum we've built in 2021 to carry over to 2022. let's now take a look at our financial summary on slide 7, starting with revenues. on a comparable basis, excluding directv and vrio from both periods, consolidated revenues were up more than 4% for the quarter and about 6% for the year, thanks to growth in our market focus areas.
adjusted ebitda was down 8% for the quarter on a comparable basis. growth in mobility was more than offset by a decline at warnermedia from the increased hbo max investment, the new directv advertising channel arrangements, and lower contribution from basic networks. our consolidated operating income results continue to be impacted by certain retained costs from directv that are in the process of being rationalized. apart from warnermedia's contributions, our communications segment ebitda was up approximately 2% for the quarter.
adjusted eps for the quarter was $0.78. in addition to merger amortization, adjustments for the quarter were made to exclude our proportionate share of directv intangible amortization and a gain in our benefit plan. for the year, eps was up nearly 7% with strong organic growth in mobility, lower interest, lower benefit costs, and higher investment gains. we exceeded our free cash flow guidance for the year.
for the quarter, cash from operations was $11.3 billion, spending increase year over year with capex of $3.8 billion and gross capital investments totaling $4.9 billion. free cash flow for the quarter was $8.7 billion even with a year-over-year increase of $1.4 billion in capex. for the full year, free cash flow was $26.8 billion despite an increase in capex of about $900 million and more than $4 billion in higher cash content costs. our total dividend payout ratio was about 56%.
this included cash distributions from directv of $1.9 billion. let's now look at our segment operating results, starting with our communication business on slide 8. for the second consecutive quarter, our communications segment grew both revenues and ebitda. a big part of that growth was driven by our increasing strength in mobility, which turned in another solid quarter.
service revenues were up 4.6% for the quarter and 3.7% for the year driven by postpaid and prepaid subscriber gains. postpaid phone churn continues to run at low levels and in fact, hit a record low for the full year. our strong subscriber momentum continues with industry-leading postpaid phone growth. prepaid also continues to deliver impressive results with phone churn less than 3% and revenues up mid-single digits.
cricket momentum continues with strong ad and phone churn substantially lower than 3%. mobility ebitda was up more than $300 million, driven by growth in service revenues and transformation savings. this growth comes without a material return to international roaming and with 3g shutdown costs of about $130 million during the quarter. we remain on track to successfully shut down our 3g network next month and expect 3g shutdown impacts to peak in the first quarter of 2022 at about $250 million.
in addition, we expect another $100 million of expense in the first quarter associated with investment in our firstnet operations and the completion of support funding for the caf ii program. business wireline ebitda margins continue to be stable as we rationalize our portfolio of low-margin products. in fact, margins were up 50 basis points year over year, thanks to our transformation process. this rationalization process will continue in 2022.
and as we lap the beginning of this process, we should see improving revenue trends in business wireline in the latter part of 2022. we believe we're really well positioned in the enterprise space. and there is an interesting dynamic as public and private networking stock. we have the account management infrastructure, the consulting expertise and the capabilities to support those businesses through that evolution as converged wireline and wireless solutions become the norm.
at the same time, we're energized by the opportunities that our fiber expansion creates in the small to midsized business segment, and we plan to be more active there going forward. turning to consumer wireline. our fiber customer growth and fiber network expansion continues. and we continue to win share wherever we have fiber.
we added 271,000 fiber customers even in a traditionally slow fourth quarter. and our fiber network continues to get even better with our new multi-gig speeds for at&t fiber. driven by our strength in fiber, total consumer wireline revenues were up for the third consecutive quarter. we had sequential ebitda growth in the fourth quarter.
segment ebitda did decline year over year due to a onetime pandemic-related benefit in last year's fourth quarter and higher network costs, including storms in the quarter. let's move to warnermedia's results, which are on slide 9. warnermedia revenues were up 15.4%, led by strong content licensing and d2c growth. d2c subscription revenues grew 11%, reflecting continued success of hbo max, partially offset by lower wholesale revenues related to the termination of our arrangement with amazon at the end of the third quarter.
content and other revenues were up 45%, reflecting higher tv licensing and theatrical releases. advertising revenues were down about 13% primarily due to lower audiences with tough comparison to the political environment in last year's fourth quarter. costs were up year over year due to a significant increase in programming and marketing, including the international launch costs for hbo max. incremental hbo max investments for the quarter was approximately $500 million.
the fourth quarter also included the impact of about $380 million in directv advertising revenue sharing cost. we also launched some incredible content in the fourth quarter, including the premiere of the hit series and just like that and the third season of succession. with the production team operating close to full throttle, we expect peak content investment in 2022 with an even stronger release schedule, including batman, winning time: the rise of lakers dynasty and the highly anticipated game of thrones prequel house of the dragon. now let's look at our 2022 guidance on slide 11.
what we're showing you today is a full year view of our consolidated revenue outlook excluding directv and vrio from both periods. our outlook does include a full year of expected results for warnermedia and xandr. we also included our full year expectation for warnermedia's stand-alone contribution to help you model post close. we now expect the warnermedia discovery transaction to close in the second quarter.
given this, we plan to update guidance for remainco at our upcoming virtual analyst event in march. until then, let me walk you through our expectations for the year. first, we expect consolidated revenue growth in the low single-digit range with wireless service revenue growth of about 3% plus for the full year. mobility ebitda is expected to grow low single digits plus over the course of the year as we continue to take disciplined share of subscribers with attractive long-term value.
as noted earlier, several onetime related impacts such as peaking 3g network shutdown costs are expected to impact year-over-year ebitda trends in the first quarter. consumer wireline revenues and ebitda are expected to grow on improving fiber subscriber trends. however, we expect front-end loaded investments to impact first quarter year-over-year ebitda trends as we ramp up promotional efforts around our new multi-gig offering. as noted earlier, we expect year-over-year comparison pressures to ease in our business wireline segment through the course of the year.
however, we expect product rationalization to peak in the first quarter, resulting in more pronounced margin pressures in the first part of the year before recovering in the back half of the year. consolidated adjusted eps is expected to be in the $3.10 to $3.15 range. this guidance reflects warnermedia's declining contributions due to anticipated investment initiatives, a 200 basis point increase in our effective tax rate and no anticipated investment gains. we also expect adjusted equity income contributions from directv to be about $3 billion for the year.
look for more details on our earnings outlook during our upcoming virtual analyst event. gross capital investment is expected to be in the $24 billion range and capital expenditures in the $20 billion range. free cash flow is expected to be in the $23 billion range. that includes expected directv cash distribution of approximately $4 billion and $2 billion in higher expected cash taxes in 2022, reflecting the expiration of the immediate expensing of r&d and lower limitations on interest expense deductions starting this year.
we expect warnermedia's full year contributions when including xandr to be revenues in the $37 billion to $39 billion range, ebitda in the $6 billion to $7 billion range, and free cash flow contribution of approximately $3 billion as we expect 2022 to be the peak investment year for hbo max. amir, that's our presentation. we're now ready for the q&a.
amir rozwadowski -- senior vice president, finance, and investor relations
thank you, pascal. operator, we're ready to take the first question.
",":
operator
thank you. [operator instructions] and our first question today comes from the line of simon flannery with morgan stanley. please go ahead. 
simon flannery -- morgan stanley -- analyst
great. thank you very much. good morning, john. good to hear the updated timing on the deal close.
can you perhaps update us on your conversations with the regulators, and what gives you the confidence to move that up? and when do you expect to give us the clarity on how the deal will be structured, what the dividend policy will be? is that going to be in the march meeting? and then if you could just give us color on what we should be expecting with the capex this year. what's the 5g build-out this year? what's the fiber build-out this year? any color there would be great.
john stankey -- chief executive officer
simon, so first of all, where we are when we set the transaction up and announced it, i think i indicated it was really important for us to put a transaction out there that we felt like we had a high degree of confidence that we could work through the regulatory process. and i'm really pleased the team has done exactly that. and if you kind of looked at the prototype of the time frame and when we expected various approvals and processes to work through, we have tracked right to the likely case analysis on that. and as you are aware, we've had several milestones over the last couple of weeks, including clearance in the eu.
we've gotten through our filing process with the sec. you kind of look at where we are in other international regulatory domains and what our exchange has been with domestic regulators, and all that is going right to pattern as we expected. and we don't see anything that causes us concern and consequently raising our confidence level that we can tighten that time frame of when we believe we'll have everything kind of line up and be ready to go sometime during the second quarter. so i'm really pleased about that.
i think everybody feels pretty good about where things stand. there's still work to be done, always is. there's a lot of moving parts. but based on how these things go, i feel about as good as i can feel at this point in that time.
and we're now moving into the mode of the cycle where we're making what i'll call the final preparations as opposed to anticipating what we have to work through. in terms of clarity on structure, i would tell you, we're pretty close to giving you some guidance on that. i would certainly expect by the time we get together with you in march that you would have some understanding of where we're going, at least that's what i would expect. ultimately, the board has to make a call on that and has to make a final decision.
looking at it, handicapping it and my sense of where they are in that cycle and what we know about how the markets have performed over the last couple of months, i think we're at a point right now where we're almost ready to call a question on that. our desire and our posture on that is we'd like to let you know as soon as we conclude. so once the board makes a final decision, we will carry it forward. and i think we're tight enough to the close window right now that we could probably do that as soon as the board is comfortable with the decision and what we want to do around that.
they've, as you would expect, put a lot of diligence into this over the last several months. they've carefully considered a lot of different options. there are pros and cons to going either with a spin or a split. certainly, it's attractive, and we're -- the reason we kept this option open is at some point, i'd like to get the share count circulated on at&t down.
and this was an opportunity for us to evaluate whether something like that could occur in order to do that. it's a bit of an unprecedented transaction in size. there's never been a split off of anything close to this number of shares with this kind of a base. we also have a very large retail base, and we have to be mindful of the fact that that retail base sometimes doesn't go as deep on the puts and takes and ins and outs of things as the institutional base does.
and we need to make sure it's transparent and clean for everybody involved in this. and as i step back and look at it, we need to be very thoughtful about what we started with is our watch word around this transaction, which was we want the shareholders to get value out of this. this is all about driving shareholder value. and given the size of the split, we know that there would have to be some leakage to kind of get that structure properly.
so as we kind of step back, we want to do something that's clean. we want to do something that's delivered. the board hasn't decided right now. there's pros and cons of both.
but i think we'll be probably giving you some sense of what we want to do around that in fairly short order. and we wanted to be transparent and claim. here's what i would tell you is kind of where i start this. markets are pretty good.
they'll eventually settle to the right place. and as i said when we announced the transaction in may, this isn't going to be something that's going to ultimately manifest and unlock the value overnight. we knew that this restructuring would take a little bit of time, both through a regulatory process and then the reordering and combination of the new assets. and so being mindful of keeping true to the best way to get value back to the shareholder and being patient as the markets wear out over time, i think that's kind of where my head is at, at this juncture right now.
and we'll finish the final touches on this and ultimately let you know fairly quickly. at the same time we do that, we'll let you know about the dividend policy and where we're going on that. we've already told you it's going to be between $8 billion and $9 billion. and i think we know enough about the market where it stands right now that no matter where we are in that $8 billion to $9 billion range even at the low end of that range, we're still going to be paying out at the top of corporate america from a yield perspective.
so it makes for a very attractive value in the stock right now. there's a lot of optionality and upside, especially when i think about how the media asset is performing and what's going on in the growth of the direct-to-consumer business and what we have for value accretion that can occur as we start to move up the kind of multiples that are warranted in that business. so i think that there's a good play either way around that. on the capex side, simon, we're not going to break out specifically what we're doing in specific categories of the spend.
what we've tried to give you a sense of is first of all, we've given you the guidance for the year. we told you in terms of how we're staging this. our spend starts to get more aggressive in the wireless transition into the c-band in the auction 110 spectrum when we hit midyear. and the reason behind that is we are in a unique position to be able to deploy both 40 megahertz of our a block from the c-band and our 40 megahertz from the auction 110.
i want to be careful about how far i go, but it's public and then the public domain that we've won 40 megahertz nationwide in that auction. those radios become available in the early part of the summer, late spring. and so to do that together at one time with one tower climb, that allows us to start really going what i would call good guns on this and scaling that up. and we'll be at 200 million pops for mid-band deployment, which will be an 80 megahertz mid-band deployment by the end of next year.
and so that's how you can think about the scaling and how we're going to deploy around that. and i think typically, when we've looked at an air interface change, it's been an $8 billion-ish round number to kind of get through that transition over a number of years. and i expect that, that will probably be the case as we work through the next three-year deployment of this air interface change.
simon flannery -- morgan stanley -- analyst
great. and on the fiber side?
john stankey -- chief executive officer
look, we've given you the direction of where we're heading. they're going to be at 30 million homes by the end of '25. you saw us pick up the pace in the fourth quarter. we wound up 2.6 million passed locations.
we feel like we're through the supply related issues. the organization is executing in the field operationally at a very good clip on that. and so i feel very, very comfortable that we're going to hit that 30 million direction that we've given you by the end of '25. as i told you last quarter, i'd like to get off of the number of homes passed in any 90-day period discussion.
and i think what you should be looking at is are we selling more end users. and you are going to see us start to sell more end users each quarter as we move forward, and you're going to see our subscriber count start to ramp as that footprint gets larger. and i couldn't be more excited, given our announcement this week on two-gig and five-gig offerings. we are going to be out in the market with a superior product.
we've had great momentum finishing another year of one million-plus adds. now with a product that's going to be even better, it's going to clearly demonstrate the superior capabilities and the infrastructure we're putting out there plus the footprint expansion, i feel really good about the moment you're going to be seeing in our subscriber counts as we move through '22.
simon flannery -- morgan stanley -- analyst
great. thanks for the color. 
operator
our next question comes from the line of brett feldman with goldman sachs. please go ahead.
brett feldman -- goldman sachs -- analyst
yeah. thanks for taking the question. your simplified mobile offers have obviously had a lot of traction in the market. at the same time, they've been out there for about 1.5 years.
and so it seems like consumers who are uniquely attracted to that have had a lot of opportunity to avail themselves. and so the question would be, how are you thinking about evolving your mobile go-to-market strategy or your value proposition? or maybe another way of asking that would be, what do you think the at&t brand means to the mobile consumer? what do you think it should mean? and what is your tactic for driving that perception shift? thank you. 
john stankey -- chief executive officer
it's a good question, brett. as we move through this year, i think you'll see us very definitively rotate into a position. first of all, i would tell you the strength of the offers that we've been on for a period of time is, in fact, that we've been on these offers for a period of time. and i don't view that as being something i'm concerned about.
i actually view it as something that we're really pleased about. it's basic, fundamental, easy for the customer to understand that we see no evidence whatsoever that we're losing traction in the value proposition that we have. and in fact, i would point to what we did this week on our broadband offer and trying to go in with an everyday simple pricing construct. and the reason we're doing that is based on what we learned from our wireless business, which is something that's very straightforward for the consumer to understand over time allows us to gain the right kind of momentum in the market that's sustainable.
it drives up customer satisfaction. it allows us to be consistent in our messaging that we carry out to the market. it ensures that every one of our employees knows the line and doesn't have to relearn something every 30 days, 60 days, 90 days. and so we're very comfortable with the messaging we have right now.
we're very comfortable that it still has room to run. and when we talk about a focused, simplified business moving forward, part of what we're attempting to do is move our entire product portfolio into a position that we can represent it in a similar fashion. and so this week's move in our fixed broadband products is really important when you think about lining that up and carrying that message forward. when i think about how we communicate more effectively around the brand, i think you've heard me allude to this in some previous conversations that there's a lot of things that i think the at&t brand is very strong and does very, very well in the market: reliability, reputation of consistency, there's a perception within the business community about advanced networking and the strength that we have around that, trusted in those regards.
but i also believe we can do some things to start to manifest to the consumer some of those characteristics we just talked about in a more real way, which is a more straightforward, simplified, credible, reliable expert. and i don't want to take away anybody's thunder, but i think you should expect after we close the warnermedia discovery transaction that you will see us maybe start to refine a little bit of the messaging around the brand moving forward in the market that will carry forward the kind of characteristics in a little bit more pointed fashion that we want to carry forward. i think that is underneath your question. and we've been doing a lot of work around this.
i've alluded to it in previous remarks. this isn't an advertising campaign. this is about structurally what we do behind the business to operate in a way that we think is going to be relevant with the consumer and get the operations lined up around that. so that what we tell the customer is, in fact, represented in our product offers, our service support, how they experience at&t moving forward.
we've been working really hard on that over the last year. we still have a little bit of work to do to finish that up. but i think by the time you get into the mid part of the year, you will see what that definition looks like and where we're going.
brett feldman -- goldman sachs -- analyst
thank you. 
operator
and our next question comes from the line of john hodulik with ubs. please go ahead. 
john hodulik -- ubs -- analyst
great. thanks, guys. first, pascal, thanks for the -- all the color on the guidance and per segment. but can you give us -- can you let us know what the guidance for '22 assumes for remainco ebitda growth? and then drilling down a little bit further, obviously, you guys cut the losses on the business side.
and it sounds like you expect sort of further improvement maybe in the second half of next year. could you walk us through sort of what's going on in that business segment to sort of rationalize it? and do you foresee the possibility of that segment returning to ebitda growth by the end of the year? and then maybe for john, just maybe following up on those comments. when do you expect to have these converged offers in the market? and is that what you're talking about in terms of refining the message around the brand, selling a package of fixed and mobile services? thanks.
john stankey -- chief executive officer
so let me do the front end of this, john, and then i'll have pascal just kind of walk you through the ebitda dynamics. so let me step back. we're going to spend a lot of time on this in march when we're together with you to give you some color on the business market and where we're going. but here's what i would tell you, you should understand we've been executing on over the course of the last year and the process we're in.
one, we've backed away from sales of revenues that are low margin, low strategic value products. and we've kind of been culling that out of the business profile. and some of that culling has been manifested in the results that you've seen over the course of the last year. and where i want the organization to move to is a much more crisp and intense focus on what i call owned and operated infrastructure.
i want the foundation of what we're doing in the business segment to really start from we're always putting the customer on facilities and infrastructure that we own and operate, whether it be a wireless network or a fixed network. and we've made really good progress in our distribution in emphasizing wireless distribution into those segments. and we're now coming in behind that with some of our fixed capabilities as well. and that partly is making sure we have the right fiber products available as well as getting the footprint engineered correctly.
so as we're out there deploying, are we doing the right things to pick up the business segments where we can grow in the small and midsized segment? we've been sharpening our engineering in order for us to do that. and so at the macro level, that's kind of the reorientation that's going on. and it doesn't mean we're backing away from the top end of the market. we want to still be that consulting expert for large enterprises and complex networking for those that need it.
and those that need it are typically broad distributed companies, not ones that operate two data centers based on how sd-wan is developed, et cetera. but it's those that have a lot of branch offices or many stores to support or restaurants to support. that distributed networking is kind of our strength and what we do and where we'll focus. but we can be a lot stronger in the mid and low end of the market.
and tuning our distribution where we had that strength so that we can be in with both wireless and fixed solutions is really the reorientation that we're working in that segment of the market and where we need to -- where we're making that pivot to ultimately get back to the kind of growth that we need. i don't expect in aggregate that we're going to see ebitda growth in the business segment this year. i do expect we're going to see that turn next year. and we're going to talk a little bit about that in march when we get together.
but that's kind of what i would say is the macro point of view of what's occurring. and the converged offers in some cases are actually happening today, especially in the mid and upper part of the market is we bundle both wireless and fixed together on the same paper. and i think you're going to now start to see things that are occurring in private networking that extend into the business space. we already are starting.
i can't disclose a couple of the larger customers we've signed with yet at this point. but you're starting to see that combined fixed wireless converged networking that i think is going to be relevant in the upper part of the business space. and then i believe you will see as we get into the latter part of the year us starting to do a better job of using both our fixed wireless capability to pick up segments of the business community early to accelerate revenues and then back in behind it with fixed facilities as we gain scale over time. but that should be something that really becomes more transparent to the customer where they're buying bandwidth from us and they're not caring about how we deliver.
pascal, do you want to give the ebitda guide? 
pascal desroches -- chief financial officer
sure thing. look, as you know, john, we did not give specific ebitda guidance, but i think you can get pretty close with some of the information that we've given. here are some of the dynamics to think about in each of our major businesses for remainco. mobility, while we expect some comparison issues early in the year, we feel really good about the organic trends in that business.
we expect continued growth in wireless service revenues. we -- transformation continues, and we expect some operating leverage from that. so we feel really good about the trajectory that the mobility business is on. i think you can get a pretty good sense for where that should land given our wireless service revenue growth, given our fourth quarter performance, we feel really good.
consumer wireline, the word here is scale. as this -- we feel really good about the build we had in 2021. as that business scales, the operating leverage is really good. you couple that with transformation, the consumer wireline segment is also expected to grow.
as you just heard from john, business wireline, we expect losses to moderate as we make our way through the year, but we don't expect that segment to grow. you layer on top of that an expectation of continued transformation savings on corporate and other. you can get a pretty fair sense that overall, the business is going to be, on an ebitda basis, flattish to up modestly.
operator
and our next question comes from the line of michael rollins with citi. please go ahead.
michael rollins -- citi -- analyst
thanks and good morning. i'm curious if you could dive a little further into the wireless business. and specifically, if you could unpack the wireless service revenue growth guidance of 3% plus, with respect to how you're thinking about volume, the opportunities to improve arpu and any contributions that you would expect from a dish wholesale deal that you previously announced? and then just separately on a higher level in terms of the asset mix. john, you mentioned that you were largely done with asset disposition.
and just curious if there's any further exploration of optimizing the wireline footprint or thinking about the future opportunities for your dtv business, and where that may better fit strategically over time?
pascal desroches -- chief financial officer
mike, i -- let me start. here's the way you think about it. first and foremost, the market remains really healthy. now for planning purposes, as you would expect, we are planning that the industry will continue to grow the way it has the last 1.5 years.
but overall, the market remains healthy. and in that environment, we're going to be disciplined, and we believe we will continue to take share in a very disciplined way. but for planning purposes, we have assumed that the overall industry normalizes to where it's been historically. that's one.
in terms of arpu, and i think we've said this previously, the way we think about this is as we make our way through the year, we have every expectation that we should see continuing recovery in international roaming. and also, what we're also seeing is our elite unlimited plan is our highest-priced arpu plan, and it's our fastest growing. and as a result of that, we expect to continue moving up the arpu stack. that's going to be partially offset by the amortization of some of the promotional expenses.
but all in all, we feel really good about the trajectory of mobility. 
john stankey -- chief executive officer
so michael, on your second question, so we set up the directv structure deliberately. and when i say we're through the asset disposition, i think the distinction i would draw there is the management team that -- of at&t remainco is not going to be distracted with having to work through additional work on restructuring the asset base of the company in the near term. and that doesn't mean that the independent directv company and the management team that is operating that over there might not choose to do something in their business. i don't know of anything.
i'm not announcing anything. but what i'm trying to distinguish is if that entity decided that there was value to be created to restructure their business in some way, shape or form, it is a distinctive group of individuals that would be involved in doing that and executing it. and it would not cause the at&t management team to have to spend cycles and energy working through those kinds of issues. and so i think that's the distinction i'm trying to draw, not to suggest that the directv asset per se is frozen in time or not.
in terms of your question on the wireline footprint. we spend a lot of time far back as 2012 and constantly revisiting and relooking how we wanted to work through the transition of our business. and i'm not a big believer right now that us going out and taking the less utilized parts of our wireline footprint; and sending them out to somebody at a steep discount; and continuing to have to do things like operationally provide services to that entity for many, many years to come on infrastructure, it systems, et cetera, that have to be maintained, is the right thing for a healthy and sustainable business. my point of view is that as a management team that runs networks and what we do around here, our job should be to rationalize those assets in an effective way and do it in the best interest of our shareholders.
and you've heard me talk about that. when i talk about transformation and shutting down products and thinking about how we become a company that offers products on fiber, what's going on behind the scenes on that is actually backing away and moving deliberately through a process of taking products that served us incredibly well. that have been the mainstay of this company for a period of time. and doing in a very, very smart and tactical way this shutdown and sunset of those.
and as we sunset them, take the high cost operating model that supports them away. and so when we talk about transformation and we talk about getting savings from shutting down applications and it infrastructure and product sunset, that's really synonymous with us actually walking away from square miles and infrastructure and costs and all the things that have seen their better day. and so we intend to ultimately capture that value and return it to the shareholder. not do it in a front-end loaded transaction that's highly discounted, that leaves us saddled with distracting operating models that don't allow us to be a focused broadband fiber provider, offering the best products available in the market. 
michael rollins -- citi -- analyst
thanks. 
operator
and our next question comes from the line of david barden with bank of america. please go ahead.
david barden -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
hey, guys. thanks so much for taking the questions. i guess my first one for you, john, we saw about 2.5 times more fiber homes passed in 2020. but over the course of the year, fiber net adds didn't really accelerate.
and so as we look at even more acceleration in fiber, when should we start to see the acceleration in fiber net adds? and what's the typical lag time from a passing to a selling opportunity? and pascal, i guess i was a little surprised to see the $4 billion growth capital investment premium over capex because i think over most of the year, we've been talking about maybe weaning ourselves off of that number. and i think that it raises the question as we look into 2023 and people have been, as you know, trying to bridge from this year's 26 to the 2023 $20 billion guidance given the higher capex and the loss of the $3 billion warnermedia cash contribution, how much vendor financing is baked into that 20 that maybe we hadn't been thinking about?
john stankey -- chief executive officer
so i'll take the front end, dave, and then you can get the color from pascal on the ebitda dynamic and cash flow. the answer to your question is, from the time we say go to about the time we're actually in the market selling is currently running about a year. and that's literally when we say go that we're going to start engineering and go into a particular area. i'd like that at maturity and the challenge i've got to the team is i like that to be nine months.
what's worked against us to do better than a year right now has been a little bit of spottiness in the supply chain that we've shared with you. it's really what drove some of the challenges to get to the three million objective last year that we ultimately ended up at 2.6. and as a result of that, we were back-end loaded in the turnup of the 2.6. that inventory came available for sale very late in the year.
and now it's out in the market and available. and as we shared with you, what we have improved fairly dramatically over the last several years is a rate of penetration once it becomes available for sale. and we're walking up that penetration dynamic faster. and so my goal had been, and what i'd still like to work the management team to, is from time of engineering to time of availability nine months and then achieving what we're actually doing right now on the penetration rates.
and so you are going to see that acceleration start to happen because we have put that inventory in the market. a lot of it came on late last year. and you should expect that as we start working through the quarter here and into second quarter, third quarter that we start crawling up that dynamic of putting three handles routinely on our net add numbers for broadband. and that's where i want to see us get, and we should be able to get there as we move through this year.
so that's kind of the color on it. but what we've been characterizing for you on our rate of penetration, teams made a lot of progress on that. and that's a huge economic driver of return, given the pace and the rate we're doing right now. but i wouldn't mind if at steady state, we got three more months of the build cycle.
supply chain has kind of been working against us right now and making that happen and maybe that clear sometime this year, we'll have to see.

pascal desroches -- chief financial officer
dave, on your free cash flow question, you'll hear more from us at investor day, but here's what -- just to reiterate some of the piece parts. for 2022, we are guiding to $23 billion of -- the $23 billion range of free cash flow. warnermedia is contributing, call it, around $3 billion. and we expect vendor financing to continue to be around $4 billion for this year.
you are correct in your recollection that look, we were going to look really hard to make sure that as we are doing these vendor financing transactions that we are getting the best possible terms. and to the extent we felt we can get better financing sources otherwise, we would do that instead of taking vendor financing. but we have found that more and more of our vendors are willing to provide us at very attractive terms and we're taking advantage of those. with all that said, the guidance we've given here anticipates $20 billion of capex, $24 billion of overall gross capital investment.
other piece parts are, keep in mind, as we close the warnermedia transaction, we should see a meaningful savings in interest expense and cash interest. and then as we make our way through the year and next year, we're going to hold ourselves accountable to continuing to grow ebitda at remainco. so those are all the piece parts to think about as you think about our $20 billion guidance for this year, and you'll hear more from us at analyst day.
david barden -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
and pascal, if i could just -- a quick follow-up on that. so if -- what you're saying is that in march of 2021, when you were contemplating not using as much vendor financing and you set the $20 billion free cash flow guide for 2023, are you saying that now that vendor financing is too attractive not to take that whatever capex number was in that $20 billion free cash flow number will fall, replaced by vendor financing, and that $20 billion free cash flow guide is actually going to be higher?
pascal desroches -- chief financial officer
i said, dave, you will hear from us. today, we are giving guidance on 2022. you'll hear from us on 2023 at analyst day in march.
david barden -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
all right. thanks. 
operator
and our next question comes from the line of phil cusick with j. p. morgan. please go ahead.
philip cusick -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
thanks, guys. it's funny. i know you're not going to own this forever, but the -- a lot of moving pieces in the warner side. can you talk through what's going on in hbo and how we should think about this going forward? obviously, a lot of issues with amazon sort of volatility through the quarter.
but should we think of this hbo arpu run rate as a good level going forward? or is there still expected to be volatility there? and how do you think about the potential growth rate domestically for hbo from here now that the ad-driven product is launched? you also said peak content investment in 2022. should we expect this to be a sort of negative ebitda all year? or do you think by the back half, we've got enough growth to get that back to positive? thanks very much. 
john stankey -- chief executive officer
sure, phil. let me give you maybe some color on the front end and then we can go through. so first of all, as you know, there's a lot of moving parts on the arpu side of things. one moving part is international arpus are different than domestic arpus.
and if you think about the growth internationally where that's going to be a large part of the growth moving forward, given the new markets we're opening up and the natural penetration that occurs, given the product is sized differently and starts from a different place, you're going to see that have an impact. generally speaking, those arpus internationally are a bit lower than the domestic arpus. second point, we've had launched, as i said earlier in my comments, the ad-supported product. and i expect the ad-supported product as a percentage of mix domestically in the u.s.
to increase this year. part of that will be because the products had a little bit of a different characteristic where the subscription product had access to first-run movies, the ad-supported product did not. effective january 1, products are identical now. and as a result of that, i expect there'll be some customers that choose to go the ad-supported route that may have gone the subscription route before.
however, what will happen is it's not that one is less accretive than the other. the subscription line will possibly dilute a bit, but the advertising line will increase. so when you look at the customer overall, they're no less profitable. it just books to two different places on the p&l.
and our goal, and in fact, what we are seeing today, we are indifferent as to what the customer chooses. frankly, maybe in some cases, it's a bit more accretive if they go the ad-supported route. so i think you just need to look at your geography of how that plays out more than anything else relative to the domestic side. look, we expect domestic growth to be more suppressed than international growth as we move forward.
we're in a great position. we are sitting at a large domestic base with a very high arpu. and the nice part about that is we said this was going to happen, and it happened. we said the market was going to come to us on pricing.
and lo and behold, we are no longer the high-priced offer in the market. and the nice part about that is we think it will allow us to have domestic growth as we move forward. but the base is in a really, really good place as a result of that. we don't have the struggles that maybe some other products that came in at very low prices are going to have to kind of try to move up that arpu continuum.
it's about being very diligent in adding customers at a moderated pace. and i think if you go back to our analyst day in 2019, whenever we did that, and we gave you our domestic point of view about what that growth is going to look like, it was a very measured and moderated point of view because starting with mid-40 million-ish customers allowed us to be very different given the arpus that we had around them. and then finally, we made that hard decision on amazon to your point. we felt it was the right decision.
i feel it was the right decision. i think it will even be more the right decision in a post discovery environment as the offer only gets stronger that's in the market and the content that's available. at the end of the day, you want full control of your customers. and i'm confident with the strength of the offer that will be in the market, those customers are all going to come back into the offer.
it may take a couple of quarters for that to happen. but there will eventually be a product out there that they're going to look at and say they want to be part of. and better to have them there where you have direct access, control of them, can market to them, know what they're doing than to have it be in some black box where you absolutely have no idea what somebody else is doing with aggregating your content and your exposure to the customer. and i would point that out again.
that is what our customer base is. there are a lot of entities out there growing ""direct-to-consumer customers"" that are behind the screen of the amazon marketplace that really are amazon's direct-to-consumer customers. they are not the media company's direct-to-consumer customers. pascal, did you want to add anything on the ebitda side?
pascal desroches -- chief financial officer
look, we provided you with guidance for warnermedia, what the contributions for the full year. and keep in mind, we are launching in a number of european territories as well as we plan to launch cnn+ this year. so we are going to be in the investment cycle. but overall, we feel really good about the underlying trends of our direct-to-consumer business.
and the balance of the business is performing exactly as you would anticipate. 
operator
and that last question comes from the line of kannan venkateshwar with barclays. please go ahead. 
kannan venkateshwar -- barclays -- analyst
so pascal, maybe one on free cash flow and a bit on the tender. but probably on the free cash flow side, if you think about the $20 billion kind of a number for this year, could you help us understand the breakdown? i mean, there's been some pushback, obviously, as you're aware, that the $20 billion number may not be a real number clearly on the back of the telecom business. so if you could help us understand how much of the contribution comes from the directv, the xandr bit as well as potential cash flow reversal because you might now get paid for hbo distribution instead of absorbing the working capital impact. so if you could just help us understand that, that would be useful.
and then the other source of confusion, i think, has been the impact of vendor and the relationship across the three assets, across directv, at&t as well as warnermedia. so if you could just understand the puts and takes. i mean, what went away with the microsoft transaction, how much of cash flow comes in to at&t and what moves out to directv, that would be useful to contextualize the cash flow number.
pascal desroches -- chief financial officer
ok. so kannan, i appreciate the question. so here is for 2020, let me try to break down free cash flow for you is that, overall, we are guiding to $23 billion. the contribution from warnermedia is about $3 billion.
the remainder of the company, including the contributions from directv, are making up the balance of this. and those both will continue post separation. the piece part to think about this year, relative to the past, we're going to have higher capex. and as john explained earlier, that capex is related to our formula spectrum as well as our continuing an accelerated rollout of fiber.
so we're going to have higher capex. but we do expect, as we make our way through the year, that our cash interest costs should decline because of the delevering that is happening at the company. and of course, we are growing our -- as i said, we're flat to up modestly on ebitda for the overall remainco. those are the big piece parts.
the way to think about xandr separately, xandr has the way to think about historically two pieces. you have the appnexus business, which is in the midst of being sold to microsoft. we have an agreement in place for that. and then you have the directv advertising inventory.
the directv advertising inventory prior to the separation was managed and included within warnermedia's results. upon separation, there was a new agreement struck that, whereby, warner media would continue to sell directv advertising inventory through the -- until close. and in exchange for that, warnermedia would not -- would receive an ad share. and so the vast majority of the economics of directv advertising inventory is going back to directv.
only a commission is staying with warner media. so that's -- those are the piece parts for xandr and the free cash flow dynamics.
kannan venkateshwar -- barclays -- analyst
ok. and could i just ask one follow-up on hbo? on the amazon deal, that probably caused some volatility in the quarter, but revenues were sequentially down even though subscribers were up and the arpu was also quite weak sequentially. but when you think about the sequential impact -- sequential revenue trends from here on, is that decline a onetime kind of a decline? how should we think about the cadence from here on?
pascal desroches -- chief financial officer
yes. kannan, yes, we expected that we were going to take a -- we're going to be decelerating as a result of amazon. it is a onetime decline. as we move forward and continue to grow subscribers, we would expect that growth from here.
amir rozwadowski -- senior vice president, finance, and investor relations
thanks very much, kannan. i'll turn it over to john for some final comments.
john stankey -- chief executive officer
so thank you very much for joining us today, and i just couldn't be more pleased with how 2021 turned out. as i started in my opening comments, we outlined for you what we intended to do through the course of the year, and i think we checked the box across the board on every commitment that we made to you. i'm really proud of the team. i'm proud of jason.
i'm proud of jeff. i think they've done a remarkable job, given that we've got a number of moving parts going on in restructuring this business to get the kind of operational focus that we asked them to do. and i think four quarters of results here demonstrate that. and i'm really pleased that we're on the doorstep of being able to complete the transactions that we have in front of us and allow both management teams to focus on moving things forward in the way they can with a clean operating environment.
i think the best days are ahead here as a result of that. thanks very much. hope you all have a good year. we'll see you in 90 days.

ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. welcome to at&t's first quarter 2022 earnings call. [operator instructions] as a reminder, this conference is being recorded. i would like to turn the conference over to our host, amir rozwadowski, senior vice president, finance, and investor relations.
please go ahead.
amir rozwadowski -- senior vice president, finance, and investor relations
thank you, and good morning, everyone. welcome to our first quarter call. i'm amir rozwadowski, head of investor relations for at&t. joining me on the call today are john stankey, our ceo; and pascal desroches, our cfo.
before we begin, i need to call your attention to our safe harbor statement. it says that some of our comments today may be forward-looking. as such, they're subject to risks and uncertainties described in at&t's sec filings. results may differ materially.
additional information is available on the investor relations website. and as always, our earnings materials are on our website. with that, i'll turn the call over to john stankey. john? 
john stankey -- chief executive officer
thanks, amir, and good morning to all of you. i appreciate you joining us this morning. two weeks ago, we reached a major milestone in the repositioning of our business with the completion of the warnermedia-discovery transaction less than 11 months after announcing the deal. i'd like to thank everyone who played a role in getting this across the finish line in good time and with a little drama, just as we promised you.
i'd also like to share how proud we are of the entire warnermedia team. david inherits an organization with one of the best global portfolios of beloved intellectual property, a team with unparalleled talent, and one of the few truly global direct-to-consumer players, as evidenced by the continued growth in hbo max and hbo subscribers which closed this quarter at nearly 77 million globally, up 3 million from last quarter and nearly 13 million year over year. we're excited about the potential for continued hbo max growth as the service launches in more new territories. warner bros.
discovery is well-positioned to lead the transformation we're seeing unfold across the media and entertainment landscape. and like many of my fellow at&t shareholders who own a stake in this new and promising enterprise, we're excited to continue to watch their success and the value they create as one of the leading global media companies. so let me turn to at&t and the new era and opportunities ahead of us. our transaction marks a critical step in the repositioning of our business.
we're now able to focus intensely on what we believe will be multi-year secular tailwinds in connectivity. we now have the right asset base and financial structure to devote our energy to becoming america's best broadband provider. over a five-year period, we expect a fivefold data increase on our networks and we plan to capitalize on the growing desire from consumers and businesses for ubiquitous access to best-in-class connectivity solutions. the results we've achieved the past seven quarters, all while undergoing a significant repositioning of our business, give me confidence that we can accomplish this goal.
our first quarter financial results are consistent with our expectations and once again demonstrate that our teams are executing well against our consistent business priorities. we're seeing record levels of net additions in mobility and consistently strong at&t fiber growth, thanks to our disciplined and consistent go-to-market strategy. in mobility, our strong network performance simplified offers and improving customer experience brought in the most first quarter postpaid phone net adds in more than a decade, surpassing last year's then decade best first quarter total. and we're confident we can continue this momentum in a disciplined manner, given our subscriber success has come from diversified channels that span consumers and businesses.
in fiber, we continue our great build velocity and now have the ability to serve 17 million customer locations. this expansion continues to allow our business to grow. and this quarter, we achieved overall broadband subscriber and revenue growth as our fiber net adds more than offset legacy non-fiber broadband losses. i'm pleased with the improved fiber momentum we're seeing with our multi-gig plans launched early in the first quarter.
it's also noteworthy that we're experiencing improved subscriber growth following the introduction of our straightforward pricing across the fiber portfolio, which does away with discounted introductory pricing. this improvement in share gains suggest that consumers are finding value and higher quality services when they're made available to them. so taking a step back, let's review our progress over the last seven quarters. during that time, we've added industry-best subscriber totals of more than 5.3 million in postpaid phones and nearly 2 million in at&t fiber, as our fast-growing fiber revenues now make up nearly half of our consumer wireline broadband revenues.
this is real and sustainable momentum. we also continue to emphasize effectiveness and efficiency across our operations. as we shared at our analyst day last month, we expect to achieve more than $4 billion of our $6 billion cost savings run-rate target by the end of this year. our focus on driving efficiencies continues to show tangible results from our network build-out to customer experience.
as we told you, we're initially reinvesting these savings to fuel growth in our core connectivity businesses. however, as we move to the back half of this year, we expect these savings to start to fall to the bottom line. our success over the past seven quarters can also be attributed to our focus on better recognizing and delivering on what customers want. our mobility and fiber net promoter scores are up year-over-year and near historically low churn levels across all businesses demonstrate how our improvements to the customer experience are real and delivering a positive impact.
our business wireline unit continues its transformation. as we move through this year, we had planned to accelerate the pace at which we reposition the business as we focus our energy on growing repeatable core connectivity and transport solutions where we have owners economics. at the same time, we'll continue to rationalize reselling low-margin, third-party products and services. the expansion of our fiber footprint is enabling our business portfolio to target significant opportunities in the small and medium business market, allowing us to capture a greater portion of the opportunities in core transport and connectivity.
in addition, as we open up relationships with more customers, we'll have incremental opportunities to continue our growth in business wireless. we expect to take advantage of these near-term opportunities to help stabilize our business wireline unit as we simplify the portfolio and grow connectivity with small- to medium-sized businesses complementing our leading enterprise position. as we thoughtfully fuel growth for services powered by our owned and operated connectivity assets, we're also being deliberate in how we allocate our capital. we've taken significant steps to improve our financial flexibility, and we're now in a much better place to grow our business as we significantly invest in the future of connectivity through 5g and fiber.
with the completion of the warnermedia-discovery transaction, we've monetized more than $50 billion of assets since the beginning of 2021. and with this transaction, we reduced our net debt by approximately $40 billion in april. as we share, we feel as though we're really well suited to navigate this unique moment in time. this leaves us in a much better position to pay down debt.
in fact, we've already addressed some of our near-term maturities and paid off over $10 billion in bank loans. this improved financial posture gives us the flexibility to carefully and prudently use the balance of the warnermedia proceeds to reduce our outstanding debt by opportunistically using the evolving higher rate environment to redeem debt securities at lower prices while also working to reduce cash interest. in addition, our expectations for continued strong cash generation provide us with incremental capabilities to reduce leverage while still paying an attractive dividend yield near the top of the fortune 500. this improved financial flexibility also allows us to pursue durable and sustainable growth opportunities that offer future upside for customers and shareholders.
if you couldn't tell, i'm proud of all the work the team has accomplished to reposition the business over the last seven quarters and could not be more excited about this next chapter for at&t. i know our teams are thrilled about the momentum we're generating with our deliberate and focused approach in attracting and retaining customers. i'll now turn it over to pascal to discuss the details of the quarter. pascal?
pascal desroches -- chief financial officer
thank you, john, and good morning, everyone. let's start by taking a look at our first quarter consolidated financial summary on slide 5. it's important to note that our first quarter consolidated results include the contributions of warnermedia and that last year's first quarter included results of our u.s. video business and vrio.
accordingly, our reported results do not provide a clear reflection of our business on a forward-looking basis. so let me quickly cover a few key points before reviewing the financial results of our new stand-alone at&t operations on the next slide. on a consolidated basis, including a full quarter of warnermedia, our adjusted eps for the quarter was $0.77, compared to $0.85 in the first quarter of 2021. in addition to merger amortization, adjustments for the quarter were made to exclude our proportionate share of directv intangible amortization and a gain in our benefit plans.
year-over-year earnings declines were primarily driven by warnermedia and, to a lesser extent, certain one-time costs in the communications segment. the declines in earnings at warnermedia reflect increased investments incurred in launching cnn+ and expanding new territories at hbo max. hbo max and hbo now reached an impressive global subscriber base of nearly 77 million. warnermedia's results were also impacted by the advertising sharing agreement entered into with directv upon its separation in last year's third quarter and the termination of hbo max's wholesale agreement with amazon late last year.
when excluding revenues from our u.s. video business and vrio from the prior-year quarter, at&t consolidated revenues were $38.1 billion, up 1.6% or $600 million year over year. cash from operations came in at $5.7 billion for the quarter. overall spending was up with capital investments totaling $6.3 billion.
free cash flow was $700 million for the quarter. warnermedia had declines of $2.6 billion in free cash flow year over year. this decline was driven by $1.2 billion in lower year-over-year securitization of receivables in advance of the transaction, $600 million in higher cash content spend, increased investments in hbo max's global footprint, and ramp-up for the cnn+ launch as well as nhl right payments and other working capital changes. now let's look at our financials for the new stand-alone at&t on slide 6.
on a comparative like-for-like basis, our financial results for the quarter are in line with our expectations for how we expect the year to trend. however, our subscriber metrics came in better than we expected as market conditions remain strong. this gives us confidence in the annual guidance provided at our recent analyst day. revenues were $29.7 billion, up 2.5% or $700 million year over year, driven by wireless and broadband revenue growth, partially offset by declines in business wireline.
adjusted ebitda was flattish year-over-year as lower retained video costs were offset by peak impact from our 3g network shutdown, continued success-based investments in wireless and fiber, and the launch of multi-gig fiber plans. we remain confident that q1 will be the trough in our year-over-year adjusted ebitda trajectory. we continue to expect the year-over-year trend line to progressively improve through the year. on a comparative basis, adjusted eps for the quarter was $0.63 versus $0.58 in the first quarter of 2021 due to higher equity income from directv and lower interest expense.
cash from operations came in at $7.7 billion for the quarter. overall spending was up year over year with stand-alone at&t capital investments of $6.1 billion. free cash flow was $2.9 billion. as expected, cash flow this quarter was affected by several factors.
first, higher capital investments as we ramp fiber deployment and prepare to deploy our 5g mid-band spectrum bands in the back half of the year. second, the absorption of 3g shutdown impact. third, increased employee incentive compensation benefits paid in q1. fourth, lower proceeds from securitizations.
directv cash distributions were $1.8 billion in the quarter, which is modestly better than the $1.5 billion contribution in last year's first quarter. we continue to expect about $4 billion distribution from directv for the year, so we do expect some moderation. given that q1 is a seasonally low quarter for free cash flow and many of the factors impacting free cash are not expected to repeat, we remain confident in the guidance we provided to you during our analyst day to achieve free cash flow in the $16 billion range for the year and on a stand-alone basis. looking forward, we expect to incur restructuring charges over the next few quarters as we continue to execute our transformation initiatives.
the cash impact of these charges has already been contemplated in our full year free cash flow guidance. now let's turn to our subscriber results for our market focus areas on slide 7. diving a bit deeper into our business unit level performance, the story continues to be simple and straightforward. the consistent, disciplined go-to-market strategy we implemented almost two years ago continues to work very well, and we're delivering strong momentum and growing customer relationships with 5g and fiber.
in the quarter, we had 691,000 postpaid phone net adds. as john said, this marks our best first quarter in more than a decade. this total also excludes impacts of 3g network shutdown of more than 400,000 postpaid phones. consistent with industry practice, we have treated this reduction as an adjustment of our base at the beginning of the period.
churn also remained near historically low levels, thanks in part to our improving nps, which is being driven by an enhanced customer experience, the strength of our network, and our consistent and simple offers. we're growing our customer base with this disciplined approach. our teams have maintained a strong focus on growing the right way with high-quality intake and by investing in existing customers. as mentioned in march, we're focused on incentivizing customers to shift to our current unlimited rate plans, which are designed for the 5g era and to better meet each customer's unique needs and provide greater value to both existing and new customers.
looking at at&t fiber, our customer base continues to grow as we expand availability of the best access technology across our footprint. we had 289,000 at&t fiber net adds in the first quarter and we expect to accelerate growth from here. to say we're excited about the underlying momentum of the business would be an understatement. where we have fiber, we win and gain share and our deployment plans remain on track.
we now have 6.3 million at&t fiber customers, up 1.1 million compared to a year ago and we expect customer momentum to accelerate from these already stepped-up levels. we continue to see strong demand for at&t fiber as customers seek out faster broadband speeds at an attractive price. and our fiber churn remains low as at&t fiber continues to offer a great experience and a consistently high net promoter score. now let's take a deeper look at our communications segment operating results, starting with mobility on slide 8.
our mobility business continues its record-level momentum. revenues were up 5.5%, with service revenues growing 4.8% due to subscriber growth. impressively, this growth in service revenue comes despite impact on service revenue of our 3g shutdown and without a material return of international roaming revenues consistent with our comments on analyst day, mobility ebitda declined 1.8% year over year, largely due to a number of onetime-related factors. ebitda was negatively impacted by over $300 million due to 3g shutdown costs and the absence of firstnet and caf ii reimbursements.
we remain confident in our stated expectations for mobility adjusted ebitda trajectory to improve through the course of the year as these impacts moderate through the balance of the year. overall, we continue to see healthy mobility demand. while our guidance does not factor in industry demand levels replicating the strength that we experienced in 2021, our q1 results came in better than anticipated. both our postpaid phone and prepaid phone churn remained near record low levels despite a modest uptick among lower-income cohorts as certain pandemic levels benefits wear off.
now let's turn to our operating results for consumer and business wireline on slide 9. our fiber growth was solid as we continue to win share where we have fiber. even with expected declines from copper-based broadband services, our total consumer wireline revenues are up again this quarter, growing 2% due to higher broadband arpu and fiber revenue growth. our fiber arpu was approximately $60 with gross addition intake arpu in the $65 to $70 range.
we expect overall fiber arpu to continue to improve as more customers roll off promotional pricing and on to simplified pricing constructs we introduced earlier this year. in addition, with the launch of our new multi-gig speeds in january, we have even more opportunity to move customers to higher speed tiers. over time, we expect these factors to serve as a tailwind to the trajectory of our fiber arpu. we also continue to accelerate our fiber footprint build and now have the ability to serve 17 million customer locations.
as you heard us share on analyst day, our plans center on pivoting from copper-based products to fiber. as we make this pivot, we expect positive ebitda growth in 2022, driven by growth in broadband revenues. also to help provide you with greater insight into the performance of our consumer wireline fiber operations, we've provided additional metrics in our trending materials that can be found on our ir website. looking at business wireline, we continue to execute on our rationalization of low-margin products in our portfolio.
in the first quarter, we experienced some impacts by the timing of government sector demand due to the delays in passing the federal budget, which caused deeper-than-expected revenue declines. however, we expect demand to rebound later this year. while the rationalization of our business wireline portfolio creates incremental pressure on our near-term revenues, it also allows us to focus on our own and operated connectivity services as well as growing 5g and fiber integrated solutions. both areas, business 5g and fiber, continue to perform well, benefiting our mobility segment with business solutions wireless service revenue growth of 8.4% and a sequential increase in our firstnet wireless base by about 300,000.
we remain comfortable with our guidance of business wireline ebitda down mid-single digits in 2022. shifting to slide 10, i'd like to reiterate our overall capital allocation framework moving forward. with the completion of the warnermedia transaction, at&t received $40.4 billion in cash and warnermedia's retention of certain existing debt. additionally, at&t shareholders received 1.7 billion shares of warner bros.
discovery, representing 71% of the new company. this transaction greatly strengthens our balance sheet and provides us with financial flexibility going forward. we now have a simplified capital allocation framework. first, we plan to invest in our strategic focus areas: 5g and fiber.
as previously said, we expect stand-alone at&t capital investments of $24 billion in 2022 and 2023. starting in 2024, we expect our capital investment to begin tapering to around the $20 billion range as we surpass peak levels of investments in 5g and transformation. the completion of the warnermedia transaction also marks a significant step toward achieving our established goal for net debt to adjusted ebitda in the 2.5 times range by the end of 2023. we've shared, as we get closer to this target, we expect our financial flexibility to improve.
this increases our ability to pursue other ways to deliver incremental value for our shareholders. as previously said, we expect to deliver annual total dividends of around $8 billion, which represents $1.11 per common share. this remains an attractive dividend and places at&t among the very best dividend-yielding stocks in the u.s. now let's take a step back and look at the free cash flow generation expected from our business.
as outlined at our analyst day, we expect to generate in the range of $20 billion of free cash flow in 2023. after paying dividends and noncontrolling interest commitments, we expect to have at least $10 billion of cash remaining. and beyond 2023, this pace of cash generation will be helped by the tapering down of our capital investment. this is why we continue to feel very comfortable with our capital allocation plans.
as i've stated, we're in a much stronger financial position to pay down debt. and at the end of the first quarter, more than 90% of our debt portfolio was fixed and we do not have near-term needs to issue debt. in april, we improved our net debt by about $40 billion and paid down over $10 billion in bank loans, providing us with a lot more financial flexibility. we also provided notice that we plan to redeem an additional $12.5 billion of bonds by mid-may, reducing our near-term maturities.
for the balance of the warnermedia proceeds, we plan to reduce our outstanding debt by focusing on pay down of commercial paper to improve our liquidity and opportunistically using the higher-rate environment to redeem debt at lower prices. so we feel really confident in our ability to pay down our current debt maturities in an effective manner and reach our goal for net debt to adjusted ebitda. amir, that's our presentation. we're now ready for the q&a.

thank you, pascal. operator, we're ready to take the first question.
",":
operator
[operator instructions] our first question will come from the line of john hodulik of ubs. please go ahead.
john hodulik -- ubs -- analyst
great. good morning, guys. a couple of questions on margins, if you could. first, maybe on the consumer side, numbers were a little bit better than we thought.
i mean if you look back to 2019, you guys were generating margins in the sort of 39%, 40% range. given the change in the business and the mix there and the higher arpus, do you think you can eventually get back to those kind of levels? and then i guess on the other side of the ledger, consumer -- or the business segment continues to be weaker than expected, thanks for the color there. but how much visibility do you have in the improvement in the margins and the declines there? any other color on that sort of rationalization of the portfolio you guys keep talking about? and should we see this improvement even if we see some economic headwinds later in the year? thanks.
pascal desroches -- chief financial officer
hey. good morning, john. how are you? consumer wireline first, let's -- the thing to keep in mind is in repositioning this business, we had -- over the last several years, we've been investing in our fiber footprint and investing and launching in new parts of our footprint. what happens going forward is as the business add subscribers, we expect margins to continue to improve.
and our cost base is relatively fixed once we've laid fiber out, so we do expect improvements over time. we haven't guided in terms of specific margins expected to generate, but we feel really good about the long-term view of this business. i mean you look at others in the space, margins are really attractive.
john stankey -- chief executive officer
and john, i'd add to that, if you go in and you kind of decompose what's in the transformation program and where we're targeting improvements in our operations in our business and things like reduction of call center activity that ultimately moves online, etc., all those things feed directly into that business that will -- it will allow us to scale that into the right kind of margin structure that i think we've historically been accustomed to, given the long-lived nature of the asset base that we're deploying. to answer your question on the business side, i'll tell you what we have visibility to. as we've shared with you, our move is to be driving harder owned and operated infrastructure into the low end of the mid part of the market. and in order to do that, that's highly correlated to where we're deploying new fiber or where we have existing infrastructure deployed.
we have good visibility to that part of it. so we know, as we deploy what we open up in terms of new market opportunity. in some cases, in order to get that market, we're shifting our distribution channels. so there is work going on around how we ultimately position to distribute the product both directly through our own sales force as well as through other third parties.
that's an execution issue. while we have control over how we progress on that, obviously, any time you scale up new channels and you work through things, there's things that you run into that are unexpected or that allow you to move left to right that you have to adjust to. but that's nothing new, that's the kind of thing we work with. and i think in terms of working through those issues, they usually are cycles that matter from a quarter or two.
they're not the kind of things that you hit a brick wall and can't work your way through. that's the area that i would say maybe we don't have perfect visibility over, but it's a question of whether you trust we can execute. and i would tell you, my view is we know how to do these kinds of things. i think i shared with you on the analyst day one thing that is very clear as we walk into the segment with the at&t brand on the product and service, it's incredibly well received.
and as i mentioned in my opening remarks, when we walk into these customers and we have the opportunity to talk to them about a new product, it oftentimes leads to a second discussion about possibly moving other parts of their services, like wireless, in that transaction. and that's the power of us in the business segment being able to go on with a complete portfolio of owned and operated wireless and direct fixed transport.
john hodulik -- ubs -- analyst
got it. ok. thanks for the color.
amir rozwadowski -- senior vice president, finance, and investor relations
thanks very much, john. operator, if you can move to the next question.
operator
michael rollins from citi. please go ahead.
michael rollins -- citi -- analyst
thanks and good morning. as you look at the postpaid phone volume growth in the quarter, how much of that do you attribute to better market share versus just better overall industry growth? and can you frame how the economics of these mobile postpaid phone customers are evolving when you consider the arpu, churn as well as the cost of acquisition?
john stankey -- chief executive officer
mike, sure. obviously, we don't -- we're first, so we don't have information as to how others are going to report this quarter. we, clearly, from the way we look at data, have some view of what's going on in the market. and i can tell you without backing that up with the actual reports from others, we believe the overall market still remains pretty strong.
and we're seeing, what i would say, consistent volumes to what we saw in 2021 in terms of gross add pool that is occurring in the market. and i think we shared with you as we were guiding, we expected that to maybe taper down a little bit this year as we were giving you our estimates and our expectations. and so far, at least through the first quarter, we haven't seen that materialize at this juncture. and i would expect, i don't know, but my guess is after everybody reports, i won't be surprised if trends are similar to what you've seen in previous quarters in terms of flow share overall for our business.
i don't want to overdrive my headlights on that, i could be surprised by what somebody puts on the table. but from my market sensing and data, i didn't see a material shift in overall flow share this quarter versus previous quarters. and i feel really good about that, especially given the nature of some of the promotional activity that occurred during the fourth quarter of last year, that we chose not to chase, stayed very consistent in the first quarter of this year with our strategies and approach and others are throwing a lot of different things at it. i don't see us out there with bogos and i don't see us out there with $1,000 incentive to switch that others are using in the market.
we've been very stable in our approach. and i think the thing that i would point to in terms of the overall economics is, look at arpus, they remain very, very stable, as we told you they were going to remain despite all the gains that are coming in here. and as we shared with you at analyst day, our cost per gross adds are getting better, not worse, because we're scaling that away now, where our fixed cost structure is obviously being spread across a larger number of subscribers on any given quarter. that's a good dynamic that's going on there.
and our churn numbers continue to be very, very strong. with our customer life cycle is actually looking better than what they've historically looked. that means better value. so as we've been sharing with you all along, we feel really comfortable that the economics of these customers that we're bringing in are no different right now than they were a quarter ago or two quarters ago or three quarters ago, and we'll take these customers all day long.
pascal desroches -- chief financial officer
mike, i would also just add, as a reminder, our fastest-growing plan is our unlimited elite, which is our top-tier plan. so that tells you the quality of what's happening in the overall wireless base.
michael rollins -- citi -- analyst
thank you.
amir rozwadowski -- senior vice president, finance, and investor relations
thanks very much, michael. we can move to the next question. operator?
operator
brett feldman, goldman sachs. please go ahead.
brett feldman -- goldman sachs -- analyst
thanks. it's actually sort of a two-part question on inflation. the first part is we saw one of your competitors earlier this week announced they were going to be increasing or have increased minimum wage for their retail workforce and a big part of their customer-facing workforce. so i was hoping you can maybe comment on what you're seeing in terms of labor cost and labor supply and whether or what you've anticipated in your outlook for this year for inflationary cost pressures on the workforce.
and then second, john, i think you've made some comments recently that if you did see inflationary pressures persist, you might look at what your pricing was, and i think it was implied that you could take price up. i was hoping you can maybe just elaborate on how you think about your pricing model if we were to remain in the sustained inflationary environment? and what gives you confidence you can execute a degree of pricing leverage even as the market remains competitive? thank you.
john stankey -- chief executive officer
sure, brett. so look, there is no question there's wage inflation in the environment. and frankly, it's 7% inflation. there is no question there's pressures across a broad segment of goods and services and we're not insulated from that.
i don't think anybody in the industry is insulated from that, and it's not a good position for the overall economy to be in. and i think from a policy perspective, it needs to be addressed. we were pretty deliberate when we did planning for '22, acknowledging that we expected we'd see some wage inflation. and we compared to previous years as we built the plan, we assumed upticks in wages as a result of that.
and we did several revisions late in the planning cycle that i would say those amounts added something with the b into overall cost structure into our expectations around that. we're in the middle of -- as you know, we have labor contracts. labor contracts are extended and ultimately program out wage increases. and we have the luxury in some cases, given the way the current wage market or job market is set up, that people stick around and work here because we have great benefits for middle-class folks and they often go beyond the wage that somebody gets paid.
and as a result of that, we've been managing through the dynamics of the wage -- the labor market pretty well. i will tell you, we're in the middle of some negotiations right now. those negotiations are likely to land in a place that i think is consistent with how we built the plan this year, which was a stepped-up wage level from previous historic levels. i'm not happy about the fact that wages are rising as fast as they are.
we're having to deal with it. it is going to drive a bit of an uptick in what i would call per individual wages. the good news is we're doing a lot of investment in other forms of mechanization and automation in our business. and some of that investment is helping us keep a lid on some of the wage-related inflation costs.
i would also point out that as you look at other parts of our business where people deploy long-lived infrastructure like fiber networks, wages are a portion of that deployment cost, not all of that deployment costs, and they are capitalized and they are taken over the life of a product that stays in service for many, many, many years. so well, obviously, we'd like to pay less in wages. it's not the end of the world when we're seeing a little bit of an uptick. it's a small portion of the cost of deployment and we can ultimately recover that over the long life cycle of the product, especially if prices ultimately go up in the market.
now to your question of pricing, i'm not going to give away or announce anything here that -- it's not appropriate to do that. but i'll go back to the comments i made a couple of weeks ago, which is broadly across the board in the economy right now, we are seeing inflationary pressures and the consumer is seeing that every place they go. it's my belief if we do not see some moderation in this fairly quickly that i think every business in the united states is going to be dealing with the cost of inputs. and i don't see the wireless industry being immune from that nor any other industry being immune from that.
and as i shared earlier, there's a lot of different ways you can deal with price adjustments. there's a lot of different tactics and approaches you can use. but when we're looking at the customer base as satisfied as we are, when we look at a customer base with some of the value we've been putting back into the product and service over time, when we look at our current churn levels do we believe we're in a position if we're forced into a situation where we have to start maybe taking some price that we can do that and move it through? our history would suggest that we know how to do that, and we can do that. and we'll be very smart and judicious as we have to apply it.
but running this business and not sitting here and evaluating where we have options to move on pricing and be successful, i wouldn't be doing my job properly. and i want to maybe go back to a comment i made in my opening remarks. if you look at what we've done in our fiber product this last quarter, we went to a simplified price structure. i want everybody to understand what this means.
we are not out in the market right now selling on 12-month promotional pricing on broadband. we are selling the customer on a stable price to the duration of the relationship with us. in many cases, we're in the market at a minimum of $10 higher to the promotional price that cable or the other broadband competitors have in the market. and our volumes were still stellar and they're continuing to grow, and we're doing incredibly well in that market.
and it's a reflection of the value of the product and the service that we're bringing in that we're able to do that. it's an example of us being able to smartly understand where there's value and where there's opportunity for us to work the overall value equation, including price, to be able to manage our business effectively and we'll continue to do that.
brett feldman -- goldman sachs -- analyst
thank you.
amir rozwadowski -- senior vice president, finance, and investor relations
thanks very much, brett. operator, we can shift to the next question.
operator
phil cusick, j.p. morgan. please go ahead
phil cusick -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
hey. a couple of follow-ups first. let's dig into the postpaid phone adds a little more this quarter. was there any impact from your own 3g shutdown on the reported ads? and what about the shutdown of t-mobile cdma network? do you see any impact there in the first quarter or maybe second quarter?
john stankey -- chief executive officer
hi, phil. the short answer is no on the first one. as you know, we don't -- when we count net adds, a migration of the 3g customer to another service plan isn't a net add. that's just the migration.
and so there wouldn't be any impact to that. and as we've shared with you, we restated our base numbers. those are out there for you to see. and so i think everything you can look at, including looking at arpu characteristics after the restatement, you should look at it.
and i would actually say, this is probably one of the best air interface transitions i've ever seen. when i think about the shutdown of the 2g network and now the shutdown of the 3g network on a proportional basis and the number of subscribers and what we're able to do here, i think the team executed incredibly well. relative to the flow share in the market today, i think we have seen over the last several quarters, sprint is -- had an issue for t-mobile to migrate and manage. and i know they're having to touch that base as they're shutting down the cdma network and moving things through.
and any time you do that, that can be disruptive to a customer base. and i think we've benefited in some flow share from sprint customers who have been evaluating what they want to do and see at&t as a good choice and a good value as they make that decision to whether or not they want to get a new handset and who they want to get it with. and there has been an element of that in the flow share in the market over, not just this last quarter, but several quarters as this has been going on. and there was an element of it in this quarter, but i don't think it was anything that was out of pattern from what we saw in previous quarters.
pascal desroches -- chief financial officer
yeah. phil, just as a reference point, 300,000 of the net adds this quarter were from firstnet. again, nothing to do with the 3g migrations.
phil cusick -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
ok. and then second, if i can. you've got a guide out there for 3% plus service wireless service revenue growth. you did 4.8% this quarter.
is there -- i mean, there's comping issues. but anything in the numbers that we should think is going to be a headwind that would drive a significant deceleration? thank you.
pascal desroches -- chief financial officer
we feel really good about how the business is performing. and we guided to 3% plus. as you've heard from john previously, this management team is in the realm of trying to put up guidance on a conservative end of a spectrum. with that said, the one thing i would remind you, as you move through next quarter, we're going to have a full 3-month impact of the 3g migration, so that is going to hit arpu some.
but we feel really good about the overall pace of the business and how we're executing.
phil cusick -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
thanks, pascal.
amir rozwadowski -- senior vice president, finance, and investor relations
thanks very much, phil. operator, if we can move to the next question.
operator
simon flannery, morgan stanley. please go ahead.
simon flannery -- morgan stanley -- analyst
great. thank you very much. i wonder if you could talk about c-band a little bit. i think you said that you would be ramping the deployment later this year.
if you could just give us some updates on when we expect that to really start scaling and what you're seeing in the supply chain then. and there's been a lot written about fixed wireless recently, and we've seen some good momentum in that market. as you get the c-band up, what do you think in terms of out-of-market opportunities or even the opportunity to upgrade some of your dsl base that may not be getting fiber anytime soon or non-fiber based? thanks.
john stankey -- chief executive officer
hi, simon. so the scaling on c-band is happening now, and it will continue. we're not -- as we told you, we're deploying midyear. that's when we have the right kind of equipment for our onetouch work between the two different spectrum bands that we can touch the tower once and move through.
we have capabilities to do prework on that. obviously, there are things that we can deploy today to get ourselves ready, make sure that we're in the right position. and we can start spending on and be in a position to scale that, turn up pretty rapidly as we hit midyear. so i'd say, as we told you, you're already seeing it move into some of the capital numbers in this quarter and it will continue to ramp as we move through the middle of the year.
and then that positions us to do the rapid turn up in the second half of the year and hit the pop targets that we've communicated to you through the analyst day. on supply chain, i'm conservative on this. i don't ever want to say we're in good hands, but here's the dynamic that i think is occurring. i actually think for the industry in aggregate globally, there are going to be some supply chain pressures, at least from what i know, where chip manufacturing is, it's going back into some of the key oems.
however, i think what you should keep in mind is that the north american market is an incredibly profitable market for providers of equipment on a global basis. if you were to start ranking it relative to other continents, it is the most profitable market of any continent out there. and so as a result of that, if you're into a situation where there's some degree of constraint, i think if you're an equipment manufacturer, you have the motivation to make sure that you supply your most profitable market first. and as a result of that, i don't want to say that we're out of the woods, but i think that we're likely to see a prioritization given the dynamics of this market that may put other parts of the globe a little bit lower down the list in terms of availability of equipment and services moving forward.
so right now, i think we have a good handle on things. our vendors are telling us they can meet our build expectations. we've done a lot of second order diligence on our equipment. we're not just taking their word for it.
we look at sourcing on key components within if we can't do every element. and sometimes it's the smallest and silliest things that end up causing a problem. we've looked at the harder things like at chip levels and feel that there's confidence in those estimates right now that they can bring them through. and so i'm not expecting that to be a problem.
but as you know, the global supply chains are fragile right now and crazy things happen, whether it's neon gas coming out of the ukraine or whatever, and we'll continue to work through that. on the fixed wireless side, i think you hit the nail on the head. look, we have hundreds of thousands of fixed wireless subscribers already. we've used it pretty aggressively in parts of the business segment where a particular business customer that we support finds it to be the right and best solution for how their particular business is set up.
we continue to believe that there are going to be applications for fixed wireless deployment moving forward, and we think our network will be well suited to do that after we get through the mid-band deployment. but to your point, it's going to be what i would call use specific. i don't intend to go into dense urban and metropolitan areas where i can build fiber infrastructure and offer broadband and try to use fixed wireless as the solution to serve broadband customers where we see estimates of traffic growing five times over the next five years and performance requirements needing to get significantly better. and we watch our fiber base, we watch our customers and we don't believe -- we watch our copper base of customers, and we don't believe a product that's doing sub 100 megabits is going to be a viable product in the market over the next couple of years based on how we're seeing consumers use the service and what they expect to do in some of these urban areas where there's broader and more dense environments, with more people in a living unit.
but there are clearly places in more rural areas where fixed wireless will be the best way to get the most amount of bandwidth out to a customer. and we believe we can play in those spaces, and there'll be some former adsl locations where fixed wireless will be a substantial step-up in opportunity. and there's going to be places where the government comes in with subsidy in very less densely populated areas that fixed wireless is going to be the solution. and sure, there may be some niche customers who can live on a very niche-oriented product for their particular use characteristic and find it interesting, but i don't believe that's the main part of the market.
i think it's really hard to market niche broadband products, frankly, over time. and i think market performance of what we're able to do is we blanket an area with a robust fixed fiber broadband service are showing in the numbers that we're putting up in our performance in the market right now.

david barden -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
hey, guys. thanks so much for taking the questions. a few higher-level questions about the new at&t, john -- or maybe the old at&t, depending on how you think about it. is the new at&t -- maybe -- i'm going to be greedy, i have three questions.
number one, is the new at&t a dividend yielder or a dividend grower? the second question is, john, last -- i think at the analyst day, you previewed that your plan was -- after the separation, that you would kind of refresh at&t's go-to-market plan. i was wondering if you could kind of maybe share an evolution of those thoughts or set some expectations around what we should see. and then finally, pascal, could you kind of describe and maybe share a little of the geography about how the go-forward financial relationship between at&t and warnermedia discovery will work, i.e. offering hbo max for free in the wireless business and those sorts of things? that will be super helpful.
thank you so much, guys.
john stankey -- chief executive officer
hi, david. let me give the front end. i'll try to do all three of them and pascal can jump in and offer anything he wants. i think we're a dividend competitor moving forward, meaning i want the dividend to remain at a competitive level relative to others out in the market, which means i'll pay attention to the yield of the dividend.
as we've told you, as we move past 2023 and we start to think about what we do with discretionary capital, as we have the balance sheet where we want it to be, the board is going to evaluate where the best returns come back into the business. and there's a lot of choices at that point. that could be what we choose to do on equity, could be choose on what we choose to do with dividend, it could be choose -- could be choices on we make -- what we make within the deployment on new business opportunities within the business for organic growth. we'll evaluate those in the complete portfolio where we stand and the relative competitiveness of the value proposition of the at&t equity with others in the market and adjust accordingly.
and so to answer your question, we'll pay attention to the yield, but i don't necessarily intend to every quarter look at it and say my expectation is that i have to grow the dividend in any given quarter relative to not answering the question of how do we stand competitively in the market and whether or not we think we've got the right kind of mix of how we're investing our capital and deploying it within the business. when you ask about refreshing the go-to-market plan, it could possibly be two things you're driving that. one could be comments i've made about what we're doing to refine the brand. if that's kind of the angle that you're going after, is that where your question is?
david barden -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
i think more specifically, john, the market's seen your kind of -- and you highlight this as a positive, your very consistent go-to-market plan on customer retention, the new and existing customer, hence that upgrade plan. it's been pretty solid for almost two years now. and i think you hinted that there would be a change. and i think people were interested in hearing a little bit more about it.
john stankey -- chief executive officer
well, there'll be a change when it doesn't work, and it's working just fine. and i'm probably not going to tell you what the change is going to be when it doesn't work anymore because that would kind of be self-defeating. but it's working just fine. and i would have guessed maybe last year that we might be hitting a point where we had to think about it differently, we're not.
and i think that's great. we have thoughts on where our next path will go if we need to go down that path. but we're not at that point at this juncture. i love the momentum we're seeing.
i think it was a great quarter. i like what we're seeing right now. and i like that we're watching others having to, in any given week or month, adjust their approach in the market while we continue to do exactly what we're doing. and as we continue to have the opportunity to grow our footprint between the two services, it opens up even more opportunity for us to do things on a combined basis that we're seeing really good progress on.
admittedly, our new footprint is still relatively small. it will grow over time. but i'm really excited about what that means for us moving forward in the future. and i think as i would stress, one of the things that's really important to understand is we're not getting our growth just through one set of go-to-market actions here.
i know you're focused and you're thinking about what we're doing in the consumer space right now. but i want to stress, firstnet has been really strong for us. what we're doing in the business customers that we have close relationships have been really strong for us. we're going to see us start to grow in some wholesale revenues later this year that we have not had in our mix up to this point in time.
so our growth portfolio is a balanced portfolio and it's not hinging on any one strategy. and i've been saying this all along, you need to understand that there's not anyone thing we're doing, it's a variety of things that we're doing on distribution that are adding up to the sum total of this, and feel good about that. your last question on financial relationship with warner bros. discovery.
we expect there's going to continue to be a relationship with warner bros. discovery going forward. i expect that that relationship will still be important to both companies. but i don't expect over time that it's going to be ultimately exclusive.
i think warner bros. discovery will want flexibility to be able to do things with a variety of players in the market. i think i understand why they'd want to do that. i think there are things that at&t can do to accommodate that and still have the right value proposition for our customers moving forward.
but i still expect there'll be a strong trading relationship given what we've had in the market is a portion of the success that we've had in being able to keep and retain customers moving forward. and we'll fine-tune that a bit as we move forward and make sure it's right for both companies. but i don't expect that it will continue to be what i call a captive or exclusive arrangement. pascal, do you want to add anything?
pascal desroches -- chief financial officer
the only point, dave, i'd say on your first question on the dividend yield growth. we've said this, the way we're thinking about generating returns going forward, dividends are only one part of it. we're going to hold ourselves accountable to growing earnings at the stock price. and it's a mix of overall return to our shareholders.
and that's what we are looking to optimize over time.

thanks so much. sort of, john, following up on the media side with regards to media streaming piracy, is there a place for at&t to gain any economics by helping streaming services reduce piracy given the breadth of your broadband footprint? i mean, netflix losing $50 billion in market cap yesterday suggests there might be value to the streamers. and i would think it would be important to the value you're giving your customers of hbo or however that evolves. and to help size that, how much password sharing did you see with hbo in the u.s.? and then if i could just sort of follow up, pascal, i just wanted a clarification.
the capex guide, $20 billion of cash spend plus paying down $4 billion of vendor financing in 2022, what should we anticipate for capex purchased on new vendor finance? thank you, both.

doug, so if i go back -- i don't know, i don't play a story in here, but if i go back probably three years ago, there were several comments i made or observations i made about the svod business, one of which was that managing customer subscription was going to be an important element of the long-term sustainability of the business. and that was at a time when i think somewhere in the industry may be advocating that rampant password sharing was somehow a good thing for these products. and i had a little bit more jaded view of that. i think there were probably some articles that were written to criticize me for having a little bit more jaded view of that.
but it drove a lot of the thought process at the front end of the hbo max product where we were thoughtful about how we built the product. we were thoughtful about making sure that we give customers enough flexibility, but we don't want to see rampant abuse. and so i'm not going to go into all the details, but there were a lot of things and features built into the product that are consistent with the user agreement, that has terms and conditions of how they can and can't use it. and we've enforced it, and we've enforced them obviously in a way that i think has been customer-sensitive.
you don't see anybody complaining massively about it. but i can tell you that we actively, in any given month, are looking at how particular users are using the product and have features and capabilities technically to limit what i would call rampant abuse. and so i would tell you that i think that's the right way for the industry to be managed. and i think maybe some are going to adjust practices and approaches overtime to try to get their arms around that, but i don't think it's the broadband providers' role in making that happen.
i think it's the owner of the applications role in making that happen. and i don't necessarily expect that we'd be trying to work on a product or service to market back to other providers to say we can help you manage that. i think there are adequate tools available in software and then how you manage your application to be able to do that. and i can tell you from our own experience, we feel like we've done that reasonably effectively in the interest of the product.
i'll let pascal go ahead and maybe pick up the second part of the question.
pascal desroches -- chief financial officer
doug, here's the way i think about it. we haven't provided guidance specifically on how much better financing commitments will enter into each year, but we provided overall cash payment guidance. and so we provided for '22 and '23, both years is $24 billion. so anything we do this year, we'd have to pay next year and that would be captured in that $24 billion guide.
and so while we haven't provided guidance, you should have a pretty good sense about where the overall trajectory should be.
doug mitchelson -- credit suisse -- analyst
all right.
amir rozwadowski -- senior vice president, finance, and investor relations
thank you very much, doug. and time for one last question. operator?
operator
walter piecyk, lightshed partners. please go ahead.
walter piecyk -- lightshed partners -- analyst
thanks. pascal, i was hoping to unpack some of the fiber comments you made earlier. you talked about rising subscriber growth over the course of the year. and then, john, you talked about basically higher arpus or basically charging $10 higher than cable.
i guess first when you look at the 289,000 that you did this quarter, what was the mix of conversions from your own customers versus taking it from other competitors that are out there? and then secondly, in terms of fiber, if you think about higher pricing, are you still seeing that kind of the penetration rate after year one and year two that we've historically seen when other companies have built out fiber? or is the higher pricing changing kind of the penetration rate that you think you can achieve for a second, third year of rolling out these new services?
john stankey -- chief executive officer
yeah. walter, let me see if i can answer your question, and pascal can jump in if he wants to. first of all, we don't disclose the mix. but what i would say to you is what you should understand is we do give you some information that you should be able to understand that we're getting a healthy growth of new subscribers to at&t.
you know, i think our aggregate share numbers in broadband in the market today and you know where those stand. we shared with you that our pen rates after we're in the market about three years has roughly an equal split of market share which is a substantial increase to where our aggregate market share in our broadband business previously stood. you can't, in a three-year period of time of fiber growth to get to equivalent market share in an area, do that without taking customers from the other side of the house. it's mathematically impossible to do that.
and so i think the way you think about it, if i were in your shoes, being an analyst, and you look at cash flows over a three-year period and you look at footprint expansion and you see that market shift, you should conclude over time that we're actually picking up, as i've described it, share points in a way that i've never seen a product move in my career. now admittedly, we put a lot of money into this infrastructure. and we should expect to see that kind of share point move, and we're getting that. so we are winning our share of new customers as a result of this.
and we report to you as well our aggregate revenues, and we report to you our growth and decline in our fiber and our copper base. and i think it's pretty easy for you to see the motion of what's happening in the copper basis to how much of it is likely moving to fiber and how much of it isn't. and i feel really good about how we're competitively performing. i see nothing in our performance that suggests we should be tamping down ultimate pen rates because of our approach.
quite the opposite, as we shared with you, our pen rates are accelerating, they're not declining. if you look at where we were several years ago. and a lot of our new builds right now, we're achieving year two pen rates in year one. and there's a lot of reasons behind that, not just one.
the great product is the foundation of it. the part of it is how we're building right now, we're much less swiss cheese, which allows us to be a lot more effective in our marketing. and we've developed much better tactics as we move into a neighborhood to be able to get early adopters to move in at a much higher rate and pace. and that has a huge impact on the economics of the business case.
if we sustain that moving forward, i'm going to frankly be relooking kind of the overall economics of the fiber business case because one of the big variables on leverage in the business case, is if you can accelerate your penetration by a year, it dramatically improves kind of the return characteristics. so i'm really proud of what the team has done in that regard. and we have no expectation by the time we get to year three that, that's going to suggest that we shouldn't expect our split of the market as a result of that. remember, we're not charging more to the customer.
we're giving the customer a better experience. we're getting rid of promotional pricing, it is a pain point for customers. they hate it. they hate the 12-month mark.
and when they're using another service, that 12-month mark means their price is going up $15 or $20, and that's just a really bad thing for a customer. and so now we put out a very simple, straightforward constant price, where the customer isn't going to see that step up for 12 months. they know what the equipment pricing is on the front end. they're getting the square deal.
they're getting a great product. and they're happiest clams and it shows in the data.
walter piecyk -- lightshed partners -- analyst
and apparently, i guess the high split investments, if you can call it that by cable, is not really helping to fight those shifts. can i just switch to wireless, john? you mentioned about wholesale as another component of growth. and then i looked at the wholesale revenue this quarter, and it didn't move much from q1. i guess that just implies that you're in the very early stages of the shift of that dish wholesale traffic to your network.
how do we expect that to ramp? is it linear? is it -- i know you've already started to connect to dish. how should that play out over the course of 2022 and 2023?
john stankey -- chief executive officer
that's an accurate assumption, walt. it has to do with the ramp directly from dish. and i think the way you should think about this, it's public information, that i think dish got a little bit of a reprieve from t-mobile on some of the legacy network availability and some help on that slowed down the front end a little bit. and i think you're aware of where dish is in their deployment and debugging their network so that it actually can function and work properly.
i think they recently announced a milestone as to what they're doing around that. those two things are the drivers of when that transition occurs, a combination of when those customers need to move off of another network as well as, as dish starts to move people on to their network, new customers coming in, those all play in the wholesale arrangement as that volume starts to ramp. so i think a surrogate for understanding that trend line, we'll be watching the loading of new customers onto dish's new network capabilities.
amir rozwadowski -- senior vice president, finance, and investor relations
thanks very much, walter. and with that, i'll turn it over to john for some final comments.
john stankey -- chief executive officer
just really briefly to all of you. first of all, thanks for joining us today. and i really want to extend my thanks and appreciation to all of you on the call. i know it's been going on internally at at&t in terms of the number of filings, schedules we've had to develop, the information we've had to put out over the course of the last month or so.
and i know that that puts a lot of work on all of you to kind of parse through that, get through this transition that we've been working through as a business. i want to extend my appreciation for your patience in that regard. and what i can promise is it should settle down here a little bit going forward. and i'm as excited about that as i'm sure you are.
so thanks very much for being with us today, and we'll talk to you again in 90 days.

ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. welcome to at&t's second quarter 2022 earnings call. [operator instructions] as a reminder, this conference is being recorded. i would like to turn the conference call over to our host, amir rozwadowski, senior vice president of finance and investor relations.
please go ahead.
amir rozwadowski -- senior vice president, finance, and investor relations
thank you, and good morning, everyone. welcome to our second quarter call. i'm amir rozwadowski, head of investor relations for at&t. joining me on the call today are john stankey, our ceo, and pascal desroches, our cfo.
before we begin, i need to call your attention to our safe harbor statement. it says that some of our comments today may be forward-looking. as such, they're subject to risks and uncertainties described in at&t's sec filings. results may differ materially.
i also want to remind you that we are in the quiet period for the fcc spectrum auction 108. so unfortunately, we can't answer questions about that today. and as always, additional information and earnings materials are available on the investor relations website. with that, i'll turn the call over to john stankey.
john? 
john stankey -- chief executive officer
thanks, amir. and good morning, everyone. thank you for joining us today. last quarter, i shared that at&t had entered a new era with the right asset base capabilities and financial structure to become america's best broadband provider.
i'm happy to share this morning that we're continuing our progress, improving our infrastructure and expanding our customer base across our twin engines of growth, 5g, and fiber. we saw historic levels of second quarter net additions, thanks to our discipline and consistent go-to-market strategy and solid execution, building fiber and deploying our mid-band 5g spectrum assets. in mobility, we brought in the most second quarter postpaid phone net adds in more than a decade, just like last quarter, building on our momentum from 2021. it's noteworthy that we've sustained this momentum in a highly competitive environment.
industry growth in the first half of 2022 has been stronger than the expectations i shared with you late last year. in our view, this strong performance reinforces that our success is not solely promotion-led, but instead reflective of our improved value proposition in the market. even though better-than-anticipated customer growth metrics resulted in some higher-than-expected success-based investment, arpu and profitability in 2q improved, and we expect that trend line to accelerate in the second half of the year. as pascal will discuss shortly, we're, in fact, increasing our service revenue growth guidance for 2022.
in fiber, we continue to invest in building out a premium network, drive a great build velocity and deliver on our stated expectations for accelerated customer growth through improved penetration rates. we're finding success in serving more customers in new and existing markets with what we believe is the best wired internet offering available. this is evidenced by our more than 300,000 second quarter at&t fiber net adds, marking our 10th straight quarter with more than 200,000 fiber net adds. the strength and value of the at&t fiber experience is enabling us to increase share in our fiber footprint and convert more ip broadband internet subscribers to fiber subscribers.
ultimately, our fiber strategy is a sustainable and long-term technology play that will support key macro trends. we expect to see a continuation of favorable arpu trends as we expand the availability of what we believe is a best-in-class network with a multi-decade lifespan. so i'm very pleased with the strong customer growth we're seeing. our success only reinforces the improved value proposition we're providing, and we expect our investment in top-tier technology to translate into strong resiliency for our services for years to come.
over the last eight quarters, we've achieved an industry-best 6 million postpaid phone net adds while adding nearly 2.3 million at&t fiber customers, increasing our fiber subscriber base by more than 50%. i'm also very proud with the progress our teams have made in rapidly expanding our 5g and fiber footprints. i'm pleased to say that we've achieved our target of covering 70 million mid-band pops two quarters ahead of our year-end target and are now on track to approach 100 million mid-band pops by the end of this year. and our expanded consumer wireline fiber footprint now gives us the ability to serve 18 million customer locations.
this is an increase of nearly 2 million from the start of the year. our teams are running hard to deliver these world-class services to our customers. and we expect our commitment to investing in our core connectivity networks to serve as the foundation for at&t's growth for decades to come. moving to our second major priority.
it's more important than ever we'd be effective and efficient across our operations. the dispositions we executed over the last two years provide us with operating flexibility to adjust, as needed, what is proving to be an increasingly pressured economic backdrop without requiring us to materially compromise on our investment priorities and financial obligations. we have strong visibility on achieving more than $4 billion of our $6 billion transformation cost savings run rate target by the end of this year. as we shared before, we've initially reinvested these savings to fuel growth in our core connectivity businesses.
however, as we enter the back half of this year, we expect these savings to start to contribute to the bottom line. as you're likely aware, we're taking proactive measures, such as selective pricing adjustments, to address as much of the very real inflationary pressures that are clearly impacting all parts of our economy. the pricing strategy we implemented is being executed in a proactive and methodical way that enables some of our longest-standing customers the opportunity to take advantage of our most robust offers while also ensuring that we're responding to the real-time cost pressures in our business. i believe we've navigated this difficult reality effectively and, thus far, are seeing results that are consistent with our expectations, although not sufficient to cover all inflationary impacts.
last quarter, i shared that we're seeing inflationary pressures, and we estimate those to be more than $1 billion above the elevated cost expectations embedded into our outlook. we're clearly operating in different times, and the macroeconomic backdrop is evolving in a dynamic manner. still, we're confident in our ability to emerge in this chapter a stronger company, thanks to our position as one of the world's largest-scaled telecom operators, our improved underlying financial flexibility, the cost reduction initiatives we have in place, the essential nature of the services we provide and our pricing actions that help partially offset these impacts. with that said, the current environment is not easy to predict.
we're seeing more pressure on business wireline than expected. and on the consumer side of our business, we're seeing an increase in bad debt to slightly higher than pre-pandemic levels, as well as extended cash collection cycles. however, it's important to note that historical patterns in previous economic cycles suggest customers have managed their accounts similar to what we're experiencing today. in fact, we feel even better about the resiliency of our services, given the elevated importance of connectivity in everyone's lives.
we view this cycle no differently and still expect customers will pay their bills, albeit a little less timely. furthermore, as i mentioned before, we feel better about our underlying financial flexibility that we have in quite a while. this is why we're confident, we can maintain our focus for growth over the long term by investing in the future of connectivity through 5g and fiber. it's our belief that near-term cyclical economic uncertainty does not warrant a retrenchment in the deployment of long-lived assets.
the long-term economic justification for these investments remain sound, and timing of the market development supports our intent to invest through this cycle. importantly, we maintained our focus on paying down debt, with the $40 billion in proceeds from the completion of the warnermedia discovery transaction in april helping us to significantly reduce our net debt in the quarter. i'd also like to touch on free cash flow directly. while free cash did come in lower than we expected this quarter, there were several notable factors that drove this.
the first is the timing of higher success-based investments on the back of our robust customer growth. additionally, we front-end loaded our capital investment plans in order to kick-start our growth initiatives. we expect these plans to seasonally moderate through the course of the year as we achieve our $24 billion in capital investment plan. and i'm pleased we've been able to effectively manage our supply chain and front-end load some of our work this year.
in addition to these investment-driven impacts, we're seeing some longer collection cycles and inflationary costs that we've not been successful in fully offsetting. these cash flow impacts, along with expectations for a more tempered economic climate in the latter half of the year, have led us to adjust our cash flow expectations for the full year, even with our expected material improvements over the next two quarters. the key takeaway is that we understand the emerging economic pressures on our business and feel confident in our ability to manage through them while, at the same time, investing for the long-term benefit of our customers and shareholders. while we're not immune to the pressures impacting the broader economy, the repositioning of our business to focus on core connectivity solutions, the underlying financial flexibility achieved through a significant reduction of our debt and the ability to invest in access technologies built for the long term allows us to opportunistically maneuver through this economic climate.
finally, i want to take a moment to discuss our business wireline unit and our focused efforts to reposition the asset. there is a sizable base of business revenue coming from legacy voice and data services, and this business is increasingly facing secular pressures as customers replace traditional voice services with mobile and other collaboration solutions. on the data front, vpn and legacy transport services are being impacted by technology transitions to software-based solutions. today, approximately half of our segment revenue comes from these types of services.
last quarter, we shared that we're experiencing additional government sector pressure related to the reallocation of spending priorities. this pressure, tied to the timing and restructuring of government spending, continued in 2q. while we're hopeful that some spending will return and the enterprise infrastructure solutions contract volumes and share gains will offset pricing reductions over time, we consider it prudent to reset expectations. it's worth noting that approximately 20% of the year over year business wireline revenue declines in the second quarter were due to government spending impacts.
lastly, we saw inflation and wholesale network access charges we incur to provide services to customers outside of our footprint due to contractual resets. this cost pressure resulted in more than 20% of the segment's year-over-year ebitda decline. this pressure will be managed through opportunities to operate more efficiently, movement of traffic to alternate providers, symmetrical wholesale pricing adjustments and natural product migration trends. looking ahead, these developments only strengthen our resolve in executing our transformation, including actions to accelerate cost take-outs and simplify our product portfolio.
we expect these actions to mitigate the year-over-year pressure in this segment's profitability over time. but we now expect business wireline ebitda declines in the low double digits this year, and our expectation for stabilization extends to the back half of 2024. however, we remain confident in our efforts to reposition the segment. the deployment of fiber is leading to an acceleration of growth each quarter in our connectivity solutions, which delivered close to 15% growth this quarter.
our fiber expansion also provides us with the ability to gain market share in smb, which is an underpenetrated segment for us. moreover, we continue to utilize our business relationships to expand opportunities in mobility. since last year, we've taken more than one full point of share in the business mobility space. our focus on fiber and 5g continues to gain traction.
and we expect to use our strong enterprise and growing smb relationships to take advantage of opportunities as they expand. we know this transformation won't happen overnight. but similar to our turnarounds in mobility and consumer wireline, we're confident we have the right strategy in place and in our ability to execute it successfully. i'll now turn it over to pascal to discuss the details for the quarter.
pascal?
pascal desroches -- chief financial officer
thank you, john. and good morning, everyone. let's start by taking a look at our subscriber results for our market focus areas on slide five. as john mentioned, our consistent and disciplined go-to-market strategy continues to resonate with customers.
in the quarter, we had a remarkable 813,000 postpaid phone net adds, our best second quarter in more than a decade. looking at fiber, we had 316,000 net adds as we delivered upon our expectations to accelerate our subscriber growth. our fiber deployment plans remain on track, and we expect to continue our solid momentum with customers. now, let's move to our second quarter consolidated financial summary on slide six.
first, it's important to note, with the closing of the warnermedia transaction in april, historical financial results have been recast to present warnermedia and certain other divested businesses, including vrio, xandr and playdemic, as discontinued operations. while continuing operations provide a clearer view of our remaining operations, keep in mind that there continues to be some year-over-year comparative challenges as the prior year results also include directv and certain other dispositions. therefore, where applicable, i will highlight our financial results on a comparative like-for-like basis in addition to continuing from operations. comparative revenues for the quarter were $29.6 billion, up 2.2% or more than $600 million year over year.
this was largely driven by wireless revenue growth and, to a lesser extent, higher mexico and consumer wireline revenues, partially offset by declines in business wireline. comparative adjusted ebitda was up 1.7% year over year as growth in wireless, mexico and lower corporate costs were partially offset by business wireline declines. we continue to expect the year-over-year ebitda trend line to progressively improve through the year as we begin to lap 3g shutdown costs and step up investments in technology that began in the second half of 2021. adjusted eps from continuing operations for the quarter was $0.65.
on a comparative stand-alone at&t basis, adjusted eps was $0.64 in the year-ago quarter. adjustments for the quarter were made to exclude a gain in our benefit plans, noncash restructuring and impairment charges and our proportionate share of directv intangible amortization. cash from operations for our continuing operations came in at $7.7 billion for the quarter. capital investments of $6.7 billion was up $1.7 billion year over year.
free cash flow was $1.4 billion. directv cash distributions were $800 million in the quarter. cash flow for the quarter was affected by several key factors. first, as expected, we had higher front-end loaded capital investments as we ramped our fiber and 5g mid-band spectrum deployment.
as john already noted, we expect lower capital investment levels in the back half of the year, in line with our expectations of $24 billion. the second is the timing of consumer collections, as it's taking about two more days than last year to collect customer receivables. the impact of this is almost $1 billion for the quarter. the last item is some incremental success-based investments, including device payments tied to accelerate subscriber growth.
now let's take a deeper look at our communications segment operating results, starting with mobility on slide seven. our mobility business continues its record-level momentum. revenues were up 5.2%, with service revenues growing 4.6%, driven by subscriber growth. mobility postpaid phone arpu was $54.81, up $0.81 sequentially or 1.1% year over year.
this is ahead of our prior expectations for stabilizing in the second half of the year. this improvement is largely a result of more customers trading up to higher-priced unlimited plans and improved roaming trends. our june pricing actions were a modest benefit as well. but given the timing of the increases, we would expect our pricing access to be a larger factor in the back half of the year.
given our expectations for arpu, we now expect service revenue growth of 4.5% to 5% for the year. that is up from our previously stated expectations of 3%-plus. mobility ebitda increased 2.5% year over year despite an approximately $100 million impact from lower caf ii government credits and higher firstnet cost. we also had around $130 million of higher bad debt expense during the quarter.
while bad debt is now slightly higher than pre-pandemic levels, it is being offset by better-than-expected customer revenue growth. we remain confident that mobility adjusted ebitda growth accelerates in the second half of the year due to revenue growth and the lapping of 3g shutdown investments that began in the second half of 2021. again, our customer growth performance was better than we expected, especially when you consider we became less active in promotional activities compared to others in our industry. so it's clear to us that the strategic change we made to simplify our go-to-market strategy two years ago continue to yield great results and that our value proposition is resonating in the marketplace.
now let's turn to our operating results for consumer and business wireline on slide eight. our fiber growth was solid as we continue to win share where we have fiber. our total consumer wireline revenues were up again this quarter, even with declines from copper-based broadband services. broadband revenues grew 5.6% due to fiber revenue growth and higher broadband arpu, driven by a customer mix shift to fiber and recent broadband pricing actions.
our fiber arpu was $61.65, up 5.3% year over year, with gross addition intake arpu in the $65 to $70 range. we expect overall fiber arpu to continue to improve as more customers roll off promotional pricing and on to simplified pricing constructs. we accelerated our fiber footprint build and now have the ability to serve 18 million customer locations with great at&t fiber experience that consistently receives high net promoter scores. as you heard at analyst day, our plans center on pivoting from a copper-based product to fiber, and we're doing just that.
we continue to expect ebitda growth to accelerate through the remainder of 2022, driven by continued growth in broadband revenues and the lapping of technology investments that began in the second half of 2021. looking at business wireline, as john stated, revenues and earnings came in lower than we expected. there are two main factors that are driving the shortfall to our expectation, the first is lower revenue than anticipated from the government sector, the second is inflationary pressure on wholesale network access costs. on a combined basis, these two factors accounted for about $100 million in ebitda pressure year over year.
while the business wireline transition and portfolio rationalization creates incremental pressure on near-term revenues, it underscores the importance of transitioning to our owned and operated connectivity services, as well as growing 5g and fiber-integrated solutions. in fact, our connectivity services revenue growth continues to accelerate as we are up nearly 15% year over year. both areas, business 5g and fiber, continue to perform well, with business wireline service revenue growth of 7.4% and a sequential increase in our firstnet wireless base of more than 300,000. before we shift to questions, i want to provide you an update on how we are thinking about the rest of the year, given the dynamic macro environment we're operating in.
as i mentioned previously, we like the momentum in our mobility business, both on a service revenue and ebitda basis. while we maintain expectations that 2022 industry postpaid phone demand levels are unlikely to replicate 2021, the strength we experienced in the first half of the year, coupled with better arpu trends, give us confidence in our raised service revenue outlook and expectations for an improved ebitda trajectory. on consumer wireline, we are largely trending on plan, given mix shift to higher-arpu fiber plans, which is driving both revenue and adjusted ebitda growth. on business wireline, you know the near-term challenges we are facing, which reduces our expectations.
we now expect business wireline to decline in the low double-digit ebitda range for the year. putting this all together, we remain comfortable in our ability to deliver revenue, adjusted ebitda and eps within our prior guidance ranges for the year. moving to free cash flow. given the combination of elevated success-based investment, the potential for further extension of payments by our customers, inflation and the more challenging environment facing our business wireline unit, we consider it prudent to take a more conservative outlook to free cash flow for the year.
given these factors, we anticipate pressure of about $2 billion to our free cash flow guidance from our prior $16 billion range for the year. now before the questions on how we get to the implied $10 billion of free cash flow in the second half of the year when we generated $4 billion in the first half of the year, let me provide you with some specific items to consider. our outlook reflects the following expectations, $3 billion-plus lower device payment versus the first half of the year due to timing, nearly $2 billion lower capital investment versus the first half of the year as we reach our $24 billion expectations for the full year. the balance of the improvement relative to the first half of the year is due to wireless customer growth, including our recent pricing increases and lower cash interest expense.
we expect these benefits to be partially offset by reduced distributions from directv and our expectations for incremental tax payments in the second half of the year. however, we do expect full year tax payments to be lower than we previously anticipated. additionally, we expect typical free cash flow seasonality, with the fourth quarter higher than the third quarter. although we're not providing an updated 2023 outlook, we expect improved cash conversion of ebitda in 2023.
here's how. better mobility cash flow as we get a full year benefit from a larger subscriber base at higher arpu level. we expect mvno volumes to ramp and become more material through the course of the year. international roaming trends should improve as well.
we expect broadband revenue growth from the mix shift to higher-priced fiber to continue. on the cost structure, we expect a full year benefit from our cost transformation efforts implemented in 2022 in conjunction with reaching our $6 billion-plus target by the end of 2023. additionally, the cost actions we plan to execute in business wireline in the second half of the year should produce more than $300 million of savings in 2023 relative to 2022. also recall that we have no 3g shutdown costs in 2023.
in addition, we expect lower cash interest expense as we get a full year benefit from the debt paydown actions taken in 2022. all these factors should more than offset the expected lower distribution from directv and an expected year-over-year increase in cash taxes. in summary, there is no doubt we're operating in a dynamic macro environment, but we feel confident in both the resilient nature of our business and the underlying financial flexibility we gained from recent dispositions. amir, that's our presentation.

great. thank you very much. good morning . just coming back to the 2023 free cash flow, can you help us a little bit with the capex? is that still expected to be about $24 billion before dropping off the following year, especially given that you've said you've pulled forward some of the 5g spend? and i guess, any updated thoughts on what you want to do in terms of fiber? are you going to continue at this 3.5 million, 4 million homes or locations a year, and you're going to stop at 30 million? what's the latest thought there? and then you've referenced directv a couple of times.
i just want to make clear, has anything changed at directv? or is this just a quarterly kind of cadence of the payments? or are you still expecting the same distributions that you put out in your guidance for the '22 and '23 as overall? thank you.
pascal desroches -- chief financial officer
sure. thanks, simon. look, the thing is -- i think you have to keep in mind is one of the things that we -- when we did all the dispositions, we wanted -- our plan was to invest significantly this year and next year, both the $24 billion level. and as you see, so far, the momentum in our business remains really strong.
those investments are providing attractive returns. and everything we see suggests that these were really good decisions. so yes, we are expecting $24 billion next year. we continue to expect to deploy fiber at the pace we've previously guided.
and as it relates to directv, nothing has changed at all. we expected around $4 billion this year. as you can see from the first couple of quarters, that's more front-end loaded. and as we -- and next year, we expect $3 billion.
so nothing has changed in that regard, and we feel really good about how the business is performing.
simon flannery -- morgan stanley -- analyst
great. and just a quick follow-up. on the price increases, what's your early read of what customers are doing? are they paying the extra $6 or $12? are they migrating to unlimited plans? is that accretive or not? and any surprises on churn?
john stankey -- chief executive officer
everything is tracking as we kind of expected when we laid it out, simon. as i shared with you, i think when we indicated we were going to do it, what we have is past models from executing these types of things that allow us to go and try to evaluate how customers are going to react and behave when the changes occur. and in this particular case, we had a great opportunity to ensure that, while we are going through a price increase on a segment of plans, we were able to also provide the option for a customer to think about moving to other plans and ultimately get more value, and i think, in many cases, very attractive characteristics associated with that. and we're seeing customers do both.
in some cases, they're choosing to pay the increase of their existing plan and not move. but as you would expect, there's a degree of inertia in any subscription base. sometimes, it takes a little bit of time for somebody to process what's occurred and react. and we're also seeing some use this an opportunity to migrate into better plans and trade up and take not only some of that value that we're giving.
but as you're seeing, we're starting to drive the improvements in arpus that we told you would occur. and certainly, this is a component of that happening. but i would tell you, it is tracking as we expected. it will be accretive as we expected.
and i think everything we've given you for end of year forecast is consistent with what is occurring right now in the market in the early days of the change.
simon flannery -- morgan stanley -- analyst
great. thanks, john.
amir rozwadowski -- senior vice president, finance, and investor relations
thank you very much, simon. operator, we can get the next question.
operator
thank you. our next question will come from brett feldman with goldman sachs. please go ahead.
brett feldman -- goldman sachs -- analyst
yeah, thanks. and just, i guess, sort of a two-part question related to the timing issue that you highlighted with collections. so the first one is, what gives you confidence it really is a timing issue and not really a nonpayment issue? you alluded to some prior experience in different economic cycles. so i was hoping you can maybe just elaborate on that.
and then i'm curious, to what extent this might be shaping the way you think about going to market, particularly in your wireless business? as you move into the back half of the year? you've obviously done very well with a certain offer or a suite of promotions. does it make sense to maintain the same promotional stance in a more difficult environment, particularly where there may be some timing issues? it certainly seems like your financial guidance anticipates lower volumes in the back half. but if that's a misunderstanding, any color there would be helpful. thank you.
john stankey -- chief executive officer
brett, first of all, i'd say that our most recent experience in looking at kind of a challenged cycle is probably coming out of the 2008 recession and the dynamic around it. and as i indicated in my earlier remarks, we've evaluated that. we looked at that. and that was a pretty stressed time, if you recall.
and i don't know that i can exactly predict what's going to occur over the next year or so. but my guess is it probably won't be quite as shocking as that cycle is, what's occurred in a worst-case scenario. and we go back and we look at patterns and behaviors that have occurred in those cycles and evaluated them. and the other great thing we know that today is we have far better data than we've ever had, that's more dynamic in how we do algorithmic scoring and things like that that allow us to be even more effective in managing customer risk.
so i think we feel pretty comfortable that we've got a reasonable record of data that allows us to do some projection on that as we start to see these things move. and as i said, this typically is not an issue of people not paying, it's an issue of when they pay. and i don't believe there's anything in our credit scoring and how we've looked at our customer base coming in that would cause those trends to be dramatically different than a previous period. in terms of how we go to market, i think we had a fantastic quarter.
and i don't know that i want to go to market any differently than the quarter that we've put on the board. in fact, looking at many of your commentaries, you've been articulating that others have been much more aggressive in the market and probably leaning in to promotional activity in a heavier way. and i would say, i would characterize our approach as being much more tempered and consistent with the past. and we have not really responded to that increased promotional activity that we're seeing from others in the market right now.
we've kind of been continuing to play our game, and we've put up a record quarter or a second quarter for ourselves in the 10-year period. and as i've told you before, we like each of these incremental subscribers we're bringing in. we think the economics of them are very strong, albeit there is investment at the front end to bring them on to the network. but i'm not going to shy away from that kind of growth.
i don't know what the overall market is going to do for the next several quarters. i expect it will be, as i said in my comments, a bit more tepid as maybe economic stress comes in. but i've been saying that we expected it to be a little bit slower for the better part of nine months now, and it hasn't materialized yet. we'll take the growth if it comes in.
i expect it's going to slow a little bit. and i'm going to continue to play our game as long as it's working, and it's working right now.
pascal desroches -- chief financial officer
and brett, one other point as it relates to the overall credit quality of our customer base. while we did see an uptick in bad debt, overall, it is nothing at all concerning. it's up slightly from pre-pandemic levels. so our call out here was really just to caution investors, given the broader macro trends that are happening.
so we're not, in any way, alarmed by this.
brett feldman -- goldman sachs -- analyst
thank you.
amir rozwadowski -- senior vice president, finance, and investor relations
operator if we can move to the next question.
operator
thank you. our next question will come from the line of phil cusick with j.p. morgan. please go ahead.
phil cusick -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
thanks very much, guys. a couple of follow-ups and one new one. can you, john, talk anything about recent customer trends, june and july? you just said a minute ago, you expect things to slow down, but it doesn't sound like you've seen slower customer trends so far. it's a little surprising, given the elevated dsos.
and it sounds like you guys don't have a lot of confidence in that 2023 free cash flow number. what -- is there just less visibility so you don't want to cut that now? or are you still reasonably confident in the $20 billion, and you think you can get there? or we could use a little more? and then finally, can you just get into the recent launch of plans that don't include hbo? what's the potential cost savings from that shift of customers away? and what's been the reaction? thank you.
john stankey -- chief executive officer
hi, phil. so let me touch on these first, and then pascal can come in and backfill to the extent he wishes to do so. so customer trends, first of all, i don't want to go down a path on stuff we haven't disclosed. but the first part of july, as you'd expect, tends to be a little bit more suppressed because it's a high holiday and vacation period.
and that's what i would call seasonal and cyclical, and we certainly saw a little bit of that occurring. but i've not seen anything in the market right now that suggests we're seeing a move away from what the first half of the year represented. and i think kind of moving into the second part of your question, i hate to describe it this way, but i think we got a little bit of a tale of two cities going on here. and when you see 9% inflation, it tends to hit those in the low end of the market really, really hard.
and it's difficult when you walk up to the gas pump and have to fill the car, and you get the electric bill come in and you see the kind of step-ups that people are seeing. and i think there's an adjustment period that goes on. the flip side is, you've got another segment of the population that banked a lot of money during the pandemic. they weren't traveling.
they weren't dining out. they were feeling a little bit more flush, and they're making different decisions. and as you know, our postpaid base is probably skewed a little bit more to the higher socioeconomic dynamics and probably a bit more insulated. but there is a portion of the base that clearly is starting to adjust to this dynamic that there's higher calls on their cash in any given quarter, and they're having to adjust betting patterns and behaviors and prioritization of how they order bills.
and i think we're seeing that there's a little bit of that starting to occur. as pascal said, it's not alarming in the way it's happening, but it is moving out collection cycles a bit, as we typically see when this type of stress starts to show up. and that's what the working capital issue is around it. so i would tell you, i don't see anything in here that would be out of pattern for this occurring.
i think you've got two different parts of the economy, though, that are working in different ways. and how they develop over the course of the next several quarters is a little bit of a visibility issue, to be candid with you. and i don't know, if you'd asked me six months ago, we would be seeing 9% inflation annualized. i don't think i would have picked it as being that strong, but here we are.
and now the question is, how fast do we eradicate it and what rate? and if you have a good pick on that or good insights, then i can probably be a little bit more precise than what i think '23 brings. i think what's important to understand is -- pascal articulated in his comments is the fundamentals of the business are really strong. we feel really good about some of the mechanical things that will improve cash flow yields into '23. that's not going to change.
but what happens in the overall economic pattern is a bit uncertain. and without seeing how the fed reacts, how fast we see the curve starting to abate on the inflation side, trying to make that pick right now just feels like it's a bit of an overreach. and so i think we're reserving the right to get a little bit more visibility on '23 to declare. but i think the strong improvement dynamics are what i would call mechanical.
and the performance of the business is supporting the fact that we're going to see that improved conversion on cash flow as we move through the year. and then finally, on your question about the plans is, look, we still have a lot of streaming services in our base that we're using. we're trying a couple of different things. part of this has been segment driven to look at opportunities for us to address areas that we think there is potential for stronger growth.
and we shifted the mix of our plan and what we gave away, so to speak, in some of the benefits, especially as we were executing the price changes that we have talked about previously. and we felt that, this quarter, and where we stood, that working on things like more generous hotspot capabilities and better roaming moving into the summer might be a better play in the market. and i would tell you, we kind of like what we saw in our results despite a lot of the changes by others in the industry in terms of what their value proposition is to customers. and it feels like it was a good pivot and rotation at this moment for what we needed to do with the kind of changes we were making broadly in our plans.
that doesn't mean that that's the strategy forever. and it doesn't mean it's the strategy for the rest of the year. as we move through the summer months and we get through the peak travel periods and we look at what other options we have, we could choose to do something different in what we decide to do from a promotional perspective and what we choose to bring in as part of the bundles moving forward. i don't think anything should be viewed as static.
and i think entertainment, as part of a wireless bundle, is probably something that's going to be around with us in this industry for a good period of time because i think customers -- certain customers resonate with it. and hbo max is a great product. we like the fact that we're kind of viewed as being the place to come to get it. and when it's right for us to put that up in the front line to do that, we'll continue to do that.
phil cusick -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
thanks, john.
amir rozwadowski -- senior vice president, finance, and investor relations
thank you very much, phil. operator, we can move to the next question.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of michael rollins with citi. please go ahead.
michael rollins -- citigroup
so a follow-up and a question. when you're discussing some of the impact that your customers are experiencing this inflationary environment, can you talk about how at&t is using the acp program, the size of it, and the opportunity to use that, which may be different than some past cycles customers had deal with potentially tougher macro climate? and then secondly, just in terms of the infrastructure money that's out there, can you give us an update on your expectations for the size of the opportunity that at&t could pursue?
john stankey -- chief executive officer
sure, michael. first of all, i think the most significant change in the acp program is the fact that we have put out a new product, access by at&t. it's very easy for you to look at that product. all you need to do is search on the internet, access by at&t, and you'll be taken directly to the page that talks about what this is, and it's, of course, tied to acp dollars.
and that program, i think, is a great program. i think it's good for the consumer. as you know, it offers 100 by $20 -- $30 fixed connection. and we also have options that are available in the wireless space around it as well.
and we've been able to, in most of our channels, activate eligibility requirements for acp. and we're working on ensuring that that's done. the government still continues to move around a little bit on some of the qualification criteria and those types of things, and we have to adjust our operations. but i would say, by and large, in most of our mainline channels, we have the ability to qualify customers and to move them into products and service as a result of it.
and i think it's a healthy program to get those that maybe are a little bit more income challenged to get them into not only new products but better products. and so i think that's a good thing. i think we still have an issue from a policy perspective in this country on how we sustain this for the long haul. and universal service reform is going to need to be a key element of that as we get out several years from now and the original acp funding starts to have to be renewed, and we have to look at it differently.
but right now, i'd say the program is healthy. i think we're in as good a position as anybody in the market as to what we're doing. and it's needs-based. but we make it very easy for those needs-based customers to self-identify and qualify at the point of sale and then take advantage of it and move into a product or service.
and we think that will be actually, over the long haul, something that makes for more continuity in our relationships with customers as it insulates them a little bit from economic cycles and some of the things that are going on, like higher inflation. on the infrastructure side, look, i'm optimistic. we haven't given any guidance on what we think that number will be. and i will tell you, frankly, timing-wise, this is a little bit out in the future right now.
as you know, the maps are not going to be issued from the fcc until a little bit later this year. and until that happens, the money really can't start to flow at the state level. so we got to get the maps in place. we've got the procedural process being defined as to how the states will come back to the federal government and seeking the distribution of these funds.
they will have to go through there. the state will have to go through their processes to do that. i expect that that will start to occur into next year. awards will probably start to materialize, maybe in some meaningful levels, in the middle part, latter part of next year.
and then you have to go and build and ultimately bring these things online. so you're not looking at these things creating what i would call material impact on the '22, '23 plans right now as it moves through the cycle. how much, we'll get a better idea once the rules are set. and each state is going to have authorship over their strategies and approaches.
i've shared before that we're actively working with states trying to shape them in ways that we think are meaningful for our business and are good policy for each of the states. i would point out, there is no company that's building a 2 million connected locations of fiber in six months like we are. we are scaling in a way that nobody else is. we are deploying wireless infrastructure at a torrid pace.
i think that makes us a good partner. i think at the end of the day, states do care about somebody who's reputable, that can execute, that has a mature supply chain, and a scaled engine to go after should make us very competitive for this money. and we intend to, through a combination of what we're doing with acp and our operational prowess and our scale that we're demonstrating and the fact that we've got a product in the market that customers love. it's got the highest nps out there.
i think we should be a very qualified partner to work with government on that, and i'm optimistic that we can avail ourselves with some of that money.
michael rollins -- citigroup
thanks.
amir rozwadowski -- senior vice president, finance, and investor relations
thanks very much, mike. operator, if we can move to the next caller.
operator
thank you. that question will come from david barden with bank of america. please go ahead.
david barden -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
hey, guys. thanks so much for talking the question. i guess, i wanted to talk about the second half free cash flow guidance, if you will, for $10 billion and the jumping-off point for 2023. i think, pascal, you said the biggest moving part is going to be $3 billion less spend on equipment in the second half, which would not be normal, i think, just because it's a higher upgrade period.
you've got the iphone refresh. i was wondering if you could kind of explain why that's going to be such a big tailwind. i think the second question would be $2 billion less in capex in the second half. we've been expecting at&t to kind of come with the c-band development and the auction 110 spectrum in kind of one big push.
and so why is it that the capex is coming down even as that begins? and if i could, one last one is, obviously, the cash flow seems very sensitive to this one or two days lengthening billing cycle. are we convinced that the billing cycle has lengthened? or should we be concerned that it's lengthening as we look into the back part of the year? thanks.
pascal desroches -- chief financial officer
ok. let me try hitting all of those, and obviously, john can chime in. first, look, the thing to keep in mind is the second -- we pay devices, for example, probably a quarter to 1.5 quarter after the sale has happened. so for q2, as an example, we're paying for the last part of q4 and q1.
so for the back half of the year, it's going to be largely activity from the back half of q2 and q3. so the holiday sales and the upgrade season, we're going to pay for that in the first half of 2023. and so mechanically, we have really good visibility in terms of the payments that we are likely going to make in the back half of the year. but overall, given the strong growth we had in the first half of the year, our overall device payments for the year are higher than we anticipated, which, candidly, this is a very good -- it's a very good situation because we think this is attractive growth, and we feel really good about it.
as it relates to capex, our fiber build was front-end loaded for the year. remember, last year, we had some supply chain disruptions, and it took us a while to ramp. we got good exit velocity and exiting 2021, and that continued. and in the first half of the year, we delivered 2 million locations passed.
so we feel really good about that. in terms of our c-band deployment and the pace of that, nothing has changed. we said we were guiding to $24 billion of capital. that remains the case.
so we're not spending any more capital than we thought for the year. and remind me the last part of your question?
john stankey -- chief executive officer
days sales outstanding movement.
pascal desroches -- chief financial officer
oh, days sales outstanding movement. so in terms of dsos, here's what we know. this is a trend that is relatively nascent. it is probably six weeks or so that we start to see an uptick in days sales outstanding.
is it a trend? is it going to get worse? we don't know. but here's what we do know. we do know that, as john alluded to, in prior recessions, customers may have paid late, but they paid us. so there's nothing to suggest, given the mission-critical nature of our services, that customers won't pay us because they're going to want to maintain connectivity.
so in that regard, we think it is a timing issue. and i think, in this macro environment, i'm not going to call whether it's going to get much, much worse than where we are today. but we're taking a prudent view and not assuming it's going to get better, given all the uncertainty.
john stankey -- chief executive officer
dave, the only other thing i would add to what pascal said is, as you -- we obviously hit our 70 million pop coverage commitment that we made to you that was part of the capital plan for this year six months early. and as we told you, we'll be around that 100 million neighborhood as we get to the end of this year. i think it's probably intuitive to you. but just to remind you, the first 100 million pops in wireless coverage are very different than the next 100 million pops, just in terms of kind of capital intensity and what has to be done to make them happen on the number of physical sites you have to touch.
so if you want to think about this, it would not be right to kind of straight-line level of activity and investment as you make your journey to covering most of the united states. and that will probably help you understand maybe some of the rate and pace of things as we move through the year.
david barden -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
great. thank you both.
amir rozwadowski -- senior vice president, finance, and investor relations
thanks very much, dave. operator, we can move to the next question.
operator
thank you. that question will come from the line of frank louthan with raymond james. please go ahead.
frank louthan -- raymond james -- analyst
great. thank you. can you comment a little bit on your dividend policy going forward? is it a priority to grow the dividend by various amounts? that would be great. and then on part of the business side, i think you commented earlier this year about exiting some lines of business that were really low to no margin.
how is that going? and to what extent is that impacting the declines that we're seeing in the business line?
john stankey -- chief executive officer
frank, look, we've been pretty clear on the dividend policy as to what we're doing. and the board ultimately makes this call and this decision. and as i've said before, we set this at what we think is an incredibly attractive return in the market right now. and i think we are still standing there relative to the yields on the stock.
as i said, the board will evaluate dividends, along with other choices in front of us to return to shareholders. as we've indicated, our priority right now is to get the balance sheet where we want it, which is a full rush and push to getting to two and a half times, and then we can evaluate what other options are at that point in time. and those other options will range from whether or not we want to do something on dividend policy or something we want to invest more back into the business or whether we want to push on some buybacks. and those decisions will be weighted at the time when we have those options in front of us and evaluate the market as to where it stands.
our intent is to ensure that we're returning a good and competitive dividend out to our shareholders, which we have today. and we'll continue to be mindful of that as we go forward, and we see the stock price adjust in what occurs in the value of the business. on the abs side, look, i think as you've heard, the repositioning of the asset is -- it's a multi-quarter. this set of processes and approach are backing away from lower-margin products is relatively straightforward.
i say relatively because we can make the decision to do it at the front end. obviously, in this customer base, we have contracts that sometimes extend for multiple years in a period of time, where we then have to kind of go through a wind-down and wrap-up cycle once we stop selling something. and we're in the middle of that occurring. but the process of choosing not to drive new sales at the front end has been a relatively straightforward set of decisions, and i feel like we're executing reasonably well around that piece of it.
we have dropped the number of products we have in the market pretty demonstrably over the last year and a half, and we'll continue down that path. and i think it's that reduction in complexity that will allow us to then scale up what's essential to have a viable franchise moving forward in a robust and growing franchise moving forward, which is one centered on moving product that is on our owned and operated infrastructure. and what's right about our segment here that i want to stress that we report a little bit differently than some of our peers, we do not report a consolidated business entity in both wireless and wireline services. you should understand, a lot of our strength in the wireless business is coming from our success in our enterprise business.
it's coming from increases in the public sector, in our success of what we've done with firstnet. it's coming from our success in penetrating deeper into our enterprise accounts with wireless services. we're really pleased with the share gains that we've seen in enterprise moving forward, where we believe we have the opportunities in the mid-market and the low end of the market. and the attractive part about that is it's a twofer.
it's not only getting more transport on the fiber infrastructure we're deploying, but we are underpenetrated in the wireless space as we move into those accounts. so when we deploy fiber and we have an opportunity to talk to mid-market customers about putting more of their transport on at&t, we also oftentimes get the opportunity to talk to them about moving their wireless account as well. and that's an attractive opportunity for us. it requires us to tune our distribution differently.
that's a slower process. and we've been making progress around it. you heard pascal talk about the growth that we're seeing in our fiber products. we're seeing some progress in the wireless space in the mid-market, but we're not up to where we need to be yet.
we will get there. we play very well in that space. our brand plays very well in that space. we know how to sell product in that space.
but it's getting the engine kind of hitting all eight cylinders. it's going to take us a couple more quarters than what we expected. but i'm optimistic we can get there. it's the right asset base.
it's the right brand. we know how to approach these customers, and we will make that happen.
frank louthan -- raymond james -- analyst
all right, great. thank you very much.
amir rozwadowski -- senior vice president, finance, and investor relations
thank you very much, frank. and operator, we have time for one last question.
operator
thank you. that question will come from the line of tim horan with oppenheimer. please go ahead.
tim horan -- oppenheimer and company -- analyst
thanks, guys. two questions. could you just elaborate a little bit more on the wireline side of the business market? what are you replacing your legacy virtual private line networks with? the same thing with voice. i guess, are you retaining these customers? do you have a product for them? is it just a lower arpu issue? and then secondly, on the capex.
we're hearing capex equipment costs, labor costs are up 10%, 15%. i know you gave your guidance out quite a while ago for next year. i guess, how are you offsetting those price increases that we're hearing about out there, keeping your capex flat?
john stankey -- chief executive officer
tim, so look, the move, as i just articulated, is we want people on owned and operated infrastructure. and so it is -- as people migrate away from vpn and we have a more dense fiber bases, we're selling more fundamental underlying transport, frankly, at higher speeds, and therefore, higher connection values in that segment of the market. and that's where our future is. we work with layering that on an sdn capability that aggregates that.
and that is the replacement product for vpn. and we do very well in the market on that, although there is, typically, in a network replacement, at the top end of the market, some trade-down in total value when that occurs. that's why this move into the mid-market is so important to us, where we are typically underpenetrated. because offsetting that trade-down in the enterprise -- top end of the enterprise space, where we are a sheer leader on vpn and have these complex networks, as we have some of that trade-down and the migration on the technology side, market replacement in the mid-market is, is what offsets that and allows us to move the sector back to growth over time as we make that happen.
and again, it's why this investment in fiber in our core business is so critical and important in repositioning our distribution to make that happen. the world, for us, moving forward is a data vpn-replacement world. and that's where we're going to make our bread and butter. our play in voice is to penetrate more deeply into wireless in these spaces.
generally speaking, when you look at what's happened on collaboration services, it's moved to other providers that are doing that kind of work. we want the underlying data infrastructure for those collaboration services to run on. and we want to sell more scaled wireless solutions on top of our transport services into these customers to extend our relationship with them. and i think, as i said just a moment to frank's question, we're doing that fairly effectively.
and that's what the future is and how we move forward on it. on the cost side, we're certainly seeing some pressures as we move through. we've articulated that. we're able to navigate it better than a lot.
as we've shared with you previously, we have a lot of long-term contracts in place. i think those help us a lot. i won't tell you they entirely insulate us. we want our suppliers to be healthy.
we pay attention to that. we have good, long-standing partnerships with our suppliers. and i will be candid, we have sat down with them. in some cases, even though not had to pay people more, i've elected to pay people more because i think that makes for a healthier win-win relationship on things moving forward.
and we are having to take some costs into our build and what we're doing. however, these are long-lived assets. and some increase in our build costs, for example, on putting fiber out there is not the end of the world for us. we've shared with you a lot of data on the effectiveness of our build.
we've shared with you that when we did the original business case on these things, we're penetrating a lot more rapidly than we thought we would. that has a big impact on the overall return characteristics of this investment. that can overcome maybe some of those per-living unit cost increases. we really like the arpu trends we're seeing.
we really like the churn trends we're seeing. all those things still make this a really smart and important investment for our business. and i think it's a balancing act as we move through it. and as we've said before, when you get the asset in the ground and ultimately work through multiple quarters of inflation, building it today is better than building it a year from today.
and if it's a long-lived asset and it's an important product, ultimately, we'll probably see some accretion move into arpus over time. so i feel like we can manage through this reasonably well, given our scale, given our long-term relationships with folks and the importance and durability of the product over time. so folks, i really appreciate you taking the time to be with us this morning. and i know you got, from maybe, hopefully, the last time, a little extra work to do this quarter as we work through the disaggregation of discontinued operations and the like in results.
and i'm excited about finishing this in this quarter and now moving forward in a more consistent fashion. we made some hard moves that brought us to this moment that i'll acknowledge. but those hard moves were to, number one, give us the ability and the flexibility to invest heavily in this business and to make sure that we could respond to what goes on in the environment economically, whether economic stress, rising interest rates, etc. and i would say, i'm really pleased we're in this position for having made those decisions.
and it's allowed us to do exactly what we intended to do, which is to think about how do we create a durable at&t with a consistent machine that can deliver the right kind of subscription services for broadband moving forward. and i think we are doing that. we're building a world-class infrastructure where we're doing that. you're seeing the momentum in the market that we're able to achieve.
i view these customer relationships as durable customer relationships that are highly accretive and attractive. and i will tell you that, as i work with the team, 90 days in this business, with the way we operate and the infrastructure we build, is sometimes a bit like trying to land a plane on the top of a pin. and so when i think about the reality of what we're doing here, we want to look at it over the course of the year. and as the business has the right kind of momentum and i've got people doing their work, we continue to invest.
we make sure we put the right things out there. and a 90-day cycle is not the end of the world in any way, shape or form. hopefully, we've given you the confidence that we understand what's going to occur in the balance of this year and that we're investing in a way that's going to return for shareholders in a fashion that, i think, we'll all be proud of moving forward. so thank you very much.
i hope you all enjoy the rest of your summer, and we'll talk with you in 90 days.

thank you for standing by. welcome to at&t's third quarter 2022 earnings call. [operator instructions] as a reminder, this conference is being recorded. i would like to turn the conference call over to our host, amir rozwadowski, senior vice president, finance, and investor relations.
please go ahead.
amir rozwadowski -- senior vice president, finance, and investor relations
thank you, and good morning, everyone. welcome to our third quarter call. i'm amir rozwadowski, head of investor relations for at&t. joining me on the call today are john stankey, our ceo; and pascal desroches, our cfo.
before we begin, i need to call your attention to our safe harbor statement. it says that some of our comments today may be forward-looking. as such, they're subject to risks and uncertainties described in at&t's sec filings. results may differ materially.
and as always, additional information and earnings materials are available on the investor relations website. with that, i'll turn the call over to john stankey. john? 
john stankey -- chief executive officer
thanks, amir. good morning, everyone. this morning, we shared our third quarter results, which yet again demonstrate our strong execution and delivering critical connectivity services to our customers. earlier this month, we saw just how vital these services truly are.
in the devastating aftermath of hurricane ian, the ability to connect with others proved to be invaluable to so many people. and our teams were yet again, some of the very first to arrive on the scene working tirelessly for our customers. the effort they made, along with first responders, supported by firstnet, to keep our network running in some of the hardest-hit areas was nothing short of heroic. i'm really grateful for their sacrifices and all of at&t is proud of their efforts.
i'd also like to say thank you to our teams for their solid execution in deploying our mid-band 5g spectrum and building out best-in-class fiber-based access solutions. as you can see from our results, we continue to deliver strong customer growth on the back of our focused 5g and fiber strategy. the demand for fast and reliable 5g and fiber is at an all-time high, and our disciplined and consistent go-to-market strategy continues to resonate. in addition, as we begin to lap investments we need to optimize our networks, improve our distribution, and transform our business, we're now seeing the benefits of our growth fall to the bottom line as we suggested they would and as evidenced by accelerating adjusted ebitda growth.
let me dive in a bit. in mobility, we posted another strong quarter of growth by adding 708,000 postpaid phone net adds. as i stated in prior quarters, our consistent results are being driven by an improved value proposition, better network experience, and our ability to meet our customers where their needs are. we're creating efficiencies through our distribution and acquisition costs are improving.
this is helping us drive further gains in operating leverage. this past quarter, our teams delivered across three key performance measurements, strong postpaid phone net adds, accelerating arpu growth, and higher mobility ebitda. in fact, the third quarter marked our highest wireless service revenue growth year over year in more than a decade, and we now expect to achieve wireless service revenue growth at the upper end of the 4.5% to 5% range. this is about 200 basis points higher than where we expected to land at the start of the year, thanks to continued net add strength and arpu growth.
now let's jump to fiber, where we continue to invest in building out a premium network and deliver on our stated expectations for steady customer growth. the success of our strategy is evidenced by the fact that we just posted our 11th straight quarter with more than 200,000 fiber net adds with 338,000 net adds this past quarter. we're finding success in serving more customers in new and existing markets with what is the best wired internet offering available. we're increasing share in our fiber footprint in converting more ip broadband internet subscribers to fiber subscribers.
this is driving favorable arpu trends and profitable growth within our overall consumer wireline business. ultimately, our fiber strategy is a long-term play, centered around a best-in-class network technology with a multi-decade lifespan. when others finally decide they need to upgrade their infrastructure, we will already be providing our customers with great service and sustainable technology. simply put, where we have fiber, we win.
and the numbers show we expect to keep winning. so let's step back for a minute and take a look at what we've done so far this year across three quarters. we've achieved what we expect will be an industry best with more than 2.2 million postpaid phone net adds. additionally, our teams are deploying our mid-band 5g spectrum quickly and efficiently, and the spectrum assets we're rolling out are performing even better than our high expectations.
as a result, we've achieved our already increased year-end target of 100 million mid-band 5g pops and now expect to reach more than 130 million people by the end of the year, nearly double our expectations when we entered the year. this progress is benefiting our customers as well. in fact, since the start of the year, our already consistent download speeds have increased materially as a result of our mid-band deployment. we're also approaching 1 million at&t fiber net adds for the year, and we've added nearly 2.3 million fiber locations through three quarters to bring our total customer locations to 18.5 million.
this keeps us on track to achieve our target of 30 million plus locations by the end of 2025. in summary, i'm very happy with the strong, high-quality, and durable customer adds, network enhancements, and improving financial returns we're seeing across our twin growth engines, of 5g and fiber. moving to our next priority. it's more important than ever that we be effective and efficient across our operations.
we continue to have strong visibility on achieving more than $4 billion of our $6 billion transformation cost savings run rate target by the end of this year. as i said earlier, we're beginning to see savings start to contribute to the bottom line. we're transforming our business as the world continues to face what feels like a period of uncertainty. many of the economic trends that we spoke about at the start of the year and the assumptions that we've been operating under are now coming to fruition.
this is one reason why we focus so intently on reorienting our business, whether it was asset dispositions, investing in cost transformation, or our proactive decision to address rising inflation through a measured pricing strategy. as a result, our balance sheet has improved, our network performance continues to get better, and we're now seeing some benefits to our profit trends. this is a direct result of acting when we did and how we did it. our third quarter results demonstrate that our business can deliver even against the challenging backdrop.
the current environment is not easy to predict, but our flexibility affords us the ability to meet or surpass all of our financial commitments while investing in the best technology available. now turning to our capital allocation strategy. the long-term economic justification for our investments in 5g and fiber remains fundamentally sound and we're continuing to invest through this cycle to support future growth. these investments will prove to be the foundation of at&t over the next few decades.
we feel confident our approach will prove to be increasingly beneficial with each passing year as data demand and traffic continues to grow dramatically. our strength and focus on core connectivity is helping us meet customers' needs, and we're growing mobility and fiber subscribers in a disciplined and profitable manner, quarter after quarter after quarter. this makes me very comfortable with our ability to continue improving the cash yields of our business going forward. our free cash flow for the quarter was in line with our expectations despite higher third quarter capital investment spend, and we're on track to deliver on our previously stated $24 billion capital investment plan for the year.
at the same time, we hope this healthy free cash flow for the quarter gives you confidence in our ability to achieve our target for free cash flow in the $14 billion range for the year, a level that is more than ample to support our $8 billion dividend commitment. before i turn this over to pascal, allow me to finish with this. our results demonstrate the strategy we put forward more than two years ago is the right strategy for not only the future of our business, but for the future of the communications industry. we're focused on creating sustainable and scalable businesses that drive a free cash flow flywheel for many years.
we continue to hold ourselves accountable for earnings growth against our historic levels of investment, which you'll see through improved cash conversion moving forward. we're confident that the investments and choices we're making will benefit our customers and shareholders now and in the future, while also setting the stage for our next act as america's best broadband provider. let me now turn it over to pascal to discuss the details of the quarter. pascal?
pascal desroches -- chief financial officer
thank you, john, and good morning, everyone. let's start by taking a look at our subscriber results for our market focus areas on slide 5. our consistent mobility strategy remains successful as we delivered 708,000 postpaid phone net adds in the quarter. since we began our transformation 9 quarters ago, we've delivered nearly 7 million postpaid for net adds along with improved arpu.
looking at at&t fiber, we totaled 338,000 net adds in the quarter. this marks our second-best quarter ever. our plan in consumer wireline remains centered on pivoting from a copper-based product to fiber, and we're doing just that. over the past 9 quarters, we've gone from 4.3 million at&t fiber subscribers to now approaching a subscriber base of 7 million.
so we're really pleased with the momentum we have with customers in the marketplace across mobility and fiber. now let's move to our third quarter consolidated financial summary on slide 6. first, as a reminder, with the closing of the warner media transaction in april, historical financial results have been recast to present warner media and certain other divested businesses, including rio, xandr, and playdemic as discontinued operations. additionally, there continues to be some year-over-year comparative challenges as the prior-year results also included directv for one month and other 2021 dispositions for a partial quarter.
therefore, where applicable, i will highlight our financial results on a comparative like-for-like basis. comparative revenues for the quarter were $30 billion, up 3.1% or more than $900 million versus a year ago. this is largely driven by wireless revenue growth and to a lesser extent, higher mexico and consumer wireline revenues. this was partly offset by a decline in business wireline.
comparative adjusted ebitda was up nearly 5% year over year as growth in mobility, consumer wireline in mexico were partly offset by a decline in business wireline. we expect the year-over-year ebitda trend line to improve for the balance of the year as we continue to grow our wireless and fiber customer bases and lap 3g network set down costs and stepped up investments in technology that began in the second half of 2021. adjusted eps from continuing operations for the quarter was $0.68, on a comparative stand-alone at&t basis, adjusted eps was $0.62 in the year-ago quarter. the quarter also includes a recurring favorable impact of about $140 million to adjusted eps from retirement medical benefits plan change.
for the full year, we now expect adjusted eps from continuing operations to be $2.50 or higher. cash from operating activities for our continuing operations came in at $10.1 billion for the quarter, up 9% year over year. capital investments of $6.8 billion was up $1.3 billion year over year, and we continue to expect capital investments in the $24 billion range for the year. free cash flow was $3.8 billion.
directv cash distributions were about $1 billion in the quarter. overall, we remain on track to achieve or surpass all of our previously shared financial targets for the year. now let's take a deeper look at our communications segment operating results, starting with mobility on slide 7. our mobility business continues its strong subscriber momentum and positive profitability trends.
revenues were up 6%, with service revenue growing 5.6% driven by subscriber growth. mobility postpaid phone arpu was $55.67 up $0.86 sequentially and 2.4% year over year. this continues to come in ahead of our expectations. this is largely a result of benefits from our targeted pricing actions, improved roaming trends, and more customers trading up to higher-priced unlimited plans.
with regard to ebitda, we delivered our highest mobility ebitda ever. year-over-year mobility ebitda increased 5.5%, driven by wireless revenue growth. we remain confident that mobility ebitda growth will continue to accelerate through the balance of the year due to revenue growth and the lapping of 3g network shutdown investments that began in the second half of 2021. so we're really happy with our mobility performance and our consistent strategy is yielding great results.
now let's turn to our operating results for consumer and business wireline on slide 8. our fiber growth remains strong, and we continue to win share where we have fiber. our total consumer wireline revenues are up again this quarter even with continued declines from non-fiber broadband services. broadband revenues grew 6.1% due to fiber revenue growth and higher broadband arpu driven by customer mix shift to fiber.
our fiber arpu was $62.62 and we expect that to continue to improve as more customers roll off legacy promotional pricing and on to simplified pricing constructs. looking forward, remember that seasonality in the fourth quarter typically results in lower industry net adds. we expect ebitda growth to remain strong on a year-over-year basis for 2022. this will be driven by growth in broadband revenues and the lapping of technology investments that began in the second half of 2021.
looking at business wireline. we continue to restructure and rationalize our portfolio with a focus on core connectivity where we have owners economics. in this regard, we continue to grow our connectivity services revenue as both 5g and fiber offerings continue to perform well. our enterprise mobility momentum remains strong with business wireless service revenue growth of 7.9% and a sequential increase in our firstnet wireless base of $334,000.
additionally, we had about $100 million in revenue from intellectual property transaction in the quarter. this is about $80 million more than the prior year. for context, this is an action we've taken in the past when favorable opportunities to rise. now i'd like to quickly touch on our capital allocation strategy.
overall, our priorities remain unchanged, and we're largely past the heavy lift of reorienting our company's focus on our core connectivity strengths. as a result, we've established a more sustainable financial structure that better positions us for the current environment. we also have enough flexibility to invest in our business while meeting our financial obligations. in the third quarter, the $3.8 billion in free cash flow we delivered was largely in line with our expectations.
and given the expected timing of our capital investments, we feel good about our line of sight to achieving our free cash flow target in the $14 billion range for the year. we are very comfortable with our cash levels after paying our dividend commitment, and this should only increase in the future years as we expect cash conversion to improve from here. our results today have only further solidified our confidence that we will exit 2022 stronger than we entered the year. in fact, we continue to expect ebit growth and higher free cash flows in 2023.
we also plan to continue to use excess cash after dividends to reduce debt with a goal of reaching a net debt to adjusted ebitda range of 2.5 times and as we typically do, we'll provide 2023 guidance when we share our fourth quarter results. amir, that's our presentation. we're now ready for q&a.
amir rozwadowski -- senior vice president, finance, and investor relations
thank you, pascal. operator, we're ready to take the first question.
",":
operator
of course. [operator instructions] our first question today comes from the line of phil cusick with j.p. morgan. please go ahead.
phil cusick -- jpmorgan chase and company -- analyst
hi, guys. thank you. short and sweet, i love it. i guess first, pascal, the free cash flow bridge to $14 billion, just to reiterate.
help us think about that as we go into the fourth quarter, you need at least $6 billion. and you said capex, it sounds like it's coming down. that's a good part of it. and then as we think about next year for what you can give us, how should we think about things like taxes, pension as well as the industry overall.
and i know you don't want to update it, but given how much the world has changed, is that $20 billion free cash flow guide even relevant anymore? thanks very much.
pascal desroches -- chief financial officer
hey, phil. i appreciate the question. good morning. maybe let's start with regard to the $14 billion for this year, the simple way to think about it, we delivered $3.8 billion this quarter.
and that is when we spent $6.8 billion in capital. next quarter, we reiterated our guide for the full year of $24 billion. so next quarter, that would suggest around $4.5 billion. and so you do the simple math, that gets you exactly where you need to get to for the full year.
and as a general matter as well, the fourth quarter -- the back half of the year, we always convert at a higher rate than the first half of the year. so all in all, great line of sight. in terms of next year, you mentioned the macros. that is the very reason why we are not providing updated guidance right now, and we're going to stick to our -- what we communicated last quarter and that we'll update you at year end when we report our fourth quarter results.
with that said, as you heard from my prepared remarks, we expect ebitda and cash to grow net -- free cash flow to grow next year. in fact, we just look at this past quarter, we grew cash continuing nearly 10%. so it's really strong growth -- organic growth from the business, and this is exactly what we anticipated coming into the year. what are the factors that are going to drive improved earnings and cash next year.
mobility. mobility business is performing much better than we expected coming into the year. subscriber base is bigger than we anticipated and arpu trends are better. two, fiber.
again, fiber is performing really well. and the mix shift that we're seeing to fiber comes with higher profit margins, higher arpu. so that's also expected -- consumer wireline expected to grow next year. we should see some moderation in the overall business wireline trends because of the cost efforts that we are undertaking.
and then you layer on top of that things like transformation savings more broadly, starting to fall to the bottom line as our investments begin to have pit and begin to dissipate over time. and lower interest is another factor to keep in mind as we delever. and then all that is going to be partially offset by higher cash taxes. magnitude, i'd say, is consistent with what we've previously guided and then slightly less dtv distributions.
all in all, we feel really good about the trajectory of the business. and when you look at an annual dividend commitment of $8 billion and a growing free cash flow, the model is working exactly as we anticipated.
phil cusick -- jpmorgan chase and company -- analyst
thanks, pascal.
amir rozwadowski -- senior vice president, finance, and investor relations
thanks very much. if we can move on to the next question.
operator
our next question comes from the line of brett feldman with goldman sachs. please go ahead.
brett feldman -- goldman sachs -- analyst
yeah. thank you for taking the question and really just sort of two here on fiber. the first is it's great to see that the fiber net adds continue to gain momentum. you now have a larger fiber broadband subscriber base than non-fiber, but you haven't quite turned the corner sustainably yet on net positive broadband growth.
and so i was hoping you can comment on how you see the path unfolding there. and do you just need a bigger fiber footprint to get there? and then the follow-up on that question is there was a report yesterday you're considering a potential fiber jv. i'm sure you're somewhat limited on what you can say. so the higher level question would be your existing fiber build is being completely funded out of your cash flow from operations.
so if you were looking to do something incremental, including with a partner, what kind of boxes would you have to check? is this about speed or breadth or potentially something else? thank you.
john stankey -- chief executive officer
hi, brett. i appreciate the question. certainly, a bigger fiber footprint allows us to improve our relative net add performance in broadband. i think the short answer to your question is for the next several quarters will be in this dance around what i would call, at least on the subscriber counts, something close to near zero.
but you ought to understand as pascal just indicated to you, our yields on fiber customers are, of course, much better than our copper customers, combination of arpu, churn characteristics and frankly, the operating performance profile, which i know you've observed that there's still room for our margin expansion in the consumer wireline business and that we should be looking at that relative to others in the industry. and i think that's an accurate observation over time as we continue to scale the business that will continue to improve profitability in it. but we still have several quarters of working through the dynamic of getting the legacy dynamics out of the business and focusing on the new infrastructure and the growth and that's a journey we're committed to. and i think you're seeing that it's got strong economic promise as we move through that and continue to increase the size of the fiber base i don't know that i could add a whole lot to you on your question about what we might think about in terms of doing other fiber builds that are out of our operating territory.
first of all, i'm not going to acknowledge your comment specifically on some of the speculation that's shown up in the media. but i think i have shared most recently when i was in arizona, and we were doing the work in mesa, that we're evaluating it under many of the same criteria and circumstances that we look at within our existing operating footprint. number one, can we go in and be the first fiber provider in an area; two, do we believe it's a market where the brand is going to perform, and we'll get the rate and pace of penetration that we need to make an economic return on it; three, can we build because of the dynamics around the particular municipality or area cost effectively and quickly with a relatively low overhead around that and get what i would call an operating scale in that geography that warrants the fixed cost infrastructure start-up. and then finally, do we think that there's some interplay in terms of having the asset and improving value in our wireless business as we operate in the area as well, and it marries into our distribution.
so to the extent that we found opportunities like that, that had as competitive returns is building in our region, i think the management team would have to evaluate those types of things and think about how it moves forward on them. and i would tell you, as i've indicated as well, that there will be some federal subsidy monies coming in, in places, and we should use that same sort of criteria in that same model as we think about are there opportunities for us to pair our capital with possibly public capital to open up opportunities that we might not have pursued otherwise.
brett feldman -- goldman sachs -- analyst
thank you.
amir rozwadowski -- senior vice president, finance, and investor relations
thanks very much.
operator
our next to the line of simon flannery with morgan stanley. please go ahead.
simon flannery -- morgan stanley -- analyst
thank you very much. john, you opened your comments mentioning the world faced a period of uncertainty. you've been looking at that for a little while. it would be great if you could and pascal update us on what you're seeing real time both on the business side in terms of cutting back it budgets, etc., and how that may evolve over the next few quarters as they deal with some of the stresses from inflation demand? and then on the consumer side, obviously, you've called out the dso issue last quarter.
good to hear the free cash flow reiterated this quarter. so perhaps you could update us on payment trends on bad debts and how we should think about churn here as your sort of pricing increases sort of mature going forward? thanks.
john stankey -- chief executive officer
sure. simon, why don't i start and then pascal is welcome to add any color they think they don't treat appropriately here. look, on the business side, one is i would tell you, i think the overriding dynamic in business is actually somewhat disconnected from the economy, and that is we're in a secular change to cloud and we're in a secular change to sdn. and we've talked about that, and i've talked about it, and it's one of the reasons we're repositioning the business segment.
and i think it's one of the reasons why us making sure that we are very careful in how we deploy owned and operated infrastructure that we can handle business workloads on is so important to us. when we think about that dynamic, we actually play very well into an efficiency story for most established in large businesses. and it's a little bit of a painful transition, but over time, we'll get through it, and there'll be a side back in the core connectivity business on owned and operated infrastructure. and that's simply the private networks that we had previously put out that were highly managed and highly architected are now moving to sdn-based technologies that are less managed but more bandwidth intensive.
and we want to play into the uplift on putting more bandwidth intensive infrastructure out there and selling those connections on owned and operated infrastructure but the enterprise gets an efficiency benefit out of sdn because those less managed networks are not as costly to them on an aggregate basis. and so i don't think the move from an economic perspective, if there are budgets that are strapped is necessarily going to impact that transition, if it did anything, it might slow it down a bit. if it slowed it down, it would probably, frankly, be somewhat beneficial to us because margin structures on existing architectures are a little bit more attractive than on new infrastructure. but if ultimately people view it as an efficiency move and they want to run their businesses more efficiently, i think those trends are manifested in what you've seen over the last several years in the business, and i don't know that they will necessarily adjust as a result of that.
in the small business side, certainly small business formation can be hit during a down economic cycle. and i would expect that in the business segment that might be something that we ultimately see occur if there's a more moderate economic growth environment. but once again, unfortunately, for us, we're under-indexed in the small business segment. we're working to change that, and we're demonstrating progress in that regard, but my embedded base of subscribers in that area for what we do in advanced networking is not as strong in the fixed market as i might like it to be.
so i don't know that we'll be overly impacted by that. we could see some softness in the wireless space if, in fact, the economy ultimately did had a little bit harder sledding moving forward that might moderate some wireless growth. but look, we've been getting more than our fair share in that segment. a lot of it's been driven out of firstnet.
i don't expect that trend didn't necessarily abate right now even in a down economic cycle. relative to some of your other questions on other economic characteristics and how it impacts the business, we've seen no change in dso relative to last quarter. we are back to pre-pandemic levels. we characterize that for you last quarter.
there hasn't been any additional slip. we, i think, accurately reflected to you in our guidance what the impact was going to be for the year. last quarter, that's still tracking consistently with what we articulated to you. we're seeing bad debt start to return back to pre-pandemic levels.
certainly, we'll have to watch that if the economy sours further. it tends to correlate to what occurs in the economy, but i see nothing right now that would suggest we're out of pattern on anything. we certainly haven't done any change credit standards in our approaches and practices to managing credit quality. and i think you've seen how we performed in the past in that regard where we have a high-quality base that allows us to kind of manage through those dynamics reasonably well if the economy goes one way or the other.
as i characterized earlier today in some of my public comments, turns up a bit. it's not out of line with what we expected when we did the pricing changes. we were able to execute the pricing change in a way that we feel very comfortable with, most importantly, the vast majority of our customers are talking to us. they're making adjustments to their plans, moving them into higher-value plans while having higher arpus on them, return more value to the customer that allows them to be a stickier and longer live customer.
we think that over the long haul is great. on the margin, there has been some churn moving out that we expected. it's no greater than what we expected. it still makes the pricing changes accretive overall, and you certainly have seen that manifested in the numbers and the operations that have come forward.
simon flannery -- morgan stanley -- analyst
right. thank you, john.
amir rozwadowski -- senior vice president, finance, and investor relations
thanks very much. if we can move to the next question.
operator
and our next question comes from the line of john hodulik with ubs. please go ahead.
john hodulik -- ubs -- analyst
hey. great. thanks, guys. you guys have some real momentum in wireless in terms of subs, arpu, and now our margins.
i mean just give us a sense for what kind of visibility you have that those three metrics continue to head in the right direction. and then as a follow-up, with the broadband fiber expansion and potentially the balance [inaudible] any change in the view on fixed wireless. obviously, both ryzen and t-mobile having a lot of success in selling that product. just your view on that as we head into 2023.
thanks.
john stankey -- chief executive officer
so, john, i think our visibility is really good. i mean we run a subscription-based business. and as you know, those customer relationships tend to be pretty sticky relationships. and we have every ability to understand how we're bringing the customer and today and at what profitability level they're coming in.
we understand the base and how the base is performing. i think we have reasonable ways to look at some of the dynamics that changed around things like roaming and have visibility toward those impacts and how they're going to work through. you just heard my commentary with simon on some of the bigger drivers of profitability in the subscription business around churn and how we think about the dynamics associated with that. so when i look at our ability to kind of understand why we're getting operating momentum, we communicated to you at the beginning of the year that you should expect the back half story on this, and you're seeing the back half story.
and now we're in the middle of the fourth quarter right now. we're obviously aware of what our numbers are right now. and i would say we have confidence that we're going to be able to deliver those continued leverage dynamics that we talked about. so i feel pretty good about our visibility on that subscription base and we've built a quality subscription base and brought in quality customers that are now starting to give us that profitability lift as well as we have visibility into our cost structure and all the work that we've done around that.
and as i've said, since the beginning of the year that we would start to see some of that move to the bottom line as we stabilized our promotional position in the market, which i think you've seen us do, and we are still maintaining market momentum with that. and so i feel really good about it. i don't know that anything has changed in fixed wireless. as i said, repetitively that it has a place in our portfolio.
that place is not broad-scale deployment in every operating territory and geography that we operate in. we-the way i would characterize it, i'd rather take 1 million new fiber customers a year than 1 million new fixed wireless customers a quarter. the value equation of those 1 million fiber customers is a far superior value equation for the long haul for our shareholders. and as a result of that, we're focused on ensuring that we can continue to grow our fiber footprint and bring on those high-value, sustainable durable relationships where we're able to have a network infrastructure that matches consumer consumption dynamics now and into the future.
fixed wireless will be that answer in a small number of geographies and applications and homes. it will not be to our entire nationwide base. and so investing shareholder money at the front end right now just to drive top-line growth that i don't think is sustainable over a three-, four-, five-year period, is not the best use of my management team's time and the best use of our scarce capital. the best use of it is to put it against putting in durable infrastructure, continuing to bring on high-value wireless customers, build our wireless network to be really effective in the next set of applications that are going to be necessary to bring the promise of 5g to life as we start to see the dynamics of autonomy and vehicles emerge, some of the medical monitoring capabilities, private 5g that starts to work into the enterprise space.
we want our wireless network to be ready to service those workloads and do it in a pristine fashion because we think those revenues will come back with the kind of margin characteristics that we've typically operated the wireless business at. and so i feel really comfortable with our balance about that, and we'll use fixed wireless as we move into next year, where it's appropriate to use it, but it will not be broad scale. pascal, did i miss anything from your perspective there?
pascal desroches -- chief financial officer
nope.
amir rozwadowski -- senior vice president, finance, and investor relations
thanks very much, john. and we can move to the next question.
operator
and our next question comes from the line of david barden with bank of america. please go ahead.
david barden -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
hey, guys. thanks so much for taking the questions. i guess a couple if i could. i guess the first question, pascal.
could you talk a little bit about how the interest rate environment is affecting the income statement. i guess, specifically with respect to probably two items. one is the fixed versus floating. and the other would be how the net impact on the pensions is being affected in terms of discount rate for the pbo and then, obviously, the impact on returns in the portfolio.
i guess the second piece i would ask would be on the wireless business. obviously, the dish wholesale arrangement was expected to be kind of a big contributor or a tailwind as we go into the year. could you just talk about how, if at all, that's affected this year's performance to date and how we might expect that to evolve? thanks.
pascal desroches -- chief financial officer
in terms of first, the interest rate environment, one of the things that we did, dave, over the last two, three years is to really reconstruct our maturity towers and took advantage of historically low-interest rates we were seeing coming out of the pandemic. as a result, right now, we have a debt tower -- a series of debt outstanding that are yielding around 4% on average. and 95% of it is fixed. and if you look at our maturities over the next several years, our free cash flows after dividend could largely handle those.
in the instance that there are slightly higher towers, we can always roll on a short-term basis. but what we've done is we've reconstructed the way we are managing capital such that we can really continue to delever over the next several years without any meaningful need to go out to the market to raise debt. so that interest rate. in terms of pension mark-to-market, in terms of pension, big picture from a cash standpoint for the foreseeable future, let's talk the next decade, there's probably no need to fund the pension plan.
now with that said, there is with the discount rate coming down. we've had some going up. we've had some big gains that we normalized out of our reported earnings. on a -- going through next year, i would expect higher pension expense because of the fact that now we have -- we're going to be discounting at higher interest rates.
but all in all, those are noncash pieces that when we think about the long-term profile of operating this company. the fact what's most important to us is that there is no need to go fund the pension plan for the foreseeable future. and in terms of the dish mvno, it's not a meaningful contributor this year. we would anticipate as we look out the next several years, it should ramp up, and we feel really good about the overall arrangement with this.
david barden -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst

amir rozwadowski -- senior vice president, finance, and investor relations
thanks very much, david. operator, we can move to the next question.

our next question comes from the line of michael rollins with citi. please go ahead.
mike rollins -- citi -- analyst
thanks. just to dig in a little bit more to wireless. in the presentation, it was flagged that the business wireless service revenue grew 8% year over year, and i think the total was around 6%. so curious, if you can unpack a bit more of the differences in trends that you're seeing between the business side of wireless and the consumer side of wireless? and then as you're talking about the next stages of 5g and the opportunities, i was reading in the press release that you're flagging the success of iot and connected device volumes.
i'm curious if you can unpack that a little bit more in terms of, i think the automotive industry was one place you referenced in the release on success. where are you seeing success in those verticals? and are you seeing any kind of inflection in the near to medium term where this b2b iot opportunity could become more expensive for at&t in the industry?
john stankey -- chief executive officer
sure, mike. let me see if i can get at your first question. i think i understand what you're looking for. if i don't quite hit this, then feel free to follow up with me.
but look, there's no two businesses or alike is the first thing i'd tell you. and so as you look at kind of how you would characterize the relative profitability of a business subscriber coming on, a lot depends on which segment you're looking at. i would tell you, generally speaking, our highest arpu dynamics tend to occur in the consumer market when you kind of look at what we're able to do in family plan structures and what occurs there. our growth in business still highly profitable growth, but under some constructs like what we are able to do with firstnet approaches as you would expect, people who buy at larger volume tend to get better rates.
and so you see that ultimately flow through or maybe your arpu dynamics around business are going to be a little bit less than what they might be in the consumer segment where people aren't able to buy at that kind of volume. now having said that, you're looking at our overall arpu trends, and you're seeing them improve and start to accrete and grow. and that's reflective of the fact that while we're doing very well in the business segment taking share, we're still growing arpu in aggregate. so despite those differences in the average arpus and what's occurring, we are still managing to grow that arpu dynamic overall, and that's a healthy place for us to be right now.
and as you've seen, our margin structure relatively stable as we go through this quarter, and that's what's helping, of course, on some of the cash yields. on the iot side, look, our main state profitability in iot comes in vehicles. that really hasn't changed. i don't expect in the near term, over the course of what i would call the guidance and planning cycle that that's going to demonstrably change moving forward.
i think there's a good opportunity for us to find the next level of growth in automotive. and i think we -- given our strong position in that market today are well-positioned to continue to work in that regard. and i think -- when you think about each vehicle out there and the intensity of communication that's going to occur, there's an opportunity for growth in that space to build on. and that's one of the most attractive areas that we'll continue to push in.
do i think that over time that in the spaces of manufacturing and medical devices that there's also an iot opportunity to develop that as we get beyond what i would call the planning and guidance cycle that we give you, i do. but i don't think those are going to be the kind of thing that as we characterize an update for you for 2023 that you're going to see those factor in, in any meaningful way in kind of business-to-business revenues that you look at and say that their pattern changes overall. hopefully, that's responsive to your questions, mike, if you want to refine the first one, feel free to follow up here.
mike rollins -- citi -- analyst
thanks. it's very helpful. and i was just thinking just even on the top line service revenue side with the business service revenue growth faster than the overall and then implicitly consumer. is that something that you would expect to continue where just business is just going to be a bigger contributor to the wireless business going forward?
john stankey -- chief executive officer
i do expect that's going to be the case because as we shared with you, we have a number of dynamics going on in our distribution strategies that have driven that. and this is -- we keep saying it, i'm not sure it's fully being processed that our stance in the market and how we're offering in the market is not just driven by a promotional device stance. this is partly driven by we have managed to shift our distribution strategy and approach into the market, and we're doing better in these segments. and these are not sales that are necessarily being driven by people walking into stores, taking an upgrade on a device.
and that's why our overall profitability dynamics are shifting in the way they have been. and we've been able to give you some visibility to how that's occurring. and when we're successfully taking share in the public sector under things like firstnet and when there's affinity dynamics that start to work into that and the households of first responders and when we're more effective at tuning our distribution in the mid part of the market for business and where we've historically been, you are going to see faster growth for us in the business segment. and i think the results speak for themselves on what we're able to bring in relative to the balance of the industry on that.
mike rollins -- citi -- analyst
thanks.
amir rozwadowski -- senior vice president, finance, and investor relations
thanks very much, mike. operator, if we can move to the next question.
operator
our next question comes from the line of kannan venkateshwar with barclays. please go ahead.
kannan venkateshwar -- barclays -- analyst
thank you. a couple if i could. i mean, first, on the fiber side, we've seen penetration growth slow a little bit. obviously, the absolute number keeps growing and accelerating every quarter sequentially.
but then when we look at it in terms of penetration rate, i think it slowed a little bit versus what you were able to achieve last date. so it would be good to understand what the puts and takes there are? and how we should expect that to evolve as we go forward. and then, i mean, i guess, an associated question is the non fiber decline rate is also accelerating. and so how much of the growth that we are seeing in fiber is on account of transfers from maybe the non-fiber side to the fiber side.
and lastly, just pascal, on the $20 billion free cash flow guide for next year, could you give us a sense of what kind of metal variables are being assumed for that guidance in terms of potential recessions or the growth environment in general? thanks.
john stankey -- chief executive officer
so, kannan, let me take the first part of your question, and then i'll let pascal do some cleanup here. so first of all, what you should expect is that over the life cycle of a build, and i think we've been pretty clear on giving you insights into this. let's call it, the first 30% of penetration goes relatively quickly, and the next 20% takes a little bit longer. and so it would be natural that as we build that when you kind of get yourself to a 30% penetration rate, you're going to see that curve start to slow down a bit, and that's to be expected.
i think the biggest change that's occurred in penetration is how quickly we're getting to the 20% level versus historic numbers. and as we shared with you previously, we've kind of doubled our pace to penetration on the front end of that curve. and i've also shared with you that if you look at a typical return characteristic cash flow analysis of the investment of fiber, there are effectively three big things that drive that return dynamic and how effective the returns are, one of which is rate of penetration. and when we did the original assumptions on kind of our fiber business case, we had a much more ratable and deliberate ramp into that first 30% of subscribers in the business case.
and now what we managed to do is we managed to effectively take a year off the cycle to get to the 20% mark. that is a huge impact on accelerating cash flows to the front end of the business case and it has a meaningful impact on the characterization of returns, even if you don't increase the ultimate assumption of what the terminal penetration is. and so i would tell you, we've already kind of had success in that regard. we characterize that for you.
but we've not made any assumptions at that once you hit that 30% level that the back end is going to go any faster. and so i think you're going to see a degree of penetration slowdown as we kind of hit that 30% and that's to be expected. it's been historic and that doesn't mean it's a bad thing. it just takes a little bit longer to kind of get to what i would call as the market norm and kind of stability of how we expect shares to be allocated between the various players in the market.
so hopefully, that gives you a little bit of sense on that. we don't publicly disclose the transfer rates and kind of what's going on there, kannan. but look, you've got enough public information that we shared with you i think pretty well can conclude that if we're turning in the kind of numbers we're turning in, that there's got to be a meaningful percentage of that total fiber increase number that's coming from competitors in order to deliver the number. and we watch it.
we track it closely. i think both are good, right? because what we know that any customer we move from legacy or embedded infrastructure over to fiber becomes a new established long-term customer with us, they're not going anywhere once we get them on fiber. but most importantly, we don't turn in the kind of numbers we communicated to you this quarter unless we're doing something that's moving share in the market, and we all know where that share has to come from. it's coming from in almost all cases, the embedded cable provider.
pascal desroches -- chief financial officer
and kannan, on free cash flow, as i said earlier, we're not updating our guidance for 2023. but what i did say, we're over three-quarters of the way through this year. and based upon our view of where the macros and all the potential risk, we expect this business to grow both earnings and free cash next year. and for all the reasons i articulated earlier on.
and in terms of just the broader macros. look, we're not immune to them, but these businesses are generally more resilient even in an economic stress situation. so overall, i mean, that's -- we'll give you an update next year.
kannan venkateshwar -- barclays -- analyst
thanks.
amir rozwadowski -- senior vice president, finance, and investor relations
thanks very much, kannan. operator, can we move to the next question?
operator
of course. our next question comes from the line of frank louthan with raymond james. please go ahead.
frank louthan -- raymond james -- analyst
great. thank you very much. with your success with wireless, i just wanted to be clear how you're thinking about the promotional activity going forward. any need to back off some of that promotional activity, you're clearly seeing good strong margin improvement without that? and then i had a follow-up question on the fiber jv.
i can appreciate not wanting to comment on the story, but conceptually, would you be open to some outside investment to possibly reach some of those areas of your territory that aren't necessarily economical with your own capital going forward? thanks.
john stankey -- chief executive officer
frank, thanks for asking the quarterly question on what's sustainable. it was sustainable for another quarter, and that's been two and a half years now. and i'll let you know next quarter if two years, two and three-quarter years. so i feel really comfortable with where we are.
i think you're seeing the strategy play out. i look at where the market sits today, and i'll reiterate what i said earlier in the call. we're not the one out there at $1,000 for new iphones right now. we are at a different place than i believe both of our primary competitors.
and i also characterize for you. you need to understand a lot of our growth is not coming from what we have as offers that we're communicating in the market. mike's question is a really important question, looking at the consumer business mix. and when we think about how we're spending our promotional dollars, i characterize for you in the goldman conference that there's a lot of other aspects of promotion how advertising gets done, how heavy you have to be to communicate your message if you're doing a more promotional stance, what you have to do in your channels to incent people to sell and change things.
the formula and the mix we have is a very competitive formula and mix right now across consumer and business, across our mix of promotional strategies or distribution partners, and one should not just simply say, because the lead offer that's being communicated in mass advertising is x, ask whether or not that's sustainable. the question is, are our customer acquisition cost sustainable. you're seeing the profitability improvement. you're seeing the arpu improvement, and i think that's a pretty sustainable equation.
i'm not going to comment on the fiber jv structure. i will make an observation, frank. it's my duty to always keep my mind open to new ideas. it's my responsibility in running the business and if there's an opportunity for us to do something that's in our wheelhouse, that's in the strength of the capabilities that we have as a company and it's core and foundational to our brand to try to ensure that we seize those opportunities and move forward on them.
we certainly have a past practice. the wireless business was built with partners. i think you should understand and look back and we've done that effectively in the past and things that we've done, and we've done it in a responsible way for shareholders, and it's been a means for us to think differently about how footprint expansion can be done. we've certainly used that kind of an approach before.
we understand how the approach works. i think about it in aspects to all kinds of elements of our business and i've got to keep an open mind to those things moving forward.
amir rozwadowski -- senior vice president, finance, and investor relations
thank you very much. operator, we have time for one last question.
operator
and that question comes from the line of walter piecyk with lightshed. please go ahead.
walter piecyk -- lightshed partners -- analyst
thanks. hey, john. when i look at postpaid, which is probably the prior focus on revenue for the company, you've increased revenue or it's accelerated for the past eight quarters. so i guess when i look at the first part of that, you kind of referenced that in the last question.
we were talking about how one was talking about the [inaudible] promotions. you saw very good subscriber growth and that sustained. and now when we look at the past year, it's been in part on price increases to some of the legacy plants. so now you've got this whatever, very -- 6% growth in postpaid.
if you just sustain that going forward, that will probably be consensus. you probably don't need to stand, but when you look at '23, is it going to be a component of more price increases? or do you think subscribers are going to help you for growth in at? and my second question, which is related is part of the arpu increase for others was bundling in netflix or for your case, hbo max, that you cut, and i think in june 1st for new customers, maybe that's been helping your profitability, i don't know, but is there an opportunity to repack some of these streaming services into your offers in order to get arpu even higher?
john stankey -- chief executive officer
so well, i appreciate the question. first of all, i think it's important when you look at the disclosures and what we've given you for the quarter. as you know, there's always some onetime things that pop into a given quarter that drive the numbers. i think your overall characterization is accurate, which is we're improving the yields of the revenue growth and what falls to the bottom line on ebitda.
i'm not going to suggest it simply because we're going to get 6% revenue growth that we should expect that we're going to immediately get to 6% yield, but you've seen those yields improving each quarter, and we have a lot of confidence that, that's going to continue to occur and it's consistent with the guidance that we've given moving through the balance of this year. and i think we have really good visibility for that improvement to happen and there's a lot of factors that move into that, one of which is managing the cost structure more effectively. in '23, look, i don't know exactly what the environment is going to be, and i'm not going to announce anything today in the market. we'll announce any of the changes we make in the market when it's time to change it.
but when i look at the reality of the inflationary environment and understanding in this kind of a rapid inflation environment, you need to manage the revenue side of the equation as well as you manage cost side of the equation. the answer to that is yes. i think that's what a responsible management team does, exactly what lever we choose to pull will be an artifact of the environment we find ourselves in, but i can assure you the team has sat down and as we've looked at planning and as we prepare to give you guidance, for the year. we'll ensure that we have the right options and levers available to us to adjust to that.
and as i said, we've got to work both sides of that equation. but i'm not going to tell you today that a preannounced set of tactics or strategies around that, especially on things that are relative to how we price in the market. on the content side, i don't think we've gotten any benefit, walt, from content relative to the industry. we still have a lot of customers that get content bundled into their services, and we still view that as an important aspect of how we compete in the market.
and as i think i shared last quarter, i would expect going forward that we'll have opportunities to incorporate content offerings in different ways into our portfolio. we still view our relationship with warner bros., discovery, and hbo max as being an important one, and it's been valuable and effective for us. but there's also others that could be worthwhile and beneficial to us. we're adjusting our strategies as we move into '23.
i think you'll see some things adjust and change as we do that. so i think i'd say stay tuned. i think you're going to see content and ancillary services continue to be part of the wireless bundle in the industry moving forward. i think will play in a prudent fashion in our overall promotional dynamic, as i said earlier, managing effectively as part of that overall cost structure and it will allow us to do a number of flexible things now that we don't necessarily have a captive content engine, so to speak, under the umbrella of at&t.

thank you for standing by. welcome to at&t's fourth-quarter 2022 earnings call. at this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. [operator instructions] following the presentation of the call, we'll be open for questions.
[operator instructions] as a reminder, this conference is being recorded. i would like to turn the conference call over to our host, amir rozwadowski, senior vice president of finance and investor relations. please go ahead.
amir rozwadowski -- senior vice president, finance and investor relations
thank you. good morning, everyone. welcome to our fourth-quarter call. i'm amir rozwadowski, head of investor relations for at&t.
joining me today on the call are john stankey, our ceo; and pascal desroches, our cfo. before we begin, i need to call your attention to our safe harbor statement. it says that some of our comments today may be forward-looking. as such, they're subject to risks and uncertainties described in at&t's sec filings.
results may differ materially. additional information, as well as our earnings materials, are available on the investor relations website. with that, i'll turn the call over to john stankey. john? 
john stankey -- chief executive officer
thanks, amir. and happy new year, everyone. i appreciate you joining us today, and i hope you enjoyed a restful and healthy holiday season. and at the conclusion of this call, i'm declaring the statute of limitations on this being the new year has run out.
i'll share upfront that our commentary is a bit longer than usual. however, we thought it was important to provide a bit more clarity on our business today, primarily our fiber strategy, since we haven't had an opportunity to discuss our december gigapower joint venture announcement. still, we'll ensure we have enough time to get to most of your questions. as i reflect on not only this past year but the past 2.5 years, it's clear that our teams have worked diligently to refocus at&t around the connectivity strategy, which has simplified our company and positioned it for sustainable growth.
our results over the past 10 quarters demonstrate we are on our way to delivering the full promise of the strategy. we're operating a streamlined and return-focused business with an improved-profit trajectory that's committed to generating sustained cash earnings growth while delivering an attractive dividend. underpinning all of our actions is a deep desire to connect our customers with greater possibility through 5g and fiber. and importantly, we're assembling the right assets, talent, and capital structure to offer an experience and value proposition that customers appreciate.
our fourth-quarter results are the latest example of how our teams continue to consistently deliver for our customers. we finished 2022 with strong momentum in growing customer relationships. and as you can see from our profitability trends, we're growing them in the right way. so, let me highlight some of our progress.
let's start with wireless. we delivered 656,000 postpaid phone net adds in the fourth quarter and nearly 2.9 million postpaid phone net adds for the full year. and over the past 2.5 years, we've increased our postpaid phone base by nearly 7 million to 69.6 million subscribers which represents our best 10-quarter stretch of wireless growth in more than a decade. during the same 10-quarter time span, we've grown wireless service revenues, ebitda ,and also increased our postpaid phone arpu by nearly $1.
and while others may have jumped the gun to claim that they were the only ones to reduce churn in the fourth quarter on a year-over-year basis, we also lowered our fourth-quarter postpaid and postpaid phone churn without offering richer promotions or free line giveaways. we consider this yet another data point, highlighting that our comprehensive approach to improving the entire customer experience is working, from our simplified go-to-market strategy, to our better network experience, to our focused market segmentation practices. on top of that, our growth was not only robust but profitable with 2022 being the most profitable year ever for our mobility business. we expect profit growth to continue in 2023 as we benefit from the investments we've made in our business over the last 2.5 years.
our network teams have also consistently outpaced our mid-band 5g spectrum rollout objective. in fact, we now reach 150 million mid-band 5g pops, more than double our initial 2022 year-end target. our goal remains to deploy our spectrum efficiently and in a manner that supports traffic growth. in the markets where we have broadly deployed mid-band 5g, 25% of our traffic in these areas already takes advantage of our mid-band spectrum.
now, let's move to fiber. where we build fiber, we continue to win. we had more than 1.2 million at&t fiber net adds last year. the fifth straight year, we've totaled more than 1 million at&t fiber net adds.
and after 2.9 million at&t fiber net adds over the last 2.5 years, we've now reached an inflection point where our fiber subscribers outnumber are nonfiber and dsl subscribers. the financial benefits of our fiber focus are also becoming increasingly apparent as full-year fiber revenue growth of nearly 29% has led to sustainable revenue and profit growth in our consumer wireline business. as we scale our fiber footprint, we also expect to drive margin expansion. in summary, we're enhancing and expanding our networks while extending our long runway for sustainable growth.
and i'm very happy with the high quality and consistent customer adds we achieved last year. we've emphasized that our plan was to grow customer relationships in a thoughtful and responsible way grounded by an enhanced value proposition that resonated with customers. and that's exactly what our teams have done quarter after quarter. in addition to growing customer relationships, we've executed some of the most challenging actions associated with repositioning our operations.
we've doubled down on our cost transformation. we've now achieved more than $5 billion of our $6 billion plus cost savings run rate target. in 2023, you can expect the benefits from these efforts to increasingly fall to the bottom line. in fact, you've already seen the benefits of this cost transformation beginning to translate into operating leverage despite inflationary pressures.
our teams did an excellent job implementing pricing actions and business efficiencies to offset continued inflationary impacts, impacts we anticipate will be with us in the near to midterm. part of tapping into these efficiencies entails improving acquisition costs and further streamlining our operations and distribution. another part entails rationalizing our wireline copper infrastructure and reinvesting those savings into fiber and wireless where we're seeing improving returns. as we look at our last priority, we also continue to generate meaningful levels of free cash flow even with record levels of investment.
this gives us confidence in our ability to continue delivering an attractive dividend today and in the future, while also improving the credit quality of that dividend as we expect to increase our cash generation over time. we strengthened our balance sheet last year, reducing our net debt by about $24 billion. so, as we close 2022, i'm proud of what the at&t team accomplished despite a competitive market and challenging macro environment. turning to 2023, what's our strategy? well, it's simple.
do it again. what exactly does that mean? it means we're focused on the same three operational and business priorities we set in place 2.5 years ago. as i've mentioned time and again, our north star remains solely focused on becoming the best connectivity provider with 5g and fiber. we're confident we can achieve this because, in wireless, we'll maintain our focus on building durable and sustainable customer growth in a rational, return-focused manner.
just as we've done over the past 10 quarters, we'll continue to take a disciplined approach to selectively target underpenetrated areas of the consumer and business marketplace and improve the perception and execution of our value proposition. we also expect to continue our 5g expansion, reaching more than 200 million people with mid-band 5g by the end of 2023. in wired broadband, we have the nation's largest and fastest-growing fiber internet, and we expect continued healthy subscriber growth as we grow our fiber footprint. as we keep expanding our subscriber base, we'll drive efficiencies in everything we do.
this includes consistently elevating our customer experience through the improved durability and reliability of our 5g and fiber networks. when we couple our evolving networks with further enhancements to our distribution and digital and self-service channels, we'll make a competitive customer experience even more appealing. we expect to realize additional benefits from our consistent go-to-market strategy and lower cost structures we also benefit from our improved brand perception, strong fiber and wireless asset base, broad distribution, and converged product offers. additionally, we have a clear line of sight to achieving our $6 billion-plus cost savings run rate target by the end of this year.
we expect even more of these savings to fall to the bottom line as the year progresses. with that improved performance, we remain focused on further strengthening the balance sheet by using cash after dividends to reduce debt as we progress toward our target of a 2.5 times range for net debt to adjusted ebitda. our commitment to providing an attractive annual dividend also remains firm. as our capex is expected to moderate exiting this year following the peak investment levels of 2022 and 2023, we expect the credit quality of our dividend to improve on the back of our higher free cash flow and improved financial flexibility.
in summary, we feel confident that our growth and profit trends are sustainable despite the uncertain macroeconomic backdrop. as i stated previously, we continue to expect that we will be operating in a challenging macroeconomic environment where wireless industry growth is likely to return to more normalized levels. the resiliency of the services we provide are time-tested and only growing in importance. when you couple this resiliency with the investments we've made to our networks and proven go-to-market strategy, we're confident in our ability to navigate potential economic headwinds that may emerge.
and our improving financial flexibility only further strengthens that confidence. now, i'd like to take a moment to touch upon our fiber strategy by quickly level setting on how i'm thinking about the success we've had, our plans for the next few years, and how we'll hold ourselves accountable. similar to the early days of wireless, we consider fiber a multiyear opportunity that will transform the way consumers and businesses growing connectivity needs are met in the ensuing decade and beyond. for at&t, we segment this opportunity into three distinct buckets based on the specific input parameters and return dynamics each one possesses.
the first is our in-footprint build where we can take advantage of our existing infrastructure, deep insights on both the customer base and competitive landscape, and our market presence in order to take share and deliver attractive returns. we believe our performance over the last few years supports the wisdom of allocating our capital to these opportunities with sustainable and solid return characteristics. as we stated previously, we currently size this opportunity is passing 30 million-plus consumer and business locations within our existing wireline footprint by the end of 2025. we finished last year with approximately 24 million fiber locations passed, including businesses, of which more than 22 million locations are sellable, which we define as our ability to serve.
our build to these locations is providing great returns as you can see from our growing fiber revenues and arpus. as a general rule, about 5% of consumer locations passed may not be immediately sellable, primarily due to timing factors such as building access, construction, or vacancies. over time, we expect more of this inventory to become addressable for sale. we remain on track to reach our target of 30 million-plus past locations by the end of 2025.
the simple math would suggest 2 million to 2.5 million consumer and business locations passed annually moving forward. as we previously shared, build targets will vary quarter to quarter in any given year based on how the market is evolving. the second bucket is availing ourselves of partnership opportunities to not only expand but also accelerate our coverage in excess of that 30 million-plus location target. this is where our recent gigapower joint venture announcement with a blackrock infrastructure fund resides.
while this deal is not yet closed, we're very excited about the expected benefit. through this endeavor, gigapower plans to use a best-in-class operating team to deploy fiber to an initial 1.5 million locations, and i would expect that number to grow over time. this innovative risk-sharing collaboration will allow us to prove out the viability of a different investment thesis that expanding our fiber reach not only benefits our fiber business but also our mobile penetration rates. but what makes me most enthusiastic about this endeavor is that we believe gigapower provides us long-term financial flexibility and strategic optionality and what we believe is the definitive access technology for decades to come, all while sustaining near-term financial and shareholder commitments.
if i were to draw parallel to this partnership approach, i'm reminded the early days of wireless where the race to grow footprint was somewhat time-bound and facilitated by a similar approach ultimately culminating in today's national networks. the last bucket is framed by opportunities to connect people who previously did not have access to best-in-class technologies through broadband stimulus and bead funding. as i shared before, we truly believe that connectivity is a bridge to possibility in helping close the digital divide by focusing on access to affordable high-speed internet as a top priority of at&t. the intent of these government programs is to provide the necessary funding and support to allow both at&t and the broader service provider community the means to invest alongside the government at the levels needed to achieve the end state of a better connected america.
as the year progresses, we expect to gain more clarity around additional opportunities that exist, none of which are included in the 30 million-plus fiber location target i mentioned. as we compete for the subsidy, we'll bring our operational and market experience to compete for contracts in a disciplined manner. in doing so, we may be the only participant that has the ability to bid as part of an embedded wireline operation, a scaled national wireless provider. and gigapower may participate as a focused and flexible commercial open access wireline fiber network.
we think this will prove to be a winning combination in pursuit of attractive growth. the bottom line is this. our commitment to fiber is at the core of our strategy. in footprint, we're on track to deliver our 30 million-plus location commitment, and we're building the strategic and financial capabilities to take advantage of further opportunities as they emerge.
to wrap up, regardless of what transpires in the macro economy in the year ahead, we remain confident in the resiliency of the services our customers depend on in their daily lives. i believe our plan for the year rings true to who we are at our core. for almost 150 years, at&t has invested heavily into connecting our country. and in the process of doing so, we provided a spark for innovation that connects people to greater possibility.
this year, we'll continue to honor this heritage by significantly investing in best-in-class technology to build on a foundation for the future of our country's evolving connectivity needs, needs that we expect to grow significantly in the coming years. with that, i'll turn it over to pascal. pascal?
pascal desroches -- chief financial officer
thank you, john, and good morning, everyone. since john already discussed the great momentum we have this past year in growing our customer base in 5g and fiber, i'd like to start by taking a look at our fourth-quarter financial summary on slide 8. first, as a reminder, with the close of the warnermedia transaction in april, historical financial results have been recast to present warnermedia and certain other divested businesses as discontinued operations. therefore, where applicable, i will highlight our financial results on a comparative like-for-like basis.
for the fourth quarter, revenues were up nearly 1%. on a comparative basis, revenues for the full year were up around 2%, largely driven by wireless service revenue and, to a lesser extent, broadband in mexico. this was partly offset by a decline in business wireline. adjusted ebitda was up about 8% for the quarter.
for the full year, adjusted ebitda was up around 3.5% on a comparative basis as growth in mobility, consumer wireline in mexico were partly offset by a decline in business wireline. adjusted eps from continuing operations was $0.61, up about 9% for the quarter primarily due to strong organic growth in mobility and lower interest and benefit-related expenses. for the full year, adjusted eps from continuing operations was $2.57. i should note that we've taken a $24.8 billion noncash goodwill impairment charge in conjunction with our annual goodwill assessment primarily due to increases in discount rates associated with the overall rise in interest rates.
we also took a noncash charge of 1.4 billion to abandon certain conduit assets related to the ongoing rationalization of our copper network. free cash flow for the quarter was 6.1 billion, including about 800 million in directv distributions. this is an improvement of $780 million year over year, even with a $1 billion lower distribution from directv and 500 million less in firstnet capital reimbursements. we also delivered on our revised full-year guidance with free cash flow of 14.1 billion for the year.
cash from operating activities for our continuing operations came in at 10.3 billion for the quarter, up 2.3 billion year over year. for the quarter, capital expenditures were 4.2 billion with capital investments of 4.7 billion. full-year capital investment marked an all-time high at 24.3 billion as we continue to make record investments in 5g and fiber. now, let's look at our mobility segment operating results on slide 9.
and for the fifth consecutive year, our mobility business grew both revenues and ebitda. revenues were up 1.7% for the quarter and 4.5% for the year. service revenues were up more than 5% for both the quarter and the year, driven by continued subscriber growth. this exceeds the raised annual guidance we provided to you last quarter.
mobility ebitda was up about 740 million or more than 10% for the quarter, driven by growth in service revenues, transformation savings, and the absence of 3g network shutdown costs versus the fourth quarter of 2021. this was partially offset by higher bad debt levels. for the full year, mobility ebitda grew nearly 4%. even as competitors introduce richer promotional offers during the holiday seasons, our consistent go-to-market approach, once again, drove our results.
this gives us confidence that we have the right formula and structure in place to continue to grow customers, service revenues, and ebitda at a healthy clip this year. mobility postpaid phone arpu was $55.43, up $1.37 or 2.5% year over year. arpu growth continues to come in ahead of our expectation and largely reflects our targeted pricing actions, customers trading up to higher price unlimited plans, and improved roaming trends. as john previously mentioned, postpaid phone churn of 0.84% for the quarter declined year over year even as we were less promotional compared to our peers.
we believe that this decline is reflective of our improved customer value proposition. in prepaid, our phone churn was less than 3% driven by cricket phone churn that was substantially lower than 3%. while we believe industry wireless subscriber volumes will continue to pace toward normalized levels this year, we also expect our consistent go-to-market strategy to help us deliver strong relative performance and ongoing customer growth. now, let's move to consumer and business wireline results, which are on slide 10.
let's start with consumer wireline. as john mentioned, our fiber customer growth and network expansion continue. and wherever we have fiber, we win share. we added 280,000 fiber customers even in a seasonally slow fourth quarter that was impacted by lower year-over-year household move activities and challenging december weather conditions.
the increasing mix shift from legacy products to fiber drove strong broadband results, and we expect these trends to continue. broadband revenues grew more than 7% year over year due to fiber subscriber growth and higher arpu from the mix shift to fiber. fiber arpu was $64.82, up $2.20 sequentially with intake arpu now approaching $70. consumer wireline ebitda grew over 20% for the quarter and nearly 10% for the full year due to growth in fiber revenues and transformation savings.
turning to business wirelines. ebitda was relatively flat for the quarter due to 90 million in intellectual property transaction revenues and ongoing transformation savings as we continue to rationalize our portfolio of low-margin products. in fact, margins were up 110 basis points year over year, thanks to our transformation process. this rationalization process will continue in 2023 as we remain focused on the opportunities that our 5g and fiber expansion create in the small and midsized business category.
our business solution wireless services revenue grew more than 7%. this is very impressive given the fact that we already have the second largest share in are growing faster than our peers. firstnet wireless connections grew by 377,000 sequentially. now, let's move to slide 11 for our 2023 financial guidance.
let me walk you through how we're thinking about operating expectations for 2023. first, we expect to continue to grow mobility subscribers against a return to a more normalized industry growth. we also expect continued benefits from a larger subscriber base and improving arpus. this should result in wireless service revenue growth of 4% plus for the full year.
for broadband, we expect revenue increases of 5% plus reflecting a higher mix shift to fiber with improving arpus partially offset by continued legacy revenue declines. overall, we expect to grow total revenues next year. however, as you all know, variability in equipment revenues driven by industry volumes could be a factor on consolidated top-line trends. as we think about ebitda trends in 2023, we expect to grow mobility ebitda mid-single digits as our disciplined approach helps us grow our valuable subscriber base.
in business wireline, we expect ebitda to be down high single digits due to continued declines in legacy products, partially offset by incremental cost savings and increased fiber-based revenues. as you consider the first quarter for business wireline, it's worth noting that 2022 included a one-time incentive compensation benefit that will impact year-over-year comparisons. in consumer wireline, we expect to grow ebitda in the mid-single-digit range, plus or minus, due to continued growth in fiber revenues and transformation savings, partially offset by continued declines in legacy copper subscribers. we expect to benefit from ongoing corporate cost reductions.
altogether, this yields consolidated adjusted ebitda growth of 3% plus for the full year. when you think about adjusted eps calculations, note that our guidance reflects nearly $0.20 per share of headwinds associated with noncash pension costs related to higher interest rates and, to a lesser extent, lower spectrum interest capitalization. importantly, we have no need to fund our pension plans for the foreseeable future. we also expect to incur more than $0.05 of noncash headwinds related to a higher effective tax rate of around 23% to 24%.
combined, these headwinds aggregates to about $0.25 year over year. normalizing for these noncash items, our guidance would imply adjusted eps growth consistent with our expected growth and adjusted ebitda. given these assumptions, adjusted eps is expected to be in the $2.35 to $2.45 range. we also expect adjusted equity income from directv to be about $3 billion for the year versus 3.4 billion in 2022.
here's what to consider when looking at our free cash flows for 2023. first, we expect adjusted ebitda growth of 3% plus. next, expect cash interest to be down about $500 million. assume your cash taxes will be higher in 2023 versus 2022 to the tune of about $1 billion, and expected cash distributions from directv should be down about $1 billion.
we continue to expect that 2022 and 2023 will be our peak investment year. so, capital investment is expected to be consistent with 2022 levels. we also expect about of $2 billion of working capital improvements, largely from lower deferrals and higher noncash amortization of deferred acquisition costs. as we mentioned earlier, we expect a more normalized industry growth volume which is expected to help working capital as well.
when you combine all these factors, you get to a free cash flow expectation of $16 billion or better. this is about twice as much as our current annualized dividend and more than enough to cover other commitments. similar to last year, we expect greater free cash flow generation in the back half of the year based on higher capital investment levels and device payments in the first half of the year, as well as the timing of the annual incentive compensation payout. we will use our free cash flows to pay out our dividend and to pay down debt as we continue to progress toward our target of 2.5 times net debt to adjusted ebitda, which we anticipate will take place in early 2025.
and lastly, the guidance we provided to you is based on our current reporting. we expect our segment reporting in 2023 will remain the same as last year. however, i'd like to note that we no longer plan to record prior service credit benefits to the individual business segments with a corporate elimination. instead, it will only be recorded in other income.
overall, we are confident in our plan for the year. and as john mentioned, it takes into account our expectations for a more normalized industry growth backdrop against continued challenges in the macro environment. our confidence is underscored by the resiliency of the services we offer, the consistent strength of our go-to-market strategy, our ongoing momentum in core connectivity, and, most importantly, our team's unwavering commitment to deliver best-in-class services to consumers and businesses alike. amir, that's our presentation.
we're now ready for the q&a.
amir rozwadowski -- senior vice president, finance and investor relations
thank you, pascal. operator, we're ready to take the first question.
",":
operator
of course. [operator instructions] our first question today comes from the line of brett feldman with goldman sachs. please go ahead.
brett feldman -- goldman sachs -- analyst
thanks for taking the question. i think i'll start off with a follow-up here on the outlook that you provided. i appreciate some of the color that pascal provided about the different operating segments. maybe at a higher level, could you give us a sense as to what you mean by a more difficult operating environment? in other words, to what extent does the outlook for this year anticipate maybe a recession or ongoing inflationary pressures? and then, i imagine one of the questions we beginning of the day are what are some of the key swing factors? and so, if we were to use your adjusted ebitda guidance as an example, what's the scenario that gets you to 3% growth? and what could be the swing factors that might take that into the -- or higher category? thank you.
john stankey -- chief executive officer
hi, brett. let me go ahead, and i'll start. and then, pascal can jump in. so, first of all, look at the foundation of what we're telling you is we've been, i think, very conservative and thoughtful in the guidance we pulled together.
it is a tough environment to predict. there's a lot of geopolitical things going on that i think anybody would have a hard time seeing and do a crystal ball on. and that's probably the most difficult wildcard. but i think we've tried to take a conservative stance of what we see in the economy today.
and what the foundation that's rested on is we know that the services that we provide to customers are pretty resilient even during more challenged economic times. and so, we have a reasonably high confidence level that our customers are going to continue to want to use the product and pay us for it. i think if you go back and look at my public comments, probably, over a year ago, i've had a relatively conservative view of where i thought the economy was going to go. i've been fairly vocal that i think inflation is a tough thing to have a healthy economic environment, and that's good for everybody, and it creates some challenges in places.
and ultimately, a lot of that came to pass. the good news is i think we're through the worst of it, and we see it easing. but as you heard from my comments, we've expected that we're going to continue dealing with some of that pressure as we move through this year. so, we don't have an outlook that says that we've solved the problem.
we have an outlook that says we're going to continue to deal with pressures that are hitting some of our line items economically that we've got to account for and things like energy and some of the continued wage and employment pressures that we've had to deal with that will carry through. and we have some longer-term contracts that didn't come up during the last year that we know are going to hit us this year in renewals that we have to factor into that. and i think we've tried to do the best we can around it. i see the economy being relatively stable right now.
we're not seeing anything that's causing us to be extremely concerned about it. but what happens later in the year, who knows. the point we've made is we've kind of assumed that we're not going to be in a robust growth environment as we make our way through the year. and i would tell you if you're asking kind of what the swing factors are, i think the swing factor, frankly, is if there's some kind of a geopolitical disruption that's something significant that none of us anticipated or that we hope would never happen that creates a disruptive event.
that's probably the thing i'd look at and say, i couldn't predict it. i couldn't plan for it, and that's going to be the issue that we have to deal with that just pops up and isn't going to be just an at&t issue.
pascal desroches -- chief financial officer
yeah. brett, the only other thing i would add is, look, we've assumed in our outlook a more normalized industry growth environment. so, to the extent it's more than that or less than that, that could be a swing factor. but the thing that i think is important, and i said this in my comments, whatever the environment is, we expect to perform relatively well versus [inaudible]
brett feldman -- goldman sachs -- analyst
thank you.
amir rozwadowski -- senior vice president, finance and investor relations
thanks very much, brett. operator, if we can move to the next question.
operator
and our next question comes from the line of john hodulik with ubs. please go ahead.
john hodulik -- ubs -- analyst
great. thanks, guys. maybe just a couple of quick follow-ups on capital uses. pascal, you may have said this in your remarks, but what's driving the 2 billion in working capital savings this year? and what are your confidence behind that? and then could you remind us on the working -- on the capex side, obviously, 24 billion again this year.
but just what was the longer term sort of view? when can we expect that to start to come down? and what do you guys think of as a more normalized sort of capex, especially given what you have now with gigapower and all the fiber initiatives? thanks.
pascal desroches -- chief financial officer
sure thing, john. here is the way i think about the 2 billion that i flagged in our guidance for 2023. the last several years, we have been growing our subscribers in wireless with that came some upfront acquisition costs. we've said for a while we expect that to level out in 2023.
and so, once you have that leveling out, we are no longer going to be spending more each and every year than the prior year in acquisitions. so, that leveling out, there is assets that are on the books associated with the deferred acquisition costs of those subscribers. that's going to be amortized we have great visibility into that amortization, and that's obviously noncash because we spent the cash in the prior year. so, that -- we have very good visibility, too.
and, look, if we grow more than last year in terms of wireless subscribers, that could be a swing factor, but i don't anticipate that.
john hodulik -- ubs -- analyst
got it. and then the capex?
pascal desroches -- chief financial officer
you know, capex, the thing to keep in mind is we plan to be at peak levels in '22 and '23 because of the significant contributions that we are getting from directv. in '22 and '23, capex is fairly meaningful amounts for spectrum deployment and transformation that will begin to moderate as we exit this year. we haven't updated the guide we provided at investor day. but clearly, we expect to trend down toward more normalized capital intensity as we exit this year.
john hodulik -- ubs -- analyst
ok. thanks, pascal.
amir rozwadowski -- senior vice president, finance and investor relations
thanks very much, john. operator, if you can move to the next question.
operator
and our next question comes from the line of phil cusick with jpmorgan. please go ahead.
phil cusick -- jpmorgan chase and company -- analyst
hi, guys. thank you. turning to fiber. gigapower was a great announcement but a little smaller than we had expected.
john, how do you think about the 1.5 million versus the potential of that venture or for others in that model? and your own on-balance sheet fiber construction of two -- i think you said 2 million to 2.5 million annually. it seems like a slower pace than we had been discussing. is there anything changing there? and then, finally, just to john's question, one quick clarification on the free cash flow. pascal, is that working capital going to contribute 2 billion to free cash flow in '23? or is it just offsetting what had been a 2 billion drag, i think, in '22? thanks very much.
john stankey -- chief executive officer
hi, phil. so, first of all, as i mentioned in my comments, i view the fiber portfolio as that, a portfolio. it's a portfolio of options for us to look at where the return characteristics are most optimal on how we deploy capital around that. and i'm trying to be pretty overt in my commentary to all of you that we understand that we need to be very disciplined in demonstrating to all of you that each of those portfolio decisions and how we put capital against that is, in fact, driving acceptable returns.
i'm very mindful of the fact that the gigapower announcement is a model that the investor base is unfamiliar with. this is something different and something new. and i want to be very sensitive to the fact, just like we did when we were deploying in-region fiber and stepping up our investments. i've tried to be transparent with all of you around what our progress has been on the key drivers of the economic return of that investment.
we've been sharing pretty aggressively things with you like arpus and penetration rates and a variety of other things that give you the confidence that, in fact, that that's a sustainable, smart, long-term investment. this new gigapower model is a bit different. and i think it would be normal for any of you to look at it and say, gee, it's going to return at the same level. and so, to demonstrate to you that i'm serious about ensuring that every incremental investment decision we make in this look, 1.5 million homes, you may say, well, that's not a lot.
it's over $1 billion of investment to be able to go do this. we set up this first tranche to be able to come back to you over the course of 18 months and give you information that raises your confidence. and in fact, we are driving the returns on this in the way that we anticipate them to be attractive. and the management team that has been put in place and how the partnership is set up is intended to do exactly that.
we will be in the market very, very soon right after the announcement. i intend to have 12 months of penetration information that i can bring back to you. and you can bet that when we're successful doing this and we demonstrate to you that we have the numbers to back it up that it won't necessarily still be 1.5 million. i would also tell you, i want to be thoughtful about, as i've made the comment, what is it that we should own and operate 100% to ourselves and what we want to do within the partnership, just like we might have done when we were building wireless infrastructure a couple of decades ago.
and if we hit the ball out of the park and things are great, we may choose to do some of this in-house and on our own and not necessarily subjected to a partnership. on the other hand, if we need more scale and we need to move faster, we have a vehicle now that's set up that we can move very quickly to increase the amount of funding and the amount of capacity that's in that entity to take advantage of that. and so, we're going to have data that we can come back to you with, and we'll, i think, do the right thing and try to make sure that you're moving along with us every step of the way. and i just see this as another tool that gives me a lot of flexibility and a lot of options.
relative to the in-region fiber side of things. as i said, i'm looking for a portfolio of returns. and what i tried to stress in my opening remarks is i'm giving you a characterization right now of what we think are high-return options within the 30 million passings that we committed to and what that looks like, and i've tried to clarify because i know some of you have been trying to do the math on it. but we have these other options now and want to balance out what i think the return characteristics will be through the gigapower initiative.
and we are going to now see some volume and capacity coming in out of region -- excuse me, out of the 30 million build that will be subject to bead funding. and some of that subsidy may have a very different return characteristics than some of the stuff we're doing organically in region right now. and i want to have options open to understand that and look at that aspect of the portfolio as well. and i think we'll get clarity on that is on the end of the third quarter of this year that we start to see where we're successful in bidding for that money, how much it is, what kind of a build lean do we put on the business in terms of having to add capacity to get the bill accomplished, and how does it fit into the kind of operating territories that we think set us up for a geography and a footprint that's intelligent for us to operate moving forward.
so, that's kind of how i think about it in aggregate. and i'll let pascal pick up your question on the free cash flow clarification.
pascal desroches -- chief financial officer
hey, phil. the simple way i think about the majority of the 2 billion is this. we have deferred acquisition cost that's on the books where the cash went out in prior years. that amortization -- it's going to continue to be amortized against ebitda in 2023.
that is noncash expenses burdening. so, when you -- just the sheer mechanics of adding that back to our free -- to our ebitda will elevate the cash ebitda that the business produces.
phil cusick -- jpmorgan chase and company -- analyst
thanks, pascal. john, if i can follow up on one sort of a two-split, do you look at gigapower and bead spending as alternative places to spend your capital and effectively now slowing the organic pace to get to that $30 million?
john stankey -- chief executive officer
i've given you the pace of how we get to the 30 million. and so i don't see that changing. i think we're committed to what i just articulated to you. so, if you're asking am i going to see -- am i going to come back and give you an incremental revision of that 30 million to substitute? no.
pascal desroches -- chief financial officer
but to be clear, phil, this -- the bead money and the gigapower are incremental to the 30 million.
john stankey -- chief executive officer
yes. if that's your question, 100%.
phil cusick -- jpmorgan chase and company -- analyst
got it. thanks, guys.
amir rozwadowski -- senior vice president, finance and investor relations
thanks very much, phil. operator, if we can move to the next question.
operator
our next question comes from the line of simon flannery with morgan stanley. please go ahead.
simon flannery -- morgan stanley -- analyst
great. thank you very much. good morning. if i could just stay on the broadband theme -- if i could.
perhaps i think you talked perhaps about providing extra color on the financial construct of the blackrock jv? are you contributing any capital, any assets? how exactly should we expect that to flow through the financials? and, john, on the bead, perhaps you just give us a reflection on the status of the process, the timing, how this is going to play out. i think there's been a lot of concerns about delays, the mapping process, the challenges, and also some of the state broadband offices maybe not being ready to stand this up. so, how do you see this evolving? and when do you think you can actually get shovels in the ground to get know what funding been awarded? and then just finally, getting to 30 million locations is great. what about the prebuilding with fiber, with fixed wireless in some of those locations.
i think you've talked about that. and how does fixed wireless play into some of that other 30 million-plus locations that won't be getting fiber in the near term? thanks.
john stankey -- chief executive officer
sure. so, simon, i'll be -- i've got to be careful about how much the partnership. it's a partnership structure, it's an entirely separate partnership structure, so you shouldn't expect to see any of the financials pull-through on a balance sheet structure for us. you should expect it to come in is investment income.
we'll give you characterizations of the success of that. and as it carries forward, you should think about this as both partners carrying equal weight in the execution of the entity. i think that probably gives you a good enough sense of how it carries through. and if you have something else you want to push on, i can try to give you a little more color.
the bead timing, my point of view is i think there is -- there's been enough information put out there right now. we're going to go through a clarification cycle on the first set of data. i think that's moving along at a reasonably good cliff right now. and i think, frankly, the bigger states, those that have a more robust staffing capability are being pretty prompt and aggressive in working through getting that data set squared away.
i would agree with you that there's going to be some states that are maybe a little bit slower than others, but my gut is when you're thinking about kind of the 80-20 rule, the bigger states, they're going to have the bulk of the funding are pretty zoned in on this, and they're moving pretty aggressively to get the process underway. and while there may be some smaller states that take a little bit longer to get their act together or are waiting to see how models develop in some of the more lead states that have bigger staffs to consider these things and then kind of be fast followers, i don't think that's going to inhibit some of the more aggressive states and being in the process and us being in a situation where in the third quarter, there's going to be monies starting to flow down from the federal government and being turned back to the states for execution. so, i don't think you're going to see any substantial shovels on the ground and certainly, customers being served in any substantial way this year. but i do think you're going to see projects and monies awarded before we exit this year.
and you will see those volumes start to come online as we move into periods of 2024. and i expect that those will be concentrated in some of the bigger states that have more robust staff that can move through this fairly quickly and pretty much have a view of how they want to go about doing this. they're just trying to get the data to fit into the process. as i've said before, we view fixed wireless as being a tool in the toolbox that we can use to deal with opportunities in areas that are less densely populated.
we'll have our next rendition of the product in the market this year. there will be places where we view it as being an acceptable substitute for fiber deployment. they tend to be -- they are going to be less densely populated areas where it makes sense to do that. we have a plan as to how we want to test our assumptions around that.
we will deploy and take advantage of that. i think it can have an opportunity to help us on some of the long-standing hybrid fiber copper base that we have that maybe has some speed challenges, and it will probably help us manage some of the churn characteristics associated with that, and i would expect to use it in that case. and then i would also add, look, there's a lot of businesses that maybe aren't in those less densely populated areas where this will be a perfectly acceptable and strong product, given the nature of how their business runs and what they need for their daily data needs and service needs. and so, i do expect that we're going to have an opportunity to complement some of our strength in wireless distribution into the business market to provide a more robust fixed broadband alternative, fixed wireless broadband alternative to those customers, and bundle and package it in where it makes sense.
pascal desroches -- chief financial officer
simon, one other point on the capital structure for the jv to consider is that we do expect it to carry a meaningful amount of debt funding as well.
simon flannery -- morgan stanley -- analyst
ok. great. and are you contributing anything to it? any capital any assets? yes.
john stankey -- chief executive officer
we did. we have contributed some into the partnership. the reason you're going to see it get off the ground as quickly as it will and bring its first customers on in relatively short orders because while we have been structuring and negotiating this, we've been doing a fair amount of work in parallel quietly. and so, the partnership, as we've indicated, is already structured with the management team that's in place that has been doing a lot of work on the offer that knows the markets we're going to be in that has infrastructure and system setup that they can be ready to go on.
and i think this is probably one of the things our partner found attractive about this. it's a first-class management team with a lot of capabilities behind it. and we will take some credit for the contribution of that work that we've done within the scope of this year.
simon flannery -- morgan stanley -- analyst
great. thanks for the color.
amir rozwadowski -- senior vice president, finance and investor relations
thanks very much, simon. operator, if we can move to the next question.
operator
and our next question comes from the line of david barden with bank of america. please go ahead.
david barden -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
hey, guys. thanks so much for taking the questions. i guess first, i just wanted to go back to the notion of wireless postpaid phone market ""normalizing"". i think a lot of people look at the relatively high correlation between the substantial step-up that we've had in the industry to roughly 9 million postpaid phone nets a year for the last couple of years and at&t's kind of resuscitated growth, as john pointed out, over the last 10 quarters.
and as such, when people consider the industry ""normalizing,"" there's a pension out there, i think, to disproportionately assume that whatever amount of tide comes out on industry growth will be disproportionately allocated to at&t because it disproportionately benefited over the last couple of years. i was wondering if you could kind of talk about that and whether you think that's realistic and that informs some of your working capital benefits that inform the cash flow or whether you think that that's wrong and that you can kind of -- if there is a tide that goes out, it's more pro rata across the industry? that's number one. and then number two, john, you touched on something in the prepared remarks that we haven't talked about a lot here in the u.s., largely because we haven't been moving in this direction until you guys really started this fiber initiative, which is copper decommissioning. and for instance, in markets like canada, it's a huge topic where they've widely overbuilt their copper plant.
and we're talking about timing and magnitude of the benefits that you start to get there. could you kind of elaborate a little bit? is it a little too early to start really talking about this as a tailwind in something like '24, or is it really with us? thanks.
john stankey -- chief executive officer
sure, dave. how are you. i don't agree with your thesis at its point. i absolutely 100% dismiss your thesis.
and i don't think that's how the market is structured and functioning today by any stretch of the imagination. i think our -- i go back and i look at our performance over the last 2.5 years. first of all, i would tell you, i think the industry is a lot more healthy than many who would like to trying to come up with this narrative? is competition up? or is it destroying itself? i mean i see a pretty consistently competitive industry over this period of time. and i tend to look at it not just on customer counts, but i look at things like both wholesale and retail revenues and how that's flowing through to service revenues.
and i see a relatively balanced dynamic in the industry. but the math would tell you that balance dynamic would suggest we've been picking up a bit of share when it's all said and done. and i don't think that's a benefit of the number moving from whatever you assume the normal stasis is 7.5 million to 9 million. in fact, i would say of customers that are paying a reasonable monthly bill, we've taken more than our fair share, and i'm more interested in taking revenue share and profitability share than i am necessarily just taking a subscriber share.
and i think our numbers would suggest that we've seen an ever-improving trend over the 2.5 years in our ability to do that. so, i don't submit to your point of view that if the industry ""normalizes"" we revert back to kind of where we were three years ago. i think where we are is because of how we're performing today, not what was going on three years ago. and that's kind of how i think about it.
what i would tell you, dave, is i don't think there's a windfall that comes in on restructuring of legacy costs. and i've i think i've been on this theme for a little while. i mean we've been working this issue pretty aggressively since the day i came into the job. and i would say we had to start formulating the plans when i came in, but now we have a very robust and functioning organization that we're doing this kind of day in and day out.
and i spend more time talking about investing in the new business and the growth that we can get on sustainable fiber and a 5g infrastructure than i do on talking about what we are taking out of service. but we are taking stuff out of service. and so, when we start managing things like our energy costs down, it's because we're decommissioning equipment and taking it off the copper grid. when we are able to manage our dispatches down and show you improvements in our operating dynamics on dispatches, it's because we have a smaller footprint to manage.
we are doing this day in and day out. and our pace at which we're doing it is accelerating. we've -- i've given you some hints along the way about the number of products that we've shuttered, and when we shuttered those products, it starts to take operating costs out of the business. this is part of what we have in our forecast to you to continue to improve our operating costs.
so, you're seeing this operating leverage start to come into the business, and it's partly contributed to the fact that we're managing through these legacy costs. and as we give you the forecast for cash this year, when we talk about improvements in our overall cost structure, some of it is coming on the backs of what we're doing here. and i'm very well aware of where our cost structure is on a comparative basis to others that we compete with in the industry, some of which do not have the hybrid asset structure that we have of both fixed and mobile. and we are on this mission to ensure that we're not operating any of that at a disadvantage over the next three, four, and five years.
and i think you're going to just see this ratably come in over that period of time as we work through what is -- it's frankly a bit of a painstaking process to go through. it's central office by central office, line by line, customer by customer, but it needs to be done. i think it can be done in a way that makes us a better and healthier business where we have a great hybrid of a fabulous fiber footprint with a fabulous wireless network that is ultimately the future of how customers are going to buy together. and i like that.
i think that hard work will be rewarded in that regard, but i will fully admit, we are creating new intellectual property here around how you get to this space. and i'm choosing to do it organically internally, not through a front-end private equity transaction that puts a little bit of cash in my pocket but ultimately has the value of it accrue to somebody else over the hard work of three, four, five years.
david barden -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
good to hear, john. thank you.
amir rozwadowski -- senior vice president, finance and investor relations
thanks very much, david. operator, if we can move to the next question.
operator
and our next question comes from the line of craig moffett with svb moffettnathanson. please go ahead.
craig moffett -- moffettnathanson -- analyst
hi. thank you. i want to stay, if i could, with this topic of your portfolio of broadband, john. if i think about your kind of overall mobility national footprint, it sort of maps with, today, roughly call it 16%, 17% of the country already overbuilt with fiber, another 10% or 12% to be overbuilt with fiber.
can you just talk about how you think about the consumer value proposition in those different segments where you have wireless that doesn't have a fiber component, where it does and then -- and what role fixed wireless might play to sort of round out that consumer value proposition?
john stankey -- chief executive officer
yeah. the way i think about it, craig, is -- and i tried to use this reference earlier is, i think it's a bit of a -- i don't want to use the term land rush, because it's not that easy to put fiber and it takes a little bit longer than a land rush, but we are definitely in a window right now where i do believe a good portion of the united states will ultimately have a fiber connection to it. and i believe there will be -- if you think about this over the long haul, that we're moving to an industry, and i've been pretty clear about this, ultimately, customers are going to want to buy connectivity from one place. they don't necessarily love making a distinction between their fixed provider and their mobile provider.
and i think over time, we're going to see an ordering of industry assets that leans more toward that. and my point of view to be in a strong position as you -- if you have the best technology out there and you ultimately build the largest footprint fastest, you're going to be in a better position to ultimately play in the outcome of how that restructuring gets done, and you're going to have the strongest customer base on a relative basis and owning and operating those assets and having the ability to control the product offering and control the cost on it will be the best way to control your progress going forward. so, yes, it's a deliberate process to continue to build fiber infrastructure and ultimately overlay it with the wireless business, but that's a process that i think is incredibly durable and sustainable. and my job is to make sure i'm doing it faster and better than anybody else.
and i think it'll come out in an ok place as a result of that. and as i said, my job is to ensure that people who give us money to go and allow for us to make that investment, feel that on a marginal basis, on an incremental basis, we're doing that in a way that's driving successful returns. i think fixed wireless, as i said, has its place in the portfolio. i don't see it's place long term in dense metropolitan areas, and i don't see it in reasonably well populated suburban areas.
i don't see the dynamic of that product, and i've been pretty clear about this if i start to think about consumer behavior and demand of consumption. and i start to take those curves out over three years. i don't see that as the optimal way to service a customer in the near term. so, i think the mobile network's role in life is to ensure that whenever somebody is away from a fixed location, they can still get the same kind of capabilities that they get while they're at home, but there's only a certain amount of bandwidth that a mobile network will ever be able to foster and support in that regard.
mobile bits are going to be higher-value bits. they're going to need to be engineered differently. they should sell at a premium because of the supply and demand dynamics on it. and i want to ensure that my mobile network is, in fact, delivering that premium solution on those mobile bets when they need to be provided.
and it's absolutely 100% there to do that. and i think at the end of the day, if your mobile network is doing that mad fashion, then you're going to have an opportunity to work in the high-value mobile space for what are going to be emerging capabilities that people need to facilitate the true promise of 5g and real-time transmission ubiquitously any place anywhere.
craig moffett -- moffettnathanson -- analyst
thank you.
amir rozwadowski -- senior vice president, finance and investor relations
thanks very much, craig. operator, we have time for one last question.
operator
and that last question comes from the line of michael rollins with citi. please go ahead.
michael rollins -- citi -- analyst
thanks, and good morning. just thinking a little bit more about the wireless growth opportunity. can you share with us how at&t is doing with the appearing of customers onto unlimited and premium unlimited plans? and then given some of the comments on inflation, are there opportunities for at&t to update wireless and fiber pricing again this year? and are any of those opportunities included in the guidance? thanks.
john stankey -- chief executive officer
hi, mike. so, i'm not going to -- look, it's just not good hygiene to talk about what our plans are on pricing, and i don't intend to do that today. i would just maybe point you back to -- we have a management team who is very good at understanding where we have great value to our customer and where we're selling in that market, and are we getting the maximum value and value exchange back from the customer. and that's across all of our products and services.
last year, i mean, you can see we saw an area where we felt like we had some customers that weren't taking advantage of the best plans that we had to offer with the most recent features. and we decided to work in our customer base to help them understand that there were better places they could go where there was maybe an exchange for them to pay us a little bit more but to get a lot more for what they were paying us. i think we executed that incredibly well. we just gave you churn numbers that were incredibly strong churn numbers, all while we did that.
and i think you should step back from that and say that's pretty good execution. i'm not sitting here telling you about i grew service revenues, and i'm dealing with a customer flight problem. i dealt with lower churn. and i think that's a testament to the fact that we were able to get a win-win proposition and our customer base with the customers walked away feeling better about the circumstances.
and we'll continue to look for those opportunities. anywhere in our portfolio on any product where we think we can do those types of things, that's just part of being good management. i would expect that there's always opportunities for us to look into that where i think we are on our ability to walk people up the value continuum, we still have room. we're not -- we're not through the 5g replacement cycle.
as you know, when a customer comes in and chooses to do that upgrade, that's a great opportunity for us to talk to them about what product and services that they have and to help them understand that maybe buying a more robust plan or fine-tuning how they're buying plants for us might fit into their portfolio and give them the best value. and we do expect we're going to continue to make headway on that. that's part of that service revenue growth that pascal guided you to. i don't think anything that we've got in there is herculean.
we've been talking about this for the better part of three years with you. every year, we've managed to do what we said we were going to do, and it's been consistent with the service revenue numbers that we forecasted for you. i think you should also understand that the global economy is not completely recovered from the pandemic. we still expect that -- as travel continues to normalize itself, that we're going to see a little bit of uptick in relief coming from the likes of more global visitors coming in on roaming and people going places.
i think asia is still going to be suppressed for a period of time, but let's hope the back end of recent policy changes that have occurred in asia means that we will eventually hit a normalization there that will ultimately get us back to kind of pre-pandemic norms at some point, which is it's good to be going down that path as opposed to having a major footprint that is kind of trying to create a fortress and not allow people to move back and forth between their borders. so, we started at the beginning of the end there, which is good. so, i don't feel any concern around whether or not we can effectively move people up that continuum. we still have room to grow.
we're banking on that in our guidance, and we'll execute around it just as we have any other years. i don't know if you want to add anything there, pascal.
pascal desroches -- chief financial officer
no, i think that's all well said.
michael rollins -- citi -- analyst
thanks.
john stankey -- chief executive officer
so, again, i appreciate your time this morning. i'm really pleased with the year. i thought it was a strong consistent execution year. i'm just equally as pleased that we've done the right things to set us up for continued growth as we move through '23.
i hope you feel the same. i know the management team is very focused on delivering what we shared with you this morning is our expectations. i feel really good about where our customer base is. as i mentioned just a few moments ago, to have churn levels in our wireless business running at the position they're in with the competitive intensity that is occurring in the industry, to have the position we have with our broadband base on fiber, and the customer satisfaction is coming with it, i think, bodes incredibly well even in an uncertain environment as we're moving forward.
and the good news is, i think we can grow in both those places to continue to drive the kind of tempered indirect growth that we shared with you. so, we're looking forward to doing it again next year. i think we've got the right opportunities in place. i think there's a lot more that we know we can still do to run this business better, and we're about doing that to ensure that we deliver improved performance for you moving forward.
so, thank you very much. i hope you all have a great '23.
