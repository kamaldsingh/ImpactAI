[operator instructions] our first question comes from the line of hartaj singh from oppenheimer. please go ahead. your line is open.
hartaj singh -- oppenheimer -- analyst
great. thank you. and a really, really good quarter, martine and team. just a quick question on tyvaso. you're -- we're seeing a definite uptick in the trend growth over the last few quarters, martine, as you mentioned, year-on-year, double-digit growth. and then also in our key opinion leader calls, we've noticed that there's a lot of overlap between the physicians treating pah using tyvaso there and physicians treating ph-ild. do you expect a lot of this enthusiasm to be occurring in those patients and then also tyvaso uptake in that group three patients going there? thank you.
martine rothblatt -- chairman, chief executive officer and director
thanks, hartaj. excellent question. and good to hear your voice this morning. i think the best person on this call to field the question would be mike because he is right in the middle of all of the details right now of actually assigning different regional sales managers and their teams among the different types of physicians: those who treat patients with ild that have never seen really pulmonary hypertension patient treatment options; and those who are normal pah treatment physicians that, in addition to that, also treat patients with ph associated with their ild. so mike would really have the best answers for that. and mike, if you could provide some color on hartaj's question?
michael benkowitz -- president and chief operating officer
sure. thanks, hartaj, for the question. i think the short answer to the question is it's hard to tell when physicians are writing or submitting referrals or prescriptions for tyvaso, they're not indicating whether it's a ph-ild patient or a pah patient. so it's a little hard to tell if there's some off-label use in that group. what i can tell you, though, about the treating community is -- and as i said in my opening remarks, we do see some differences in that group. i -- by our count, in terms of those physicians that are treating pah and those that are treating ild, there's maybe only about a 20% to 25% overlap. and there's sort of an inverse relationship between the number of pah patients that the doctors see and the number of ild patients those doctors see.
or in other words, if you've got a doctor that sees a lot of pah patients, they're seeing very few ild patients and vice versa. so what we can see on the referral form are the doctors that are writing the prescriptions. and so what we haven't seen is a lot of new prescribers, which tells us, obviously, that all of the -- the vast, vast majority of these tyvaso prescriptions are coming in -- are being submitted by your typical pah doctors. and given the -- just sort of the -- i think the underlying data that we see would lead me to believe that the vast, vast majority are for pah patients. but again, we don't have the visibility to know exactly whether they're pah or ph-ild.
martine rothblatt -- chairman, chief executive officer and director
thanks so much, mike. that's a great response. hartaj, one little footnote i'd add to mike's response is it's very interesting to me, just having studied this field for quite a bit, that there are this very substantial quantity of patients in the group three -- who group three type of pulmonary hypertension, over 30,000 patients that -- for those patients, the systemic drugs are contraindicated. so here, in the field of group one who, we have upwards of 12 different medicines available to treat pulmonary hypertension, and there are just about as many group three patients as group one patients, but there are 0, no approved medicines to treat those group three patients. so it's a screaming unmet medical need, and we are just crossing every finger we could cross that on -- in april, on the pdufa date that the fda will give us clearance to translate the increase clinical trial results into an approved treatment for those 30,000 patients, it would be the only approved treatment for those patients. it was a great trial, the increase trial. as you are well aware, hartaj, we met all of our primary and secondary end points. so i think there is going to be a tremendous amount of excitement among the physicians that finally, they have something to treat those 30,000 patients with. thanks so much again. operator, next question please.

our next question comes from the line of eun yang with jefferies. please go ahead. your line is open.
eun yang -- jefferies -- analyst
thank you. for tyvaso in new indication, ph-ild, can you comment on your regulatory filing ex the u.s.? and then for tret, if you use in ph-ild, do you expect you would need it to run another switching study similar to phase iii breeze? thank you.
martine rothblatt -- chairman, chief executive officer and director
yes. thank you, eun, for those very interesting questions and exploring some kind of areas that a lot of people overlook. so i'm glad you've asked those questions. at this point in time, we haven't made a firm decision with regard to the european filing schedule, mostly because we're just like laser-focused on gaining fda approval to deal with this huge unmet medical need that i just talked about, the 30,000 patients here. so we're kind of like a step-by-step strategy here. and first, we want to be able to successfully get approval into the u.s., and then we'll consider what is the best approach to go as to europe. the second part of your question is also quite insightful because the dreamboat tret device is a much easier to use device than the optineb nebulizer that we used in the increase study and that we submitted for fda approval on. and i think most people feel that whatever the captured market would be for this nebulizer, that dry powder dreamboat device could give you 2, maybe three times larger a market because of its greater convenience. so as you mentioned, eun, we did -- we do plan to file for approval of the dreamboat device based on the current breeze study in the april -- in april, of 2021, and then that would take its normal fda approval period. so as i mentioned in my opening remarks, hopefully, we can get that approved, if not by the end of '21, then at the very beginning of '22.
now whether or not that dreamboat tret device is approved for just who group one pulmonary hypertension, which is the population in which we did our breeze study, or is also going to be approved for the who group three population, that would be a decision, which is, of course, up to the fda. what we will do to support that decision and provide guidance is as soon as we wrap up the filing based on the breeze one study in the who group one population, we will immediately begin a breeze two study in the ild population or the who group three population. and that way, we will at least have that data available for the fda if they feel that they are not comfortable to approve dreamboat in group three without some data. we should have that data by the time they would reach their pdufa date for approving the breeze device in the group one population. if for any reason things take a little longer, we'll have that data immediately available. i don't think it's really going to be of much consequence because, in fact, the desperation in the who group three population for any treatment is so large that the optineb base -- the nebulizer-base form of tyvaso, i think, will be very rapidly taken up. but you always want to keep building on your momentum and making it easier for larger and larger patient populations to avail themselves of tyvaso. so we will be right on with breeze two data for the ild population. we'll be right on that immediately after completing the breeze one filing. thanks for your question, eun. next question operator?

our next question comes from the line of marty auster with credit suisse. please go ahead. your line is open.
marty auster -- credit suisse -- analyst
hey, everybody, thanks for taking the question. martine, will you indulge my 2-decade tenure to let me ask two questions again?
martine rothblatt -- chairman, chief executive officer and director
yes, dr. auster. one for being marty, and one for being doctor.
marty auster -- credit suisse -- analyst
thank you kindly. so a couple of things i want to follow up on. first on tret, you reported that the healthy volunteer kind of part of that study was done. can you comment at all on the -- what that data look like and the equivalence to what you've seen with tyvaso? and then can you also talk on tret about what the supply needs that you're anticipating would be? and then if you think you'll be able to kind of meet where the demand for that new device and that new system might be if you were approved on a first pass approval. the second question was on the xeno-organ side. i think there's something like 20,000, 25,000 kidneys transplanted in the u.s. each year. you probably know the number more specifically. but if you could comment maybe on what the overall big picture opportunity -- i know there's a very long wait list, and i know that you're seeing a lot of people that don't get served. but what is the kind of addressable big picture market opportunity there? and when do you need to think about pulling the trigger to make decisions on expanding and building out your dpf capabilities to kind of start thinking about how to meet some of that long-term demand? thank you.
martine rothblatt -- chairman, chief executive officer and director
okay. thanks, marty. fascinating questions, kind of things we could like talk in a coffee house for hours over, if we could talk in a coffee house. but with regard to the first question on breeze, the pk data, the buildup of tret devices, dr. peterson, if you could at least talk about the pk side. and if you feel comfortable talking about the inventory side, roll into that and if not, i'll talk about that at the front-end of the xeno stuff.
leigh peterson -- vice president of product development
yes, sure. hi, everyone. thank you all for calling in. great to speak with you. so you all know that the tret study in healthy volunteers, that was -- the primary objective of that was to show comparable pk between tyvaso and tret. and that has been completed, and we're actually undergoing the data analysis right now. so i don't have the final, final output package to discuss with you. but i will tell you that, i mean, this was an open-label study. and we're seeing consistent results between the two medications. we're actually seeing -- it appeared at least early on that the tret device actually seems to penetrate the lung a little bit better than tyvaso with optineb. but that also might be because, as you all might know, tret, you get your entire dose from, like, one to two breaths. and so you just need a tiny little cartridge and you breathe it in, and then you get the full dose whereas with tyvaso, if you can take like nine or 10 or -- it takes several different breaths to -- multiple breaths to get the full dose. and so that can explain the lung penetration. but again, the final data are being analyzed literally as i'm speaking, and we will be able to get that up to you very shortly. but we definitely do not expect any surprises there.
martine rothblatt -- chairman, chief executive officer and director
thanks, dr. peterson. thank you very much. so with regard to the inventory, marty, i think we're going to be in good shape. in fact, just this week, at the request of our head of manufacturing, pat poisson, we allocated $5 million for inventory buildup for the tret launch during 2021. so he regularly visits the mannkind plant in connecticut where we do the manufacturing of everything. and i feel confident that we'll have adequate supply to meet our needs. as you probably recall from reviewing our proxy, one of our company's four companywide objectives, upon which everybody's bonus is based in the entire company, is that we have to have a 2-year inventory of all commercially launched products at the rate of the product take-up. so mike benkowitz and his commercial team, they would provide a forecast to manufacturing in terms of how many dreamboat tret patients we expect to garner in the first 12 months after launch, which would be mostly a 2022 thing. and then -- so already in 2021, pat poisson and our manufacturing team are making sure that we have two times that amount of inventory built up for at the time of launch so that we can crush that manufacturing and inventory milestone as we actually always have every year for as far back as i can remember. with regard to the xeno question, i think your numbers are quite accurate, marty.
there are 20,000-plus kidney transplants done. there -- if you get into what are called living-related kidney transplants where people designate a kidney to a relative or something like that, you get up into the 35,000 type of category. then the next number that comes up a lot is 100,000 people are waiting for kidney transplants and are currently on dialysis. and then the next number that comes up is that there's something like 300,000 people in need of kidney transplant but for various and sundry reasons, they are not even able to access dialysis. so it is -- it's probably one of the largest unmet medical needs in the united states. it's not unrelated to the very high levels of diabetes in the united states, but that's not the only reason for end-stage renal disease. so kidney transplantation is a cure for end-stage renal disease. and people such as ourselves have been working many years in order to have an unlimited supply of transplantable kidneys that would be well tolerated by the recipients. and i think that's what we are on the cusp of here. we've spent several years knocking out or knocking in gene after gene and then testing the results to make sure that we had really the ideal level and the ideal combination of genes that have been knocked in or knocked out. and then we've also constructed a pathogen-free facility, which is the xeno-equivalent of a good manufacturing product in alabama. and it -- or it is those kidneys coming out of that dpf facility which will be the first ones going into the clinic, which is why i mentioned that we expect to file an ind in 2021 based on kidneys coming out of that dpf. in terms of when we would pull the trigger on building a commercial scale dpf, the one i just referred to in alabama is a clinical trial scale dpf.
the commercial scale dpf will take a couple of years to build and bring into operation. so i think the right time to pull the trigger on that would be once we have a successful result in the first clinical xeno-kidney transplants. and with the -- as mentioned in the beginning of my -- of the call, with the ind going in, in '21, so we will know in '22 whether we have a successful xeno-kidney product. and so that would be the time to pull the trigger. we have already completely designed the facility using our design architects at ewingcole company in philadelphia. they specialize in bio/agro type of manufacturing designs. so we have a well-vetted design that's been reviewed by all of the experts in controlling viruses and microbes and whatnot in animal populations. so i think we're ready to like sign a contract pretty rapidly and proceed with the construction. and then that whole facility could be brought into operation sometime during 2024. thanks for the question. marty and operator, we have time for one last question.
operator
our last question comes from the line of joseph thome with cowen and co. please go ahead. your line is open.
joseph thome -- cowen and co -- analyst
hi there. thank you for taking my question. and congrats on a great quarter. just a little bit on tyvaso in ild. can you comment a little bit on how well these patients are identified currently given that, as you mentioned, there really aren't great treatment options for patients. do you anticipate that the potential approval of tyvaso in the indication will change this paradigm? and is it your expectation that there are some ph-ild patients sort of built up and waiting for launch?
martine rothblatt -- chairman, chief executive officer and director
sure. let me suggest, like, we give you a 2-part answer to that question, with the first part being given by dr. peterson because she was ultimately in charge of the increase study that produced the clinical result in the ild patients. so she could speak most expertly about those results and -- which were reported at the abstract level at the ats conference and, i believe, are imminently going to be appearing in a peer-reviewed publication. so she could talk about kind of the medical thing of how well it worked in those patients. and then mike benkowitz, our president, who has spent a lot of time thinking about the market segmentation and the approach to the market, can speak more about the second part of your question. dr. peterson?
leigh peterson -- vice president of product development
yes, sure. so as you know, tyvaso worked quite well in the patient population -- who three population. and this is -- this was ild plus pulmonary hypertension. and in this population, the -- for the increase study, the patients actually did have data from a right heart cath, ok? so they had documented pulmonary hypertension. and up until now, since there was no medication for this group, the doctors didn't really -- if they suspected ipf, they -- or even suspected pulmonary hypertension in this population, they didn't give the patients necessarily a right heart cath because even if they did discover ph, there was nothing to treat them so why go through all of that invasive procedure in order to find that out. so we've heard several times that now that there is a treatment, they will be performing those right heart caths to see the degree of pulmonary hypertension because they do have -- they presumably will have an approved treatment relatively soon.
so yes, the identification of this population will definitely be more robust since they have something to give them. and again, also with what martine said about the publication, so we do expect to publish these results in a major medical journal very shortly prior to the pdufa date of april. so that definitely will -- what we've also heard from the docs is that once we have that published, that gives them even additional confidence in looking for this -- for pulmonary hypertension in this patient population. and yes, we'll likely -- they have said they will either prescribe or certainly be waiting for the approval if they feel comfortable. so i hope that answers the question. so i give back...
martine rothblatt -- chairman, chief executive officer and director
thank you, dr. peterson. that was great answer. and mike, would you like to add some color on that, that we're getting from all of our medical sales teams?
michael benkowitz -- president and chief operating officer
sure. i agree with everything leigh said. i think the -- there is a lot of pent-up demand. there's also, i think, an -- there has been, i think, an underdiagnosis of ph-ild for the reason that dr. peterson stated, which is you have these physicians that may suspect pulmonary hypertension. that suspicion typically happens as the -- obviously, as the symptoms become more severe and present themselves. but because there's no treatment out there, the doctors are putting the patients through the very invasive procedure of the right heart cath. all of our interactions with physicians, be it advisory boards, healthcare -- scientific presentations at healthcare conferences, interactions with our medical team suggest that now that there's a treatment available, these physicians suspect that significant percentages of their patient population have pulmonary hypertension and will start to really screen and diagnose those patients appropriately.
so -- and that's really a large part of what we're doing right now to prepare for the launch in april as we've got our medical teams out -- certainly, the key opinion leaders in the field understand the disease and understand the pulmonary hypertension piece related to interstitial lung disease. but as you get into some of the community physicians, we're spending a lot of time educating them on ph-ild. how do you screen for these patients? how -- what are the things that may lead you to suspect that, ok, this patient has pulmonary hypertension? and then how do you go about arranging for right heart cath to confirm the diagnosis?
martine rothblatt -- chairman, chief executive officer and director
great. thanks, mike. operator, there's time for one bonus question here. do you have another person lined up?
operator
i do. our next question comes from the line of liana moussatos with wedbush securities.
martine rothblatt -- chairman, chief executive officer and director
that's excellent. okay. hi, leanna. good morning.
liana moussatos -- wedbush securities -- analyst
good morning. thank you. since covid continues to be a problem and infection rates are going up and it's affecting our industry, clinical trials and commercialization, can you just give us a brief overview of what has to happen and when you think the timing of this could be resolved between now and maybe end of '21?
martine rothblatt -- chairman, chief executive officer and director
yes. it's a -- it's like one of these kind of 30,000-foot questions that cover everything. in our company, liana, we have a risk management group that reports into our chief financial officer, james edgemond. and this risk management group ultimately has group meetings that involve as many as like 50, 60, 70 people at united therapeutics. and every week, they issue a report regarding covid-19 and how it affects all the different parts of the company. so james, maybe if you could provide some color for liana's question in terms of the overall impact of covid-19 on united therapeutics and when we see -- based on inputs we're getting from our risk management group, when we see some of those effects perhaps ameliorating?
james edgemond -- chief financial officer and treasurer
yes. thank you, martine and liana. good to hear your voice. so as martine mentioned, internally, way back to the beginning part of this year, we organized leadership -- a leadership team to make sure that across the organization, we were communicating effectively and coordinating with each other with respect to risk management and the impacts around covid-19 on all areas of the business, from human capital to manufacturing, the clinical trials, product development through specialty pharmaceutical distributors. and it's been a really effective tool for us to make sure that across the organization, everybody is in tune to what impacts there are to the organization as a whole. and i think broadly speaking, everybody has stepped up. all the unitarians, as we call ourselves internally, have stepped up to make sure that we have understood the various risks and the impacts, not only internally, but to those of our patients and those, importantly, to the patients and individuals in the clinical trials, both that were enrolled, that continue to be enrolled as well as those that were about to enter clinical trials that we may have shut down, as we talked about, and we've begun to reopen some of those based upon the opportunities and really, the hotspots around the country or around the globe.
so broadly speaking, i think martine is right. it's been a coordinated effort to really understand and prepare and execute to make sure, as an organization, we can continue, again, for unitarians or patients at large. from a standpoint of when we think things will get better, we hope for the best, as everybody does in the near term. but we're going to need to stay vigilant around all aspects of the organization to make sure that we can continue to perform as an organization. and so i think as things unfold and we all continue to get better educated and educated on the multiple aspects, we'll certainly continue to communicate in our public filings and on conference calls and various questions. but it's something that we'll continue to take seriously as everybody is doing to make sure the business at whole and at large can continue to move forward. so back to you, martine.
martine rothblatt -- chairman, chief executive officer and director
thanks so much, james. to wrap up, everybody on the earnings call, we've had a great quarter. i think this quarter and perhaps more generally, this half of the year will be looked at in retrospect as a key pivot point for united therapeutics. this will be the time when we pivoted from being solely a pulmonary hypertension company to becoming both a pulmonary hypertension company as well as a pulmonary fibrosis and other forms of interstitial lung disease company. you can see this pivot in us moving into a group of pulmonary hypertension patients, who group 3, as to whom pulmonary hypertension is not their primary problem. their primary problem is interstitial lung disease. it's, of course, greatly worsened by the pulmonary hypertension, but the source of their pulmonary hypertension is ultimately interstitial lung disease. so for the first time, we're moving into a group of patients for whom pulmonary hypertension is not their number one problem, if you will. and secondly, for the first time, we're moving into a large phase iii study in which patients do not have pulmonary hypertension at all.
they simply have this form of interstitial lung disease, pulmonary fibrosis. if you take a look at a diagram of all the species and subspecies of interstitial lung disease, you'll see it is a very large and diverse population. and we were really pleased to see in the outcome of our increase study that we actually were able to modify the disease. in other words, not only slow the rate of decline in forced vital capacity, but actually improve forced final capacity in the patients with pulmonary fibrosis as well as a couple of other subsets of interstitial lung disease. so it's a very exciting time here at united therapeutics. you always hope that you could be strong at your home base and then expand from that. and with this adjacency of interstitial lung disease and pulmonary hypertension, we have a very logical and solid basis from which to expand our footprint in providing more and better healthcare to ever larger numbers of people. thank you so much for your time and attention this morning. look forward to seeing you at upcoming healthcare conferences. operator, you can wrap up.

",1.0,1.0,2020-10-28 09:00:00,"prepared remarks:
operator
good morning, and welcome to the united therapeutics corporation third quarter 2020 earnings call. my name is kenzie, and i will be your conference operator today. [operator instructions]
i will now turn the conference over to mr. dewey steadman, head of investor relations at united therapeutics.
dewey steadman -- head of investor relations

now i'll turn the call over to dr. rothblatt for an overview of the third quarter 2020 financial results and business activities of united therapeutics. martine?
martine rothblatt -- chairman, chief executive officer and director
thank you, dewey. good morning, everybody, and welcome to our third quarter earnings call for 2020. i'm going to be joined on the call today by our president, michael benkowitz; our chief financial officer, james edgemond; and our head of product development, dr. leigh peterson. we really have all good news to report today so it's going to be a very fun earnings call. let me define the good news into two categories: pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary fibrosis. let's start with pulmonary hypertension. we had, over the past quarter, the highest number of patients on our treprostinil medicines ever. in addition to that, we've seen double-digit growth in the number of our patients on orenitram and a number of patients on tyvaso, that's double-digit growth year-to-year, quarter-to-quarter. on top of that, we've also had solid remodulin performance, and we expect this solid remodulin performance to be even further enhanced with two planned launches for 2021: first, the remunity launch for the patients on subcutaneous forms of remodulin; and secondly, the isr, or implantable system for remodulin, launch for patients on the intravenous form of remodulin.
these new product launches are important because most pulmonary hypertension patients declined remodulin due to its great difficulty of delivery. indeed, most pulmonary hypertension patients die without ever having access to remodulin therapy. speaking of our pipeline for pulmonary hypertension, also great significance is our accelerating progress on ralinepag. we expect both the ralinepag outcomes and the ralinepag capacity phase iii trials to be half enrolled in 2021 and fully enrolled by the end of 2022. let me now turn to some of the good news related to pulmonary fibrosis. we remain on schedule to launch our tyvaso product for ipf-associated pulmonary hypertension in april '21, subject to fda approval on its pdufa date. we expect to further penetrate that 30,000 patient market for patients with pulmonary fibrosis-associated pulmonary hypertension with the launch of our dreamboat tret product by the end of 2021 or possibly early 2022. i'd like to remind everyone that systemic drugs for treating this type of pulmonary hypertension, the pulmonary fibrosis-associated pulmonary hypertension, are contraindicated, leaving tyvaso as probably the only medicine approved by the fda to treat this 30,000 patient population. we then expect to greatly expand our pulmonary fibrosis footprint with our teton study in pure pulmonary fibrosis patients starting in the first quarter of '21. indeed, we will be filing the ind for this teton study next quarter.
that 700-patient study should be completely enrolled by 22. so there's a lot of things that are happening, both -- not only in our core historical franchise of pulmonary hypertension, but you can also see that the company is making a steady adjacent market expansion into the field of pulmonary fibrosis, first, by having kind of one leg in two camps with the group three pulmonary hypertension associated with pulmonary fibrosis and then with the other leg completely in the pulmonary fibrosis side of the fence with the teton study. while i've been talking about our pipeline, let me also talk about things that are going on at the phase i and what i would call the phase 0.9 level of our pipeline. so with regard to phase i in the -- in early 2021, we will begin clinical development of our once-daily form of orenitram based on an ind that will be going in shortly. this will be much more convenient for patients than the three times daily form of orenitram and, i think, will be instrumental in continuing the double-digit growth that we're currently seeing year-over-year in orenitram. another exciting activity that i would say is at the phase 0.9 level is remopro.
this is the painless form of subcutaneous remodulin designed ultimately to go into the remunity pump. we plan to file our ind in the fourth quarter of '21 and then move into phase i right after that in '22. speaking of filing inds in '21, another ind we plan to file in '21 is for our xeno-kidney project. this is a 10 gene-modified porcine kidney designed specifically to avoid the types of rejection that are common in xenografting and instead to appear to the recipient as no different than another allograft. we expect to file the ind for the xeno-kidney program in '21 and then, due to the unique nature of that type of a product, move directly into a phase ii/iii study in '22.
well, with that overview of our clinical development and pipeline activities, i'd like to next turn the microphone to our president, michael benkowitz, to give a review of other aspects of our operations, including commercialization. michael?
michael benkowitz -- president and chief operating officer
thanks, martine. good morning, everyone. as martine said, overall, we're extremely pleased with our reported revenue performance in the third quarter, highlighted by strong double-digit year-over-year growth in orenitram, tyvaso and unituxin. and when you adjust our revenue growth to account for the excess order that occurred by one of our distributors in the third quarter of 2019, that growth is even stronger. on this adjusted basis, u.s. remodulin revenues grew year-over-year and 5% sequentially, and tyvaso and orenitram revenues grew by approximately 30% each year-over-year. we periodically caution that our revenues represent sales to our distributors and may not reflect underlying demand for our products. happily, we can report that revenue growth we saw in q3 is supported by growing demand in the u.s. as reflected by the following highlights during the quarter. first, after experiencing some covid-related softness and new patient starts earlier during the pandemic, total treprostinil starts returned to prepandemic levels during the quarter. second, as martine noted, the number of patients utilizing one of our treprostinil products reached another all-time high. this is the fourth quarter in a row that we've achieved an active patient since its record for our treprostinil products.
we have a record number of patients benefiting from orenitram, reflecting continuing and increasing adoption of this therapy by physicians following the freedom-ev label expansion last year. we have more patients benefiting from tyvaso than we have had in approximately five years prior to the commercial availability of oral prostacyclin class medicines. and finally, we are just shy of a record number of patients utilizing remodulin. in addition to those highlights, we're seeing increases in average dose levels and the length of time our patients stay on our medicines, both of which positively impact our revenues. so we're very pleased all the way around with the momentum and trending of our commercial products. meanwhile, we are making very good progress toward our nearer-term new product launches. we are building out our field-based medical sales and nursing teams to support the expected tyvaso label expansion in april 2021 to include patients with pulmonary hypertension associated with interstitial lung disease following our increase trial. we have started engaging with physicians that treat these patients, which, by and large, is a new prescriber base compared to those currently prescribing our products for pah, in appropriate forums, such as investigator meetings, scientific presentations at healthcare conferences, advisory boards, market research and one-on-one interactions.
the increase data is roundly considered overwhelmingly positive, and the ild treating community is looking forward to having tyvaso in their treatment armamenterium for these very sick patients upon fda approval. between the momentum we're seeing with tyvaso and its approved who group one indication and the excitement around the upcoming launch into who group 3, we're well on our way to solidifying tyvaso as our largest product in the very near term. our two upcoming remodulin pump launches are also progressing. in the case of remunity, our new subcu pump that was approved by the fda earlier this year, we believe we have overcome the covid-related delays that impacted the july launch timing. our partner, deka research, is building commercial inventory. and once we have sufficient safety stock, which we expect soon, we'll be -- begin making the remunity pumps commercially available. and finally, our partner, medtronic, continues their discussions with the fda to clear the outstanding conditions of approval for the isr, which is our new iv pump. we believe we remain on track for a launch next year, and we are already working with key pah centers to get them ready for this launch.
so with that, i'll turn the call back over to martine.
martine rothblatt -- chairman, chief executive officer and director
thanks so much, mike. operator, i'm now happy to field the calls, and i'll direct them among dr. peterson, james edgemond and mike benkowitz as appropriate.

thank you. [operator instructions] our first question comes from the line of joseph thome with cowen and company. please go ahead. your line is open.
joseph thome -- cowen and company -- analyst
hi there. thank you for taking my question and congratulations on all the progress. i want to discuss the hopeful integration of the dpi a little bit. can you give us your thoughts on how you expect to transition in or start patients on the dpi in pah? and then for ph-ild, because the dpi could launch reasonably quickly after the formal label expansion, how are you thinking over the next 12 to 18 months integrating ph-ild patients on the dpi versus the nebulized tyvaso version?
martine rothblatt -- chairman, chief executive officer and director
yes. thanks so much for those good questions. they're both really in the realm of business questions that mike benkowitz and his very talented team have already been working on and interacting with physicians on. so mike, could you take that question?
michael benkowitz -- president and chief operating officer
sure. yes, i think the answer applies really, i think, to both indications. and we're really excited about the progress we've made with tyvaso dpi. we're looking forward to the filing, as martine said in april. and with the priority review voucher, we purchased at the end of last year, are hopeful that, assuming everything goes well with the fda, we'll be able to launch that into both indications by the end of this year. and i'll tell you that there's both in -- with pah docs and with ph-ild docs, there's a lot of excitement and enthusiasm around having a dry powder inhaler. and so we're preparing to aggressively launch that product and make it available -- and get available to as many patients as are wanting to either start -- initiate new therapy on tyvaso as well as transition over. and so i think at this point, we're very encouraged by the feedback we're hearing from the physicians, very optimistic that there will be a -- i think relatively speaking, in ph, a quick transition for those patients that want to transition to dpi to be able to do so very soon after launch.
martine rothblatt -- chairman, chief executive officer and director
thanks, mike. operator, next question, please.
operator
our next question comes from the line of liana moussatos with wedbush. please go ahead. your line is open.
liana moussatos -- wedbush -- analyst
thank you for taking my question. so for remunity launch, how should we think about q1 revenues?
martine rothblatt -- chairman, chief executive officer and director
thanks, liana, nice to hear your voice this morning. again, another business question, i'd like to forward that to mike benkowitz.
michael benkowitz -- president and chief operating officer
yes. so i think with the remunity launch, you're looking at i think another product where there's a lot of excitement in the market. as martine said, we launched that earlier this month. we're pleased to see the really early enthusiasm from physicians around remunity. we're already seeing referrals come in. and so we expect to get those patients on therapy in the coming weeks, months, and into the future. we're not going to break out remunity versus the ms3 pump revenues. we'll still continue to kind of report that as remodulin revenues. but we certainly believe that with the remunity pump, we have an opportunity to continue to kind of maintain our remodulin business over the long term and grow it by virtue of the remunity pump as well as the next iterations of that, the machine fill pump, and as martine talked about, the remopro, which is our pain-free version of remodulin.
martine rothblatt -- chairman, chief executive officer and director
thanks so much, mike. i'm so excited about remunity. liana, i can't actually pull myself back from sharing this anecdote that flowed in just the past couple of days ago. there is an important pulmonary hypertension center that had regularly put patients on iv remodulin but was very resistant to putting patients on subcu remodulin. they actually have become the first center to put patients on remunity. they were so impressed with the differences of remunity compared to subcu remodulin that this center that had not put patients on subcu remodulin for a long time was now switching patients over or starting new patients on remunity, whereas they wouldn't have done that for subcu remodulin. so i just think that that anecdote is a very positive indicator of things to come for immunity. operator, next question.
operator
our next question comes from the line of eun yang with jefferies. please go ahead. your line is open.
eun yang -- jefferies -- analyst
thank you. questions on tyvaso dpi. so once it's approved, you owe double-digit percentage of royalty to mannkind. are there any regulatory or sales-related milestones? and with that, do you expect the gross margin to kind of settle around mid-to-high 80s? thank you.
martine rothblatt -- chairman, chief executive officer and director
okay. thank you, eun, so much for the question. that sounds to me like pretty much of a financial question. so i'm going to ask our cfo, james edgemond, to please handle that one.
james edgemond -- chief financial officer and treasurer
yes. thank you, martine, and good morning, eun. you're right. we do owe mannkind royalties related to patients that use the dpi going forward. and as you've probably recognized and noted in the financial statements, we have historically made milestone payments and we've achieved these milestones under our agreement with mannkind. going forward, there are limited milestones with respect to pursuing other indications. so our main financial obligation, as you kind of referred to, is really around our royalty obligation for new patients going to dpi.
and as for kind of your question around gross margin, you're getting very specific in terms of what it would be, i think, overall, because we don't necessarily anticipate breaking out of tyvaso or dpi versus the current nebulizer. so in your modeling, i think, if you take the royalty obligations that we owe mannkind within your model, you're going to come out to something based upon how you're splitting the revenue. but we don't anticipate doing that on a going-forward basis. so thanks for your question, and martine, back to you.
martine rothblatt -- chairman, chief executive officer and director
thank you so much, james. appreciate it. operator, could you please receive the next question?
operator
our next question comes from the line of jessica fye with jpmorgan. please go ahead. your line is open.
jessica fye -- jpmorgan -- analyst
[indecipherable] good morning. thanks so much for taking my question. my question is on the tyvaso ph-ild launch and in the press release, how you kind of reiterated the hope to double the number of tyvaso patients in the near term. i think in the past, you suggested may be looking at about 18 months. when we think about that growth in patients, should we think of that as sort of straight-line growth? or is this something that could have an initial bolus or conversely something that might start slow and then sort of inflect over time?
martine rothblatt -- chairman, chief executive officer and director
thanks, jessica, for your question. nice hearing your voice this morning. that's very squarely a business question. so i'll pass that one to mike.
michael benkowitz -- president and chief operating officer
yes. thanks. thanks, jess. it's a great question. as we talked about when we did the increased call -- investor call last month, i think our belief is that it probably won't be straight line. we do think that there may be an initial bolus. i can't really quantify what that is right now because i think we're still gathering that data through interactions with our physicians. so there may be an initial bolus, and then it may -- could dip a little bit and then start to ramp back up. but i think -- my belief based on what we're hearing right now is i think it will be, thinking about the big picture, a little bit slower then ramping up over the next 18-month period of time.
and that's really just a function of getting the patients in, getting them screened, getting an echo done, getting a right heart cath. and there, i think there's still some -- there's scheduling, there's logistics and all of that stuff has to happen, and then you have to get the referrals and get patients initiated on therapy. so that's really the reason for that. it has nothing to do, i think, with lack of awareness or lack of enthusiasm for tyvaso in any indication. as we talked about last month, there's certainly a lot of excitement about being able to have this to the treatment armamentarium for pulmonary hypertension and ild.
martine rothblatt -- chairman, chief executive officer and director
thanks so much, mike. operator, next question, please.
operator
the next question comes from the line of marty auster with credit suisse. please go ahead. your line is open.
marty auster -- credit suisse -- analyst
thanks, martine. i think this one is going to fall into the business question category as well. but i just want to check in with mike. tyvaso had some nice growth this year, and obviously, there's a lot of awareness and interest in the group three ph-ild indication that we're all hoping for approval on the pdufa date coming up in april. curious if you could maybe talk a little bit about -- did you see any sort of increasing in terms of the breadth of prescribers of tyvaso this year? were you just seeing kind of a little like kind of better depth and uptake of the existing base? just curious if you could kind of comment as we're trying to think about how much -- kind of how much of that growth is reflecting some early enthusiasm for the broadened indication. thanks.
martine rothblatt -- chairman, chief executive officer and director
thanks, marty. great hearing your voice again today as well. you guessed it. mike?
michael benkowitz -- president and chief operating officer
i kind of earned my paycheck today. that was great. yes. so it's a little bit difficult to know the extent to which there is off-label use as a result of the increased data. all that we're able to track is the -- is who's writing the referral. so to your point about the prescriber base, that hasn't changed. the folks that are writing tyvaso are typical pah prescribers? we have not seen a material change in that. we haven't seen really an uptick in new prescribers yet. we do expect that that's going to occur after we get the label expansion. so within that prescriber base, our usual prescriber base, to the extent that they're seeing ild patients, they could be writing through the indication. but by and large, the performance of tyvaso is within our traditional pah stocks. i think a lot of it has to do with the buzz around tyvaso, the new england journal. and i think it's just on the pah side, just reminding physicians what a great drug that is for pah patients.
martine rothblatt -- chairman, chief executive officer and director
awesome. thanks, mike. thank you, marty. operator, next question, please.

our next question comes from the line of hartaj singh with oppenheimer. please go ahead. your line is open.
hartaj singh -- oppenheimer -- analyst
hello. great. thank you for the question. this is a financial question. in 2020, you had a dip in your sales from losing adcirca. james, i know you always talk about opex spend as being 50% of previous year sales. however, in 2021, you're going to have potentially long launches, a lot of things going on. just how to think about that and then going forward also?
martine rothblatt -- chairman, chief executive officer and director
thanks, hartaj. great hearing you online today. hopefully, winter is not treating you too bad there in new york. and james, solid financial question.
james edgemond -- chief financial officer and treasurer
yes. thank you, martine. good morning, hartaj, and it is always good to hear your voice. so thanks for the question. so the budget algorithm that we have talked about historically and that you referred to this morning where we plan our budget in a current year, for example, 2021 based upon 50% of prior year revenues in total. so to your point around the decrease in sales, if you use adcirca as an example, overall, we still need to maintain our budgets and our financial discipline with respect to our total revenue. so as revenues grow going forward, that means unitherians in terms of their budgets will get additional funds for projects.
with respect to your specific question on 2021, we still need to stay within our budget algorithm with all the activity that martine and michael talked about in terms of product launches and clinical development. we still need to make sure we stay within that budget algorithm. so our 2021 budgets are based upon 2020 revenues and that's how we built them and that's how we'll execute across the course of 2021. and all unitherians know that in order to get more an additional budget dollars, we need to all grow revenue across the firm, and that's what martine talked about double-digit growth going forward. and that really is objective across united therapeutics. so thanks for your question, hartaj. and martine, back to you.
martine rothblatt -- chairman, chief executive officer and director
thanks, james, for a great answer. and it's really beautiful hearing you describe the budget algorithm because the vision that i have in my head is that we have not 100 people rowing to grow the business of the company, like just the sales and marketing force, but we have 1,000. the total headcount of united therapeutics all rowing in the same direction, the product development, the research and development, legal, financial. everybody is focused on a singular goal of growing the company so that everybody there, everybody in the company, can have additional resources available to grow the projects that are nearest and dearest and center to their own career development experience. so that budget algorithm has had an excellent effect of kind of magnetically aligning all 1,000 unitherians in the same positive direction. thanks for bringing up that question. operator, next question, please.
operator
our next question comes from the line of terence flynn with goldman sachs. please go ahead. your line is open.
terence flynn -- goldman sachs -- analyst
hi. good morning. thanks for taking the questions. maybe two for me. martine, you talked about double-digit revenue growth. just wondering that -- i think, for 2021, but how sustainable is that longer-term? and then on ralinepag, another important late-stage program for you guys, maybe any update on enrollment there and the potential timing of the data? thank you.
martine rothblatt -- chairman, chief executive officer and director
sure. thanks. i'm going to answer the first question, which is kind of, i guess, more of like a strategic overall question, and then i'm going to pass it to dr. peterson to answer the scientific question relating to ralinepag. so as to the durability of our revenue growth, i think it looks really strong. and that was the reason i wanted to kind of highlight in the introductory remarks that we're not talking about growing within kind of a single small finite crowded pond, which is a bit how i would describe group one pulmonary hypertension-about 10 approved drugs, roughly speaking, 50,000 u.s. patients.
we are going to grow in that group one pulmonary hypertension, but the durability of our growth throughout the 2020s doesn't depend just on group one pulmonary hypertension, [we], even on top of that, have this group three community, which is one of their feet are in pulmonary fibrosis, which is the cause of their disease, and the other of their feet is in pulmonary hypertension, which we know very well. and now we are -- we've done the necessary pivotal trial, executed to a level of scientific rigor and confidence that it enjoyed publication in the new england journal of medicine, and hopefully, to be approved in april.
now with that launch, we will go into a patient population of approximately 30,000 patients, who are almost all are already being treated for their pulmonary fibrosis, but virtually none of them are being treated for their pulmonary hypertension because there was no drug approved to treat that. and that's why i mentioned at the beginning of the call, this is, to me, like kind of a very beautiful scenario. it's like when we started the company a decade or two ago, there were maybe 20,000 pulmonary hypertension patients, and we were competing with glaxo on the parenteral side. we're competing with actelion on the oral side. we were competing with another drug called iloprost on the inhaled side, and those actually fragmented. and then we had 10 different competitors as we do today, but still growing organically within group one. but in group three, there's none of that.
there's 30,000 patients in need of a therapy, and hopefully, knock on wood, the -- we will get approved in april. and then we have an awesome therapy for them in tyvaso. and then like just a year later, absolutely revolutionary therapy with the tyvaso dpi product. so i think that's going to drive growth for well beyond 2021, in fact, for several years. and then one more thing, which i mentioned in the introductory remarks, is this pure pulmonary fibrosis population of 100,000 patients in the u.s. all being managed with a drug, which unfortunately reduces the rate of decline in their forced vital capacity, but does not improve it, does not modify the disease.
and we've got this very promising data from the increase study that builds upon earlier benchtop data that shows actually there is disease-modifying capability in tyvaso for patients with pulmonary fibrosis. we need to now validate that hypothesis with a prospective study, which is what our teton study is currently enrolling. so you add up the group one, the group three, the pulmonary fibrosis, not to mention the perfect study. and i think this growing our patients by double-digit rates is something that can be reasonably anticipated for the balance of the 2020s. so with that answer to your business question or strategic question, let me shift over to dr. peterson to address the scientific question.
leigh peterson -- vice president, product development
yes. so basically, you were asking about the ralinepag studies. and in spite of the pandemics, the enrollment in those studies, especially the outcome study, is going quite well. we still have a few sites that aren't open due to the pandemic, but of those sites, the majority of the sites are open. and again, they're enrolling quite well. this is -- the outcome study is an international trial, so we have sites all over the world. and we have pretty -- we have good enrollment both in the u.s. as well as outside of the u.s. we're still planning to have this outcome study enrolled in 2022, and then have a readout in 2024.
now, remember, this study is endpoint-driven, hence the name, outcome study. and so not only do we need to have the patients enrolled, but we need to follow them and collect data on the disease progression of these patients and then compare that in the two groups. so we expect a 2024 readout and a 2025 launch. we're also enrolling our cpet study. now that study isn't endpoint-driven. it's change in peak vo2 from baseline to week 28. and we'll be enrolling 193 patients in that study, and that allows for dropouts. and so if we don't have as many dropouts as maybe we put into the initial calculations, we could finish that trial sooner. but we're counting on them both to be finishing around the same time at this point. we'll know more as enrollment progresses and the sites continue to open up.
martine rothblatt -- chairman, chief executive officer and director
thank you so much, dr. peterson. operator, we have time for one last question.
operator
we have no telephone questions in queue at this time.
martine rothblatt -- chairman, chief executive officer and director

good morning, and welcome to the united therapeutics corporation fourth quarter 2020 earnings call. my name is kenzie, and i will be your conference operator today. [operator instructions]
i will now turn the conference call over to mr. dewey steadman, head of investor relations at united therapeutics.

martine rothblatt -- chairman, chief executive officer and director
thank you, dewey. good morning, everyone. welcome to the 2020 full year and fourth quarter earnings call of united therapeutics. we are going to have a really great call today. ut is a pulmonary hypertension company, now becoming both a pulmonary hypertension and a pulmonary fibrosis company. we expect our products for these two markets to generate double-digit growth for several years to come. for example, today, we report that our fourth quarter 2020 revenues grew by double digits, about 24% from fourth quarter 2019. and even excluding a onetime 2019 aberration in the distributor order patterns, revenue still grew over 10% fourth quarter year-over-year, with tyvaso posting a 27% growth fourth quarter year-over-year and orenitram posting a ut record 30% growth.
let me now go into some detail on why we expect strong growth in treprostinil patient counts to continue. starting with our pulmonary hypertension activities, we believe organic growth from our existing three commercialized products as well as new products emerging from our pipeline will drive double-digit growth. organic growth from our three existing products includes, first of all, the increasing use of remodulin as part of our remunity protocol to drive pulmonary artery pressures down below 40 millimeters of mercury before rapidly switching the patients for long-term management on orenitram. several top pulmonary hypertension experts have recently shown that this kind of protocol is associated with much longer patient survival than the conventional approaches.
second of all, substantial organic growth is coming from tyvaso based on data from our increased pivotal trial that was published this past quarter in the new england journal of medicine. this kind of growth is visible in the 24% year-to-year financials mentioned above. and third of all, organic growth is also coming from orenitram based on ever-greater awareness of its ability to reduce mortality and morbidity based on data from our freedom pivotal study. this is clear in the 30% growth rate from fourth quarter to 2019 to fourth quarter 2020. now we also expect growth to be driven by new products emerging from our pipeline. these, for pulmonary hypertension, include, first of all, our just launched remunity device; secondly, our expected launch of our implantable system for remodulin, or isr product, jointly developed and promoted together with medtronic; and third, our expected launch by the end of this year of our dry powder inhaler form of tyvaso, which we call tyvaso dpi.
then just around the corner, during 2022 to 2024, we expect to advance through late-stage clinical development and launch for pulmonary hypertension, first of all, our trevyent product optimized for dexterity challenged patients, which is, in fact, just awaiting resubmission to the fda; second of all, our once-daily alternative to uptravi called ralinepag; thirdly, our once-daily version of orenitram; and fourthly, a pain reduced form of remodulin called remopro. so all told, you add up the ones that are on the market and about to come, we have 10 parallel pathways to propel double-digit growth in pulmonary hypertension, three on the market, three next up to the market, and four in queue behind that. now in addition to all of that, as mentioned at the beginning of the call, we have now built the bridge to evolve from just a pulmonary hypertension company to also being a pulmonary fibrosis company.
this evolution was made possible by the beautiful results from our increased trial reported in the new england journal of medicine that showed tyvaso in ild-ph or also known as who group three disease patients met all of its primary and all of its secondary endpoints in patients with pulmonary fibrosis-induced pulmonary hypertension. this new indication, representing -- it's over 30,000 u.s. patients, has no approved therapies. and nearly all existing pulmonary hypertension treatments are, in fact, strongly contraindicated in it. it's funny for me to reflect on this, but roughly speaking, it is like -- pending fda approval in april, which our fingers are all crossed on, it's like starting ut's revenue climb from the birth of the company all over again, but this time, without competition from actelion, pfizer or glaxo. now our bridge in the pulmonary fibrosis is being even further strengthened with our phase iii teton trial of tyvaso in patients with pure pulmonary fibrosis. that is no pulmonary hypertension. in this trial, we will test the hypothesis that tyvaso is a disease-modifying drug on top of existing pulmonary fibrosis treatments. that hypothesis, already indicated by benchtop studies, received strong confirmatory data in the increased trial because the patients on tyvaso had improved forced vital capacity outcomes or fvc as compared to just a reduced rate of decline in fvc seen in the conventionally treated group.
now this patient population, the pure pulmonary fibrosis patients, numbers about 100,000 in the u.s. and are easily accessible since they are being treated already with either pirfenidone, also known as esbriet, or nintedanib, also known as ofev. so between the group three population of 30,000 patients i mentioned before that we hope to get approval for in april and the teton population, we hope to show success in by the end of next year, numbering about 100,000 patients. there will be plenty of tyvaso patients to drive double-digit growth for several years to come. i should also add that we expect our approval of our tyvaso dpi, i mentioned that earlier, to include the label not only for pulmonary hypertension patients, but very importantly, also for pulmonary fibrosis patients.
in summary, without even getting into our phase iii trial in copd-associated pulmonary hypertension or a registration trial for pulmonary hypertension gene therapy, ut's prospects have never looked better. with a total of 12 other vectors to double-digit patient growth, some in pulmonary fibrosis, some in pulmonary hypertension, some on the market, some soon to be launched, we feel very confident that the most important growth phase of united therapeutics is just about to begin. now i'd like to open up the lines for questions. we have a number of experts joining me on the phone. so if you ask me the question, i'll forward it either to mike benkowitz on all business questions, to james edgemond for all financial questions, to dr. leigh peterson for scientific questions and to dewey steadman for any ip questions. operator, please feel free to open the lines.

[operator instructions] your first question comes from the line of eun yang with jefferies.
eun yang -- jefferies -- analyst
thank you. i have a couple of questions. one is on group three ph-ild. so we heard from physicians that they see their patients every three to six months. and i know, martine just mentioned that group three is a more difficult disease to diagnose and quantify compared to pah. but is it like aside from targeting physicians, do you plan to target patient so that patients are actually seeking treatment with tyvaso?
and the second question is on subcutaneous remodulin. i understand that you may be limited to what you can say, but in 10-q, the trial with sandoz and liquidia, you don't expect to begin before mid-2022 at the earliest. does that mean that liquidia could not -- cannot launch the product until the trial is over? thank you.

thank you for your question, eun. nice to hear your voice this morning. due to the shortage of time on the call, we're only going to be able to allow one question per inquisitor, if i could say that. so i'm going to just take the first question and refer it to michael because it's really in the domain of a business question. mike, can you help eun with understanding what our strategy is with regard to ild-ph? sure. so let me -- before i get to the specific question around the patient, maybe give a little bit of color around the ph-ild launch. so martine, i think, gave a great overview of sort of our 5-year vision of growing from roughly 8,000 total patients to 25,000 patients and roughly half of those being tyvaso patients for various indications. so with respect to the ph-ild piece of that, i just want to reiterate what we've been saying since january. and that with this launch, we expect the number of patients on tyvaso to approximately double by the end of next year. and the other thing that we've been saying is that it's probably not going to be a straight line from here to that doubling. there'll be a little bit of a ramp and then something looks a little bit more hockey stick-ish as we get later into the year and certainly into next year. and that's due to various things around the fact that, and eun touched on this, we have a new group of ild treaters. so they're having to go through the process of getting their patients in, screen those patients, diagnose those patients and then clear the -- get that cleared with payers. so that process is ongoing. i will say, in the first three to four weeks of the launch, it's very early days. we're incredibly pleased with what we've seen in terms of referral activity, in terms of the number of referrals that have come in. we actually have patients that have started since the launch on tyvaso. and i'll also say that in the last week, i've been out meeting with six of the major ild centers in the western half of the u.s. and i will say you to a person, to a center, all of those physicians are extremely excited about having a treatment option for these very sick patients. and again, all have said that we have -- there is a meaningful unmet need here that we're going to be able to address with tyvaso. so we have been -- since last summer, we're building relationships with these new treaters, educating them on the disease. now we're able to talk more openly about tyvaso, the benefits of tyvaso, how you get a patient started now that we have the approval. and then the second point to that, coming back around to eun's question is, yes, of course, we are -- we have multiple patient engagement and education efforts ongoing. obviously, with fda guidelines and other restrictions on being able to communicate with patients, we have to be a little bit more careful in those engagements for very good reasons. but we do have a, i would say, very robust patient engagement and education effort ongoing. awesome, mike. thanks so much. operator, next question.

your next question comes from the line of liana moussatos with wedbush securities.
liana moussatos -- wedbush securities -- analyst
thank you for taking my question and congratulations on all the progress. how are you going to commercialize tyvaso solution versus tyvaso dpi at the end of the year, presuming approval?
martine a. rothblatt -- founder chairperson, chief executive officer, and director
thanks so much, liana. so great to hear your voice again as well. so that's, again, squarely a business question. so mike, can you help describe the differential launch plans?
michael i. benkowitz -- president and chief operating officer
sure. so we're really excited about the prospect of bringing -- being able to bring the dpi to market. we think that it certainly provides a more convenient, easier way to deliver tyvaso. but if you kind of step back and really kind of look at the history of united therapeutics and what our objective and missions has been or have been, and that is the right patient options. patients with options -- different ways to take our medicines in a way that is -- meets kind of where they are in their disease, and that's most convenient to them. so we started with remodulin and then we developed two versions of remodulin.
we developed tyvaso, which was an easier way to take treprostinil inhaled, and then eventually got to orenitram, which is obviously the simplest version of all of them. and so i look at dpi as really kind of fitting in. it's fitting kind of into that strategy of providing patient options. and so i would expect that with the dpi, you're going to have a significant number or majority of patients that are going to want to transition to the dry powder inhaler, and that's fantastic. you will have other patients that, for various reasons, may choose to stay on the nebulizer. and that's great. we're going to continue to support that product. it's a great product. there is going to -- i do think that there is going to be a patient type that is maybe better suited for that product over the dpi. don't hold me to this. i think when the dust settles, you're probably looking at something of around a 70-30 split between dry powder and nebulizer. so we're going to continue to provide both options, support both options. and i think they're both great delivery devices for the right patient.
martine a. rothblatt -- founder chairperson, chief executive officer, and director
perfect. thanks so much, mike. operator, next question, please.
operator
your next question comes from the line of hartaj singh with oppenheimer & company.
hartaj singh -- oppenheimer & company -- analyst
great, thank you for the question and great work. got a question on orenitram. so since the approval of the freedom-ev, the addition to the label, the study, freedom-ev study, martine, it has -- the trajectory -- growth trajectory of the product has definitely increased substantially in the last two years. johnson & johnson with uptravi, the old actelion drug, indicates about 20% on average growth every quarter. some of that from market share, some of that from an increase of the overall market size. can you give us color there and also help walk us through how you see orenitram adding those additional 3,000 patients, as you had mentioned earlier in your prepared commentary? thank you for the question.
martine a. rothblatt -- founder chairperson, chief executive officer, and director
great. hartaj, so awesome to hear your voice this morning as well. very interesting question. very much in the range of what we call business and market strategy. so mike, if i can ask you to provide hartaj with some more insight into the business ramp plans for orenitram?
michael i. benkowitz -- president and chief operating officer
yes. happy to do that. yes. so i think with orenitram, i think you have to kind of, again, kind of step back and look at the timing of the launch and kind of where that kind of fit with covid, right? so i will say, at a high level, i think as a company, we continue to be very pleased with the physician reaction to the ev data. i think our underlying patient trends continue to be very solid. and i would say, in particular, i think, in late q1 and even heading into q2, if you look at referrals and starts, we've seen actually a nice uptick over the prior months. i will say, i mean, hindsight to 2020, as i kind of look back over the last 18 months and think about when we received the label expansion, which was october of 2019, when the publication came out, which was in march, like literally two days, i think, before the world shut down, to your point, hartaj, we did see a nice uptick in that kind of initial four to six month period. and then it did get sort of muted. so we had a nice ramp and then it just kind of plateaued a little bit there for a little while.
and i think, obviously, as i look at it, i think it's a function of kind of covid shutting down, the lack of access that we had to physicians and just impacting our ability to really kind of get out and continue to communicate the ev data. i mean we certainly had some access during covid virtually, but nowhere near the axis that we had pre-covid. so i think that we're starting to come out of this a little bit. we're getting that access again. we're able to get in and have really, i think, fruitful discussions with physicians and really kind of talk about the orenitram value proposition. i think the doctors are seeing that.
and like i said, i think we're starting to see that uptick. and so i think as we look into the future, i think, long term, as martine said, i think we do have a lot of runway there with orenitram as we continue to educate the physicians on the value proposition. i also think with some of the data that we've talked about in prior calls around this idea of treating patients to pressure. so putting -- starting them on remodulin, really trying to drive down their pulmonary arterial pressure and then switching them over to orenitram, i think that is continuing to get a little bit of -- certainly a lot of attention by physicians. and i think over the long term, that's going to give us, i think, another -- sort of another leverage point with orenitram. and then i think the third one that we see in sort of the latter half of the 25/25 plan that martine laid out is orenipro, the once daily.
so that provides, as we're talking about tyvaso, a more convenient way to take orenitram and potentially with a better tolerability and an ability to dose faster. so maybe some additional attributes there. so i think it's really sort of a combination of building on and restarting -- build on the momentum we've seen in the last quarter and continuing to leverage the ev data, leverage this treat to pressure idea that's getting some attention and then the once-daily formulation that's coming in kind of the back end of the 25/25 time frame.
martine a. rothblatt -- founder chairperson, chief executive officer, and director
excellent, mike. thank you so much. operator, i believe we have time for one last question.
operator
your next question comes from the line of joe thome with cowen and company.
joe thome -- cowen and company -- analyst
good morning and thank you for taking my question. just a quick one on the teton program. as you start thinking about adding more trials here and expanding tyvaso's opportunity, is it possible to study the dpi alone in some of these trials, maybe the increased adherence or ease of use would maybe drive better treatment outcomes? or do you have to start with the nebulized version and maybe do a pk study to show equivalents there?
martine a. rothblatt -- founder chairperson, chief executive officer, and director
yes. just that is, i would say, that was close to a scientific question as we've got so far this morning. i'd like to bounce that one over to dr. peterson to discuss.
leigh peterson -- vice president of product development
yes. thank you for the call -- or the question. so we have been told or actually we have, in writing, that once we receive approval for tyvaso for new indications and once we receive approval for the tyvaso dpi for pah, really, then the approval will automatically be granted for the additional indications for dpi as they come along. so given that, it really depends on what we decided at the time with regard to supply, ease of use, where patients are with wanting to be on our dpi versus the inhaler, the tyvaso inhaler, we don't exactly know. i mean we have studied the dpi -- the tyvaso dpi in -- for human factors in all different indications, whether it's pah or ph-ild or even some ilds without diagnosed ph.
so as far as that goes, they're quite similar. but there is some question, and i can't say one way or the other, that some patients with different indications might actually prefer a nebulized form. it might be a little bit easier for them to take and get a good dose versus the dry powder inhaler because they have to -- have more -- they actually breathe in for the dry powder inhaler versus the nebulizer is a little bit more passive. so we're going to -- as soon as we continue to do additional studies, we'll investigate that. but right now, teton one is already in the work. the sites are open, and we have a protocol. we should have the enrollment any day now, and that's with tyvaso. thanks so much, dr. peterson. really appreciate it. well, we really have been happy to have an opportunity to share our business, scientific and our financial progress with everybody during this first quarter earnings call. we've been happy to share with everybody on this world pulmonary hypertension day that by the end of next year, we expect to be able to double the number of patients that we have on tyvaso. and by 2025, we expect to be able to help roughly three times as many patients with our treprostinil suite of products that we're currently helping today. it is a fact that based on the kaplan-meier curves of all of the main approved therapies that about 15% to 20% of the patients progress in their disease symptoms -- signs and symptoms each year. and just to make the math easy, at 50,000 patients, 15% a year progressing is 7,500 a year, 20% progressing is 10,000 a year. so whether the number of patients needing a new therapy is 1,500 a year or -- i'm sorry, is 7,500 a year or 10,000 a year, both of those numbers are well above the growth that united therapeutics requires to go from 8,000 patients that we're helping today to 25,000 patients that we will be helping by 2025. so i believe that the goal is realistic. the need is real. and our capabilities are strong, impressive and ever growing. thank you so much, everybody, for joining us on this call and look forward to seeing you at least virtually at an upcoming healthcare conference. operator, you can wrap it up.

now i'll turn the call over to dr. rothblatt for an overview of our first quarter 2021 financial results and business activities of united therapeutics. dr. rothblatt?
martine a. rothblatt -- founder chairperson, chief executive officer, and director
thank you, dewey. good morning, everybody. thanks for joining us on our first quarter 2021 earnings call. i'm going to start off with a sort of 30,000-foot overview. and then after that, i'll open the line for any questions. if there are business questions, i'll refer them to our president, michael benkowitz. if there are financial questions, i'll refer them to our chief financial officer, james edgemond. and any scientific questions, i'll refer to our senior vice president, dr. leigh peterson. i may even pass the odd legal question to dewey. well, i think from a 30,000-foot viewpoint, the main quantitative goal at united therapeutics is what we call 25/25. this means increasing the number of patients that we are helping with our main medicine from over 8,000 patients today to over 25,000 patients by 2025.
this quantitative metric is an especially important one to call out today because today is world pulmonary hypertension day. it's the one day in the whole calendar that countries throughout the world have agreed to focus their thoughts, attention and for many patients and families' prayers on the hopes for getting better therapies and treatments for people with pulmonary hypertension. we expect about half of the roughly 18,000-patient growth that we will require to meet our 25/25 goal will come from patients with what's called who, or world health organization group 1, pulmonary arterial hypertension, and about half of that 18,000-patient growth will come from patients with world health organization, or who group three pulmonary hypertension. let me start by breaking down how i believe we'll get our 9,000-patient growth in the group one category, and then i'll talk briefly about the second 9,000-patient growth in the group three category. so for the half of the growth we expect in who group i, we expect that to come in roughly equal thirds from our remodulin product, our tyvaso product, and our orenitram product. we think we'll be able to gain about 3,000 new patients on remodulin, particularly due to the convenience and patient friendliness of our newly approved remunity pump.
we think we'll be able to gain about 3,000 new group one patients on tyvaso because of the convenience and patient friendliness of our new dreamboat dry powder inhaler, which we have filed for approval and we hope to be approved in december of this year. this is a finger-sized device compared to the large liquid nebulizer that we use today. and then finally, we think we'll be able to gain about 3,000 new patients between now and 2025 on orenitram because of the constantly growing appreciation of the efficacy of orenitram in reducing morbidity and mortality. now please keep in mind that there are about, in the u.s. alone, 45,000 patients in who group one being treated with non-united therapeutics drug and about 15% progress in their disease annually per the kaplan-meier curve of their trials. so overall, there are some 50,000-plus patients being treated for pulmonary hypertension, about 8,000 of them currently being treated by our drug and the balance somewhere between 40,000 and 45,000, probably closer to 45,000 being treated with non-united therapeutics drugs.
so it is very achievable. there is plenty of market space. there's plenty of help-the-patient space available for us to grow in who group one from the current 8,000 patients we're treating to something like 16,000 patients that we expect to help by 2025. now i mentioned that our total goal is to help 25,000 patients with pulmonary hypertension by the year 2025. and the second half of that, achieving that 25/25 goal comes from penetration of who group three by tyvaso for our fda approval that we achieved just last month. now within who group 3, there are something between 30,000 and 40,000 patients with pulmonary hypertension. we are told to actually by prescribers that the actual number is quite a bit larger than even 40,000. it's somewhat similar to the situation with who group 1. you'll see various accounts that there are 40,000 patients, 50,000 patients.
we are told by prescribers that actually, there are quite a much larger number of patients with who group one pulmonary hypertension. and it is a difficult disease to really quantify and identify because it's a disease that is identified by excluding numerous other conditions whose symptom limit those of group one pulmonary hypertension. anyway, back to the group three pulmonary hypertension, there, whether the number is 30,000, 40,000 or larger, we are the only drug now approved for this ipf market segment of ipf patients with pulmonary hypertension. and this portion of patients, also called ild-ph patients, are actually the ones who have the most rapid decline. in other words, if you have the interstitial lung disease and you have pulmonary hypertension, the statistics show that your decline to death is much more rapid than the patients with interstitial lung disease that do not have pulmonary hypertension.
so given that there are well over 30,000 patients who need treatment and that our goal by 2025 is to capture at least 9,000 of those patients, i think it's a very achievable goal in terms of comparison to the capturable market size. so in addition to the 25/25 goals that we are highly focused at and is our number one quantitative priority, let me also mention a few of what i would kind of call free options in our pipeline. and by free options, i mean, we are doing these things. i believe they have a very high probability of success because they are in either late phase clinical trials, phase iii clinical trials, where statistically the odds of success are quite high or they are developments that we would call bio comparable therapeutic, meaning that they are comparable to things that are already approved by the fda. so let's talk about some of these ""free options"" in our pipeline. first of all, there is a phase iii study of tyvaso in copd-associated pulmonary hypertension.
the name of this phase iii trial was called our perfect study, and it should complete its enrollment by the end of next year. second, we have a phase iii trial of a drug called ralinepag in group one pulmonary hypertension. this study is also doing very well, and i think it should probably complete its enrollment also by the end of next year. in fact, it's just under 1/3 enrolled at this point in time in the lead of the ralinepag trials called the outcome -- advance outcomes trial. next up, we have yet another phase iii trial. this one of tyvaso in interstitial -- i'm sorry, in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, ipf, that should be completed in this enrollment or i would say the first half of '23. this is very interesting for united therapeutics because it is actually the first time that we have developed non-oncologic treatment outside of around having anything to do with pulmonary hypertension and yet using a drug, tyvaso, which has just been approved in an adjacent therapeutic class to the target of this trial.
so let me unpack that for a moment. the approval that we just have in an adjacent therapeutic class is the approval the fda granted us just this month based on our increased trials, which was in patients with pulmonary fibrosis as well as pulmonary hypertension. so they had kind of that double strike, and that's what i mean by an adjacent therapeutic class to pulmonary fibrosis without pulmonary hypertension. and in that adjacent therapeutic class, we were able to show improvement in the key therapeutic clinical markers of pulmonary fibrosis. that key indication is called forced vital capacity or just for short fvc. and we're showed -- be able to -- we were able to show improvement in that, that was shown and talked about also in our new england journal of medicine publication on the trial. and so now we're approved in the adjacent class. so we are now taking that same drug that's proven safe and effective in ipf with pulmonary hypertension and developing it in ipf without pulmonary hypertension. so again, i think the odds are very strong in our success, and it's a well-designed study.
by the way, we call that study, the teton study since the head of our clinical and product development program for the pulmonary fibrosis activity, dr. leigh peterson, hails from the grand teton state of wyoming. third, we have another phase iii study, a pivotal study, a registration study of our enos gene therapy treatment for pulmonary hypertension. and this one should also complete its enrollment by the end of next year. and then last but not least at all, in fact, in many ways, close to first, is our bio comparable once-daily form of orenitram and our bio comparable less painful forms of remodulin, both of which should be launched by the key quantitative date of 2025. so to wrap up from this high-level overview, we've got an awful lot in the market. it's a market which is very capturable by us and much larger than the number of patients we're currently helping plus a lot of new products to bring to the market. so i think if i was a parent of a patient with pulmonary hypertension, as i am, and there are tens of thousands of others -- hundreds of thousands of others throughout the world, on this world ph day, i would be very thankful and very hopeful about a bright and optimistic future.
with that set of introductory remarks, operator, if you could be so kind to open the lines, and i'll be happy to field the questions.

operator
thank you. [operator instructions] and your first question is from the line of jessica fye with j.p. morgan.
jessica fye -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
hey. nice quarter this morning. you guys said you're well on your way to the goal of doubling the number of patients on tyvaso but also that the path may not be linear. so can you share your latest thinking on the shape of the curve to get to that year-end '22 goal? and related to that, you also mentioned that ordering patterns can factor into revenue, not perfectly aligning with patient demand. so how should we think about that dynamic going forward, say, in the back half of the year? thank you.
martine rothblatt -- founder chairperson, chief executive officer, and director
thanks, jess. nice to hear your voice this morning. both of those questions seem to be squarely in mike's bailiwick.
michael benkowitz -- president and chief operating officer
sure. i think on the first part of the question around the shape of the curve, i think we're still trying to get better visibility into what that looks like. and i think the question that we're still trying to get some insight into is the patients that are residing with the ph-ild treaters and how quickly those patients are getting referred -- either getting referred over to pah clinic or these ph-ild treaters are starting to activate and treat patients on their own. so that -- we're still getting the insights on that, we don't have perfect clarity. i think -- i'm hoping through q3 into q4, we'll get a better sense of that. so that's still why i'm still thinking that it's maybe not going to necessarily be a linear and maybe potentially more hockey stick-ish as we get into 2022. but i think we'll have a little bit better visibility on that as we get into -- later into the second half of the year.
on the ordering patterns, i mean it's -- this is always an issue that we've always had. the specialty pharmacies have days on inventory requirements, pre-order contracts that they have to keep on hand. they have an algorithm they look at that takes into account historical shipment data, as well as prospective estimated demand. and with that, we've got to agree upon level of ordering that has to happen. and so, beyond that, it's really just sort of kind of normal course of business. and so as we start to kind of see referrals to start on the tyvaso side of things pick up, i would expect the orders to pick up as we go along.
martine rothblatt -- founder chairperson, chief executive officer, and director
perfect. thanks so much, mike. next question, please?
operator
your next question is from the line of hartaj singh with oppenheimer and company.
martine rothblatt -- founder chairperson, chief executive officer, and director
hi, hartaj. good morning.
hartaj singh -- oppenheimer & co. -- analyst
hey, good morning, martine. pleasure to hear your voice. thank you for the question, and a nice quarter. the question i had was on copd and ipf. martine, you pointed those out at the beginning in terms of the prepared script. could you just talk a little bit about the scientific rationale behind tyvaso inhale for copd and ipf? and then, specifically, when do you expect the readouts for both patient enrollment to complete and readouts to happen for copd and ipf? thank you.
martine rothblatt -- founder chairperson, chief executive officer, and director
yeah, great question, hartaj. i'll speak for a moment or two about the group 3 copd pulmonary hypertension and let -- while i'm doing that, dr. peterson, if you could queue up your thoughts on the scientific rationale in ipf, which is unique in the sense that it has nothing to do with pulmonary hypertension at all. and dr. peterson has studied that scientific rationale quite a bit.
so with regard to the copd, we're not treating the copd per se, but we're treating only the pulmonary hypertension that those patients have, who also have copd. we're doing this based on previous work from dr. waxman and others that showed that when group 3 patients with copd were treated off label with tyvaso, they had dramatically improved six-minute walk scores, hartaj. and it was based on that data that we were able to size our perfect study. it's about roughly 100 patients, a bit more than 100 patients and we felt very confident with that sizing because of the very dramatic data that had could come out earlier. so it is the mechanism of action is the same as it would be for treating any other type of pulmonary hypertension.
we've got the ability of treprostinil to, for example, dilate the smooth muscles in the pulmonary arteries, which are causing the vessel constriction. and we also have the ability of tyvaso inhale to reduce the platelet aggregation in those tiny arterials, which also contribute to ultimately a after-load in the right heart and actually spells a worse morbidity and mortality picture for the copd patients who have pulmonary hypertension than for those who don't. there are a lot of patients, hartaj, with the copd form of pulmonary hypertension, in fact, over 100,000 in the u.s. alone. so there is a real great opportunity for us to do good there and i think the scientific rationale, the empirical data upon which we sized and based the perfect study was very solid and we have high expectations for success. dr. peterson, would you like to talk about the scientific rationale in pulmonary fibrosis because that's something really very new?
leigh peterson -- vice president, product development
yeah. yeah, sure. thanks, martine. and thanks for the question. so really what came -- one of the things that came out of the increase study, in addition to meeting our primary endpoints and everything that's been published so far, including new england journal, is that we published a paper in the lancet recently and it describes the surprise, sort of, that we saw which was that we saw an improvement in fvc which is forced vital capacity. and this indicated that tyvaso might not only work on the pulmonary hypertension component of the disease, but it might actually work on the fibrotic disease in patients with ph-ild. and that's actually supported by -- so we saw this clinically, and that's actually supported by non-clinical evidence where there's been several studies that have shown us the anti-fibrotic effect of treprostinil. so that together made us design and think about what's going on and think that possibly this could also work in patients with ipf without pulmonary hypertension; so again evidenced in increase and evidenced in non-clinical studies, both in-vitro and in-vivo.
and just to reiterate what martine just said, so for ph-ild and ph-copd, obviously, as you mentioned, there is a common pathogenesis for the ph component, but, in fact, due to these other effects of treprostinil; treprostinil binds multiple receptors on multiple cell types and has multiple mechanisms of actions, there are additional actions such as the fibrosis that can work specifically in patients with fibrotic lung disease and there is even a bronchodilation effect that could also help the patients with obstructive lung conditions such as copd.
martine rothblatt -- founder chairperson, chief executive officer, and director
perfect. thanks so much, dr. peterson. operator, next question, please?
operator
your next question is from the line of joseph thome with cowen and company.
joseph thome -- cowen and company -- analyst
hi, there. good morning and thank you for taking my question and congratulations on great progress. maybe one more just a little bit on the reimbursement environment for ph-ild, if you can comment a little bit more on that. how many, kind of, patients that if they're prescribed the therapy, are they able to actually get tyvaso right now for the most part? and, obviously, we know this is essentially the first therapy probably approved in this indication, are you seeing any sort of considerations for prior therapies that patients need to have seen or specific levels of disease burden?
martine rothblatt -- founder chairperson, chief executive officer, and director
yeah, thanks for the question. it's -- all of our strategic operations and managed markets activities report in to mike. so, mike, if you could provide some insight on that question?
michael benkowitz -- president and chief operating officer
sure. joe, so in terms of disease severity or prior therapies, we're not seeing any requirements there as i think you know this is really the first and only treatment that's on the market to treat the pulmonary hypertension associated with the ild. the other drugs are treating current -- they're treating underlying lung disease. so we're not seeing any issues there. i would say on the kind of the private payor side of things, those prescriptions that are coming in for pah -ild patients are going through with little to no issue.
and then on the -- like i said, on the cms side, we're waiting for the cms approval which -- that process is ongoing. they've accepted our application. they're just going through their, like i said, their policies and procedures and we are optimistic and hopeful that that's coming shortly. so, those patients, like i said, are eligible to apply for our patient assistance program and then if they're eligible, they can come in and start and then once we have cms approval, presumably, they could become commercial patient.
martine rothblatt -- founder chairperson, chief executive officer, and director
perfect. thanks so much, mike. operator, next question, please.?
operator
your next question is from the line of eun yang of jefferies.
eun yang -- jefferies -- analyst
thank you. great quarter, congrats. recently j&j received approval of intravenous uptravi. so i want to ask you, what do you -- how do you see this might or might not impact your remodulin franchise? thank you.
martine rothblatt -- founder chairperson, chief executive officer, and director
thanks for the question, eun, nice to hear your voice this morning and thanks for the congratulations. we, at present, really we have no idea to comment about what kind of impacts intravenous uptravi might have. we do feel that the intravenous route is important, although the same amount of efficacy can be achieved with the subcutaneous route and that's, of course, ordinarily much easier on the patient, and certainly much easier on their ongoing lifestyle. so that's really the question to be assessed there.
in terms of over the longer term, i think what mike was referring to and i was referring to earlier, is that the patients tend to have the best experience, according to these recent reports from both europe and japan, when they are on the parenteral route for a relatively short period of time in order to aggressively reduce their pressures down below 40 millimeters of mercury and relieve the after-load on the right heart. so whatever goes on there is, i would say, not part of the biggest picture of pulmonary hypertension because the total amount of time on the parenteral therapy is relatively short, compared to the total amount of time on orenitram or another oral therapy. so, hopefully, that gives you a little bit of insight into what might be going on in the parenteral optionality space.
next question, please?
operator
your next question is from the line of terence flynn with goldman sachs.
terence flynn -- goldman sachs -- analyst
hi, thanks so much for taking the question. i was just wondering if you could comment at all about the breadth of prescribing you're seeing [technical issues] ild side. are you seeing a mix of both new prescribers or existing prescribers? and then the second part of the question is just how should we think about the treatment duration for the ph-ild setting relative to pah for tyvaso? thanks so much.
martine rothblatt -- founder chairperson, chief executive officer, and director
yeah, great question. mike, would you like to handle that one?
michael benkowitz -- president and chief operating officer
sure. on the prescribing breadth, i mean, as it stands right now, and not surprising, and i think this got a little bit i think into jess' question around whether the uptake is linear or not. it's more heavily weighted to -- so the answer is we're getting both pah and ph- ild i would say. as we sit here today, it's more constant, the weight is more toward the pah side, but we fully expect that as the launch evolves, as we continue to engage with physicians that, that will start to even out and maybe even potentially shift to ph- ild. i think it's really going to depend on the center where the physicians are, do they have a ph clinic, and do those ph -ild physicians want to actually treat versus refer. from our standpoint, we don't really care who treats, we do want to make sure that those patients are getting caught earlier in their disease because we think that -- and this gets into the second part of your question, we think that the earlier they start on tyvaso, the more and the longer that they can benefit.
and so from a timing standpoint, in terms of duration of therapy, it's really going to -- i think it'd be a question of where they are in their disease progression and what's sort of the dominant part of the disease, is it p-ild or is it the pulmonary hypertension. and so if you've got really severe ild, less on the ph, if they go on tyvaso, i think those patients probably won't be on as long versus patients that are -- it's really more ph less on the ild, where i think we would expect to see duration of treatment along the lines of what we see, if not longer, in pah.
martine rothblatt -- founder chairperson, chief executive officer, and director
perfect. thanks so much, mike, excellent response and very comprehensive. so, operator, we've got time for just one more question.
operator
your final question is from the line of geoff meacham, bank of america.
jason -- bank of america -- analyst
good morning, this is jason on for geoff. thanks so much for taking our question and congratulations on the quarter. just thinking ahead in terms of the second half of the year, i know you were projecting growth, but there were some obvious -- some one-time benefits including unituxin, the japanese order and ous remodulin and just wanted to get your sense of how confident you are in kind of moving forward on the trajectory for the second half of the year. thanks so much.
martine rothblatt -- founder chairperson, chief executive officer, and director
okay. geoff, so basically you're just asking what we expect to see forth from here toward the end of the year?
jason -- bank of america -- analyst
well, sure. i was looking at the 10-q, the continued revenue growth in the second half of 2021 compared to 2020, given the one-time benefits of this quarter, the confidence in the growth trajectory of the second half of 2021.
martine rothblatt -- founder chairperson, chief executive officer, and director
yeah, i don't think -- i wouldn't really buy into the hypothesis about huge amount of one-time growth benefits this quarter. i know mike referred to the warehousing of the remodulin patients. but i wouldn't, like, translate that into being a one-time benefit because those patients have to book their appointments with the doctors and come in and there's going to be a continual upward swell coming from patients who were pushed back due to covid. so i don't see this as a one-time event. i really see it more as what mike has been talking about and we've been talking about, that we're building steadily toward our goals of doubling the number of tyvaso patients by the end of next year and having 25,000 patients by the end of 2025.
and any given quarter, there is, of course, always ups and downs, but what you're seeing, i think in this quarter is the new revenue track for united therapeutics going forward; a revenue track, which is consistent with doubling the number of tyvaso patients by the end of next year and a revenue track that's consistent with having 25,000 patients by the end of 2025.
jason -- bank of america -- analyst
got you. thanks so much for the color.
martine rothblatt -- founder chairperson, chief executive officer, and director
excellent. mike, did you want to add something about unituxin on that last question?
michael benkowitz -- president and chief operating officer
yeah, i would just say -- i would just add maybe two granular point. so the unituxin i wouldn't look as necessarily being a one-time event as martine mentioned. the larger japan -- when i referenced the larger order from japan, that really was a function of the fact that we have larger than what we were forecasting because we weren't expecting the broader label than what we got. so now that we have the broader label, i think the orders that we expect from japan would be on par with what we saw in this quarter over time. i would also say, on the international side, we always see some lumpiness there, part of what we saw last year with the generic entrant into europe was ferrer, our partner, having to draw down their inventory. so that's been drawn down and i think we'll still see lumpy orders internationally, but over the course of the year, i think that will level out.
martine rothblatt -- founder chairperson, chief executive officer, and director
exactly, exactly, mike, totally agree. operator, you can please now wrap up and we'd like to thank everybody for participating in our second quarter earnings call. it's been an extremely exciting quarter with all of the top level results that mike reported on, best in numerous different categories, solidly on track for our announced goals and a very exciting pipeline to continue propelling our growth through the balance of the 2020s. operator, you can now wrap up.

now, i'll turn the webcast over to dr. rothblatt for a review of our second quarter 2021 financial results and business activities of united therapeutics. martine?
martine rothblatt -- founder chairperson, chief executive officer, and director
thanks, dewey. good morning everyone and thank you for joining us on our quarterly earnings call. we have a lot of good news to share today, so it's going to be a very fun call. you've read in the press release the outstanding financial results and, in a moment, i'm going to turn the mic over to mike benkowitz, who will speak a little bit more about the commercial success that we're experiencing.
i'd like to talk a little bit about our pipeline, which is quite robust and doing very well. we have a number of studies in phase 3. i'd like to highlight a few of them. two of our studies are outside of group 1 pah, the perfect study in copd, specifically a form of copd that's associated with pulmonary hypertension, and another phase 3 study in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis also known as ipf. that study is called the teton study within united therapeutics. in addition to those phase 3 studies, we have additional phase 3 studies within group 1 pulmonary hypertension. two of those phase 3 studies are using our once-a-day drug called ralinepag and both of those studies are growing quite nicely.
in addition, we have a lot of next-generation treprostinil development activity that will be in -- some of it's in phase 1 and then moving into bioequivalence testing over the next year or two. so that will provide an ongoing pipeline of next-generation treprostinil products for group 1 and possibly also group 3 pulmonary hypertension.
looking a little bit at the longer term, we're working on cures for pulmonary hypertension, either through gene therapy, and we do have a gene therapy trial, also in phase 3, or actually manufactured lungs; lungs that are manufactured in our laboratories and then transplanted into patients to completely cure, either their pulmonary hypertension, pulmonary fibrosis or many other end-stage lung diseases.
in the meantime, on the clinical side, there is increasing evidence that current medicines, dosed appropriately, may, in fact, convert pulmonary hypertension into a lifelong manageable condition. and a lot of these data are coming from europe and japan. i think you're going to soon see more reports from the united states, but it's really startling to see reports with patients -- more than 90% of the patients in the cohort living 20 years, over 10 years with current medications but dosed differently than kind of the traditional dosing; dosing or dosed according to a very specific protocol. so that's tremendously exciting for us in the pulmonary hypertension field to be able to convert pulmonary hypertension into a lifelong manageable condition. and, indeed, the goal of our next-generation treprostinil products is to make these kind of lifelong manageable protocols as easy as possible for the patients because they'll be on them for, literally, decades.
well, with that introduction to our pipeline and clinical development activities, i'd like to pass the microphone over to mike benkowitz to talk about the commercial operations. mike?
michael benkowitz -- president and chief operating officer
thanks, martine, and good morning everyone. the second quarter was a very exciting quarter for united therapeutics on the commercial front as we began our push into new rare lung disease indications outside of pulmonary arterial hypertension. i'm pleased to report that we achieved several milestones in the second quarter at a treprostinil franchise level.
first, we ended the second quarter with a record number of u.s. patients on our treprostinil therapies, marking the fourth consecutive quarter of total treprostinil patient growth. second, we achieved an all-time high in two of our key underlying u.s. demand metrics: total treprostinil prescriptions; and total treprostinil actual patient starts. finally, while we always caution that revenues don't necessarily reflect underlying demand for our products to the ordering patterns of our specialty pharmacy and distribution partners, we're excited to have achieved record treprostinil revenue in the quarter.
now, i'd like to spend a few minutes talking about individual product performance. of course, we're very excited to have launched tyvaso at the pulmonary hypertension associated with interstitial lung disease at the beginning of the second quarter. earlier this year, we established a goal to double the number of patients on tyvaso by the end of next year, assuming no covid-related impact to hcp access and patient initiation of therapy and, importantly, recognizing that the path to doubling may not be linear. in the first quarter of the launch, we have established strong momentum and as of the end of q2, we're already more than one-sixth of the way to our goal of doubling the number of patients on tyvaso through the ph-ild label expansion. we're also very encouraged by the prescription and start patterns in q2, which are double or more than double the quarterly referral and start levels in 2020.
on the reimbursement front, we continue to work with cms to update their policy to cover tyvaso for the treatment of ph-ild. we remain confident that this update will happen, but cannot predict its timing due to the government's processes and procedures. in the meantime, medicare/medicaid patients can apply and have been applying to our patient assistance program. if they meet our patient assistance program eligibility criteria, they can initiate tyvaso therapy immediately. once cms updates their coverage policy, medicare/medicaid patients will be able to start on commercial drug.
moving on to remodulin. we were very pleased to see, in q2, the highest number of prescriptions and starts for remodulin in the past 12 years. we believe there are several factors contributing to this. first, as we mentioned last year, remodulin therapy initiation was most impacted by the pandemic for a period of time as many patients were unable to come into the hospital to start on remodulin. we believe this created a so-called warehousing of patients that started to open up in q3 of last year and continued into q2. in addition, there is renewed appreciation of the clinical benefits of remodulin for pah patients. for example, the ability to move patients to low-risk status and then potentially transition to oral prostacyclin such as orenitram and, as martine mentioned, recently published retrospective data showing that use of remodulin can reduce impact or mean pulmonary arterial pressure and if impact is reduced below 40 millimeters of mercury, there can be a dramatic improvement in long-term survival.
the competitive landscape did change in the second quarter for remodulin as a generic form of subcutaneous treprostinil became available. at this point, the subcu generic launch look very similar to the iv generic launch we saw in 2019. there has been an initial bolus of subcu remodulin patients, similar in quantity to what we saw with iv, in primarily these dual eligible medicare/medicaid patients that have been force-switched to generic treprostinil. however, the base of patients we have now is higher than when iv generic launched. we still see that pah staffs prefer branded remodulin over the generic alternatives when they are filling out their prescriptions and we have yet to see widespread payor management of these patients.
it's also important to note some of the potential limitations around generic subcu availability. it's our understanding that this product is only being offered by one of the specialty pharmacies that distribute pah medicines. it's also our understanding that the subcu pumps that are currently being used with generic treprostinil are limited in supply. meanwhile, we have invested in the supply of pumps and disposables, including the new remunity pump and believe that we're well-positioned to serve remodulin patients for the long term.
orenitram also had a strong quarter, posting new prescriptions and starts in the second quarter that were one of the highest since the product's launch, and total patients on therapy that were the highest ever. i've mentioned in previous calls and investor conferences that while we saw an uptick on orenitram following the freedom-ev label expansion, the launch trajectory was blunted by covid. in the second quarter of this year, we were able to have consistently more robust interactions with prescribers about freedom-ev and the total orenitram value proposition, and we believe that translated into the underlying demand performance we're seeing. if we can maintain this momentum going forward, we expect this to show up on the revenue line in subsequent quarters as patients titrate to an efficacious dose and ordering by specialty pharmacies, which often lags underlying demand, catches up.
with respect to unituxin, we are extremely pleased to see second quarter demand continue at a similar pace to the first quarter. we have limited visibility into how the drug is being used, but we know use has increased in the u.s. moreover, unituxin was approved in japan in the second quarter with an indication that's actually broader than the u.s. label. consequently, our japanese distribution partner, ohara, ordered a larger-than-expected amount of unituxin in the quarter.
finally, we're excited about our pending application at fda for tyvaso dpi. we're pleased that the pai, a general facility inspection, at our partner mannkind's danbury, connecticut facility has commenced as scheduled and is ongoing. our pdufa action date is in october of this year and we're working hard to build launch quantities and mobilizing our commercial teams to support the launch soon after approval.
so there's a lot of positive things happening on the commercial front. we remain focused on executing against our plans through the second half of the year, and, importantly, making progress toward our near-term goal of doubling the number of patients on tyvaso by the end of 2022.
with that, martine, i'll turn the call back over to you.
martine rothblatt -- founder chairperson, chief executive officer, and director
thanks so much, mike, great review. so, operator, we can now open up the lines for any questions. and whatever questions come in, i'll direct them either to james, our cfo; to mike, our president; or any questions of a scientific, medical, technical nature to dr. peterson. operator?
",2021-Q2,UTHR
,,,,":
operator
[operator instructions] we'll go first to joseph thome at cowen and company.
joseph thome -- cowen & company -- analyst
good morning. thank you for taking my question and congrats on the progress. just on the continued growth for tyvaso, one of the points mentioned was increasing the number of physicians that are predominantly ild writers. can you just dive a little bit more into how this will happen? are you experiencing any consideration for this physician population thus far that you're working through?
martine rothblatt -- founder, chairman & chief executive officer
thanks for the question, joe. and mike, would you be able to answer that question?
michael benkowitz -- president & chief operating officer
sure. thanks, joe. yes, no concerns thus far. i think it's just taking some time to bring these treaters online. so keep in mind that the diagnosis process for these physicians is very different than i think what they're used to. they have to screen the patients. they have to do echocardiograms, those things i think they're accustomed to doing. the right heart cath is new to them. i wouldn't say it's a barrier, i just think it tends to slow things down. so a couple of things are happening there. in some cases, referring these patients to pah clinics even though they have said over the long term, they intend to treat these patients. they are in some -- in a lot of cases, these patients are -- reside with physicians and community practices and so they don't have a right heart cath readily accessible. so they're having to figure out where to send these patients to get a right heart cath. i think the third thing to keep in mind is a lot of these physicians are the same physicians that are also on the front line of treating covid patients.
and then finally, as i mentioned in my opening remarks, i do think that there is a little bit of waiting for cms coverage before really kind of diving in and digging in and starting to write for tyvaso. so we are adding new prescribers. it's not like we're not adding. they're starting to come on online. i think we probably would have expected that it would have been a little bit faster than what we're seeing but they are coming in and i think that will continue to come as we move into next year.
martine rothblatt -- founder, chairman & chief executive officer
fantastic, mike. thanks so much for that answer. and operator, you can now call up the next questioner.
operator
we'll go next to jessica fye with jpmorgan.
jessica fye -- jpmorgan -- analyst
hey guys, good morning. thanks for taking my question. can you talk about how many of the now, i guess, 1,000 ph-ild patients you've added since the launch. how many of those are on medicare and basically getting free drug until that coverage is finalized?
martine rothblatt -- founder, chairman & chief executive officer
yes. it's good to hear you this morning, jessica. mike, i think that question would also be in your bailiwick.
michael benkowitz -- president & chief operating officer
sure. so, thanks, jess. so even prior to ph-ild, i mean we've always had a patient assistance program that has, let's say, some small percentage of patients in it so receiving free drug. i think with the ph-ild launch and not having the cms covered, we have seen that tick up i would say in the grand scheme of things, it's still a relatively small percentage. so you've gone from like a small percentage that's effectively doubled but it's still -- you're talking about low single digit -- or sorry, low double-digit percentages of patients that are in the patient assistance program right now. as i said, i think -- and we continue to kind of really hear this anecdotally in talking with physicians, i think there is this sort of warehousing effect that's going on, particularly, like i said, with the ild treaters where i think they're waiting for the cms coverage to go through the process of writing the referral because even if you're going through the patient assistance program, there is still a process that you have to go through to see if the patient is eligible and apply and our sense is that a lot of these physicians don't want to have to go through that process twice and like i said, are waiting until we get the cms coverage.
martine rothblatt -- founder, chairman & chief executive officer
super, mike, thanks so much for that answer and jess, for your question. operator, who would be the next analyst on the call?
operator
next, we have hartaj singh with oppenheimer.
hartaj singh -- oppenheimer & co. -- analyst
great. thank you for the question today and the really nice update. just a question on -- this is the first time i've heard you provide actual number of patients ex-u.s. martine, mike, the 1,000, you also are now starting a phase iii study with teton ex-u.s. so have there been any thoughts on kind of the use of business model ex-u.s. and how interesting that market is to you?
martine rothblatt -- founder, chairman & chief executive officer
yes. thanks a lot for the question, hartaj and good hearing your voice this morning. i think we are more interested in the ex-u.s. opportunity for ipf and possibly as well for ild. there seems to be a much greater unmet medical need, especially with regard to ipf, where we believe we can have a disease-modifying agent. so we definitely are opening up our bandwidth, if you will, to look at more activities ex-u.s. we also have a terrific partner in europe, grupo ferrer which we've been working with and other partners in other parts of the world. so your intuition, hartaj as always, is right on target and we are ramping up activities outside the u.s. thanks.
operator, you can bring on the next analyst.
operator
we'll go to eun yang with jefferies.
eun yang -- jefferies -- analyst
thank you. a quick question on tyvaso dpi, so when you address the single deficiency that was identified in the complete response letter. would that be the resubmission that we classified as a class 1 or class 2?
martine rothblatt -- founder, chairman & chief executive officer
yes. eun, nice to hear you this morning and very, very interesting question. fortunately, we have dr. peterson on the call and she is our expert in matters that kind of transcend scientific and regulatory affairs. so dr. peterson, could you provide some insight?
leigh peterson -- vice president of product development
yes. so basically, we do have some meetings that we will be having with fda to address your specific question on the resubmission and the time line. but again, we're very confident that we will get approval by the summer of '22 or earlier to address, again, the single deficiency.
martine rothblatt -- founder, chairman & chief executive officer
thanks so much, leigh. well, that seems to be the end of the q&a questions. and once again i'd like to say that it's just super, super, exciting for me as a person who likes to sort of set goals that set everybody up for winning and then see such really strong progress toward those goals. for example, it was all plus or minus like a year ago that mike and i set up these goals of doubling the number of tyvaso patients by the end of '22, 25,000 treprostinil patients by the end of '25 and as you heard from the numbers we shared today, we're making amazing progress on both of those goals with the double-digit growth in revenues and obviously, on patient count as well and now 40% of the way already to the 2025 goal. so it's just -- it's really, really gratifying for me as ceo to see our company delivering so strongly on the forecast that we had made. thanks again to everybody joining us this morning. i believe mike will be speaking at credit suisse very shortly. so feel free to attend that conference and learn more. operator, you can now wrap up the call.

now, i'll turn the call over to dr. rothblatt for an overview of the third quarter 2021 financial results and business activities of united therapeutics. dr. rothblatt?
martine rothblatt -- founder, chairman & chief executive officer
thank you very much, dewey. good morning, everyone and welcome to our third quarter 2021 financial results call. we've had an absolutely fantastic quarter and i really have only great news to share with you this morning. for example, we have experienced double-digit growth in revenues, double-digit growth in non-gaap earnings. within our revenues, we've experienced double-digit growth in tyvaso, double-digit growth in orenitram, double-digit growth in unituxin. it's just amazing all the way across the board, we've had a fantastic quarter. in fact, in no product category have sales decreased from last year. so like i said, all good news to date.
in addition to these operating results, we also are making really great progress with all of our phase iii clinical trials. we have a number of phase iii clinical trials going on. we've got in the area of pulmonary hypertension, our gene therapy trial called sapphire. we also have our ralinepag two trials, all those in pulmonary hypertension. in pulmonary fibrosis, we have two phase iii trials. we call them teton 1 and teton 2. and in copd, at least a type of copd associated with pulmonary hypertension. we have another phase iii clinical trial going on called perfect. we also are just now wrapping up a phase iii trial in our organ transplantation area dealing with ex-vivo lung perfusion. so really, just huge amount of pipeline activity going on. in addition to all of that, we have some very exciting earlier-stage activity, where we are developing next-generation forms of our parenteral, inhaled and oral products. so all the way across the board. the one which we expect to launch the soonest will be the next-generation product for our inhaled product, that's our dry powder inhaler.
we just recently launched our next-generation product for remodulin which is remunity and in our pipeline, we have even next-generation improvements on that product. and we are working on our next-generation better-dosing product for our orenitram po. and then following that, as noted earlier, we expect ralinepag to make a huge difference in the oral treatment of pulmonary hypertension. so it's kind of like a best case situation here at united therapeutics. we love what we're doing. we love that we're doing it all so well.
and on that note, let me turn the podium over to our president and chief operating officer; mike benkowitz, who is responsible for so much of this great news.

thanks, martine and good morning, everyone. as martine said, we're very pleased to have posted a strong third quarter highlighted by year-over-year double-digit growth for total revenue, treprostinil revenue and three of our products, tyvaso, orenitram and unituxin. at the same time, we continue to progress toward our 25x25 goal which is to reach 25,000 patients with our therapies by the end of 2025. at the end of the third quarter, we had approximately 9,000 patients on our treprostinil products in the u.s. which when coupled with the approximately 1,000 patients on our treprostinil products outside the u.s., puts us at about 10,000 patients toward our 25,000-patient goal. this quarter, i'd like to dive into the underlying performance of our three treprostinil products, tyvaso, remodulin and orenitram.
so i'll begin with tyvaso. earlier this year, in anticipation of the ph-ild approval that we ultimately received last april, we established a goal to double the number of patients on tyvaso from 3,000 to 6,000 by the end of next year. this assumes no covid-related impact to healthcare practitioner access and a patient initiation of therapy and importantly, recognizes that the path to doubling may not be linear. the third quarter was our second quarter of the ph-ild launch and we're very pleased with the progress thus far.
we continued growing the number of tyvaso-active patients during the quarter, ending with approximately 4,000 patients on tyvaso putting us 1/3 of the way toward our goal of doubling the number of patients on tyvaso by the end of 2022. i also want to mention that during the third quarter, the cms comment period regarding medicare reimbursement for tyvaso in ph-ild commenced and is open through mid-november. we can't predict the timing of a coverage decision. but in the meantime, federal healthcare patients can apply to our patient assistance program to access tyvaso prior to the coverage decision if they are eligible. once we obtain cms coverage, we will be able to transition these patients to a reimbursement model over time.
to that end, we anticipate three near-term drivers for tyvaso growth over the next few quarters. the first driver is the approval of medicare reimbursement of tyvaso and ph-ild. even though federal healthcare patients may be eligible for patient assistance, we are hearing through the channel that many physicians are waiting for cms coverage before prescribing tyvaso on their ph-ild patients. the second driver and somewhat related to the first is that we expect to see growth in prescriptions from ild treaters. to date, the vast majority of prescriptions have been from our historical pah writers. and then the final growth driver is the approval of tyvaso dpi which we expect no later than the summer of 2022.
moving on to remodulin, last quarter, we learned that a generic form of subcutaneous treprostinil became available. this launch so far has played out almost exactly like the iv generic launch we saw in 2019. there has been an initial bolus of subcu remodulin patients, similar in quantity to what we saw with iv and which are primarily these dual eligible medicare and medicaid patients that have been forced switch to generic treprostinil. since the generic subcu launch, generic transitions have tapered off to a negligible amount as we enter q4 and in fact, our new patient starts remain at or above our long-term trend levels and we are now adding back patients to our active patient census.
finally, i'll provide some color around orenitram. we've mentioned in previous calls and investor conferences that while we saw an uptick on orenitram following the freedom-ev label expansion, the launch trajectory was blunted by covid. in the second quarter of this year and continuing into the third quarter, we were able to have consistently more robust interactions with prescribers about the freedom-ev data. and we're receiving positive feedback from these physicians about the orenitram value proposition, especially regarding its efficacy. and this has translated into strong new patient start momentum over the last two quarters and the highest number of patients on orenitram as of the end of the third quarter.
so in conclusion, we're pleased with the progress we're making in the ongoing tyvaso launch in ph-ild and that we're on track to achieve 6,000 patients on tyvaso by the end of next year, the continued momentum around orenitram and appreciation of its value proposition and returning to remodulin patient growth.
and so with that, i'll turn the call back over to you, martine.
