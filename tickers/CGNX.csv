greetings, and welcome to cognex first quarter 2019 earnings conference call. (operator instructions) as a reminder, this conference is being recorded. it is now my pleasure to introduce your host, cognex' cfo, john curran. thank you. you may begin.
john j. curran -- senior vice president of finance and administration, treasurer and chief finance officer
thank you, and good evening everyone. i'm john curran, cognex' cfo, and i'd like to welcome you to our first quarter earnings conference call for 2019. with me on today's call are dr. bob shillman, cognex' chairman; and rob willett, cognex' president and ceo. please note that our earnings release and quarterly report on form 10-q are available on the cognex website at www.cognex.com. both contain highly detailed information about our financial results.
during the call, we may use a non-gaap financial measure if we believe it is useful to investors or if we believe it will help investors better understand our results or business trends. you can see a reconciliation of certain items from gaap to non-gaap in exhibit 2 of the earnings release. any forward-looking statements we made in the earnings release or any that we may make during this call are based upon information that we believe to be true as of today. things often change however, and actual results may differ materially from those projected or anticipated. you should refer to our sec filings including our most recent form 10-k for a detailed list of these risk factors.
with that, i will now turn the call over to dr. bob.
robert j. willett -- chief executive officer, president and executive director
thank you, dr. bob. good evening, everyone. as dr. bob said, revenue in q1 grew just 2% year-on-year due to market conditions that we discussed in our q4 call in february. lower spending by customers in china and in the automotive sector in the americas offset most of the strong growth that we achieved in logistics. given these conditions and the greater visibility we now have into consumer electronics, we expect our overall revenue will shrink slightly in 2019.
let's take a closer look at what's happening. in consumer electronics, we now expect customers to defer investments in automation and machine vision, particularly in smartphone manufacturing. as a result, we expect that revenue from consumer electronics will decline by approximately 1/3 in 2019, marking the second consecutive down year for this major piece of our business.
while there's inherent volatility in consumer electronics as we witnessed over the past 3 years, we remain confident that we are not losing share in this market and that cognex machine vision is a key element of manufacturers' long-term plans, both to bring new products to market and to realize productivity and quality gains. considering the significant decline expected for consumer electronics, we believe that automotive will be our largest end market in 2019.
however, we are anticipating challenges in the automotive market as well. after 3 years of strong growth, revenue from automotive is relatively flat due to lower sales in china and the americas. manufacturers are scaling back and delaying large automation projects in responses to change in consumer purchases, declining unit sales and evolving product road maps.
on the positive side, there are trends shaping automotive that will benefit cognex over the long term, including a ramp-up in electric vehicle production by mainstream automakers, the relocation of manufacturing facilities and the increased use of sophisticated electronics in automobiles, all of which will require more machine vision and barcode reading.
turning to logistics. i'm pleased to report continued strong growth year-on-year in q1 driven by a broad base of customers that includes many well-known e-retail and retail names. as the e-commerce sector grows, forward-thinking customers are recognizing the need for automation to improve the speed and accuracy of delivery, and they're turning to cognex vision and barcode reading as key enabling technologies in their distribution centers. many of the other industries we serve also continued to grow strongly as our products become easy to use and our sales team reaches more customers.
cognex has always viewed market slowdowns as an opportunity to reallocate existing resources to high-potential areas of our business in order to take market share. our long-term approach includes developing technology to address fast-growing areas that can bring significant revenue over time, such as logistics, deep learning, 3d, mobile terminals and life sciences.
turning to new products. we recently introduced the dataman 370 series of fixed-mount barcode readers for general manufacturing and logistics customers. more accurate and twice as fast as competitive readers, the dataman 370 simultaneously reads different sized, challenging 1d and 2d codes even if the codes are positioned at varied angles and distances from the reader, such as on packages inside high-volume logistics scanning tunnels.
we also introduced several 3d products that outperform what's available today in the 3d vision market. dsmax is the world's fastest and highest resolution 3d displacement sensor ideal for precise measurement of fine details on very small parts, such as electronic components smaller than a dime. 3d-a5000 delivers highly accurate 3d point cloud images from over 1.5 million data points. and when combined with powerful cognex 3d vision tools, performs highly precise assembly verification, in-line measurement and robotics guidance in factories 10x faster than current methods.
marking our entry into 3d dimensioning, the 3d-a1000 was recently previewed at 2 major logistics trade shows where its precise measurement of boxes, poly bags and envelopes traveling at high speeds on conveyor systems generated substantial interest. advancing cognex' powerful 3d tool set is patmax 3d, a breakthrough part-locating vision tool for our entire 3d product range.
with that, i'll pass the microphone to john for financial details from the first quarter. as we announced earlier this month, john will be leaving cognex on may 3. i'd like to take this opportunity to thank john for his contributions as cognex' cfo these past 2 years especially for his work implementing our new erp system and the further development of our finance and administration organization. we wish him all the best.
john j. curran -- senior vice president of finance and administration, treasurer and chief finance officer
thank you, rob. it has been a rewarding experience to be a part of such an exciting and financially strong company and to help lay the foundation for its continued growth. i will miss working with such a talented and dedicated group of cognoids, and i wish everyone at cognex all the best.
turning now to details for the quarter. as dr. bob said, our q1 results were as we expected. revenue in q1 was $173.5 million, representing year-on-year growth of 5% when excluding fx. logistics continued to show strong growth, but as previously discussed, we experienced weakness broadly across greater china and in the automotive sector in the americas.
gross margin was 73% compared with 76% for q1 of '18 and 73% for q4 '18. the year-on-year decline was primarily due to the unfavorable absorption of manufacturing overhead costs. operating margin was 17% in q1 of '19 compared with 20% in q1 of '18. the dip in gross margin was the largest contributor to this decline. also, the 2% increase in operating expenses had a slight negative impact. we benefited from a $2.7 million discrete tax item from the exercise of stock options during the quarter. excluding all discrete tax items, earnings were $0.17 per share in q1 of '19 compared with $0.18 a share a year ago.
looking at revenue from a geographic perspective. overall market conditions in q1 were generally in line with our expectations. europe grew by low double digits year-on-year and delivered the largest contribution to growth both in absolute dollars and in percentage terms when excluding a 6-point negative impact from currency exchange rates. growth came from several industries and was led by logistics and consumer products. americas also grew by low double digits. growth was led by substantially higher revenue from logistics customers, which was partially offset by lower revenue from automotive as our customers are deferring spending.
in greater china, more so than anywhere else, we see customers deferring their capital spending plans. continued weakness across the region resulted in lower revenue year-on-year. the negative impact of currency exchange rates contributed 6 percentage points to the decline. revenue from other asia declined due to lower spending by consumer electronics and semiconductor capital equipment manufacturers. otherwise, underlying demand in the region remained solid.
looking at our balance sheet. cognex continues to have a strong cash position with $864 million in cash and investments and no debt. inventory decreased by $4 million or 5% from the end of 2018. lastly, we prospectively adopted a new lease accounting standard, which resulted in a $17 million balance sheet gross-up at the end of q1.
with that, i'll turn the call back over to rob.
robert j. willett -- chief executive officer, president and executive director
thank you, john. turning to guidance. revenue for the second quarter is expected to be between $190 million and $200 million. while this range represents an increase over q1 of '19, it is lower than q2 of '18 for the reasons we have discussed. furthermore, while it's not our practice to provide full year guidance, i will say that for all of 2019, we believe revenue will decline slightly year-on-year and be somewhere right between the levels we reported for 2017 and 2018.
we expect gross margin for q2 will be in the mid-70% range, in line with the 73% gross margin we reported for q1. operating expenses are expected to increase by low single digits on a sequential basis. the effective tax rate is expected to be 15% excluding discrete tax items.
with that, we will open the call to questions. operator, please go ahead.

(operator instructions) our first question is from joe ritchie with goldman sachs. please proceed.
joe ritchie -- goldman sachs -- analyst
hi. good afternoon, everyone.
robert j. willett -- chief executive officer, president and executive director
hey, joe.
joe ritchie -- goldman sachs -- analyst
so rob, maybe let's touch on china for a second. i saw in the q that china was down mid-teens in the quarter. it seems like machine to orders in electronics are kind of at all-time lows. auto production starting to look up a little bit. but in effect, you're basically calling weaker -- weakness throughout the rest of the year. are there any green shoots that you're seeing throughout your business? i know that you're expecting a little bit of a pickup in 2h. just any color around that would be helpful.
robert j. willett -- chief executive officer, president and executive director
so china has been a great growth market for cognex for many years, and we believe it will continue to be in the long term. but near term, as you rightly pointed out, it's broadly soft more so than anywhere else. and what we see is a lack of confidence, among other issues, is causing capital expenditures to be delayed. so to speak to your question specifically, i think if that confidence comes back suddenly or quickly, that's what is likely to change things around. and i would say china has a habit, in my experience, of turning around as a market quite quickly when it does turn, but that's not what we're assuming is going to happen currently. our largest end markets in china are electronics and automotive and both are notably softer.
i would say as we look forward, there's still just so much manual labor performing basic tasks that can be better performed by machines, and smaller chinese manufacturers are coming up the curve and the logistics infrastructure also is in stages of modernizing and investing. so i think all of those bode well for cognex in the longer term. the question is how quickly will it turn around and we've assumed in our words to you, not soon.
joe ritchie -- goldman sachs -- analyst
fair enough. and i guess one of the things that we've noticed in some of the trade shows we've been to, it seems like competition on the 3d vision and logistics products piece is increasing. now look, given the growth rate has been incredible for you guys over the last several years, i guess, are you seeing any of that increased competition? do you need to do anything additional from an investment perspective? i know you've launched new products recently, but maybe talk to us about how you're penetrating that market on a go-forward basis specifically as it relates to 3d vision.
robert j. willett -- chief executive officer, president and executive director
yes, so cognex has been in the 3d vision business now for a few years, and we see it as a very high-growth area for us. in previous years, i've talked about 3d vision being around 5% of our business with the potential to grow at 50% a year. i think in the long run, we still have that view. growth for 3d vision for us was stifled last year by consumer electronics, and i expect we'll see a similar dynamic this year based on the softness of that market. however, your question relates to logistics, and i think the potential for cognex 3d in logistics is very significant.
we -- most of our logistics business today is primarily in barcode reading. we're seeing it expand into vision more for various tasks like inspecting packages and looking for damaged packages or looking at numbers or letters on packages and symbols such as hazardous symbols on packages. so it's expanding into vision. and then now we're really starting to move into 3d vision and logistics, which is something we weren't really doing up until last year. and so there's potential for that to grow significantly.
a product we did preview at the 2 largest logistics trade shows for our industry this year, promat and logimat, was the 3d-a5000 and that's a 3d vision system which has superior technology over time of flight and laser-based dimensioning. so dimensioning is something that happens a lot in logistics increasingly where customers are more often being charged for the size of packages not just the weight. so this is a great growth market, and we have advantaged technology which gives a much cleaner image of what's being studied as it moves down a production line. it's also technology that's much easier to integrate and much easier to manage than laser and time of flight-based products. so we see that as, i think, shorter term perhaps during the second half and then on growth driver for us at 3d and logistics.
then there's another market and i think probably many of you on the call went to the trade show in chicago and you would have seen a lot of companies doing kind of robust vision-enabled tasks. we see a lot of companies spending a lot of money in that space, but we think the technology is still relatively in its infancy. and we have great technology in that space, but we still think it's some time before we see the kind of random bin picking replacing humans in logistics that i think is creating a lot of excitement today. so i think that market is still some way off. when it does come, i think we're very well positioned because we really are working with the leaders in this space, looking at what's going on. but we realize that i think a lot of money is going to get lost in that market for quite a long time before it finally turns into a profitable venture. so we're being thoughtful about how we're approaching it.
joe ritchie -- goldman sachs -- analyst
if i could just ask one quick clarification. you mentioned earlier that auto is going to be your largest end market this year from a revenue perspective. is logistics going to be as large, if not larger, than electronics?
robert j. willett -- chief executive officer, president and executive director
i don't think we're going to give specific input on that at this point, joe.
joe ritchie -- goldman sachs -- analyst
thank you.
operator
our next question is from josh pokrzywinski with morgan stanley. please proceed.
josh pokrzywinski -- morgan stanley -- analyst
just to maybe take the -- some of the near-term weakness in auto electronics a bit further, rob. i think over the last couple of years, clearly there's been a big accumulation of automation technologies in both of those industries particularly in china. i think if you were to look at robot installations over the past decade, they probably don't look too far below your own growth rates.
you mentioned that there's still a lot of runway and a lot of manual tasks that are being automated. but how far along do you think we are in kind of the penetration of automation into some of those markets? do you think we're halfway there, a quarter of the way there, 80%? i know it's kind of a tough question, but just trying to think of, coming off of a long period of growth now, how much of this is a deceleration that could stick with us for a while versus a reset year and back off to the races?
robert j. willett -- chief executive officer, president and executive director
okay. so i think how i approach that question as i think about it is what's the ultimate end point, and i think it's what i would call lights-out manufacturing, right? and where do we see the closest to that in automation today? possibly in semiconductor and perhaps some -- closer but no way near in automotive. other industries, i'd say, are so far away from full automation of their processes. i know it's certainly less than 25% penetrated as i look around the industries that we serve. and to give you an example, we talked about slowing in consumer electronics.
but if we want us to wonder the china market, which is perhaps the most difficult market today in terms of growth, the number of people that we see in manufacturing, literally millions of people assembling electronics as an example, that really can be replaced by products, robotics and vision that will do a better job in the long run and more consistently gives me a sense that this market still has a very, very long way to run. and of course, we're a technology company, so our products are getting more powerful, easier to use, easier to integrate, less expensive.
and we're bringing new technologies to market in vision that can expand the boundaries of what we do, perhaps the best example being our new deep learning technology, which really does allow us to replace more and more basic visual inspection in production. so not only are we gaining share from non-automation to automation, we're also expanding the boundaries of what automation will do. so -- and then we see new markets continuing to adopt automation as an example. food was very underpenetrated from robotics and vision perspective a few years ago, but we now see it being a fast-growing market for us and there are many other markets to which that applies. so i'm viewing this as a temporary phenomenon in a slowdown of the move of automation into a lot of markets.
josh pokrzywinski -- morgan stanley -- analyst
got it. and i guess within that, and this is my follow-up, given maybe some broadening of the application set beyond kind of the traditional 2 large markets for you guys, electronics and auto, what does that mean for mix? is that mix positive? is that mix negative? does it matter? because obviously, the type of buyers of the applications will change as you kind of run around application to application.
robert j. willett -- chief executive officer, president and executive director
when you say mix, josh, presumably you mean profitability?
josh pokrzywinski -- morgan stanley -- analyst
yes, product mix if you want to think about it in gross margins or asp, whatever makes the most sense to you and we could kind of contextualize.
robert j. willett -- chief executive officer, president and executive director
yes, i mean i think to speak in generalities, i think generally, smaller customers who don't require much support from us tend to have low service components to that revenue. so then we often put the business through partners. so we often see them having higher margins overall and they use discrete vision system technologies like in-sight, for instance. so that can be margin accretive for us overall. we tend to see certain industries, where customers are large and adoption is complex, requiring more support from us. so we see that particularly in the smartphone market and the logistics market currently where we have some very, very large customers and potential customers who need more application engineering support from us.
so we see that in logistics at the moment, and that's dilutive and that is an impact to our gross margin year-on-year, which i think we've spoken about already with you. so we see some of that. so i think the smaller customers that are adopting, let's say, that will stay under sort of 10% of our revenue for longer periods have the potential to adopt our technology themselves. we have very easy to use, easy-to-adopt technology. i'd hazard to say the easiest in the industry, and i think that bodes pretty well for our margins.
another thing to bear in mind is that as these new customer sets kind of develop, that means we have to call on a lot more plants globally as the industries we serve broaden. and that's one reason we've added a lot of salesnoids over the last few years is to extend our reach and as we develop products such as our in-sight 2000 or the dataman 370 we just launched. it means those salespeople can call on plants and close business relatively quickly, so we need more coverage to do that. that's going to be great for our margins over long term as the business grows. but right now it certainly means that we're carrying more expense than we would have if we were just serving a few industries.
operator
our next question is from richard eastman with robert w. baird. please proceed.
richard eastman -- robert w. baird & co -- analyst
yes. thank you. robert, could you talk just a second or 2 about the auto business? and i'm thinking you have another big second quarter comp from last year. but if you think of the business in dollars that come from the auto industry, i'm just -- i'm curious from a dollar perspective, are we near what you might think of as a bottom or when you think of the business sequentially? or how do you see that playing out for the year perhaps, comps aside?
robert j. willett -- chief executive officer, president and executive director
okay. rick, yes, i think that depends on what's going to happen in various markets. so i'll kind of give you an overview and try to put some color on that. so the china market is broadly soft more so than anywhere and uncertainty, among other issues, is causing capital spend to be delayed. the american automotive market is noticeably slower than it was. manufacturers are scaling back large automation projects as they focus on reducing production rates. europe has been performing relatively well this year. brand owners in europe seem to be more optimistic coming into the year. and then in the rest of asia, the automotive business is more solid, delivering some better growth for us particularly around automation, new technologies and electric vehicles.
so kind of with that as backdrop, i think what i would say, i do see some sequential growth for cognex as we move through the year on automotive, but whether that's very limited growth or stronger growth depends on how some of the uncertainty plays out. i think the uncertainty is quite consumer-driven in china where we're going to see more stimulus. and then i think to some degree, the trade uncertainty that's hanging over america and china and potentially for europe, too, is an issue. and if that, i think, loosens up, we'll see some capital break free and we should see better growth rather than just very limited growth as we go through the year year-on-year.
i would add that in terms of automotive, i spent substantial time last month in the southern states of america visiting automotive companies and their suppliers. i did see a lot of uncertainty and stagnation there. i saw big automotive plants reducing their shifts from 3 to 2 shifts in some cases, and i saw a slowing down of investments going on among tier 1 suppliers, notably, japanese suppliers as an example. so i don't think that's a long-term phenomenon. i think it's a temporary phenomenon, and how quickly it changes will determine the answer to your question about whether we're sort of rather stagnant or returning to growth.
richard eastman -- robert w. baird & co -- analyst
okay. all right. and then just my follow-up actually, i want to bounce a question off to dr. bob, if he's live on the call.
robert j. willett -- chief executive officer, president and executive director
dr. bob, are you on mute perhaps?
robert j. shillman -- founder, executive chairman & chief culture officer
exactly. i was on mute. thank you. i am now back and fully here. i was on mute.
richard eastman -- robert w. baird & co -- analyst
my question is around this -- the robotic guidance market and this path toward automating bin picking, and it seems like the early vision market here is kind of 2 pieces. one is around the movement of the pick itself, and the other is kind of movement around the arm. and i'm curious if we end up in a situation where we have one bit of software that's maybe 3d software that can do both tasks because it seems to me the movement of the pick itself might be somewhat commoditized at some point. am i thinking about that right? just your thoughts on that, dr. bob.
robert j. shillman -- founder, executive chairman & chief culture officer
okay. the general bin picking problem has been around since i was a graduate student 40 years ago. but at that time, it was presented as a tub of identical parts lying in any random array, and the goal was to find the one that was on top and that pretty much is solvable. but the problems that customers want to solve today is quite a bit more difficult than that. the problem, as i understand, the customers want to solve is there's a bin someplace in a rack even, not necessarily on that laboratory floor, there's a bin in space and it contains numerous items not all the same, matter of fact.
now if you ask a human, ""reach into this bin without even looking, your hand over your head, and pick out the pen -- the package with a pen in it instead of packages that have calculators in them or whatever,"" a human can do that. and having been in this field for 40 years now, every day i am more and more impressed by what humans can do, even a low-paid human: the ability to find things, to grasp them. and if they grasp it, they grasp it appropriately and hard enough so they won't drop it even if they're moving their hand quickly. so the problems we're faced with today are that there's a bin somewhere and there are mixed parts in there in various orientation and the goal is to pick out the calculator out of that bin which contains other things as well as calculators.
now the problem, even though humans can do it by a sense of touch and understanding what things feel like and how hard they are, how much they weigh, the problem requires today from automation to be solved, it does require machine vision to look into the bin, the first thing to do, to look into the bin, try to find the part that's there and then more importantly or as importantly, locate the point to pick it up. because if a robot arm goes in there and picks it up from the end, let's say, let's say it's a piece of wood measuring a foot long, if it picks it up by the end, by the time the hand moves back to put it in the shipping carton, it will have dropped that because it turns out the robots have to move quickly to justify this entire system. so not only does the vision have to determine where the part is that it's supposed to pick up, but also where to pick it up. then that's a vision problem. very complex. very complex.
next, there's the gripper problem. what kind of gripper is going to be used to pick up the part? well, there are a variety of different kinds of grippers. there are mechanical ones, suction ones. and how hard do they squeeze on it so that when they move quickly, they won't drop the part? very hard problem. then there's a robotic mechanics problem, which is how do you move the arm in the gripper in such a way to get into the bin, not knock the bin over, not hit the other staging that is holding the bin and compute the path to pick it up and then to retrieve it and put it back in the box.
so this is a very, very difficult problem. i would say it's almost equivalent to self-driving cars, which is again, a very difficult problem. and although we have pieces of that puzzle, i don't believe that anyone yet has put the entire -- all those pieces together into a solution. and we've been working with a variety of companies to try to solve this problem, but i'm afraid that it is beyond the technological state-of-the-art and will remain so for a few years.
richard eastman -- robert w. baird & co -- analyst
and just to be clear, the way you're seeing it currently is more around 2d vision to identify the problem. is that how cognex is approaching? or is it 3d?
robert j. shillman -- founder, executive chairman & chief culture officer
no. no. in the most difficult case, we need 3d because you have to determine which part is on top because that's the one you're going to pick up. we have been using some advanced snapshot 3d sensors of our own design, our own technology, to work on this problem. but i believe it's going to be a long time before these major e-tailers could lay off or repurpose the people who are now doing the bin picking. it's going to be a long time.
richard eastman -- robert w. baird & co -- analyst
i got you. thank you. thanks for the explanation.
robert j. shillman -- founder, executive chairman & chief culture officer
you're welcome.
operator
our next question is from jim ricchiuti with needham & company. please proceed.
james ricchiuti -- needham & company -- analyst
hi. thank you. good afternoon. i may have missed it, but did you provide growth rate for the logistics business in the quarter? i know you've been historically talking about it growing 50% or better. but i was just wondering, this past quarter, what was the growth rate?
robert j. willett -- chief executive officer, president and executive director
jim, we're not going to give quarterly growth rates on any specific market that we serve. i'm going to say that we are very happy with the growth rate we achieved in logistics in the quarter.
james ricchiuti -- needham & company -- analyst
okay. rob, i wonder if we could look at the consumer electronics business and the kind of decline that you're anticipating for this year. i'm trying to understand a little more about the dynamics in that market right now. is it just market weakness? or some of the customers, potentially the larger customers, also perhaps repurposing some of the existing machine vision? i know in other times as companies -- some of your customers transition to new products, it ended up being a significant investment in all -- in vision, and i'm trying to get a better sense as to what might be happening in some of these factories.
robert j. willett -- chief executive officer, president and executive director
yes, jim, so what we're seeing is large customers in consumer electronics are deferring investments in machine vision and particularly in smartphone manufacturing. broadly speaking, a number of customers are focused on upgrading their existing lines, and they're not making heavy investments in new capabilities this year as far as we can see. and as we said, we expect the business to decline by about 1/3 this year, and you'll see the impact most notably in our, strangely, in our european region because some large customers purchase us -- from us there, but also in china and in the rest of asia.
so consumer electronics remains a growth opportunity for cognex and companies have product plans that require automation and machine vision to implement. so new innovations that we all read about in the newspapers, such as foldable screens, wireless charging, virtual reality, will certainly require more complex manufacturing processes in the long run. and although we may see some of those technologies in various companies' products today, they're still really being tested and not rolled out in any massive hardware sense this year and the focus is more on retrofitting existing lines and improving productivity.
certainly, rising wages and current processes are still very labor-intensive, and so there's certainly focus on those areas to reduce cost. and then another factor that's going on certainly is new facilities are being built as companies diversify away from china to other emerging areas. i mean we even read about electronics manufacturers here in the u.s. and -- but certainly also in india and other markets, were seeing some investments, too, just start to begin.
so i'd say it's a great transitional year. it's one where the new technology is not here yet where there's a lot of focus on cost, and that's kind of certainly having its impact on our business. there is business for us for retrofitting and improving lines. but as you can see from our guidance, it's much less exciting and growth oriented than when major new lines are being implemented or new features are being brought to market.
operator
our next question is from joe giordano with cowen and company. please proceed.
joe giordano -- cowen and company -- analyst
i guess maybe -- wondering if you had an update on integration of some of the deep learning capabilities into the in-sight platform. i've seen some of you guys at trade shows, and that's something you guys have been working toward. i think some of your competitors are close to launching something similar to that. so just any update there on being able to put all that technology onto a single platform?
robert j. willett -- chief executive officer, president and executive director
well, generally, joe, we don't give a comment or we don't comment about future product launches which may or may not be coming from cognex. so that's not something that i would comment on. certainly, we're very excited and we're seeing some excellent growth in our deep learning business, and it's an area we think we're leading in from a technology point of view. and of course, making that technology more accessible and easier to use would be what one would expect a product road map to include, but i'm not going to get specific about when and in what form we might launch future products with that technology.
joe giordano -- cowen and company -- analyst
okay. when i think about where your balance sheet is and what you've done over the last couple of years, you've obviously -- you were hiring like crazy to meet demand. so how do you feel you guys are positioned now in terms of like is your capacity too high from a human capital perspective? and in terms of the financial capabilities, i was a little surprised to see no buyback this quarter. just how should we think about that going forward?
robert j. willett -- chief executive officer, president and executive director
yes, joe, i'll talk about the sort of capacity issue then i'll invite john to comment on the buyback. so you're right. we've been investing very heavily in the businesses. we saw some phenomenal growth and phenomenal potential in the business. obviously, 44% growth in 2017. we were, in a sense, under capacity as we -- we didn't have the capacity to support that level of ongoing business as we exited the year. so we were doing some catch up in '18.
what you're seeing now is we're going to be slowing down significantly on hiring and expense growth, and we're reallocating resources because we're -- cognoids are very talented and capable individuals that we take great effort to hire, have the cultural fit with our business and train and develop. so they're great assets for us that we're going to or are in the process of redeploying toward high-growth areas of the business such as logistics.
so we think it gives us extra capacity for what we want to do in the future, but we certainly are slowing down expense growth and hiring based on what we see and we've been discussing on this call. now i'll turn it to john on the buyback in q1 question.
john j. curran -- senior vice president of finance and administration, treasurer and chief finance officer
yes, joe, as you mentioned, we weren't in the market in q1. last year, we got -- our purchases, we got pretty far ahead of our dilution. so we kind of paused on buyback at the end of last year and into q1, but we plan to be in the market in q2. we've had a significant grant during the quarter, so we'll be back in the market. and just as a data point, we have about $190 million authorized by the board, so we're ready to go.
joe giordano -- cowen and company -- analyst
if i could just sneak one quick one in on just a math clarification. just on your consumer electronics business, you mentioned down 1/3 or so this year. i think it was down a similar amount last year. can you just maybe frame how much dollars in that business versus the 2017 base is going to be gone and effectively has been made up by other parts of the business because revenue on a full basis will be above 2017?
robert j. willett -- chief executive officer, president and executive director
yes, i think directionally, revenue in that market was down about $65 million last year, right? i think we would expect to see it down about 1/3 this year, right? so a similar amount generally. your question kind of was what was it in '17 and what's it going down. and i think we may struggle to answer that question, but we might do a little work offline and answer a little later in the call. so we'll go to the next question and we'll try to address it.
joe giordano -- cowen and company -- analyst
fair enough. thank you.
robert j. willett -- chief executive officer, president and executive director
we'll try to aggressive.

our next question is from andrew buscaglia with berenberg. please proceed.
andrew buscaglia -- berenberg capital markets -- analyst
hey, guys. quick question on some of your machine vision peers, some being customers, are mostly calling for a flattish to up mid-single-digit year in 2019. so you mentioned you don't think you're losing share. but why -- what's the -- how do you triangulate the commentary out of some of your publicly traded peers? is it they're playing in different niches that maybe they're growing differently? but can you comment on what's the delta there?
robert j. willett -- chief executive officer, president and executive director
yes, andrew, i think there aren't really any like-for-like publicly traded peers with cognex. i think there are different data points in the market from publicly traded companies, but none of them really map very well to what cognex is. certainly, our largest competitor is keyence, and i think they may see similar phenomenon that we do. but their exposure to market's may be different and of course, their business is much larger and much more diverse than ours, right? and then there maybe other companies, smaller publicly traded companies that deal specifically with electronics or other markets, so you may see them affected in different ways.
so i think when we talk about share, we think about the accounts that we serve. bear in mind that cognex is the largest and most respected machine vision provider in the automation world. so pretty much all of the major companies that use machine vision do use cognex, whether we have the biggest part of that business or not. it may depend but certainly, we have a very good feel about what's going on with their plans and if and where we might be losing or gaining share.
i think my comment related specifically to the consumer electronics vertical where we obviously have some very, very large business and deeply penetrated businesses in certain accounts. so certainly, that's driving our confidence that although our business is severely down, we're not losing share or account share in that market per se.
andrew buscaglia -- berenberg capital markets -- analyst
got it. and if you could comment -- you're seeing a lot of cash here. your cash flow is still strong. we're in kind of a down year. will you consider or are you looking harder like at inorganic growth opportunities? and maybe if you can comment on what m&a valuations are like and things you're looking at. are you getting more comfortable there?
robert j. willett -- chief executive officer, president and executive director
so we look at acquisition for growth opportunities on an ongoing basis regardless really of whether our business is growing fast or, in this case, not growing at the moment. so that's -- it's not really a growth-driven activity, and we have a very structured approach to acquisitions with the corporate development team that maps markets, looks at our own market and what represents good bolt-on opportunities for us in our existing markets and what adjacent markets we might enter through acquisition. we've made 6 smallish acquisitions in the last couple of years or so. generally, they've been acquisitions we really like a lot, which is great engineering and technology companies with a small number of employees and a lot of talent and growth potential, and we've seen that flow through particularly in the areas of deep learning and 3d.
so we -- that's the type of acquisition that we like. there are, i think perhaps to speak more directly to your question, some larger opportunities out there to acquire competitors. and certainly, we have what i would refer to as a shopping list. and as those companies become available, then we certainly look at them. and those could take larger amounts of capital to acquire, right? so certainly, we do look at those. but we are highly selective in what we choose to acquire, and a big factor for us is our culture. we don't want to bolt on some kind of underperforming or less-than-excellent culture to cognex because we believe that's so essential to our long-term success as a business. but there certainly are companies that we would like to acquire if and when they become available, and that might consume hundreds of millions of dollars of cash to do so.

our next question is from karen lau with gordon haskett. please proceed.
karen lau -- gordon haskett -- analyst
hi. good afternoon, everyone. rob, i want to start it out with china. you mentioned long-term adoption still very robust for machine vision end market. can you talk about how big of your china business is still oriented toward consumer electronics and auto? and are you seeing any benefits from like other industry adopting machine vision benefiting the chinese business in any way?
robert j. willett -- chief executive officer, president and executive director
yes, karen. so you're right that our 2 largest vertical markets in china are electronics and really only in recent years, automotive. we've seen very, very strong growth in our automotive business in china over the last 3 years where it's rivaling consumer electronics in terms of its size. and then we have a lot of other markets just as in other geographies that we serve in china, and we see very widespread and fast adoption in markets like that. so pharmaceuticals, medical device, solar, for instance. we're putting up some very good growth numbers even in this type of an environment. so i'd say those are more big, big growth opportunities off small basis that we see, and it's certainly a reason that we built the sales force to be able to reach all those potential customers.
karen lau -- gordon haskett -- analyst
so if you parse out consumer electronics, which obviously has its own dynamic in china, have you seen any improvement in sort of capex investment sentiment in the past month or so after chinese new year? because there seems to be so much stimulus going on like people cutting prices in cars or cutting manufacturing taxes. so it felt like from your guide you're not seeing any improvements. but are you seeing any stabilization improvement at all in china outside of ce?
robert j. willett -- chief executive officer, president and executive director
no. i mean i'm reading the same things that you are, karen, but i'm not really seeing the market turn and the investment come back on yet. that's what i would say.
karen lau -- gordon haskett -- analyst
okay. got it. i guess more broadly you -- i guess you guys started the call calling out slower business conditions. but aside from electronics and auto, have you detected any hesitancy in like other types of customers toward investing in automation like anywhere and in any vertical at all?
robert j. willett -- chief executive officer, president and executive director
i mean i would say it's more of a geographic phenomenon is what i would refer to. i think as i look across our americas business, i would say in general it's not -- it is not the sort of level of buoyant investment in automation right now that we did see, say, back in a year ago or in 2017. so i would say that's the case. i think it's also europe. you see and read a lot about a lot of hesitancy in that market, too. i think we've -- our european business has done better than we expected so far this year, and we're still seeing some stronger trends there than we expected to at the start of the year. but even there you can see some hesitancy particularly, i think, in southern europe where financing may be more difficult to come by. customers are a little bit less bullish in terms of their investment plan.
and then i think another thing to appreciate about the automation market, which maybe many of us do, is it's quite global and there are certainly big machine builders in southern germany or in italy or in japan or taiwan or korea that are very dependent on global customers, particularly in china. so if those customers are paring back their investments or waiting, it can hurt the order books of companies in those very distant geographies.
karen lau -- gordon haskett -- analyst
okay. that makes sense. and then just one last one, quick one on consumer electronics. i understand that you mentioned you're not losing shares. but if you compare what you're guiding to, the down 1/3 number, that's pretty drastic after a down 20% last year, right? and i think some of your, to the earlier questions, your peers or some business partners kind of talked about their consumer electronics market expecting to be like not down as much this year. i realize the trend can change very quickly. but i'm just curious, you're not losing share, but are you in any way may be suffering from some sort of trade repercussions from like chinese smartphone makers toward like u.s. suppliers maybe temporary? is that like -- has that been any impact to your business at all?
robert j. willett -- chief executive officer, president and executive director
so i think what i want to do, karen, is i want to qualify what i said is i don't think we're losing any account share overall, although we may have exposure to some larger customers, greater exposure than other companies do. so i think that may be part of the confusion in this overall. so i would say as i look at accounts and i look at the businesses we're having and i look at our sales funnel and our crm system, the business we seem to have -- we're working on. we're not losing at a rate that seems different than in the past.
but i think when all is said and done and we have -- we look back on the year, we may find our electronics business is down 1/3, and that's more than other customers based on where our exposure is. we're more exposed to certain end-user customers and we have less exposure, as one -- you might expect us to say, the japanese businesses, more exposure in some other areas. so let me say that that's the case. i think on a dollar-for-dollar basis on the overall market, we may find our share decrease while our account share is maintained.
karen lau -- gordon haskett -- analyst
okay. any comments on any potential -- any, like, trade repercussions that may be impacting your consumer electronics business in china?
robert j. willett -- chief executive officer, president and executive director
it's not clear to me but that's obviously -- it's very hard to parse out what's consumer-led, government stimulus-led, anxiety-about-investment-led. so the answer to that is i think i just don't know.
karen lau -- gordon haskett -- analyst
okay, got it. thank you.
operator
our next question is from paul coster with jpmorgan. please proceed.
paul chung -- jpmorgan -- analyst
hi. this is paul chung on for coster. so just on add backs, your spend is slowed in 1q. it looks like it's extending into 2q. investor pace of hiring has slowed as you mentioned. but how should we think about the second half given the slowdown in top line for the full year? i did notice some comments you mentioned on outsourcing some engineering costs. is that something new that you're doing? and is there kind of like a bigger focus now here on kind of costs?
robert j. willett -- chief executive officer, president and executive director
so we -- a, we don't give expense guidance for the full year, but you can see we're slowing down our expenses. and as i mentioned to an earlier question, we're allocating resources into higher-growth areas. so i think we should think of this as the pivoting of talent and resources toward higher-growth areas. it's certainly not a kind of a serious reduction, cost-cutting environment like we might have seen, say, in 2008. that's not where we are. we're not heading for the bunkers by any means. but we're just starting to focus a bit more on allocating resources to high-growth areas and driving some productivity through the business we invested last year and bringing a lot of new cognoids on board, so getting them up to speed. and we invested a lot in a new erp system, which can drive a lot more productivity for us. so i think of it as a pause and reallocation rather than a reduction. so i wouldn't expect to see us reporting reduced expenses quarter-on-quarter as we get through the second half of the year. but any growth rates, i think, will be relatively modest.
paul chung -- jpmorgan -- analyst
understood. and then lastly, i don't think you've had an analyst day in years. so why now? and any preview on the agenda?
robert j. willett -- chief executive officer, president and executive director
so we have an analyst day pretty much every 3 years and that's -- i think that's been the case for maybe 15 years. so we're right on time to have the next one and i think nothing to read really -- nothing to read into that, but we're very much looking forward to bringing many of you to natick. you'll see so many changes, and we have a lot of exciting things to show you in september.
paul chung -- jpmorgan -- analyst
great. i appreciate it.
operator
our next question is from matt summerville with d.a. davidson. please proceed.
drew haroldson -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
hey. good afternoon. this is drew haroldson on for matt summerville. i just have a couple quick questions. first, can you talk about specific end market trends outside of auto, consumer electronics, logistics areas such as general industrial, life sciences, food and beverage and provide some regional color?
robert j. willett -- chief executive officer, president and executive director
yes, thanks, matt. your question is very broad, so i think i'll focus on some highlights. at cognex, we're very thoughtful about end markets where machine vision can really have a lot of value over the long term. so some of the markets you name, certainly that's the case. life sciences is a market where we've been investing and focused on for a long time, and we're actually very pleased with the progress we're making on that. this is a market where customers make machines that generally look at human bodily fluids, such as just blood, and analyze it with reagents. and they bring machines to market that require machine vision, and the market generally has used some pretty basic id, pretty low-price point id products from some companies in that space. and what we've seen is there's much more interest and need to do a lot more with machine vision.
so we've been focused on this market for a while. we tend to measure success by design wins when large companies that you would recognize the name of design a new machine and they include cognex vision. and when they do, what we see is the potential to generate many millions of dollars for each machine that we specified into over a 7- to 11-year period. so one of the oem machine projects we won with a major european life sciences company last year, we expect to generate several million dollars of revenue per year starting in 2021. and then we actually won 20 new design wins last year. so not all of them as big as that one, but has the potential to generate hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars of revenue per year for substantial periods. and it's not material to our results now, but we believe it will be a larger contributor in a few years. so that would be one example certainly. and i think if there's anything i'd want you to take away from my comments is we have a pretty long-term view about where machine version can play and the benefits it can provide.
another market we haven't really talked about in recent calls, but i anticipate we will perhaps at the analyst day or in future, is our market for mobile terminals. it's a new market we entered, about 3 years ago, where we have an advantaged product that integrates smartphones into a rugged design with cognex machine vision on the front and it's capable of doing a lot of very interesting and powerful functions for those in logistics and in manufacturing. so that's a business we expect to double this year off a relatively small base, but it's another example of a vertical market where we're seeing a lot of growth.
maybe if there's a third market i'd point to, cognex machine vision is very powerful in helping customers in highly regulated goods fight counterfeiting and diversion, and that's a market that is bouyant and sees a lot of investment going in and where we've seen a lot of growth in our business, those of whom who want to fight those kind of problems in markets like tobacco, for instance. so those would be examples where we see long-term growth potential and we're investing and we're seeing good results in the short term even though they may not be that visible to you in the results that we publish each quarter.
drew haroldson -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
and maybe as a quick follow-up, my second question, in your mind, what are the things that need to happen for mobile terminals to become a meaningful part of cognex?
robert j. willett -- chief executive officer, president and executive director
so i think we came to market with an innovative kind of disruptive concept, and what we've seen is a lot of customers have resonated with that and have bought small numbers of the products and have been experimenting with them and seeing what they can do with them. so as we -- what we need to do is make sure that we can convert those customers into large users because they may have bought 5 from us and that they may buy 5,000 a year from some of the large players in that market. so the key will be our ability to convert some of those customers from those who are experimenting with our technology to fully adopting it.
operator
we have reached the end of the call. i will now turn it back over to dr. shillman for closing comments.
robert j. shillman -- founder, executive chairman & chief culture officer
yes, thank you very much. look, it's obvious that things are slowing down in much of the world in manufacturing. the sale of new phones doesn't seem to be growing, and the sale of cars seems to be slowing, maybe millennials or whatever. the good news is, first of all, that even though our revenue is slowing down, we're still going to be very profitable in 2019. we expect to be still very profitable and also to have positive cash flow. and aside from that, we are highly confident that we'll be back into good times in a year or so. the world needs more products. consumers want to buy things of high quality and low cost, and the only way to get there is through automation and cognex plays a key role in the automation of virtually everything you buy.
so we expect to get back on a growth track when the economy improves and when vendors -- when the companies that manufacture things start manufacturing more of the stuff. generally speaking, our products are not reused. they're not repositioned. but when a new line opens up or new products are coming to market from the manufacturers, they need more machine vision and it's generally cognex machine vision. and as rob pointed out, we haven't lost any customers. that is very important to us to keep track of customers and making sure that, hopefully, that we never lose a customer. so what we have seen, of course, is some customers, and particularly large ones, buying considerably less and that's what you see reflected in our comments today.
okay. i hope to be able to report on better results in the coming quarters and to take your questions again at that time. thank you for attending the call. bye-bye.

greetings and welcome to cognex second quarter 2019 earnings conference call. as a reminder, this conference is being recorded. it is now my pleasure to introduce your host, ms. susan conway, cognex -- senior director of investor relations. thank you ms. conway, you may begin.
susan conway -- senior director of investor relations
thank you and good evening everyone. with us today are cognex's chairman, dr. bob shillman; president and ceo, rob willett; vice president and corporate controller, laura macdonald, and cognex's treasurer, chris stagno. i'd like to point out that our earnings release, and quarterly report on form 10-q are available on the investor information section of our website at www.cognex.com. those contain highly detailed information about our financial results.
during the call, we may use a non-gaap financial measure if we believe it is useful to investors or if we believe it will help investors better understand our results or business trends. you can see a reconciliation of certain items from gaap to non-gaap in exhibit 2 of the earnings release. any forward-looking statements we made in the earnings release or any that we may make during this call are based upon information that we believe to be true as of today. things often change however and actual results may differ materially from those projected or anticipated. you should refer to our sec filings, including our most recent form 10-k for a detailed list of these risk factors.
with that i'd like to turn the call over to dr. bob shillman.
robert j. shillman -- chairman and founder
thanks sue and hi everybody. thanks for joining us. overall, our q2 results were in line with our expectations and we were highly profitable. however, it's very frustrating to report a year-over-year decline in both revenue and profits as a result of the current downturn in both consumer electronics and automotive markets. even so, we are confident about the future of cognex and the role of machine vision and automation and turns out that distribution remains strong, logistics. right now, i'm in san diego and everyone else is at our natick headquarters.
so for more details. i'll turn the call over to my partner, rob willett and i'll remain on the call for any questions you may have with me. rob, the microphone is yours.
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, dr. bob. good evening, everyone. as dr. bob said, our q2 results were as expected with revenue at the top of our guidance range. the lower spending by customers and consumer electronics and the automotive sector in the americas that we discussed last quarter played out as expected. however, the broad factory automation market in europe was considerably softer than we anticipated in q2 and the impact of this will be more noticeable in our q3 results. demand for many end markets is declining, notably in automotive, which is one of our largest markets in europe. customers, particularly those that are exposed to the slowdown in greater china are reducing and deferring large project. asia has also weakened. this is due to a continuation of the challenges that we have been experiencing broadly across china and to softness observed in the industrial markets elsewhere in asia. these dynamics obscure our continued strong performance in logistics, in that market a growing and broad base of well-known e-retail and traditional retail companies are investing in automation to improve the speed and the efficiency of their fulfillment operations and they are turning to cognex machine vision as a key enabling technology in their distribution centers. we also continue to make strong progress in other industries we serve that are currently relatively small but are growing quickly.
putting it together, consumer electronics and automotive, our two largest markets that combined have recently been responsible for more than 50% of our revenue, are both contracting simultaneously for the first time in many years. broadly speaking, it's due to a widespread lack of business confidence amid falling demand, changes in customer preferences and the timing of transitions to new technologies. heightened uncertainty and the distractions around trade tensions are also a problem. however, we are confident in our business strategy and are keeping a long-term perspective. we continue to fund our engineering projects and the development of impressive new products continues to plan. we are, we allocating resources toward faster growing areas such as logistics and deep learning and markets where the adoption of machine vision is still in its infancy. the skill sets of our engineers and sales noids are highly transferable and can be applied to a variety of opportunities. before we move on to the details of the quarter, as you may know, we're actively recruiting to fill the cfo role. in the meantime, we're especially fortunate to have laurie mcdonald serving as our principal financial and accounting officer. laura is a 25-year cognoid and has led cognex's finance, accounting and reporting teams as vice president and corporate controller since 2007.
laura, the microphone is yours.
laura a. macdonald -- vice president and corporate controller
thank you, rob, and hello everyone. revenue in q2 was $199 million representing a decline of 6% year-on-year due to a reduction in revenue from the consumer electronics and automotive market. the decline was 3% in constant currency. logistics continue to be a strong performer and offset much of the decline in the manufacturing sector. gross margin of 74% was consistent with q2 2018 despite the lower revenue and was up 1 percentage point from q1 '19. operating margin in q2 was 26%, down from 30% in q2, 2018. on a sequential basis, operating margin increased by 9 percentage points due to seasonal growth in revenue and prudent management of discretionary expenses. the effective tax rate for the first six months of the year was 16% before discrete tax items, up from our expected rate of 15% due to a shift of income from lower to higher tax jurisdiction. the true-up of the tax rate reduced net income for q2 by approximately $925,000. excluding all discrete tax items, our earnings per share were $0.27 in q2 '19 compared with $0.31 in q2 '18 and were up from $0.17 in q1 '19. looking at revenue from a geographic perspective, the americas performed the best of any region increasing by high-single digits year-on-year. strong growth continued in logistics and was partially offset by lower revenue from the automotive sector where spending continues to be slow. revenue from europe declined by mid teens year-on-year, and that includes a 6 percentage point negative impact from currency exchange rates. consumer electronics declined substantially as expected. we also saw growth soften in the factory automation market. in greater china, revenues declined by low teens year-on-year, also due to consumer electronics at a negative impact of 6 percentage points from currency exchange rates. manufacturers across our customer base in china continue to cut back their capital spending plans. revenue from the rest of asia declined by mid-single digits, principally due to reduced spending in the electronics, and semi markets, which are dependent upon demand in china.
turning to our balance sheet, cognex continues to have a strong position. we ended the quarter with $862 million in cash and investments and no debt. during the quarter, cash provided by operations was $15 million. we repurchased shares of cognex stock, totaling $62 million and we paid $9 million in dividends to shareholders. inventory decreased $6 million or 8% from the end of q1 as expected. as noted last quarter, we prospectively adopted a new lease accounting standard this year, which resulted in a balance sheet growth of [phonetic] assets and liabilities of approximately $18 million at the end of q2. now i'll turn the call back to rob.
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, laura. moving next to guidance. revenue for the third quarter is expected to be between $175 million and $185 million. compared to $232 million reported in q3 of 2018, the decline is due almost entirely to substantially lower revenue from consumer electronics. as discussed last quarter, this is particularly related to smartphone manufacturing. otherwise, we believe that continued growth in logistics at a few smaller high potential markets that are performing well will be offset by decreased revenue from the automotive sector and other industrial markets. we expect gross margin for q3 will be in the mid 70% range and slightly lower than the 74% gross margin we've reported for q2.
operating expenses are expected to be relatively flat with q2. the effective tax rate is expected to be 16% excluding discrete tax items. and with that, we will open the call for question. operator, please go ahead.

at this time we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [operator instructions]
our first question comes from the line of karen lau of gordon. please proceed with your question.
karen lau -- gordon haskett research -- analyst
good afternoon, everyone. rob, you mentioned logistics was still growing at pretty healthy pace. there were some other companies that called out some push out in large projects, i guess over the course of past few months. i guess, can you comment on the growth rate you're seeing in 2q and what you're expecting in 3q and if you're not seeing any -- if you're seeing any push out in projects in your pipeline?
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
yes, hi. thank you, karen. our logistics business continues to be very healthy. we're growing at a good clip and we baked into our q3 guidance that is continued growth right around that 50% growth rate that we're targeting. so we haven't -- there is a fair bit of seasonality in logistics and as we get into this market more and understand it better, generally what we tend to see is higher revenue quarters for us in q2 and q4 and lower revenue quarters in q1 and q3. but the growth rates we're seeing continue to be very strong and we expect that to continue.
karen lau -- gordon haskett research -- analyst
okay, thanks.
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
okay, thank you. [indecipherable] go to in more detail, if that's of interest.
karen lau -- gordon haskett research -- analyst
yes, sure. i guess, do you think that's a function of you have been adding so much more resources in that market that allows you to outgrow that market or are you somehow just more penetrated in like smaller project these days. so any kind of deferral in larger project areas doesn't that affect you as much?
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
yes, i mean i would -- we are newish to this market and we have some very advantage technology that we're bringing and certainly the technology leaders in this market, particularly in the e-commerce space recognize that and i'd say we're i would say we're being very much recognized as technology leaders. so i think that's the reason we think we can keep growing, we have been and we think we can keep growing this market at 50% growth rate over the long term. so i think i see that continuing, we're also introducing some exciting new products, we introduced the 3d-a1000 for dimensioning which will be very advantaged over time with light and laser based dimensioning systems that are currently in that market and we're reallocating resources as you note to make sure we have the capacity to go on -- to go on growing. so if there is a silver lining to this very disappointing market situation we're seeing in automotive and electronics, it's that we're able to reallocate those cognoids to some very exciting growth opportunities, notably, logistics and deep learning.
karen lau -- gordon haskett research -- analyst
okay, great, thank you for the color. and then just on consumer electronics, can you update us first this down one-third expectation that you had going into the year, what is your expectation now for that market?
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
well, i would say, we don't really want to be giving annual guidance every time we meet, we're not really changing our kind of approach to that. however, i will say things haven't really changed a lot in our outlook in that market since we last spoke. so our guidance in q3 reflects a $50 million a year-on-year decline in revenue from consumer electronics, that's the big change we expected to see and we're going to go on seeing. so as you try to understand our q3, it's really not so much an electronic story. i think that's what -- it's similar to what we have told you previously, it is much more a story of a softening in automotive and europe and the overall market we see in china.
karen lau -- gordon haskett research -- analyst
okay, understood. and then just lastly, i guess more broadly on ce, realized huawei is not, probably not a big customers of yours or you have said that it's not that material of an impact, but i'm just curious, the whole episode of the ban and the ongoing trade tensions. does it impact your confidence or will it impact your ability at all to participate in future smartphone capex cycle given that i guess a lot of the infrastructure as well as manufacturers, machine oems are -- a lot of them are in china. so does that impact -- i guess, does this whole trade tension impact your longer term outlook in ce at all?
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
yes, it's a difficult call to make longer term, i mean, and obviously as you rightly noted, we don't talk about specific customers. cognex does supply all of the major manufacturers of smartphones whether directly or indirectly, through contract manufacturers and the current market and trade conditions make it more difficult to work with particularly some more than others as you've said, and some of the ones it's hard for us to work with perhaps one of the ones [phonetic] that are showing the most growth or have been in recent quarters. so that is -- that's a challenge for us, certainly. but certainly our guidance contemplates that situation and i think we will have to see how it's going to play out from a government and trade talk point of view.
karen lau -- gordon haskett research -- analyst
okay, understood. i'll leave it there. thank you.

our next question comes from the line of andrew buscaglia of berenberg. please proceed with your question.
andrew buscaglia -- berenberg capital markets -- analyst
hi guys, so i'm curious from a high level, you made some comment that you haven't seen quite a while consumer electronics and auto detracting simultaneously. you also would have the trade thing going on, which could be impacting things further. you know i'm just -- given you guys have a long history in this space and experience in here, can you talk about how this compares to other downturns? is this something you think is going to be prolonged? or do you -- based on your history and experience that you see, do you get the sense that things could turn quickly if we do get some sort of resolution in the trade agreement or any other factors? curious, your thoughts on that.
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
yes, hi, andrew. it's not easy to kind of prognosticate on these kind of things, but i would say a few things. one is, i think the consumer electronics market can turn quite quickly, right? so i think particularly around these issues. so i think that one potentially is one that could come back more strongly. i think the automotive market tends to be more of a, kind of a longer-term player, and it tends to take them longer to decelerate and accelerate around changes that go on, and i think i'd make that point of view. i also think i'm -- i can't quite remember exactly, i wanted to say 2015, we certainly saw some contraction in consumer electronics. but we didn't see the same thing going on in automotive at the same time. so that's a little bit different thing. i think all of us know that cognex has grown its topline every year consecutively for the last nine years and we're not growing this year. so this is a different situation that we're seeing and i think it has to do with a number of factors that have and some of which [phonetic] we've talked about the automotive industry itself is oversupplied at the moment and it's between kind of the fact it's between having the combustion engine cars in too many of the manufactured and perhaps not as competitive for consumers, as they need to be, but not yet having geared up on electric vehicles that are coming, but not yet really in the phase of major investment in automation.
so we're in that situation there and in consumer electronics i think we've gone through a period where we have massive investment and it's a matter of when we're going to return to that as well. i think -- as i think about this longer term, which is how we like to think about things at cognex, i think the story of the last many decades really has been increased spending and innovation in automation, in electronics and automotive, right? and as i look at consumer electronics, i think i would certainly expect there will be future waves of innovation and investments that are coming. and you can see that in many areas, 5g being one example in consumer electronics or autonomous, semi-autonomous vehicles and electric vehicles in automotive. so i think it's a matter of when those come and how they play out and how much of their lift they bring to automation. but when i think it'd be million literally millions of people involved in manufacturing, consumer electronics and the major investment and challenges and margin pressure on automotive to automate, i'm very optimistic about the long term, but much less optimistic about this year.
andrew buscaglia -- berenberg capital markets -- analyst
okay, that's helpful. maybe just turning to your balance sheet, that's something i asked last quarter you guys have this pile of cash. do you think -- does your appetite change in the last three months, given some of your peers, and your machine vision peers are a little bit weaker now and also just curious maybe the second part of that question, would you ever consider -- vertical integration with any specific pieces of your business?
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
so i would say we have a long-term strategy and some very strict and thoughtful criteria around acquisition if you're getting at that, so that doesn't really change based on short-term considerations. we obviously have a lot of firepower in our balance sheet to make acquisitions as and when they become actionable. so that will continue. i didn't really understand your vertical integration question, perhaps you could explain that to me.
andrew buscaglia -- berenberg capital markets -- analyst
just some of your suppliers that you use, is there -- does it ever make sense [indecipherable] thinking longer term? yes, on the camera side, makes sense to bring those in-house.
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
so we, i now understand your question. okay. so i think there are various technologies that we -- we have cognex work with and an example might be in the area of high-performance liquid lenses. so what a wonderful technology partner that we have in that space, where we've used our ability to invest to get some exclusivity around that technology without having to acquire the company. but it shows you what we're willing to do where we find advantage technology that we want to secure and whether it's through exclusivity or acquisition. we would do that but i don't think you're going to see us acquiring what i would consider more commoditized businesses like cameras, right? as an example.
andrew buscaglia -- berenberg capital markets -- analyst

our next question comes from the line of joe ritchie of goldman sachs. please proceed with your question.
joe ritchie -- goldman sachs -- analyst
thanks, good afternoon, everyone.
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
hi, joe.
joe ritchie -- goldman sachs -- analyst
so rob, just your comments on the auto market and electronics market notwithstanding, you did also say that like you experienced broad fact -- the broad factory automation market, particularly in europe slowing down. and so i was just wondering like if there you can provide a little bit more color on what really factored into that comment and what you guys are seeing specifically in europe.
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
sure, joe. i think it's pretty well known fact that the purchasing managers' index or pmi for manufacturing in europe was -- recently fell to a number of 46.4, which is a 79-month low, but i think generally we're seeing pretty under a confident manufacturing environment broadly in europe right now. we saw that emerge really kind of after our european organization came back from sort of the easter vacation time-frame, right? right after the call we had last with you. so i would say and we really noticed a lot of pulling back i would say on investment. i think another thing that perhaps -- might have crowded the view to that was i think at automotive we sort of saw q4 of last year from memory or certainly the second half which didn't look very good. it wasn't good last year in europe. and there was a -- a bunch of that had to do with regulation, right? around emissions and some other factors that they were dealing with which kind of held up demand in the end of last year and then we saw that kind of break free. and i think it made q1 in europe look better than probably it was on an underlying basis. so then we had to really try to recalibrate on really where are we as we came through into q2 and we realized it was weaker than we were expecting. and as i look around at other companies i see similar thing, particularly in automotive, i would point to the very large tier 1 automotive supplier, continental recently said they have revised view about the automotive industry this year from being flat, not their business, but the industry in total, on a global basis, not flat, but down 5% and they provide that down in a similar time period.
so i would say, we see that. the other thing i think it's probably, i know you many of you on the call cover many companies, i'd say difference between cognex and some of those companies is our distributors don't really carry almost any inventory and that's kind of part of our supply chain model. we really like to work in a situation where we tell our distributors we will supply you quickly and we don't want you tying up your cash holding cognex inventory. so as a result, we have a pretty clear line of sight with what's going on in the marketplace. so i think while other companies might be later to see that where the kind of sell-through of inventory may cloud that in some ways. anyway, those are my own views about what's going on in european manufacturing and automotive.
joe ritchie -- goldman sachs -- analyst
that's really a helpful commentary. and if i just could ask a follow-on there, i guess as you think about the capex cycles that you guys are tier 2 and how decisions are made, you referenced project deferrals earlier, i guess how do we think about the timing on when we could see an improvement in capex? we're halfway through the year this year, will budgeting decisions continue to be made this year or is this kind of more of like we'll get that further insight [indecipherable] on an improving business condition as we had really kind of toward the end of the year?
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
which i'd say very good question. not one i'm sure i can answer all that well. i'll give you my views which are, i think, i don't think we're going to see improvement in the situation this year, right? although it's possible, right? as they start to budget next year, there are going to be some factors that are going to change things. i think one factor is just very significant momentum and investment around electric vehicles and hybrid electric vehicles and autonomous features with very many new models plan to come to market in the next three, five years. and at some point, i think there's going to be a race to get those products to market and to gear up in automation. when does that begin i think is a critical question, of course, we're seeing investment in lithium-ion batteries and capacity in that space, and that is a good market. it's growing well for us at the moment. but i think we have to see more of those products, those new cars come into production and i think we'll have a better view of that probably as we exit the year.

our next question comes from the line of joe giordano of cowen and company. please proceed with your question.
joseph giordano -- cowen and company -- analyst
hi guys, thanks for taking my questions.
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
hi, joe.
joseph giordano -- cowen and company -- analyst
rob, you mentioned something, i think you said ce and auto something about changes in customer preferences, and i just wanted you to clarify exactly what you meant there and related to that, are you seeing any sort of noticeable shifts in market share for what you guys do, in markets that are impacted this much whether it be just market dynamics or trade or is that having any impact on who is supplying it now?
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
well, yes, i was alluding to i think factors that we've probably mentioned, but let me try to sort of them brush [phonetic] them up. now to the group, i think so i think in automotive, we have this factor where we globally companies have produced a lot of combustion engine cars and consumer is really less interested in buying those and we see that particularly in markets like china where capacity particularly for foreign automotive companies is that, no, it's a fraction of utilization. so you see those kind of trends going on, which means they're really, no pun intended slamming on the brakes. but then you have -- and yet as i was saying just previously the electric vehicle investments aren't flowing through in automotive. yes, so i think, i think those changes we see coming and some of the government incentives and some of the trade conflict that's going on, isn't helping that situation. so those are the sectors [phonetic] there. i think in consumer electronics what we see is we're seeing waves of investment, we saw our major wave obviously in 2017 around oled technology and new sensors and many new products right? and now we're seeing overall sales of unit slowdown, but there will be more features and technology coming and the most obvious example there i think is 5g, right? i think there's a lot of virtual reality and other sensor technology that we can expect to see coming in future, right? and i think inevitably, there will be also new form factors, new case technology, new products targeting new geographies and markets that have the potential to grow, as an example, markets like india and indonesia and markets such as that. so i think all of those give us confidence that we will see a return to investment and growth again, but none of that appears to be coming in the short term.
joseph giordano -- cowen and company -- analyst
are you seeing any evidence -- material evidence of your customers looking to retool outside of china, given what's happening there? and starting to build our production bases in other parts of the world?
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
what i would say is that that's been something that i think many companies we work with particularly in consumer electronics have had under consideration or have been activating on for quite a long time now. certainly, some of the larger korean manufacturers in the smartphone space and others certainly have scaled up manufacturing and are producing lower price point models in india as an example. so that's not new. i'm certainly hearing rhetoric around the ability to accelerate that and contract manufacturers data they are able to pivot into that space, but i don't have anything specific to tell you.

our next question comes from the line of richard eastman of robert w. baird & company. please proceed with your question.
richard eastman -- robert w. baird & company -- analyst
yes, good afternoon. robert, can i just follow up on the last kind of comments that you made there? one of the things that we have been seeing is just again in the smartphone market this movement of production outside of china. and you mentioned [indecipherable] and we've been kind of paying attention to that. in a scenario like that, have you seen your customers literally relying on capacity, subcontract capacity that's already in place or why is, is there not any demand coming from that incremental capacity that's being built outside of china to accommodate that movement? i mean, have you seen any indication of demand on your business? i mean it doesn't appear that way, but why should we not or why would we not expect to see that?
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
i think, here's what i do see for a number of companies we work with in the consumer electronic space. focusing on the india market, which is they are generally relying on their machine builders that they work within the existing capacity in china or in asia to fulfill that demand. so they're not scaling up. machine builders in india for instance they are more shipping product over and then opposed to that in some cases moving lines and commissioning and bringing them up on older models there. so i think that's the overall strategy that they are following and i think it's pretty small scale at the moment. and i think it couldn't -- be be much bigger in future.
richard eastman -- robert w. baird & company -- analyst
good and then just somewhat related, there is a lot of puts and takes right now going on in the small display oled display market. there's is a ironically some tariff issues between japan and korea and some of the specific materials that go into small displays or even large. but the chinese are building out their capacity around oled displays both small and large and we've talked maybe for the last 18 months about cognex broadening its exposure to in the ce market and i think one of those was oled. but has cognex experienced any of that demand? i mean just a shift in share and do we count all of the oled display manufacturers in asia as customers?
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
right. so we are seeing growth among -- with business that we're doing with chinese oled customers, right? so certainly, i think you're right in thinking that those manufacturers are seeing growth and investment. and in many cases, we're supplying those companies through machine builders in countries such as korea or japan, right? so that's why we are generally seeing that business increase. but to me it looks like it's sort of [phonetic] incremental and there's still a lot of capacity that was built out in '17 among the big players that still isn't being utilized. so i don't -- i think we were expecting some major increased investments as soon as next year, right? and i think maybe that's a little optimistic now depending on what happens. but i do think at some point, it is going to come.
richard eastman -- robert w. baird & company -- analyst
okay. and a related question, then i'm done. this may be counts as three but i'll think it 2.5, but was the reference you made earlier that the automotive industry, i think you explained of thought maybe coming out of the first quarter would be flattish for the full year. and now with the incremental weakness that we've seen, are we thinking down mid-single digits or we're down double-digits now for auto for the year?
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
i think we are now thinking down around 10%.
richard eastman -- robert w. baird & company -- analyst
i got you. okay, very good. thank you. thanks for the extra question.
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer

our next question comes from the line of josh pokrzywinski of morgan stanley. please proceed with your question.
josh pokrzywinski -- morgan stanley -- analyst
hi, good evening guys. i'll try to keep it seven questions or fewer. so i guess just first one more of a clarification than anything else rob, it looks like a lot of their consumer electronics decline shows up in the third quarter, which is just more seasonality than anything else i think going back prior third quarters had the same phenomenon. any other big end markets that show up third or fourth quarter that we should be aware of that are kind of seasonally larger, you mentioned logistics a little bigger in 2q and 4q, is auto weighted to some quarter in particular that we should keep in mind, we've [phonetic] done on the decline or when that comp gets easy?
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
yes, so i think q4 can benefit from larger logistics, a seasonally larger logistics. so i would anticipate that again this year. and then, q4 can benefit from automotive and in general, kind of budget flush in the path that goes on. but i'm really not anticipating that in the current environment we're in. so i think -- and then sequentially from q3, obviously europe tends to be very slow in q3 and then get back up to speed as they come back from vacations and make more investments in q4. so those are normal phenomenon that we see at -- in our markets.
josh pokrzywinski -- morgan stanley -- analyst
got it. that's helpful and then just kind of thinking back to the secular growth model here, i know cycles get in the way in those are shorter maybe medium-term phenomenon. but when you talk about penetrating customer's facility and having kind of more content there, if they're not spending money, there is no ability to gain content, but when that turns on, do you kind of catch-up from where you were, so maybe rephrase differently. you'll have a couple of years of easy comps in consumer electronics and auto heading into next year? do you -- can you kind of catch what you didn't get during that time period because customers wanted to spend they just weren't. or is it just a question of the cycle comes back and we start from kind of a reset base? that question makes sense?
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
yes, it does, it does. i would say in my 11 years with the company, i've seen difficult market conditions turn around and in times there can be very strong growth. i'm not predicting that here, please don't get me wrong, but in 2009 we grew going into 2010 by 65%, we had other -- we have obviously 2017, where we saw are after some years of a slow, i think '15 and '16, we grew 44%. so ours is a kind of market where you can see those kind of turns around and i'm not -- i'll just say again i'm not predicting anything there, i'm just saying that we see those kind of things can change quite quickly in our markets and we want to be sure when those things happen that we have the capacity and the products to keep our momentum going. the slow situation we have now is -- it's unusual. as we said we've grown for the last nine consecutive years. so we're in a bit of a new space here and it's hard to know when that will turn around and when we will return to growth and when we do, how quickly it will come.
josh pokrzywinski -- morgan stanley -- analyst

michael wyzga -- needham & company -- analyst
hi team, this is mike wyzga who's on the line for jim ricchiuti. thanks for taking the questions. first question was around the gross margins that we're looking at for q3, i guess the slight deterioration coming off of q2, and i just wanted to get a better sense is that gross margin compression we're looking at tied to revenue mix coming from logistics more than the consumer in the auto piece or is it more just the reduced revenue base that you're looking for?
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
yes, so gross margin in q3 is going to continue to be in a mid 70% target range, a little lower than we've reported tonight. we did have for q2 some higher margin revenue in the service area that hit the p&l that won't repeat in q3. and then some of it can have to do with the mix of business right as well, which can effect our gross margins, but i don't think and i don't think there is a tremendous amount of noise going on in our gross margin in q3 relative to q2 that you need to understand, it's not that material.
michael wyzga -- needham & company -- analyst
understood. and then can you also help us better understand the reallocation of resources when we're looking at your opex. is it a function of investing more in some of these smaller businesses that show potential for growth in the logistics business to help offset some of the larger markets where you're experiencing weakness? or how are we thinking about those expenses?
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
so we have very talented engineers and sales noids that we recruit and develop over time and they are great assets. so in times when we see the market slow down and rather than remove them, our culture is very important to us. we take a long-term view. so we're moving them, we tend [phonetic] to move them into areas where we see longer-term growth potential. an example would be we're relatively under-penetrated in the logistics market in china. but clearly, that's a large and high potential market for us. so while we're seeing a slowdown in those areas, we're able to leverage those noids we have and move them over would be one example, and that also areas like deep learning and life science where we see a lot of long-term potential and the need for talent. so that's really what we're doing and at the same time as we're doing that, we are being much more conservative about incremental spend that we're making and discretionary spend that we're making at this time. because obviously when the business isn't growing we want to try to keep the expenses relatively flat.
michael wyzga -- needham & company -- analyst

our next question comes from the line of matt summerville of da davidson. please proceed with your question.
matt summerville -- da davidson -- analyst
thanks. within the us, you talked about factory automation, a bit more from a regional standpoint with respect to europe and maybe asia. but with pmi sort of decelerating, industrial production decelerating arguably against pretty tough comparisons, have you started to see factory automation in north america start to roll over? and is that an incremental concern for you going forward into 2020?
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
right. i think -- the americas region and really united states, i would say is soft particularly in automotive where investment plans continue to be delayed and there's too much capacity and too many produced certainly. i would say we as a company. i think we understood that pretty early and we kind of -- we right-sized our efforts and i think our guidance or our forecasting around the americas market quite early. so i would say this is not really surprising us. the other factor we have in the americas is we have, it's our largest region for logistics and that's growing very, very strongly, right? so that's certainly helping to on a region-by-region basis make up for the slower areas in general, factory automation that we see in the americas. so overall, i think that's what we're seeing.

jairam nathan -- daiwa asset management -- analyst
hi, thanks for taking my questions, daiwa securities. so i just wanted to get some more color on operating expense and we saw in the qa [phonetic] you had mentioned that some of the declines year-on-year came from erp, a lesser expense on the erp side, and just trying to -- and with respect to r&d at this rate it could be -- it could imply your r&d expense might be flat year-over-year. so just wanted to try to understand how should we think about those for rest of this year and next?
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
i would say generally we don't give guidance around operating expense beyond what we've already told you. i'll just make a few general comment, i think operating expenses in q2 were slightly lower than our expectation given the environment where as we talked about reallocating resources to higher growth areas, and we continue to manage expenses without disrupting any major products under development, our long-term growth plans remain intact. and in the environment we're in it gives us a good opportunity to focus on driving productivity. we did make a major investment in implementing an erp system last year and there's plenty of opportunity to improve our processes and we're doing a lot of work in that area, which i think will will put us in good standing when the market comes back and were able to grow without necessarily adding much capacity.
jairam nathan -- daiwa asset management -- analyst
okay. and then just as a follow-up, which is -- we have seen some of the mobile terminal competitors starting -- talking about an over-inventory under [phonetic] distribution side. are you seeing a similar trend and can you just give -- update us on the progress we have made in that in that field?
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
yes. so we have our journey into the mobile terminal market. i think it is similar to other markets that we've entered over the last 15 years or so and where we're leveraging our technology and strengths. and certainly it continues to be an area for growth for us. the activity that we're seeing is encouraging. and while the business is still small in mobile terminals we expect their revenue this year to grow substantially. and so i think we're seeing that. and yeah, our customers are broadening, we've got some large well known company that are evaluating our product and particularly in areas of e-commerce and actually in airports and airlines. so we're certainly seeing some innovators starting to use our technology and the growth results are very strong on a percentage basis although up very small base.

hi. how is it going rob? question, just to clarify in terms of the european factory automation market, understanding your comments that one of the differentiators with north america is in that market, logistics is stronger, is it fair to say that factory automation in europe is more heavily to the automotive market, than it is perhaps some of the other verticals in your other geographies?
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
well, i think the european market is -- has a large automotive piece to it, as does america and asia tends to be more consumer electronics, right. that would be a broad brush. america is becoming less dependent on automotive as we broaden into logistics more quickly. i would say, but overall automotive is probably the biggest market for us in both america and europe or has been.

robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
right. so -- we announced we're staying with the same dividend currently but i'm going to -- i'll just pass it over to our treasurer, chris stagno. can you answer that?
chris stagno -- treasurer
hi, this is chris. thanks for the question. i think if you take a look at the, at the buyback program, we do have about $130 million -- available under the plan, we did about $104 million repurchase during q2. in terms of future purchases, i would expect us to continue to purchase, but the timing would be subject to market conditions, the potential uses of cash going forward.

robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
i think our r&d investment is probably pretty consistent and across those two periods and then certainly we have added considerably in terms of sales head count, particularly in europe through that period so [indecipherable] in logistics. so i think we're seeing that and certainly and anybody want to add more color than that, laura?

yeah. thanks a lot for passing it back to me. and ok, look, the outlook is clearly not what we expected and despite the fact that we know that automation and machine vision are key for the future for making everything from chocolate chips to computer chips and those are real examples, it's unsettling to see the slowdown that we're seeing now. we're hoping for better times and not only hoping for it, management is working very hard, looking at as rob mentioned, reallocating to those growth areas and that's reasonably easy for us to do. and also we're looking at some very exciting acquisition opportunities in the future to add to our growth. that's it from here. i wish we had better news to report and i'm sure in the future we will. thanks again for paying attention to cognex and for participating in today's call. good night.

operator
greetings, and welcome to the cognex's third quarter 2019 earnings conference call. [operator instructions]
it is now my pleasure to introduce susan conway, senior director of investor relations. thank you. please begin.
susan conway -- senior director of investor relations
thank you, and good evening, everyone.
with us today are cognex president and ceo, rob willett; vice president and corporate controller, laura macdonald; and cognex treasurer, chris stagno.
i'd like to point out that our earnings release and quarterly report on form 10-q are available on our investor relations website at investor.cognex.com. both contain highly detailed information about our financial results. during the call, we may use a non-gaap financial measure if we believe it is useful to investors or if we believe it will help investors better understand our results or business trends. you can see a reconciliation of certain items from gaap to non-gaap in exhibit 2 of the earnings release. any forward-looking statements we made in the earnings release or any that we may make during this call are based upon information that we believe to be true as of today. things often change, however, and actual results may differ materially from those projected or anticipated. you should refer to our sec filings, including our most recent form 10-k, for a detailed list of these risk factors.
with that, now i'd like to turn the call over to ceo, rob willett.
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
hello, everyone. thanks for joining us today.
i know most of you are used to hearing cognex's chairman, dr. bob shillman, welcome participants to our earnings call. dr. bob is unable to join us this evening due to a prior commitment. he sends his regards, and he looks forward to talking with you on our next call.
cognex delivered q3 results in line with our expectations, with revenue at the top end of our july guidance. that said, our revenue was down both year-on-year and sequentially as a result of the ongoing slowdown in manufacturing investment. the decline can be almost entirely attributed to consumer electronics, which decreased by approximately $50 million, roughly 50% from q3 of 2018. the automotive and the broader industrial sectors also continue to weaken due to persistent global economic uncertainty and trade conflicts, particularly in europe and china. that deterioration was partially offset by growth in logistics, which increased by approximately 50% year-on-year. we have confidence in our logistics strategy, and we believe we can continue to grow at that 50% rate over the long-term.
in logistics, well-known traditional brick-and-mortar retailers are starting to invest heavily in logistics automation to compete more effectively with their e-commerce competitors. they are changing their supply chain, and they are looking to cognex's industry-leading products to help them implement an automation strategy to fulfill orders rapidly, reliably and cost effectively. near-term market conditions notwithstanding, the long-term potential for machine vision and for cognex is unchanged. our long-term operating model remains intact, and with a target of 20% compound annual growth, mid-70s gross margin and 30% operating margin.
now, i'd like to say a few words about our recent acquisition of sualab, an outstanding technology company specializing in deep learning software to automate inspection tasks that are currently done by human visual inspectors. sualab is the type of acquisition that we like to do. it has an excellent engineering team, i'll expand on this in a few moments, and also is a great cultural fit. we believe that deep learning technology will be a major growth driver for cognex in the years ahead. for the first time, machine vision is reaching a level of performance that allows it to replace tens of thousands of humans globally, whose work it is to perform highly repetitive, visual inspection tasks, to identify cosmetic flaws and defects on products during their manufacture.
the market we serve today for machine vision using deep learning and factory automation is estimated at $100 million of annual revenue and is growing rapidly, we believe, by 75% per year. the largest and fastest growing segment of that market is the replacement of human inspectors in asia, particularly for electronic components and finished products where sualab is well positioned. the acquisition of sualab not only extends our deep learning capabilities for inspection application, it more than triples the size of the cognex team dedicated to developing and applying deep learning technology to industrial inspection tasks.
upon closing, we welcome the approximately 100 smart, ambitious and energetic new employees who share our passion for machine vision, the majority of whom are in engineering departments and are highly skilled in both contemporary programming techniques and applying deep learning to inspection tasks in the manufacturing process. led by co-founder song kiyoung, the sualab engineering team will continue to operate from its headquarters in downtown seoul. they will work closely with our team based in cambridge, massachusetts, which is led by reto wyss, a co-founder of vidi systems, which we acquired in 2017. the vidi acquisition established our deep planning development efforts and is the reason for our success in this area to-date.
here are a few more details on the acquisition that i'd like to share with you. the purchase price was $195 million. we paid $171 million in cash at closing. payment of the remaining $24 million is deferred until a later date. although sualab's revenue is modest, the price is justified by the high value of the company's substantial engineering team, its core technology developed over the last six years, and its experience applying that technology at very large companies in asia. we expect technology acquisitions to be accretive within two years, and it looks like sualab will fit within that model.
moving on to the next topic. we have published an updated view of our served market. you can find it on our investor relations website at investor.cognex.com. our new estimate of cognex's total served market for machine vision is $4.2 billion. this is a narrow definition of what we can serve with our current product offering. this estimate is 20% higher than our previous estimate as a result of both growth in the underlying market and new opportunities that are now addressable with cognex products. despite near-term challenging market conditions, we believe our served market will grow in the low teens over the long term, and we expect to continue to outperform market growth as a result of our superior technology and the strength of our customer relationships.
now i will turn the call over to laura for financial details from the third quarter. laura, the microphone is yours.
laura a. macdonald -- vice president and corporate controller
thank you, rob, and hello, everyone.
revenue in q3 was $183 million, at the high end of our expected range. revenue declined 21% year-on-year due to lower sales in consumer electronics, particularly smartphone manufacturing. revenue from automotive and the broader factory automation market also declined from q3 '18, partially offsetting the shortfall with growth in logistics.
gross margin of 74% was down slightly from q3 '18 and consistent with q2 '19 despite lower revenue. operating expenses declined from both q3 '18 and the prior quarter, reflecting reduced expenses for incentive compensation plans. we continue to be prudent with discretionary spending without changing product development plans. operating margin in q3 was 24%, representing a decline both year-on-year and sequentially due to the lower revenue environment. excluding discrete tax items, earnings per share were $0.23 in q3 '19 compared with $0.39 in q3 '18 and $0.27 in q2 '19.
looking at revenue growth year-on-year from a geographic perspective, the americas was the best performing region, increasing mid-teens year-on-year due to strong growth in logistics. the impact of this quarter's substantially lower contribution from consumer electronics was most noticeable in europe, where revenue declined by more than 45% year-on-year.
customers in greater china continue to defer their capital spending plans, resulting in low double-digit revenue decline year-on-year. this decline would have been greater in greater china and less extreme in europe if not for procurement changes made by certain customers in consumer electronics, shifting their purchases from china -- to china from europe. in the rest of asia, revenue was relatively flat with q3 '18.
turning to our strong balance sheet. we ended the quarter with $918 million in cash and investments and no debt. even after purchasing sualab, we have enough capital to support our organic growth objectives and m&a plans and for sharing our ongoing success with our shareholders through stock buybacks and dividends. in that regard, our board of directors has increased the quarterly cash dividend by 10% to $0.055 per share. the dividend is payable on november 29 to all shareholders of record on november 15.
now i'll turn the call back to rob.
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, laura.
moving next to guidance. we expect revenue for the fourth quarter will be between $155 million and $165 million, making it the lowest revenue-generating quarter this year compared with revenue of $193 million reported in q4 of 2018. industrial markets are significantly weaker today and continue to deteriorate, led by automotive. the contraction is most pronounced outside of the united states and particularly in business that relates to china.
unlike q3, we don't expect growth from logistics to offset the overall revenue shortfall in q4. even though logistics revenue grew by approximately 50% year-on-year in q3, we expect it to decrease year-on-year in q4. this is the result of a major customer delaying delivery of large orders for new sites.
gross margin for q4 is expected to be in the mid 70% range, consistent with the gross margin for q3. operating expenses are expected to increase by mid to high single digits on a sequential basis. approximately 4 percentage points are attributable to incremental costs for the sualab team, estimated amortization of intangibles and expenses associated with the acquisition.
the effective tax rate is expected to be 16%, excluding discrete tax items. i'd like to make you aware of two discrete tax items expected to be recorded in 2019. the first item involves changes to our corporate tax structure, which came about because of legislation passed by the european union. for that one, we expect a discrete tax benefit of between $100 million and $125 million and a slight increase to our 16% effective tax rate, excluding discrete events going forward.
the second item is our decision to move acquired sualab technology out of korea to align with our corporate tax structure. this is expected to result in a discrete tax expense of between $27 million and $33 million. these items continue to be evaluated, and because of that, we do not have more detail at this time.
with that, we will open the call for questions. operator, please go ahead.

operator
[operator instructions] thank you. our first question comes from the line of joe giordano with cowen and company. please proceed.
joe giordano -- cowen and company -- analyst
hey, guys. good evening.
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
hi, joe.
joe giordano -- cowen and company -- analyst
rob, could you size that big order that was pushed? and is it something that you just found out recently? is it something that you have visibility into, like, just delivering it after the quarter or something? i'm just trying to see how indicative it is of the logistics environment in general, or this is just kind of a one-off thing that gets fixed in a few weeks.
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. so it's a pretty substantial order. let me give you a bit of color on it. so, overall, our logistics funnel is strong and growing, but we expect lower revenue year-on-year from logistics in q4 as a result of this major customer delaying delivery of large orders to new sites. and this same customer did take substantial deliveries in q4 of last year. so many of these orders are on our books, awaiting delivery, which we now expect to result in revenue next year and not in q4. visibility of that is quite recent for us, but we see probably that some major integrators may have had some more specific understanding of that situation earlier. so, we continue to see strength in our logistics business, particularly among a broad base of customers who are growing very, very well indeed and remain confident that we can grow it 50% over the long run. but we now just don't expect to grow at that rate for the full year in 2019.
joe giordano -- cowen and company -- analyst
can i just clarify one thing there? so, this is an order you have received, right? this is not an order that you thought you might get that didn't materialize, this is an order that you already have though?
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
so it's an order that's coming in in many pieces, it's very substantial, right. so we don't have all of it, but we have many, much of it.
joe giordano -- cowen and company -- analyst
okay. and then i guess my follow-up. yeah, go ahead please.
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
i was going to sort of state it. i think it's really to do with changes at the customer, about their plans and the timing of their plans, which unfortunately for us is moving revenue out of this year and slowing down our overall growth rate in q4 and for the full year for logistics.
joe giordano -- cowen and company -- analyst
okay. my follow-up would be around china. obviously, a lot of talk around trade war and what a phase 1 agreement might do. how much of this stuff -- do you attribute like any of this weakness to that specifically? and if there is some sort of like phase 1 of 3 kind of deal coming out, does that change anything on the ground for you guys do you think any -- on the near term?
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
it's difficult to call but i have to say, yes. i mean, certainly, china is our softest region at the moment, and after being a real engine of growth for us for so many years, with customers there have a real wait-and-see mindset and they're very slow to place orders, and they continue to reduce and delay capital expenditures. so that's what we're seeing. and i think laura pointed out also the revenue from china in q3 benefited from purchases from certain consumer electronic customers that have started to purchase our products in china, when previously they bought them out of europe. so that's also maybe making our china numbers or the situation in china look better than it really is.
so how quickly will that turnaround? well, my experience with china, my experience with our business in general, is that when things do change, the business can come back very quickly. i've seen that on a number of occasions. i don't know whether this is really a different long-term situation, unlike what we've seen before, but i do happen to think if confidence can return, we see momentum in the other direction, we could see a quick recovery, but i just have no way of gauging if and when that will come.
joe giordano -- cowen and company -- analyst
fair enough. i have some others. i'll jump in queue though. thanks.
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from richard eastman with robert w. baird & co. please proceed.
richard eastman -- robert w. baird & co. -- analyst
yes, good afternoon. rob, could you put a little color around sualab. when we looked at their website, they have a pretty impressive customer list, and all the big majors on the consumer electronics side, it appears. and i'm curious, with very modest revenue presently, how is their product deployed? is it still kind of in a piloting phase? or is it deployed at a central location? or is it deployed on equipment itself? just kind of walk me through that, maybe just a little bit, and how quickly the revenue expectations can inflate, given the implication.
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
sure, sure. sualab has a business model, some -- very like vidi, right. so they sell suakit, a sophisticated deep learning machine vision software. and they have a very strong team of application engineers who help customers apply it, right. so the majority -- the vast majority of that business today, over the trailing 12 months, is related to that, right. and -- but i think more excitingly, i think what we see the potential is to take that technology, and they're already working on this, and to deploy it through machine builders to help it scale much in the way that we have in our consumer electronics business over the last five years or so.
we, of course, have a great network of machine builders and integrators who can help them speed that up. and then they have some very nice application-specific related products in their pipeline that we think will be very powerful in changing this market. so there's a base kind of business that i would describe very much like vidi, very, very good technology with some relative strengths and differences compared to vidi, and then some very interesting opportunities to apply more application-specific products through machine builders in a form that should be more scalable in the coming years and where we are very well positioned to help them.
richard eastman -- robert w. baird & co. -- analyst
okay. all right. and then just a follow-up on this issue that you raised about a consumer electronics customer purchasing in china for china versus prior. it was purchased -- product was purchased out of europe. what predicated that switch? is it a currency issue? why is there a shift there and where the purchases are occurring for presumably the same application?
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. i'm sort of limited into of what i can say specifically about the internal workings of our large customers. but i think, certainly in that case, perhaps due to some of the trade situations we're seeing and tax consequences and other things, they've decided they want to purchase from us locally in china rather than out of a subsidiary in europe. it doesn't really change the nature of the work we do nor does it really change our profitability on the business, generally speaking, but it just does mean where you see it show up in region is different.
richard eastman -- robert w. baird & co. -- analyst
okay. and that had started this quarter?
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
laura?
laura a. macdonald -- vice president and corporate controller
materially this quarter, yeah.
richard eastman -- robert w. baird & co. -- analyst
okay. okay, very good. thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of josh pokrzywinski with morgan stanley. please proceed.
josh pokrzywinski -- morgan stanley -- analyst
hi, good evening guys.
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
hi, josh.
josh pokrzywinski -- morgan stanley -- analyst
just want to follow up on the logistics comment, maybe some more color about some of the lumpiness there. i guess, first of all, can you talk us through kind of the concentration from a customer perspective? in that case, it sounds like there was some large order that got pushed. but is this going to be something kind of analogous to the electronics side with your large customer there, where we do see lumpiness just related to one customer really driving kind of the quarter-to-quarter cadence?
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, ok. so you have two questions that are sort of what's that kind of customer mix in logistics and how does that play out in terms of lumpiness in the business. in our logistics business today, we have a handful of large important customers, right, who can be ordering a substantial amount from us in the order of $10 million to $20 million in a quarter. it would not necessarily be unusual, i think, in terms of how we see them playing out. and those orders are based often on their automation plans, that's how they roll them out, right? so i think that does have the potential to move revenue in and out of quarters. and i think that's probably going to become -- that is probably a reality of our logistics business going forward. and then, we have many, many smaller customers who might be buying very small amounts, up to a few million dollars. and there's a good base of that business that looks much more consistent overall.
and that business actually is -- when we look at it, it's growing faster than our overall business. we expect that probably to go on as our technology becomes easier to integrate, more widely known and accepted, and as we develop our own capability and our integrated network to deliver it. but in kind of answering your question here, we have a handful of customers, and i think the one we reference not by name but today, and i could certainly think of others, may mean that our revenue, as it plays out in the coming quarters, will be lumpy in logistics, and we'll just try to give you a heads up to that. we're really in this for the long term. we see a big change going on, and our 50% long-term growth strategy is all based around that. so i think we're relatively comfortable with the fact that may change, but we realize we need to explain it to you as soon as we see it, as we are doing now. and sometimes, that can -- it can move.
josh pokrzywinski -- morgan stanley -- analyst
understood. that's helpful. and then, just taking a step back from consumer electronics, obviously weakness there has been perpetuated for a couple reasons. obviously, the tough comp coming off of some of the -- the oled roll-outs a couple of years ago, and then your general weakness in the electronics industry in 2019. but we are starting to see kind of select green shoots from folks in the broader definition of capital equipment, maybe products that will come off a lot different from what cognex is supplying, but some kind of early indicators that 2020 will be better. i guess from your perspective, you guys don't get a lot of that color until more of the 2q time frame, but is there anything you can share with us either on kind of product roadmaps, any kind of technology shifts that you see out there, that would maybe help define important things to watch for 2020, understanding now that you have kind of a couple of years of easy comp starting to build out?
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. okay, josh. i think i'll point to a few things, but these are really just reprising what i've said before. we really get a better view of our consumer electronics business in q2 when we're reporting the q1 next year. i think that's when we'll have a real read on how it's shaping up.
always, i would say, at this stage, there's a lot of interesting stuff in the consumer electronics pipeline that we have some visibility on. the question is sort of how well it's funded and able to be implemented as we get into the year. i mean obvious kind of things that could really help and be a big tailwind for the business overall next year, 5g, is a very obvious one. to what degree that is implemented and the technical challenges around implementing it, there are always new features. we have a line of sight on coming in, in the electronics market. so that can really drive, but again, it's interesting to see which ones make it in each year.
and then as you mentioned, the roll-out of oled, specifically as it relates to high-end phones, foldable screens, that definitely has the life in it as i think you can see by reading the paper, but that's some technology where -- but there's a lot of value that cognex can add. and then i think the headwinds would remain those still -- now there is -- one of the largest smartphone companies in the world is one we can't sell to. so that certainly is an ongoing headwind and i'd like that situation to change and i think so would they. but at the moment, that's a potential problem for us.
josh pokrzywinski -- morgan stanley -- analyst
and just one final one i'd like to squeeze in there. were you doing business with that company before and now you can't? is there any way to size kind of what that missed opportunity was? and i'll leave it there.
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. i think we don't really like to talk about customers by name specifically, but you can assume -- i mean, we're the leading machine vision manufacturer in the world. so any company that's performing advanced discrete manufacturing is likely a cognex customer. and you would expect a big electronics company to be doing -- certainly to be doing a few million dollars or more with us.
josh pokrzywinski -- morgan stanley -- analyst
understood. thanks.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of joseph ritchie with goldman sachs. please proceed.
joseph ritchie -- goldman sachs -- analyst
thanks. good afternoon, everyone.
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
joe.
joseph ritchie -- goldman sachs -- analyst
so rob, just a few quick ones. maybe just following up on that question on electronics visibility in 5g, how much visibility will you have as the year progresses? and what do you think the timing of that visibility will be? will it be kind of early next year? would you know by 1q? i'm just trying to get a sense for timing and visibility.
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, i think we'll be in a position to give you a clear view of that as we have in past years when we report our q1 results. i guess that is end of april -- end of april. we may have -- we'll probably have visibility earlier than that. i think it's -- my experience now, having been through a number of cycles, is there's a lot of stuff there in the funnel, but in reality, the overall view of the market and what gets rolled out really doesn't crystallize until that kind of time frame. and that's very different than our other markets. we sometimes liken [phonetic] it to they're building the airplane as it's going down the runway in that industry. so, we do have quite late visibility as to what really makes it into the final build.
joseph ritchie -- goldman sachs -- analyst
yeah. that's fair enough. and then just, i know we've been talking about this topic a little bit on the call already, but the customer delaying the decision on large orders to new sites. can you maybe give us a little bit of color on why there was a deferral?
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
it has to do with their plans to roll out automation, their automation plans and delays are changing that, right? and those are delays that are related to that company and their plans, not to do -- not related to cognex vision and our ability to meet that demand, but i don't -- i can't get more into specifically what and where that customer is finding those issues.
joseph ritchie -- goldman sachs -- analyst
okay. got it. i guess i was just trying to get a sense for whether it was like liquidity issue from a customer perspective or whether it was just managing too much and having the capacity to roll this out?
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
no. this is a very, very substantial company. it's not -- it's really much more about engineering and automation product roll-out and plan rather than anything to do with financial or anything to do with cognex's ability to fulfill those orders that we have on our books and are expecting to complete on our books soon.
joseph ritchie -- goldman sachs -- analyst
got it. okay. and then one quick one. i may have missed it earlier, but you mentioned on sualab, the accretion within two years. what's the expectation then from a financial perspective for next year?
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
i don't think we've -- so generally we have a policy of not talking about the forecast for next year, for the full year. so we're not currently disclosing that. but obviously, we're looking for some significant growth from that. and obviously based on what i've said, it would be dilutive to us next year.
joseph ritchie -- goldman sachs -- analyst
okay. got it. thank you.
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. and accretive in two years, and i think we'll be in a better position to give you more detail on that when we report the full year as well. it's still a relatively recent acquisition for us.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of paul coster with jpmorgan. please proceed.
paul chung -- jpmorgan -- analyst
this is paul chung on for coster. thanks for taking our question. so just another follow-up on the sualab acquisition. why now on this? and is this kind of customer-driven demand? or is this part of your vision for capturing some incremental offerings across your verticals? and if you could also talk about some of your cross-selling benefits here with their existing consumer base. i have a follow-up.
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. sure. i mean i think the right way to view it is at cognex, we pride ourselves on having a deep understanding about the technology and the application for machine vision. and we spent a great deal of time studying those. and we've talked about logistics and how we see that's kind of hitting -- has hit a tipping point where the need for automation is changing. there's another tipping point going on currently in the world of machine vision, and it has to do with the deep learning technology and it's progress, and it's huge technology development going on in that space. and the potential it provides to replace human visual inspectors in electronics, of whom there are tens of thousands in asia. and the technology is getting to the point where it's really now a very attractive market opportunity, and large customers really see that.
and they're very interested to work with us. they face a lot of challenges around finding people to staff, human visual inspection, visual inspection not being very effective. human visual inspector might be 85% effective in their work in catching defects while machine vision has the capability to be 99.9% effective. so, there's a very good return on investment. that, i think, pretty clear to us and to the big electronics customers that we see in asia. so i think that's the reason why this is happening now and why we're so positive about it. i think we're also fortunate in that we acquired vidi 2.5 years ago, and we really had the chance through owning them to see the potential, but seeing that potential also made us realize that we needed more engineers and we needed more reach and engineering capability in asia, where this market really is.
so as we looked at that and we worked on it, we really realized that sualab is really right in the sweet spot of all of that. then we got to know them. i think we've developed a lot of mutual respect for one another. and we were so pleased to see a fantastic cultural fit, which for us is really important at cognex because we like to buy acquisitions. we like to buy companies that have great engineers and great growth potential. and the amount of excitement that, that creates in us and in them is something that works very well for us. and we did that with vidi. we've done that with chiaro and other acquisitions we've made over the years.
so the more we drill, the more we got to know each other, the more we understood the market, the more we talk to large customers in the space and saw where sualab is working, the more exciting we got and easier it was in our minds to justify making this for us a pretty substantial acquisition.
paul chung -- jpmorgan -- analyst
okay. thanks for that. and then switching gears, on free cash despite material lower revenues and earnings. can you just talk about the puts and takes of what's driving your working cap conversion benefits this year relative to last. is this kind of temporary in nature or is there some things more structural going on and how you see working cap trends over the next six months? thanks.
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. let me ask laura macdonald to answer that. do you need more clarification?
laura a. macdonald -- vice president and corporate controller
well, let me see if i can answer. you let me know if you need more clarification. but one of the noticeable changes in our balance sheet is our decline in our inventory balance, which has come down in q3 as we delivered on large opportunities and ship recently introduced new products, and we've worked that down nicely from the end of the year. we believe we now have enough inventory balance at an appropriate level. so that was one noticeable change in working capital, is -- did that answer your question?
paul chung -- jpmorgan -- analyst
yeah, somewhat. thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from line of matt summerville with da davidson. please proceed.
matt summerville -- da davidson -- analyst
hi. thanks. maybe just two quick questions. first, with respect to the americas, can you provide a little bit more granular detail in terms of what you're seeing across the different end markets there? you mentioned logistics. but i could have missed it, just any more color in terms of what you're seeing there would be helpful.
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
sure. hi, matt. yeah. so pretty much like all of our end regions, the americas region is soft, but particularly in automotive. but i would say, relative to other regions, i think we saw that softness early this year, and now it's more stable. it's not -- we're not seeing declining rates we're seeing elsewhere. the -- i think as we look at the market overall, we're seeing a lot of uncertainty and delays. and automotive is our
biggest market in the americas. and we're not anticipating a sort of a significant budget flush in americas or anywhere, really, that we might expect at the end of the year. so that's kind of baked in our guidance.
the americas has a relatively better growth profile than elsewhere, also as a result of a higher weight in logistics. it's a home market where we have relatively more business in logistics than anywhere else, and that's a business that is growing very, very strongly. so that's also helping our results in this region. other industries in the americas, just out of interest, that -- other industries that are holding up well, medical-related business, food and beverage, and packaging. there, we're doing ok. they're -- i think they're all growing currently despite the difficult market conditions, but -- and logistics is growing well. but then certainly, automotive is much more challenging overall.
matt summerville -- da davidson -- analyst
got it. and then are you able to parse out between what the year-over-year revenue changes would have looked like had that customer not changed geographic, i'll call it, procurement strategy, just to try and bridge that instead of europe being down mid-40s, maybe what would that have been down instead of china being down low teens, maybe what would that have been down, if that change didn't happen?
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, there's still quite a lot of moving parts as we come through the end of the quarter. so, i don't think we're going to try to do that, per se. laura, do you want to add...
laura a. macdonald -- vice president and corporate controller
yeah. i think we -- and that's kind of pro forma information that we haven't prepared to disclose.
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. so we're not really ready to give you a read on that yet.
matt summerville -- da davidson -- analyst
okay. got it. thank you, guys.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of karen lau with gordon haskett. please proceed.
karen lau -- gordon haskett -- analyst
thanks. good afternoon, everyone. just a quick one on opex. i think you mentioned about 4 points of the sequential increase is due to sualab, but you also mentioned there is some amortization there. i just want to clarify how much of that would you say is sort of one-time that shouldn't really continue into next year? and how much should we really put in the base number as we project forward?
laura a. macdonald -- vice president and corporate controller
sure, i can answer that, karen. so the 4 percentage points represents the sualab team ongoing operating expenses in addition to an estimate of amortization of intangibles, but we're still in the process of finalizing the purchase price allocation. so we don't know exactly what those numbers will be. but i can tell you that we expect the majority of $170 million that we'll allocate to be assigned to goodwill. so that 4% there was a small percent that i would say is non-recurring. most of the 4%, like 3% of the 4%, i'd say, would be recurring. and again, we expect most of the purchase price will be allocated to goodwill.
karen lau -- gordon haskett -- analyst
okay. got it. so parsing out the 4 points sequential increase that is related to sualab, the core spending would be the remaining 4 points. i noticed that in the third quarter, you -- in terms of opex, it looks like you underspend a little bit versus your guide. is the sequential uptick more -- in the core opex spending more of a timing issue? or should we read into that as maybe some of the pent-up investment coming back or maybe you're positioning for some projects next year? how should we think about that?
laura a. macdonald -- vice president and corporate controller
yeah, i think what you saw us underspending a little compared to the guidance in q3 related primarily to adjustments to our incentive compensation plans.
karen lau -- gordon haskett -- analyst
okay. i guess -- ok. thank you. and then just, i guess, taking it more broadly into next year, rob, let's say, for whatever reason, whether it's stabilization or consumer electronics start to turn next year, i would imagine you've been doing -- you guys have been doing a good job in quote unquote cutting the crap, but also, there is probably some pent-up spending that might have to come back at some point. so let's say the end markets start to turn next year, would you expect sort of a normal type of incremental margins to be realized? or do you think that given so many things have been kind of -- investment and spending-wise -- have been delayed this year because of the environment, there is more sort of catch-up spending that needs to happen next year if things start to get better? i'm just trying to get a sense of the incremental that you would expect.
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
yes. okay. it's an interesting question, karen. at the moment, i'm not expecting sort of that kind of our markets to recover very strongly going into next year, but it's obviously -- i think it's really too early to talk about next year. but here's what i can say, i think we run cognex for the long term. so we're not kind of cutting back on important things that are essential to our three-year growth strategies. in fact, we go on investing in those things that we consider essential. and i think through what is, obviously, a much lower rate of increase in spending, we've been able to keep our new products on track and our plans intact. so, i'd say that's the case.
now if i then go back and i look at times when we have seen a big recovery in our markets or a big incremental step-up in growth that i'm talking about years like 2010, 2014, 2017, where we had growth in excess of 30%, the pull-through in those years is awesome, right? given our kind of gross margins, and there isn't a great need to add an additional incremental expense related to growth like that. so i would expect if and when our markets recover. and if they come back strongly, as they had, we should see very, very good fall-through on incremental revenue.
karen lau -- gordon haskett -- analyst
okay. so there is no kind of delay in spending that what have to be catch-up, kind of regardless of how much end market come back next year?
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
well, i think the thing to point out would be incentive compensation really, so that is -- this is a year where we're not achieving our budget, and we're certainly paying out much less incentive compensation. so if we went back to a normal year, then it will be a step-up in that, and we'll get back to a strong year, it will be a significant step-up in that.
karen lau -- gordon haskett -- analyst
okay. thank you.
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of jim ricchiuti with needham. please proceed.
michael cikos -- needham & company -- analyst
hey, guys. this is mike cikos on for jim ricchiuti. just a couple of questions here. the first, coming back to the delayed shipments for this logistics customer, i wanted to get a better sense. it sounds like this is one of your larger customers. and i know you kind of scoped the large customers contributing as much as $10 million to $20 million per quarter, not being unusual. fair to assume that this customer coming in at the higher end of that range, if not higher than that $20 million bogey.
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
it's -- we're not sure exactly where it would come in and -- but perhaps the order of magnitude and yeah, in a range of significance, probably south -- not as much as $20 million, but -- and it all depends on how much of the orders, we would expect them to take in a particular quarter. and i do just want to clarify, you wouldn't take that number and multiply it by four to get the size of the customer, right? it would be just more like customers have plans. they rolled out at a certain cadence, and that may mean a quarterly revenue for any particular customer might be on that order of magnitude. and that might be the kind of level of challenge that we're seeing in headwind this quarter.
michael cikos -- needham & company -- analyst
i see. okay. and i guess, if you would say that the logistics business because of this q4 shift is not expected to grow 50% year-on-year, how fast is it growing in 2019 then based on what you currently have in hand?
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
yes, that's not a number we're going to disclose at this time, right? we've told you q3, we're going to sort of see how things play out in q4. and then we might have more to give you a better view of that when the year is over.
michael cikos -- needham & company -- analyst
i see. okay. and then just one final question, if i may, on the gross margin front, i was interested in hearing how you guys are able to maintain, call it this mid-70s percent gross margin versus q3 on the lower revenue base is part of that mix shift? or is there anything else we should be thinking about in that?
laura a. macdonald -- vice president and corporate controller
yeah. that was a result of the revenue mix in the quarter.
michael cikos -- needham & company -- analyst
great. thank you guys.
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of andrew buscaglia with berenberg. please proceed.
andrew buscaglia -- berenberg capital markets -- analyst
hey, guys. quick question. so consumer electronics, can you comment if that continued to get worse from q2? it sounds like auto is somewhat stabilized, but how would you characterize consumer electronics?
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
well, i would say, consumer electronics has kind of played out as we expected this year based on what we told you in april. i think -- if i think back and we certainly -- we were unhappy to discover back at that time that our customers in consumer electronics, we're really looking at a very dry year, and i think we kind of had eyes on that and communicated at that point. and it's played out as we expected. so annual revenue from consumer electronics is on track to decline by roughly one-third this year. and it represented 30% of our business in 2018. and it's particularly as a result of smartphone manufacturing, and the decline you'll see is most notable in our european region, followed by china and the rest of asia, but it's certainly been a year of diminished investment, and i think that as we expected.
michael cikos -- needham & company -- analyst
and just to confirm, you said -- i think you said in the prepared remarks, it was down 50% year-over-year.
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
so revenue for consumer electronics in q3 declined by approximately 50% year-on-year or nearly $50 million, due particularly to smartphone manufacturing.
michael cikos -- needham & company -- analyst
okay. okay. thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of ben rose with battle road research. please proceed.
ben rose -- battle road research -- analyst
yes. hi, robert and susan. rob, can you identify the industry of the customer in the logistics -- for the logistics product?
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
it's a large customer of ours in logistics. so you can assume it's either e-commerce or retail.
ben rose -- battle road research -- analyst
okay. okay. i just wanted to be sure that...
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
it's not -- it's not airport baggage handling or bridge tool, which might be the other thing. that's why you can see some large chunks of business, but that's not what it is.
ben rose -- battle road research -- analyst
okay. and then just a question on sualab's -- are the customers today for their product, are they primarily the korean oem manufacturers? do they have any penetration -- meaningful penetration thus far outside of korea?
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, their main markets are in korea and china and vietnam, overall, and they're really with them. chinese and korean electronics or electronic components manufacturers doing inspection. and -- but i -- something we like about them is they're really -- they, like us, really have close high-level engineering relationships with senior engineers at those companies. so it's not -- they're not trying to move that product through the oem machine build there. it's being pulled by the end user who really -- many of them are employing many thousands of visual inspectors and are looking to see better cost and performance out of that aspect of their business.
ben rose -- battle road research -- analyst
okay. and sorry, just one final perhaps. has the company actually validated the technology with the kind of reduction in visual inspectors that you mentioned earlier in the call in the order of hundreds or hundreds or thousands of visual inspectors being replaced by the technology?
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
absolutely. yes, yes. i don't think we would have acquired the company had we not done our due diligence on that for sure, right? now there is -- and we ourselves on cognex before we met sualab, see opportunities where our electronics customers really are very interested and have been previously unable to replace those visual inspectors with machine vision. and so, we're seeing a lot of interest from them as a result of this news.
ben rose -- battle road research -- analyst
okay. thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of karen lau with gordon haskett . please proceed.
karen lau -- gordon haskett -- analyst
hey. thanks for taking my follow-up. rob, i'm just curious on consumer electronics and -- or maybe broadly, more in china, there's been stories about chinese companies kind of future proofing their supply chain. i don't know if that's the right word to use. but just sort of in light of like blacklisting or all of a sudden, they get cut off from their us suppliers. i think that is more concentrated in like kind of chips manufacturing, that sort of thing, but i wasn't sure if you are seeing any of that sentiment in areas that you participate in china. maybe you can talk a little bit about that?
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
yes, karen. so the answer is we're looking for that, and we're really not seeing it among our customers. i can really only think of one instance that i've heard of where a chinese company -- you didn't -- and it's not a company we would -- any of us would know readily. didn't -- was concerned that didn't want to do business with us because we were american. so that's not widespread. and i think what you're reading about is much more components and chips technology in that way. i think the other thing important to realize is our technology basically doesn't -- isn't owned inside the us or sold from the us per se, right, in terms of how we're recognized by our customers. so i think that also somewhat insulates us from this. but clearly, what we've seen with one of the largest and some companies where we might become unable to sell to them, if that was a real threat on a larger scale, that would be a big problem for us.
karen lau -- gordon haskett -- analyst
okay. so nothing beyond far away that you're seeing that concerns you in terms of chinese companies sourcing from suppliers from other geographies?
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
correct.
karen lau -- gordon haskett -- analyst
okay. got it. thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of joe giordano with cowen. please proceed.
joe giordano -- cowen and company -- analyst
hey. thanks for taking my follow-ups here. on sualab again i understand the geographic presence that bring in the engineering capabilities. is this a fundamentally different products than bd or is this something that you foresee over time like one offering globally that's integrated as whenever you guys may call it or is it one thing or is it two kind of things?
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
hi, joe. and i should say, this is the last question i think we have time for, but i know i'll answer it. so a point from earlier, i think you might have asked the question what do we bring to sualab, and i think what we do bring is a lot of customer relationships and a big sales footprint in the market. so i think i just still want to make that point. this is all -- this is very much complementary, i think, for both companies and the synergies on the growth side for both of us working together. but your question related to what -- can you repeat that again? i'm sorry.
joe giordano -- cowen and company -- analyst
like, are these two fundamental -- fundamentally different things vidi and sualab, or is this something that ultimately is like one team, one integrated product that cognex offers?
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. i'm sorry, yes. so they're quite similar products. so deep learning software could do various functions, and we've developed with vidi certain functions that really relates more to our end markets where we've been focused, particularly automotive and based on our geographical presence, right? and sualab has some strong tools and capabilities that relate to asian visual inspection. so similar but develops in different ways, right? i would -- i would say that.
and then because they have a big footprint of engineers and application engineers in asia, they have the ability to help unlock a lot of potential that we see in that market where we didn't have that capability. so they bring a lot of engineering and application capability, which could be applied to either vidi or to sualab, right? and then we have a big sales network where we have a pent-up demand that they can help unlock. so that's kind of where the complementary parts of the business go. but the product itself, vidi and suakit are quite similar. there's quite a lot of overlap with quite a few complementary strengths around specific tools, capabilities, user interfaces and other key elements.
joe giordano -- cowen and company -- analyst
that's very helpful. and if you don't mind, just like a one -- you can answer it in two words if you want, but the medical, food and beverage, and consumer at verticals that we don't spend a lot of time talking about, do you expect those to be up this year?
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
yes. we do.
joe giordano -- cowen and company -- analyst
all right. thank you.
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
thank you. we have reached the end of the call. i will now turn it back over to mr. rob willett for closing remarks.
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
thank you. so while our results are not what we'd hoped for at the start of this year, we are confident in the future role of machine vision and in the long-term prospects for cognex. thank you for joining us tonight. we look forward to speaking with you on our next quarter's call. good night.

greetings. welcome to cognex second quarter 2020 earnings conference call. [operator instructions]
please note, this conference is being recorded. i will now turn the conference over to susan conway, senior director of investor relations. thank you. you may begin.
susan conway -- senior director of investor relations
good evening, everyone. thank you for joining us today. with us are cognex' chairman, dr. bob shillman; president and ceo, rob willett; and chief financial officer, paul todgham. i'd like to point out that our earnings release and quarterly report on form 10-q are available on our investor relations website at www.cognex.com/investor. both contain highly detailed information about our financial results. during the call, we may use a non-gaap financial measure if we believe it is useful to investors are we believe it will help investors better understand our results or business trends. you can see a reconciliation of certain items from gaap to non-gaap in exhibit two of the earnings release. any forward-looking statements we made in the earnings release or any that we may make during this call are based upon information that we believe to be true as of today. things often change, however, and actual results may differ materially from those projected or anticipated. for a detailed list of risk factors, you should refer to our sec filings, including our most recent form 10-k and subsequent quarterly report on form 10-q.
now i'd like to turn the call over to dr. bob.
dr. robert j. shillman -- chairman and founder
thanks, sue. hello, everyone, and welcome to our second quarter of 2020 earnings call. it has been a very busy three months since i talked to you on our last earnings call. and as you know, since that time in our business and most others have deteriorated substantially due to the worldwide government ordered shutdowns attributed to covid-19, because of that, we had to make difficult measures to align our company to the slowdown, and that resulted in large writedowns in q2, which severely affected our reported financial results. the details on those results and on what cognex has been doing this past quarter,
i'll turn the call over to my partner, cognex' ceo, rob willett. rob, the microphone is yours.
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, dr. bob, and good evening, everyone. tonight, cognex announced financial results for q2 of 2020 that reflect the difficult business environment we expected when we talked with you in april. good news to report is that revenue increased by 1% over the prior quarter. this was better than we anticipated due to our faster than expected delivery on a substantial backlog of orders from the logistics market. cognoids worked hard to manage our supply chain and deliver cognex products to customers despite significant component shortages. however, revenue declined by 15% year-on-year due to lower spending by customers in europe and the americas. the downturn was most noticeable in the automotive market, which was our largest end market in 2019. growth in logistics, semi and life sciences helped offset that decline. business activity is improving, but demand in many of our markets is weak and is expected to remain so through the end of the year. despite that, there are two areas of strength in our business that are contributing positively. one is the e-commerce sector of logistics. even though most retail stores, airport baggage handling customers and postal accounts are struggling, major online and big-box retailers are stepping up their investments in cognex' machine vision to enable higher throughput and productivity in their distribution centers. the other sector that's doing well is consumer electronics. we are now delivering large deployments of cognex products that we expect will be recognized as revenue in q3. in addition, we are pleased with how productive our sales team has been during these times of limited customer access. salesnoids and application engineers have been successful holding technical discussions and product demonstrations via video conferencing, and winning a lot of business in this manner, even with new customers. next, let's talk about the plan we announced during q2 to lower cognoid headcount by 8%.
the decision was a difficult one, given our company culture and the value we placed on perseverance, but it was something we had to do given the circumstances. we entered 2020 staffed to achieve significant new revenue levels, perhaps exceeding $1 billion in one year or two. but unfortunately, that is unlikely to occur due to the economic disruption, and therefore, we rightsized the team for more modest near-term growth. as part of the restructuring, we saw an opportunity to reduce duplication and redundancies that have built up in our business from years of global expansion and acquisitions. we reorganized our engineering teams around the world in a way that we believe sharpens our focus on specific growth areas and enables us to leverage cognex' unique capabilities more efficiently. after the restructuring, we still have the capacity for significant growth. we've not changed our product road map, nor have we delayed new product development. we are also moving forward with other initiatives such as it systems upgrades, process improvements and projects to support future growth. another development in q2 that i want to address is our writedown of a portion of the deep learning technology that we acquired in october with sualab. we are confident in our deep learning strategy and believe sualab has an important role to play. however, sualab's technology requires hands on application engineering and in person collaboration with customers, and that's difficult to do in the current environment. as a result, our projected revenue for sualab has been pushed out, thereby reducing the value of that asset. we continue to be bullish about our overall deep learning business. deep learning's bookings have increased by more than 50% year-on-year, making it our fastest-growing product category. a major step was the launch of cognex' in-sight d 900 smart camera in april. the d 900 makes advanced deep long technology accessible at the tens of thousands of manufacturers who have standardized their factory automation on our industry-leading in-sight platform. initial sales are growing nicely as customers discover how effectively the d 900 finds defects on complex parts and accurately reads badly deformed, skewed and poorly etched codes. in other product news, we launched the in-sight 8505 p, a high-performance five megapixel smart camera with cognex hdr plus technology that is ideal for integrating into tight spaces on production lines. it's important for our asia region, where electronics manufacturers and oems value its combination of precision, speed and small form factor for demanding applications, such as inspecting assembled devices for manufacturing defects. we're proud of these new insight products and doubly proud to have launched them in the current environment. they demonstrate the advantage that our culture brings as we effectively work together during these challenging times. while many cognoids are still working from home, we're maintaining our product development plans and remaining on schedule with our operations and process improvement plans. regarding supply, managing our global supply chain continues to be a challenge currently, but we're navigating well under the circumstances. in q2, we saw some vendors struggle to supply parts. we also continue to see freight deliveries taking longer and costing significantly more. our close relationship with suppliers and our practice of holding substantial component inventory have helped us in the current crisis. even so, we recognize and continue to plan for the possibility of supplier and customer closures and further disruption down the road.
let's now turn to details from our second quarter. paul, over to you.
paul todgham -- senior vice president of finance and chief financial officer
thank you, rob, and hello, everyone. as you know, cognex is known for being straightforward. we typically discuss our results almost exclusively on a gaap basis, but we believe some pro forma disclosures will be helpful this quarter, given the actions we took in q2. with that in mind, let's get into the details. revenue for the quarter was $169 million, which was better than we expected, but still weak. that level represented a substantial decline year-on-year in the broad factory automation market, particularly automotive. the impact was most noticeable in europe and the americas because of widespread business disruptions in both regions, partially offsetting the decline was growth in logistics, where e-commerce fulfillment customers performed well. logistics also increased on a sequential basis.
that growth, combined with returning production in china, offset the decline we experienced in other areas of our business from q1 to q2. reported gross margin was 70%, which included a reserve of $7.7 million for excess inventory resulting from the business decline. gross margin was 75%, excluding that noncash charge, which is consistent with q1. it was slightly better than we expected due to a favorable product mix and improving gross margins in logistics. operating expenses in q2 included a restructuring charge of $14.8 million, primarily for the workforce reduction discussed by rob. our restructuring actions were substantially completed by the end of the quarter. we expect a residual charge of between $1 million to $2 million in the second half, primarily in q3. we also recorded a noncash charge of $19.6 million in q2 and primarily to writedown a portion of the intangible assets from our acquisition of sualab. excluding these onetime charges, the combined total of rd&e and sg&a declined by 14% on a sequential basis as expected. the decrease was due to lower stock option expense and savings from actions we implemented early in q2, including lower travel entertainment costs, prudent management of discretionary spending, and a restricted hiring plan. we reported an operating loss in q2 because of the charges for the restructuring actions, intangible asset impairment and inventory writedown. excluding these charges, operating margin was 21%, which was approximately 800 basis points higher on a sequential basis. the decline year-on-year was due to the lower revenue as compared with q2 of 2019. the effective tax rate in q2 was 19%, excluding discrete tax items. that was higher than we expected because we now believe more of our profits in 2020 will be earned and taxed in higher tax jurisdictions. on a non-gaap basis, earnings were $0.18 per share in q2 compared with $0.28 in q2 of 2019 and $0.11 in q1 of 2020, excluding discrete tax items and the three charges just mentioned. looking at the change in revenue for q2 year-on-year from a geographic perspective, our best-performing region was asia, which increased by low single digits year-on-year. higher revenue from consumer electronics and semi offset a decline in automotive. our customers in asia are now largely back to work and in that regard, ahead of other regions. in the americas, revenue declined by low double digits year-on-year. growth in logistics almost offset a substantial decline in revenue from automotive. spending by manufacturing customers is gradually improving. facilities are reopening, and we are winning business from companies that are scaling up production for covid related products. the most challenging region in q2 was europe, where revenue declined by 40% year-on-year. business shutdowns further worsened already weak fundamentals in automotive. the timing of revenue from consumer electronics was also a factor. in that regard, large order revenue from consumer electronics in 2019 was split between q2 and q3. this year, we expect that business will be mostly concentrated in q3 and with a higher proportion benefiting our asia region. turning to our balance sheet. we ended the quarter with approximately $900 million in cash and investments and no debt. our approach to capital allocation remains unchanged despite the difficult business conditions. we continue to manage cognex for the long-term while also sharing our many years of success with shareholders. we paid approximately $10 million in dividends to shareholders during q2. and tonight, we announced a similar payment to be made in q3. we did not buy back any stock in the quarter. our inventory balance decreased by approximately $7 million or 12% from the end of 2019. however, excluding the substantial e&o reserve we recorded in q2, inventory was roughly flat over the six month period.
now i'll turn the call back over to rob.
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, paul. moving next to guidance. we expect q3 will be the best quarter of the year by far, with revenue between $200 million and $220 million. that range represents an increase both year-on-year and sequentially due to higher expected revenue from consumer electronics, which we believe will be mostly concentrated in q3 this year. we also expect another strong quarter in the e-commerce sector of logistics as we deliver on business that we have been working on for some time. despite that strength, which can be attributable to a few large customers in e-commerce, semi and electronics, overall demand is lackluster, and it's unclear when that will change. gross margin for q3 is expected to be in the mid-70% range, slightly tempered by the high-volume of revenue we expect from logistics. the combined total of rd&e and sg&a, which excludes the charges that we discussed tonight, is expected to be relatively flat, both year-on-year and sequentially. lastly, the effective tax rate is expected to be 19%, excluding discrete tax items.
now we will open the call for questions. operator, please go ahead.
operator
[operator instructions] our first question is from karen lau with gordon haskett. please proceed
ka wing lau -- analyst
rob, you sound pretty downbeat on markets, excluding e-commerce and ce. are you i was wondering, are you guys not seeing any meaningful sequential improvement in markets outside of those two? and can you maybe comment on kind of the rate of decline you saw in april versus the exit rate you saw in june or maybe july even?
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
yes, karen, i think the story really is the automotive market, which was our largest market last year, and it looks weak. and i think that's the main source of it. there are other markets that we serve, medical related industries, including life sciences, medical devices, pharmaceuticals, product security, a broad range of our markets. more of the other markets, actually, which are performing reasonably well and showing some growth. so i don't wish to sound overly negative, but certainly, automotive is the market that is giving us substantial headwind.
ka wing lau -- analyst
and so to that point, can you comment on kind of the exit rates that you're seeing in auto in june and july? how much you and i hope is down revenue down year-over-year?
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
yes. yes, i mean, i'll give you some color on that. i mean, so i think automotive was our largest market in 2019, and it was soft coming into this year. but we were optimistic at the start of the year that we thought things might pick up in the second half. and obviously, we no longer expect that to happen given the covid situation. demand from automotive deteriorated sharply around the covid outbreak. and revenue from automotive declined by 40% year-on-year in q2. so it's roughly $25 million of headwind for us in the quarter. it continues to look weak worldwide, including spending even on electric vehicles, not really showing the strength we might have expected. in terms of exit rate, there's some signs that it's improving from its lows. i would certainly say, i think we've hit bottom there. but in terms of getting to the level that we had hoped coming into the year or the return to the kind of solid 10% growth that we've become used to over the past few years, we don't expect that to happen probably until the middle of next year.
ka wing lau -- analyst
got it. understood. thanks for the color. and then on qe, so with the delivery expected in the third quarter, can you comment on how much the overall is going to be up this year? and then maybe put it into context for us, i believe your ce business peaked in 2017. if you account for the increase this year, how much would you still be down versus that peak level?
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
so generally, karen, we don't give kind of full year projections, as you know, forecasting for cognex nor would we gives specific guidance like that. what i would say, i think you're right is that 2017 was our best year in electronics, and i wouldn't expect us to outperform that this year. but we do we're putting up some good growth in that market. i would say coming into the year, we thought there was a very good chance we would see very strong growth in consumer electronics. and we're seeing growth but it may not be quite at the level that we would like. so i think what there's a bunch of things going on. one is outside of phones outside of smartphones, the accelerated online learning and working from home and is certainly driving growth, and we're seeing a lot of growth in that area. and then we certainly are seeing some nice growth related to 5g and oled screens. but i'd say some of that growth that we had hoped would come this year. it looks like it may be getting pushed out a little. but despite that, i think it will be a good year for us. in consumer electronics. so we expect consumer electronics will be our largest market this year, but logistics may just give it a run for its money. and automotive is not in the running to be our largest market this year, i would say.

our next question is from andrew buscaglia with berenberg capital markets. please proceed
andrew edouard buscaglia -- analyst
and can you how those consumer electronics trends, is there a reason to believe, just given the given how unprecedented these times are with q1 or in q2, that we could see some atypical seasonality in consumer electronics in q4. is there any indication that, that is likely this year?
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
well, i think we certainly think that most of this year's revenue will be recognized in q3. last year, it was q2. in q3, pretty much if you look back through the last five years or so, which have been really big electronics use for us. it's always been q2 and q3. and this year, as we've sort of discussed in previous calls, it's got pushed into q3. i don't i wouldn't expect large amounts of it to flow into q4, but there's no reason why we couldn't see some growth or still some strength in electronics in q4. but it's really a q3 play from where it looks from here.
andrew edouard buscaglia -- analyst
okay. and you took some substantial restructuring that you haven't taken out in a long time, which would indicate you wouldn't expect really a pickup in demand anytime soon. but it seems like q3 is picking up a bit. and can you comment on like am i reading into that wrongly that you don't expect much of a lift beyond q3 or q4?
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
yes. i wouldn't read it in such a short-term way. i think we've been we've grown our head count, and we've made a lot of acquisitions, seven acquisitions in the last four years. we i think we were staffed. i know we were staffed entering 2020 like we expected to return to some pretty strong growth after having the first down year in nine years in 2019. so we were kind of ready to go, expecting the kind of growth we're seeing in logistics, expecting a strong year in electronics, expecting a better year in automotive. and then after covid, we recognized that we needed just to take action and we viewed the current environment as an opportune time to sharpen our focus on growth areas, leverage talent more effectively, reduce some of the redundancies we saw in the business. so i think we really aligned our capabilities better following many years of growth. so i we're really long-term thinkers at cognex. and this is something that probably needed to happen. we needed to align ourselves better. and the downturn in demand really was very clear to us that this is the time to get on with that. but we as i said in my prepared remarks, i think we have plenty of capacity for growth, right? we really are, i think, well-structured for growth. so we could expect to grow our business substantially without adding much cost other than variable costs. not much headcount, not much investment i think. we're still well set for that.
andrew edouard buscaglia -- analyst
all right, that's helpful. thank you.

our next question is from joe giordano with cowen & company. please proceed
joseph craig giordano -- analyst
wondering, can you kind of, like, scale the content that you're getting on some of these ce and logistics kind of orders? like if you were to think about it in a given production line, for ce, you're in a given amount of square footage like a logistics facility, how does your content look now versus a few years ago? i am not looking for specific dollar amounts, obviously, but how has that like-for-like content expanded over time?
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
well, it's joe. it's an interesting question. we don't generally think of it that way. i think we tend to think of numbers of lines or in the case of logistics numbers a facility, and we think that what we do in terms of features or specific tasks that are being added there. i would say, overall, the level of content and capability we're adding to alliances is similar, probably than it's been over previous years in facilities, but it's changing. i think it's more vision related, higher value. so i would say probably kind of similar, but evolving in what it is more to higher value applications, we used to perhaps be doing more basic barcode reading and things like that. and now we would be doing more vision, more just learning, higher value type applications.
joseph craig giordano -- analyst
that's fair. and then on auto, third-party estimates right now, and obviously, those can change widely over time. but right now, we're talking about pretty substantial year-on-year production growth next year. i mean, how would you think about cognex' business in that kind of environment? now obviously, that's mostly just filling up existing capacity to some extent. but how would you think if those numbers are right, that your business could fare in that environment?
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
yes. i want to make sure i understand your question. you're saying in automotive, you think if your expectation...
joseph craig giordano -- analyst
yes, in auto, they're expecting production ramps next year, pretty substantial on a year-on-year, obviously, off a low base, but i'm just curious, you're more on the investment side of things. so how do you think your business would operate in that sort of production site see?
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
so you're talking more about unit volumes of production?
joseph craig giordano -- analyst
yes. unit volumes look like they're going to go up. i'm just curious as to how you think about what that means for your business next year?
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
yes. yes. i think for us, it's going to be more about new lines of retrofitting existing lines. so i think i don't necessarily see unit volume driving a lot of incremental investment in automation. what i would see is the introduction of new models and new technologies would drive would be real growth drivers for us. so that's more of a lever. there are speculation that there are perhaps 60 new electric vehicle models coming to market over the next few years. those kind of things can really drive a lot of growth for cognex. but of course, when big automotive or tier one automotive, who are our customers in that space, if they're struggling, and if they can serve in cash, then they're likely to do less retrofits or upgrades in general. so it does have an impact on us, but more of the kind of metric to gauge future growth for us would likely be around introduction of new models and new technologies into automotive.
joseph craig giordano -- analyst
and if i could just sneak one last one in, e-commerce, you're obviously doing quite well there. you mentioned a few big customers driving some of that business now. given what's going on and everyone kind of scrambling to get supply chain is adjusted to the current reality, does this year strike you for your business as like well above trend, something that can't be repeated? or is this just the normal like this is the way we were going, it just accelerated a little bit, but we don't see why this can't continue?
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
well, i think so i think we see logistics as a great growth market for us. and we've said in the past, we have ambitious plans to grow that business at 50% a year, and we've been able to do that pretty well in most of the last few years. i think because we just see so much demand for machine vision in helping productivity developed supply chains. and as those supply chains move to more online and more e-commerce type models, we just have it's a great market, and we have a great technical advantage in it to play. i think so what we're seeing at the moment is we're seeing that growth is being very skewed toward winners in that marketplace, particularly those who already have pretty sophisticated e-commerce models or well under development.
what's been disappointing to us more in the logistics area is those customers in broad retail, like formerly, bricks-and-mortar retailers that we wouldn't have expected to see growing strongly at the moment. but of course, they're really struggling. right? and i think they're struggling with liquidity and their own future. so we're not saying the same level we're not seeing the same level of investment there we would like to have. also, airport baggage handling is not the biggest part of our logistics type business, but that's a market that has really gone very cold this year. so i think those it's a bit of a varied story, but the really good growth we're seeing better-than-expected in e-commerce. i think longer term, we would expect some other markets, like the ones i discussed more regular retail to come back more strongly for us in future.
and then i think the other thing we're expecting and we're seeing already is broader use of machine vision beyond just barcode reading more to things like inspection, dimensioning, more capabilities where we're using the data from our vision systems to help companies manage their logistics efforts more efficiently. so i think we have big and exciting growth plans in logistics. some of them have gone really well, some of them in the current environment but a little tepid. and i think that demand will come back once we're through this current situation.
joseph craig giordano -- analyst
thank you.

our next question is from joe ritchie with goldman sachs. please proceed
joseph alfred ritchie -- analyst
so rob, i think if i recall correctly at the end of last year, you guys talked about something like $40 million or so of logistics revenue that got deferred. and i think you expected to ship it in the third quarter of this year. did some of that get shipped in 2q? or is that predominantly still on track to kind of ship for 3q?
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
yes, jeff, i'm not sure we gave a specific number, but i think directionally, you're correct that we did. we saw a big backlog of logistics business building and deliveries getting delayed. and we're really we're seeing a lot of that business come through qs 2, three and four is kind of how it looks. and we're also seeing a pretty big backlog build in addition to that. so broadly speaking, that's kind of what is happening, i think, as we expected there.
joseph alfred ritchie -- analyst
got it. okay. that's helpful. and look, some of the some of the integrators like a honeywell, for example, their intelligrated business. they just reported their orders were up something like 300% this quarter, and kion's orders were also doubled this quarter. i guess how should we think about their businesses as it relates to yours in being able to whether there's any type of, i don't know, capacity constraint in being able to ensure that your products are being installed within a reasonable time frame? is there any kind of bubble that's forming that could potentially constrain your ability to get your products installed and delivered on time?
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
well, i think the way it works is there's a group of, we call them integrators, out there. intelligrated, the division of honeywell i think you're referring to, is one of them. there are many others, damatic, randol, andy, bastian, or toyota has acquired a number of those businesses over the years. generally, they're getting very, very large contracts that sometimes can be two years out. and in some ways, the dynamic is a little bit like what a line builder does in automotive. so they're getting contracts for new car models that are a couple of years out. and then as the product becomes closer, nearer to implementation, we work with them on putting the vision system in, but we're specified normally by the end user. so when you look at some of those kind of reports that we're hearing, it's indicative of years of growth ahead, which will be coming our way, probably in a year or so depending on how the product rollout schedule changes between now and then. so i view it as leading indicators and in line with what i would expect.
joseph alfred ritchie -- analyst
got it. that's great to hear. and i guess just lastly, maybe just following up on some of on the consumer electronics question. you did reference like online learning, oled screens specifically. i'm just curious if you can give maybe just a little bit more color on end market application. it doesn't sound like it's smartphones. i don't know if it's like ipads or what specifically this is going into?
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
yes. so cognex, we sell we really sell to all the major players in consumer electronics. and so they most of them really have a broad portfolio of products. our business has been very much in smartphones this year, still very solid in smartphones, for sure, it's how it looks. but it's perhaps growing better. it's stronger than we would have expected more in tablets and laptops and other electronics and devices, wearable devices, headphones, etc, that we've seen, i think everyone has seen an uptick in that business, which is a result of everybody equipping themselves to work at home. that's how it looks. then in terms of oled screens, that's a market we've been working on heavily for best part of five years, and we saw a very big spike in our business in 2017. we still see some good strength and growth in that business, and we've diversified generally, the base of that business more to china, etc, where we're working with some of the major players there. but i think in terms of our expectations, maybe oled isn't it's this is not a blow-the-doors-off year for oled. it's sort of growth, and we're working there. and by the way, those companies really value our deep learning technology for inspection because there's some the value of yield in that market is massive. but in terms of perhaps what were going to be big growth drivers, 5g and oled, it's similar or maybe not quite as good as one might have hoped coming into the year, and that's being offset with some of these other better areas that i spoke about earlier.
joseph alfred ritchie -- analyst
that's super helpful. thank you, guys.
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
thanks.
operator
our next question is from paul coster with jpmorgan. please proceed
paul coster -- analyst
so you mentioned that the gross margins might be a little light because of the logistics mix. i'm just wondering, did i hear that right? and if i did hear it right, what is it in the product mix that leads to slightly lower gross margins for that end market?
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
yes, so paul so yes. yes. and i'll invite i'll talk on a product level, and i think paul will talk a little bit more about that, too. so when we to give you the long view, when we got into logistics, we worked with some very major customers somewhat as we do in consumer electronics who required more implementation from us. so we were doing more application engineering, right? so that was certainly a part of that. part of that issue. and we still do some of that, which can be dilutive to our margins. so it has some more service-related pieces, and it also has more integration, which may be, in some case, we're selling lower margin accessories or metal frames or other things that currently, we need to do in order to fulfill the needs of customers, but we're developing products that are more modular, and we're developing relationships with systems integrators. so we're taking more and more of that business away and allowing our gross margins to approach the gross margins we have elsewhere. paul, would you like to say?
paul todgham -- senior vice president of finance and chief financial officer
and yeah, have some. i think you landed it, but logistics is still slightly dilutive to our overall gross margin, but it is improving versus a year ago or certainly versus three years ago. so it's similar to the strategy we use for developing the factory automation market, solve people's problems, a little more service and then figure out how to effectively productize it. and we're in the middle of that migration with logistics, and it's going well. but overall, logistics is a bigger share of our revenue. it is somewhat dilutive, although that's countered by other aspects of our business that are growing that are highly accretive to our margins, such as deep learning is a great example of a software-based market that's highly accretive to our gross margins and is a growth
paul coster -- analyst
got you. so just a quick question on the deep learning front. obviously, you've taken action changed course really quickly. and i think that's awesome that you sort of identify the need to do so and act precipitously. the question i've got, though, is what does this chill your interest in further acquisitions in that area, knowing that there's a sort of integration work involved? or is it just an anomalous situation?
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
well, let me kind of back up for a minute. so i think we see deep learning as kind of a revolution going on in machine vision, and it's allowing us to approach machine vision problems in a new and better way. and we made the acquisition of vidi 3.5 years ago. and that technology is remarkably good at running on low power chips. and that's demonstrated in the in-sight d 900 that we just launched. and it fits very well within our existing kind of model of selling smart cameras with a lot of performance, right?
now then we've acquired sualab. sualab has very, very powerful capabilities around the application of convolutional neural networks to industrial machine vision and they're ideal for doing other things like classifying images with great precision and inspecting complex images. so it's almost like some of the technology they have is sort of further down the road, and we'll be assimilating it. over time, but some of the nearer-term applications for it did require on-site work with very sophisticated engineering teams in asia. and that's the thing we really haven't been able to do at the moment. so because just access to site and working closely with operators in those kind of environments. we're still going to do that. it's just delayed. and then sualab brings great engineers and great technology, which will help us with all the other things we want to do in deep learning.
paul coster -- analyst
so m&a will remain the sort of a key area of focus?
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
yes. maybe we're i think sorry, yes, thanks. sorry, paul, that was the second part of your question. so i think we've got a lot of horsepower now in deep learning, but we're always out there looking for interesting assets to acquire in deep learning or in other growth areas of the business. and generally, we're always on the lookout for great engineers who bring a lot of capability to our organization. so that's an ongoing kind of cadence at cognex.
paul coster -- analyst
got you. thank you very much.

our next question is from richard eastman with robert w. baird. please proceed
richard charles eastman -- analyst
rob, just to be clear, the upside in revenue in the second quarter to your previous thoughts that the second quarter would look like less than the first. was that upside did i capture it right? china came back sequentially faster? and then you pulled some of the logistics business that you shipped came out of backlog? are those the two primary factors for the upside?
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
yes. i'll let paul comment. i mean, certainly, we were able to win and ship more logistics business than we'd expected in the quarter was a big driver. and then yes, and certainly, the recovery in our china business was probably stronger than we had anticipated. paul, any other color you'd like to give?
paul todgham -- senior vice president of finance and chief financial officer
yes. i mean, the commentary on china was more about kind of q1 revenue levels to q2 revenue levels, not so much our expectations for q2. i think for why we beat our q2 forecast or we didn't give guidance, except that we thought we would be down versus q1, and we were up slightly. that was more driven by strength in logistics. and just i'd say, managing our supply chain and potential component shortages and other sort of risks in our business didn't materialize as negatively as we had feared. we're certainly seeing higher costs and logistical challenges to work through, but our ability to convert it to revenue is and meet customer demand is pretty good.
paul coster -- analyst
so you put a rick greg
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
yes, rick. sorry, it's rob again. i think but just to make sure we understand the standing finding order activity during the quarter was quite a lot stronger than we anticipated, right? so we did we certainly exited the quarter with a very large backlog. so i wouldn't want you to think that we made q2's beat off backlog necessarily, we didn't. we had good strong orders as well.
paul coster -- analyst
yes. i understand. and was china again, china year-over-year was down 11%, but that other asia number, other asia was plus 23%. is that massive dollars? but what was that kind of $6 million increase that amounts to other asia in apac? what end market was that particularly driven by ce?
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
it's semi and ce from i may booked ok. yeah. and obviously, there is some element of inorganic from sualab in there too, but very modest.
paul coster -- analyst
i see. and was so if we we had a nice quarter in the second quarter to be sure and we built backlog, is the logistics business, would you expect it sequentially to be higher in q3 than it was in q2? i mean, is that kind of timing on backlog? is that a doable expectation?
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
so yes. so we've got some good momentum in logistics business. we had a record quarter for revenue in q2, and we expect q3 to be higher. so yes, and we expect q4 to be good also. so yes, we definitely have good momentum, and it's not getting concentrated in particular quarters at this point.
paul coster -- analyst
understood. and just i'm sorry, my last question here, just promise. the would you expect in consumer electronics to have a 10% customer in 2020, given current backlog and trends? obviously, you have some help, the factory automation business is down. but just curious, would you expect to see a 10% customer in ce this year?
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
well, yes, that's not really a question i feel like i'm ready to answer at this point. so i'm going to pass on that one just given sensitivities in that market.

our next question is from markus mittermaier with ubs. please proceed
markus m. h. mittermaier -- analyst
two questions from my side, please. one more long-term and one on the second half. maybe i start with the longer-term question. given the sort of 8% head count reduction that you did, which isn't easy in any case, but particularly probably in the cognex culture. how do you think about supporting that long-term growth vision that you have throughout the cycle, right? i mean, some of your competitors, particularly on the sales force side, have probably significantly larger sales forces. so i'm just trying to think about strategically how you think about that through the cycle. that's long term. and then on the second half, i don't want to belabor all the seasonality issues around consumer electronics, etc. but maybe just some color where you can and where you might have some visibility in customer conversations, maybe q3, q4. is there sort of some special effects around covid, maybe also to the upside? i'm thinking about e-commerce. is there access issues maybe in some of the customers, given how busy the distribution centers are? just trying to get understand the puts and takes here from into q3, q4.
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
great. yes. to your first question about the 8% headcount reduction. i mean, i think if you go back and you kind of look at our productivity as a company, it's even with the headcount reduction, it's well below what it was in 2016. so we see as having plenty of capacity for growth, right? and i think we came in thinking we were going to grow into that capacity this year with revenue being lower. we had a lot more capacity than we needed. but we really i don't really feel constrained on that. you kind of talked about sales productivity. and we do you're right, we do compete with customers that have bigger sales forces. but we come back that in two ways. one is we're pure-play machine vision. so cognex salesnoid is not selling at plcs or robots. they're focused very much on their experts in machine vision. and then we do have a good network of systems integrators and distributor partners who cover those areas that we don't reach. so i'm not at all concerned about lack of coverage or and i do think there's a lot of opportunity for us to grow into our current headcount and deliver leverage to the bottom line. that's where we see opportunities to focus there in the next couple of years, i would say, at this point. your second question kind of was around opportunities for growth or other areas. and i think it's worth saying that we have seen some nice activity and interest in the use of cognex machine vision for covid related applications. so we've seen certainly, medical, pharmaceutical applications are others that are we've seen some interesting demand for our products in that area. and i do think as companies scale up testing and vaccine production, that is certainly a good opportunity for us to work. life sciences as well and the application of our deep learning technology more broadly, it's an area that i think we see good upside potential for us as we move through this year and into next. so those would be some of the areas that come to mind.
markus m. h. mittermaier -- analyst
great. and maybe a quick follow-up. do you think that could be material near term? or is that sort of in early stages? i'm just trying to think through i understand the seasonality around ce and q3, etc, but then as you think into q4, you mentioned q3 is probably going to be the best quarter anything that you see early in customer conversations that could be a material factor in q4 that we might not have on the radar at the moment? or is that too early?
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
yes. i think material in it's true definition, probably the answer to that question is no. and i don't think we're going to see something really massively material from some of these other conversations in q4. but the other answer is really it's too soon to say. i think in that, i think other more things that might move the needle for us later in the year might be more around whether there's earlier investment in electric vehicles or if there's more electronics kind of business coming in earlier or perhaps more than those in general might be logistics we see more and stronger demand the back end of the year, which can happen in our business. so but generally, i don't want to give you an overly optimistic picture of q4, as we said in the opening remarks or whatever that we do expect q3 to be our best quarter. and certainly, that's how it looks to us right now.
markus m. h. mittermaier -- analyst

our next question is from jairam nathan with daiwa capital markets. please proceed
jairam nathan -- analyst
just on the to kind of ask it in a different way to the earlier question here on consumer electronics, how should we think about the diversity within consumer electronics in 2020 compared to 2017? has it gotten a little more diverse?
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
yes. so we've worked certainly had over the last two years to try to take our technology and apply it more broadly, whether that's more into component type areas, such as like housing and screens and other things rather than just final assembly and test and packaging, which is where we were highly concentrated a few years ago. and then, obviously, more in accessories, as we discussed, certainly, we see and in portable type products, the less laptops and others. so you should see our businesses being much more diversified in terms of its applications in that market, although, as we know, the end users i'm sorry, the brand owners are pretty concentrated still.
jairam nathan -- analyst
okay. and with regard to logistics, you still largely u.s. build based business? or and what's the scope for expanding into europe and asia?
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
yes. so the majority of our revenue today is still in the u.s. but we've been investing and we're seeing good percentage, very good percentage growth rates in european market and in parts of asia, certainly. so and we expect probably the majority of growth to come from those areas as we go over the long term. but right now, we're definitely still highly concentrated in the united states.
jairam nathan -- analyst
okay. and i know there is an annual exercise that you do on addressable markets. but how should we think about logistics addressable market from i don't remember the number, but what it was, like is it a multiple of that, you think, based on what's happened?
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
yes. i don't really feel ready to answer that. we said it was a $1 billion served market. and i would have thought that might actually be quite similar now. i mean, we're basically seeing a lot of growth with e-commerce, but i think a lot of that market is actually in areas that aren't doing that well right now, things like package delivery, postal, general bricks-and-mortar retail. so those businesses, they're only growing slightly for us. and we're probably gaining share, the market may be shrinking currently. so i still i think of that being a great market overall in logistics. we sized it at $1 billion when we told you last we think it can grow. i think we said in the mid-teens, and i view it very similar now just with a different complexion.
jairam nathan -- analyst
okay. and final question on the competitive environment. given the difficulties, have you seen it getting a little easier in terms of have you seen any competitors going down on going bankrupt or exiting the business?
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
yes. i'm sorry, i didn't quite understand your question. have we seen it getting more difficult with who?
jairam nathan -- analyst
no, any of your competitors have exited the business or given the tough conditions.

ka wing lau -- analyst
so just that one opex follow-up question for paul. i think it sounded like in the second quarter, you didn't realize any of the savings from the restructuring. i think the number is expected to be a $25 million savings run rate. so you would kind of imply that the savings is coming starting in the third quarter. but sequentially, opex is flat. so is the idea that some of the temporary cost that to put temporary cost savings that took place in the second quarter is coming back, but this structural savings kicking in, so they kind of offset? or is there some temporary costs associated with the higher delivery in the third quarter that is like kind of masking that sequential savings structural savings uptick?

sure. yes, karen. it's mostly puts and takes. i mean, if we take a step back to 2020, going into the year, we said we'd be adding about $25 million to our cost structure associated with reset of incentive plans and some hiring and the integration of sualab, and then we've now committed to a $25 million annualized cost reduction, of which we did realize a portion of it in q2. but certainly q3, we'll be realizing more. so yes, so i'd say the payroll savings and some of the savings and depreciation and amortization and so on in q3 will be partially offset by a little more travel, just as you've got more sales activities going on, travel will still be significantly down for the year. but with facilities open, our salesnoids are going and paying visits. we did get some onetime benefits associated with the restructuring in q2 in our incentive compensation that won't repeat in q3. so that's also one of the takes to offset the payroll savings.
ka wing lau -- analyst
understood. and rob, if i can ask you a quick one on semi? i understand it's a relatively small market for you, and i think it has something to do with like semiconductor customers, they buy mostly software. so the asp is smaller for customers in that market. but i guess in the context of maybe people learning new applications. and then we have the backdrop of these arms race going on in building chips everywhere. is can that piece of the business become much bigger over time, whether it's aside from the market growing, but more in terms of your content to that market?
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
yes. we're having a good year in semi. it's true, and i think the industry is having a good year. but just generally, that has been around 5% of our business. we view it as kind of a cyclical probably cyclical declining market overall. why? it's kind of moore's law where you can produce more and more chips on fewer and fewer lines, right? i think that isn't really going to change. sure, we can see some pops in investment. and there's some areas where we have very strong positions and great technology. but overall, i don't see it as a big lever for us for growth over the long term.
paul todgham -- senior vice president of finance and chief financial officer
okay. and karen, just back to your original question too, one piece, obviously, just with a higher revenue mix or higher revenue level in q3 versus q2, that will also bring some opex, right? think about commissions and so on. so there's an element of that as well in the quarter-to-quarter.
ka wing lau -- analyst
yeah, makes sense. thank you.

operator
greetings and welcome to the cognex third quarter 2020 earnings conference call. [operator instructions] as a reminder, this conference is being recorded.
i would now like to turn this conference over to your host, susan conway, senior director of investor relations. thank you. you may begin.
susan conway -- senior director, investor relations
good evening, everyone. thank you for joining us today. with us are cognex's chairman, dr. bob shillman; president and ceo, rob willett; and chief financial officer, paul todgham.
i'd like to point out that our earnings release and quarterly report on form 10-q are available on our investor relations website at www.cognex.com/investor. both contain highly detailed information about our financial results. during the call, we may use a non-gaap financial measure if we believe it is useful to investors or if we believe it will help investors better understand our results or business trends. you can see a reconciliation of certain items from gaap to non-gaap in exhibit 2 of the earnings release.
any forward-looking statements we made in the earnings release or any that we may make during this call are based upon information that we believe to be true as of today. things often change however and actual results may differ materially from those projected or anticipated. for a detailed list of risk factors, you should refer to our sec filings, including our most recent form 10-k and subsequent quarterly reports on form 10-q.
now, i'd like to turn the call over to dr. bob.
robert j. shillman -- chairman and founder
thanks, sue, and hello everyone. i am actually physically here with the team at this time. and i'm happy to be here enjoying the beautiful fall colors. not so happy to experience the gray rainy weather, but it does remind me why i left many years ago for southern california.
well, as shown in the news release earlier today, we reported terrific results. q3 was the second highest quarterly revenue in our 39-year history, along with terrific profitability. in addition, cognex's board of directors increased the quarterly cash dividend to $0.06 a share. and the dividend increase demonstrates our confidence in cognex's financial strength and long-term growth prospects despite the current difficult business environment.
now, you're not here just to hear that -- those platitudes, you're here to hear more details. and for those, i'm going to turn it over to my partner cognex's ceo, rob willett. and rob, the microphone is now yours.
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, dr. bob, and good evening, everyone. cognex reported strong results for the third quarter. revenue was $251 million, which represents 37% growth year-on-year. we were highly profitable reporting an operating margin of 38%. the 14-point increase over q3 of 2019 demonstrates the substantial operating leverage we have in our business model.
earnings for the quarter more than doubled year-on-year to $0.49 per share. we expected q3 to be our best quarter of the year. and it even exceeded our expectations that we gave the guidance last quarter. this high level of achievement was made possible by the efforts of cognoids around the world. they worked hard to meet the increased demands of some of our existing customers to win new customers and to successfully manage our own supply chain during these difficult times. because of their efforts, we won more orders than we expected during q3, particularly in the americas. also, we met accelerated delivery requirements from existing customers concerned about potential disruption in q4.
consumer electronics delivered impressive growth in the quarter. revenue from this market has an annual cycle with large revenue generating quarters typically in q2 or q3. this year, that happened in q3. much of our revenue in consumer electronics relates to the assembly of smartphones and the manufacturing of related components.
however, this year, online learning and the work-from-home dynamic are making a notable contribution. people need tablets, laptops and wearable devices for a world where connecting virtually has become even more important. cognex machine vision is enabling the precise and rapid manufacturing of those products. in logistics, we reported another record revenue quarter due to continued strong demand in the e-commerce sector. we delivered on both recent orders as well as on a backlog of orders. major e-commerce and big-box retailers are investing in automation for higher throughput in their distribution centers to meet higher online demand and to prepare for the upcoming holiday season.
other bright spots in q3 included both medical-related industries and semi, although they were a much smaller contributor to overall growth than consumer electronics and logistics. regarding medical-related orders, we're pleased to report growth from manufacturers that produce covid-related products. cognex machine vision is currently being applied in a variety of covid-related applications, including the automated manufacturing of masks, inspection of vials, vaccines and the assembly of covid testing kits. we're proud to have been chosen by industry leaders to help them bring these important products to the world.
in automotive and the broader factory automation market, revenue continues to improve on a sequential basis. however, it's unclear whether this is the start of a recovery or a catch-up from depressed levels in q2 and from customers placing orders in advance of a potentially difficult winter season. business was good in q3, but we have a saying at cognex, good is not good enough, excellence is expected. in our quest for excellence, we have launched some very innovative products in recent months that we believe will strengthen our leadership position.
our most important product launch this year is the in-sight d900 smart camera, which we introduced in april. it is among our most successful new product launches ever. designed to run cognex deep learning tools on our industry-leading in-sight platform. this easy-to-use vision system addresses inspection applications that were previously too difficult to serve with traditional rule-based vision tools.
customers of the d900 include existing cognex customers as well as many first-time users of machine vision, all of whom need to inspect items for surface defects such as scratches, chips or other blemishes that human inspectors often miss and which rule-based machine vision can't reliably detect. new color and optical character recognition models broaden the applications addressable by the d900 and perform exceptionally well on difficult task such as decoding tiny and deformed alphanumeric text on a wide variety of materials.
the merging of our sualab and vidi deep learning technologies is progressing well. in fact, sualab vision tools are now available together with vidi video tools on the cognex deep -- cognex vision pro deep learning platform. this product is targeted at sophisticated customers who have very complex problems to solve.
now, let's turn to details from our third quarter. paul, over to you.
paul todgham -- senior vice president of finance and chief financial officer
thanks, rob, and hello, everyone. obviously this was a busy quarter both professionally and personally. my wife and kids and i packed up our home in the san francisco bay area and moved to a new home near cognex's headquarters. we are excited to see the house when we arrived because we literally had never physically seen it. i generally wouldn't recommend buying a home based on photos, floor plan and a facetime call with a realtor, but it went well. i think we're all doing things during covid that we never expected we do.
turning now to our results. revenue for the third quarter was $251 million, which represents substantial growth both year-on-year and sequentially and was significantly higher than the guidance we gave you last quarter. growth came from consumer electronics and e-commerce sector of logistics, where revenue from a few large customers were even stronger than we expected. in the broader factory automation market, we successfully fulfilled a stronger than anticipated pick-up in demand and accelerated customer delivery requests that were previously scheduled for q4. and new covid-related business that rob just spoke about contributed nicely.
automotive remained a drag for considerably less so than in q2. gross margin was 76%, which was higher than we expected and an increase over both q3 of 2019 and the prior quarter. and that is even after excluding an $8 million excess inventory charge we took in q2. the stronger performance was due to a favorable product mix and leverage on higher volume. gross margin and logistics, while still dilutive to the company overall, continues to improve. as we discussed three months ago, we recorded one-time charges in q2 for a restructuring and a writedown of intangible assets that totaled approximately $35 million. restructuring charges in q3 were very modest at $250,000 and we expect to complete the charges in q4.
excluding those charges, the combined total of rd&e and sg&a increased by 4% sequentially and 2% year-on-year. this is consistent with our expectations. within operating expenses, incentive compensation was higher due to strong revenue. and we continue to realize savings in travel and entertainment and from the restructuring actions taken in q2. operating margin expanded to 38% in q3 '20, which, as rob noted, is 14 points higher than in q3 '19, demonstrating the operating leverage we have from incremental revenue.
the effective tax rate was 18%, excluding discrete tax items. this is a slight decrease compared to q2, given higher profit, reducing the impact of non-deductible expenses. i'd like to make you aware of a discrete tax benefit we expect in q4 related to our 2019 federal tax return, which we filed this month. under new irs regulations, we were able to reduce our us tax liability by more than $12 million for foreign taxes we paid when we moved acquired sualab technology from korea. we will recognize tax savings for accounting purposes this year in the fourth quarter.
now back to q3. reported earnings doubled to $0.49 per share in q3 compared with $0.24 in q3 of 2019. we reported a loss of $0.01 in q2 of 2020. on a non-gaap basis, earnings were $0.47 per share in q3 compared with $0.24 in q3 '19 and $0.18 in q2 of 2020, excluding discrete tax items and the charges just mentioned.
looking at the change in revenue for q3 year-on-year from a geographic perspective, asia was our best performing region increasing by 82% year-on-year with greater china growing even faster due to this quarter's substantial contribution from consumer electronics. notably, customers in china are largely back to work, while challenges continue elsewhere in asia, particularly india.
in europe, revenue was roughly flat year-on-year. growth in logistics and in the broad factory automation market offset a decline in automotive. you may recall that in past years, europe was helped by consumer electronics orders for cognex products used on assembly lines in asia. due to a shift in procurement, that revenue is now largely recognized in our asia region.
in the americas, revenue increased by more than 30% year-on-year due to growth in logistics. there was also incremental revenue from medical-related industries, including companies scaling up production for covid-related products.
turning to the balance sheet. we ended q3 with $1 billion in cash and investments and no debt. as noted by dr. bob, we announced today that our board of directors has increased the quarterly cash dividend to $0.06 from $0.055 per share. the dividend is payable on november 27th to all shareholders of record on november 13th.
now, i'll turn the call back over to rob.
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, paul. in summary, cognex had a strong third quarter, but the substantial consumer electronics revenue we expect in q3 is behind us for this year. it would likely be several quarters until we report revenue as high as we did in q3. we believe revenue for q4 will be between $190 million and $210 million, which represents an increase year-on-year due to growth in consumer electronics, logistics, medical-related industries and semi. automotive is improving but remains at a significantly lower level than in recent years. there also continues to be a high degree of uncertainty in today's environment and business conditions are difficult overall.
gross margin is expected to be in the mid-70% range and lower than we reported for q3, given the expected increase in logistics revenue as a percentage of total revenue. operating expenses are expected to increase by mid-single digits on a sequential basis and to decline year-on-year due to cost saving measures and lower travel and entertainment costs.
lastly, the effective tax rate is expected to be 18%. that excludes all discrete tax items such as the expected $12 million benefit described earlier by paul.
now, we will open the call up for questions. operator, please go ahead.

[operator instructions] our first question comes from the line of josh pokrzywinski with morgan stanley. you may proceed with your question.
josh pokrzywinski -- morgan stanley -- analyst
hi. good evening, all.
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
hi, josh.
josh pokrzywinski -- morgan stanley -- analyst
i guess, first question on the consumer electronics strength, which was pretty notable. i guess, pretty consistent with what we've seen and heard out of the supply chain constraints, low inventory lead times extended out to things like pcs and notebooks. i guess, first question, how long do you expect that to continue? and what have your customers told you about kind of future investments there, given that this is not something that they would have anticipated six, nine months ago either?
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
so, josh, i'd say that this is a good year for our consumer electronics, not a great year like 2017. and it's changing in dynamic kind of as it often does. obviously there's new technologies rolling out like 5g and some of the sort of more virtual reality-type technology we're starting to see adopted. and if you joined us for our analyst day about a year ago, i think we were sort of -- i think we sort of suggested that these new technologies were coming, and they're always coming in consumer electronics. there's always innovation and it's always challenging to manufacture. and that's why you need great vision technology in automation to do it.
so, i think this is a fairly regular cadence of that going on. i think what can drive higher or lower revenue years with some of the dynamics we've talked about like big model changes and shift to new technologies. and in this case, obviously market dynamics like to work from home high level of orders that we see and then new features like screens. a lot of great new oled screens from these suppliers hitting the market now currently. but i think really that's as much as i can tell you. i'm not -- i don't have great insights into next year's roadmaps or the demand profile unlike the companies that actually make these products.
josh pokrzywinski -- morgan stanley -- analyst
understood. i appreciate that color. and then, i guess, just a follow-up on the cost side for whoever wants to take it. i think, about operating expenses, clearly some good work done on the cost-containment side in the second quarter, getting good leverage off that here in the medium-term. as we get kind of back into a normalized growth environment at the corporate level, how should we think about either growth in operating expenses relative to revenue growth or just as a percentage of sales that there is a target in mind? because i think if you look over the past few years, it's been all over the map depending on investment mode or cost containment mode.
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. well, josh, i'll start and then i'll invite paul to give some color. i mean, i think, we at cognex have long-term plans to grow the company substantially at high gross margins. and we are investing in r&d to support that growth and sales force where necessarily to grow the company over the long-term. and as you can see tonight and as you've seen many quarters at cognex, there's substantial fall through on revenue growth to the bottom line. so that's kind of our model.
now, we believe, at the moment, we have capacity to grow revenue substantially without significant head count additions. we think we're pretty well-sized and we're still not as big as we were in 2018 in terms of the size of the business if you take our guidance for q4. so, i think we have plenty of room to grow and without adding a lot of cost. but of course, there's more detail as salary increases and other things that inevitably got businesses absorb and other factors as well. but generally, i think we're pretty well-sized expense wise to grow without adding a lot of expense. paul?
paul todgham -- senior vice president of finance and chief financial officer
yeah. i mean, i think that's right, rob. and we are in the middle of our budget cycle and we'll have more to share with you in february related to expectations for q1 and so on. but i think it is that balance of being very disciplined in the short term, we are being disciplined around headcount growth being disciplined around all of our operating expenses while ensuring that we continue to be positioned well for longer-term growth. of course there'll be some puts and takes. right, we save money on travel and entertainment this year.
i assume that will be fairly conservative next year, but we hope to be able to travel more and see customers more often. by the end of this quarter, we'll have annualized our sualab costs, so that won't be a variance will be talking about in the new year, which will be great too.
josh pokrzywinski -- morgan stanley -- analyst
i appreciate the color, rob and paul. thank you very much.
operator
our next question comes from the line of joseph giordano with cowen. you may proceed with your question.
joseph giordano -- cowen -- analyst
hey, guys.
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
hey, joe.
joseph giordano -- cowen -- analyst
along those same lines are you kind of rethinking the sales force kind of organization, a little bit at this point because here obviously being successful with people not traveling, i know that's a huge part of your -- historically huge part of that sale and being face to face of customers. but now with the ability to kind of do things remote or are you organizing it internally different or people covering is it not regional anymore, how do you think about this in kind of the new world of connectivity?
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
well, around the restructuring we did earlier in the year, we did do some work on the sales force, more just to align them with their capabilities in areas where we needed. we saw strong growth potential over the coming years. so there was some realignment. on your point about changing the way we work, i mean i think we were pretty successful at changing to online sales and marketing. and we've kind of pivoted into that pretty well in the spring. we've been seeing as much as 50% of our sales activity really being online and then looks very well [technical issues] background noise -- it works, that was not a sales call going on in the background [indecipherable]. so anyway, it works pretty well selling online -- online for us. our customers are engineers and often sometimes they really want to meet with people in person. they're introverts and they enjoy kind of getting into the technology and we found them to be very receptive to kind of an online selling model.
but where it can be more challenging or areas where we have very sophisticated technology that requires hands-on work on a customer site, right? and we would have expected to see some more sales, particularly from our deep learning technology and replacing human inspectors in asia. we kind of talked about that i think a little bit in the last conference call where it does require more on-site work. fortunately now things in asia are opening up much more and we're able to do much more of that. so, it's a long way of saying, i think that we've adapted pretty well. we've reorganized our sales force to kind of address what we see in front of us.
joseph giordano -- cowen -- analyst
i also wanted to ask on logistics. i mean i know you had some core customers that are large retailers and that makes sense. curious as to the momentum you're seeing on new customer front, whether it's pretty old tech companies or like a fedex ups-type companies or just smaller retailers looking to move more omni-channel. what's the pacing on new customer acquisition into that space?
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
we've been in this market about five years. and so, certainly in the americas market, where we have the majority of our logistics revenue. we're well known, i think, sort of the big technically sophisticated players in this market. and they certainly respect and know our technology, but we're also expanding to a lot of new companies that are coming up, particularly in the e-commerce space. we had one very nice customer in this quarter who sold pet-related products online. for instance, one that was a new customer for us. and sort of innovative start-up companies, i think, like cognex technology and like the way we work. so we're seeing some kind of growth in that area.
i think, custom is we would really like to be doing more business and feel not in a great place at the moment are bricks and mortar retailers, customers that really haven't developed an e-commerce model and then now struggling whether financially or logistically to do it right. we also have had a good business in airport baggage handling. but as you can imagine, that isn't going anywhere right now. so, there are definitely some parts of the logistics market that are down and not really signing up new customers for us.
joseph giordano -- cowen -- analyst
thanks.
operator
our next question comes from the line of richard eastman with robert w. baird. you may proceed with your question.
richard eastman -- robert w. baird -- analyst
yes. thank you and congrats on a fantastic quarter. just a quick question on the logistics business in the e-commerce business that you referenced. when we think about consumer electronics, there is a seasonal demand to get in front of the holiday season. so it's logical that that falls off seasonally. but the logistics business, there were some big orders booked by some of the upstream players in the second quarter. lots of commentary on how that would -- those bookings would ship well into '21. how does the backlog look for you in logistics or e-commerce and is there the same seasonal pattern there or is there enough panic by the e-commerce players to get square footage in place that that business can be consistent from q3 to q4 and run well into '21?
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. hi, rick. generally backlog is not something we comment on except just at the end of the year and obviously, but we did give some color maybe a year ago on some larger orders that we're going out for longer periods. i would say this; i would say, we're still getting to know the logistics market. i think it's a market where we can see pretty consistent revenue over quarters. however, it can be lumpy when larger orders hit. so this is not obvious to me now being in this market that it's great market in a particular quarter or poor market in a particular quarter. there's not a sort of cyclicality or seasonality that i observe and there is some lumpiness. but i draw your attention that i think we've seen very good sequential quarter of growth in logistics and i think we're well set, in general, if we take out lumpy stuff to see that going forward.
paul todgham -- senior vice president of finance and chief financial officer
yeah. and i might just add part of what's contributing to our expanded guidance range that we've had the last couple of quarters. beyond just sort of covid related uncertainty is how we balance meeting customers' demands. i'm trying to pull orders influences in anticipation of a challenging supply environment or not being able to get into deliver certain orders and so on. so as logistics has grown. it has added a bit of uncertainty to kind of that revenue timing for us.
richard eastman -- robert w. baird -- analyst
okay. and did you have a or more than one 10% customers in the quarter?
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
again, that's not something we disclosed. you can read our 10-k at the end of the year, we will tell you.
richard eastman -- robert w. baird -- analyst
yeah, ok. okay, fair enough. and i just -- could i just ask the d900 that you introduced back in the spring. my recollection is that the first target market or significant kind of first adopter and vertical was around consumer electronics for some of those tough to inspect applications. can i just ask that the d900 have a measurable impact in q3 growth? i mean, did it have that success?
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
well, rich, first thing i'd say is, no, you misunderstood it. you thought it was a consumer electronics product specifically. i think our expectation was it was going to be very large in automotive. so, the success we're having isn't driven by the buoyancy of that market, i'll say that, but it's very widely used. some of the covid-related applications i talked about. i have deployed the d900 to do inspection of things like vials and masks.
richard eastman -- robert w. baird -- analyst
i see. okay. okay, very good. thank you.
operator
our next question comes from the line of karen lau with gordon haskett. you may proceed with your question.
karen lau -- gordon haskett -- analyst
good afternoon, everyone. rob, i was wondering if you guys are to still to an extent restricted by excess to customer site during this period. which i guess would lead to still upon plan to catch up pent up from projects that or is there were placed before. or has that you know largely been caught up already. if you can just comment a little bit on that?
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
well, as i kind of mentioned in my opening remarks, it's difficult call to know kind of we have. i'd say quite a lot of sort of some volatility going on where customers, some of them are really pulling in demand, because they're worried about supply chain and the second wave of covid shutting factories while causing disruption. and then, you have other ones who are run like you suggest our haven't really had the resources and time will give us the access to drive the products and the projects. so it's not something i can't really quantify for you. something i would say kind of in-person sales activity kind of varies around the world like in china. it's a 100% what it was before, it's going great guns [phonetic] in other markets. japan, parts of europe it's much less good less than 50% of sales activity in person. so clearly, i think that that's an along with kind of spending anxiety and those kind of markets that depressing sales and i would expect that to improve when we kind of get back to normal business in those markets.
karen lau -- gordon haskett -- analyst
got it. and then i was wondering could you comment on kind of the cadence of improvements in outside of [indecipherable] and logistics, which obviously have been very strong but in auto and the other general industrial markets food the beverage and whatnot. how much are they still down year-over-year first of all, and what's the cadence of sequential improvement that you were seeing? did you see maybe over the summer like sort of big ramp up and then now is the sequential improvement, is that kind of more steady petering out or it has just been kind of steady improvement? if you can talk about the cadence of like the activities that you're seeing in those markets.
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. so i sort of mentioned i think on our last conference call that are, our automotive business was, i think i sit down around 40% in the second quarter. it was down much less, right, last quarter. we're not going to get into the business of giving quarterly growth rates on industries. but certainly bad, but a lot less bad than it was. and i think we all know that automotive was our biggest market last year. so that's a pretty substantial headwind that we're starting to overcome, but a lot of other industries actually kind of did pretty well, i would say.
obviously we've talked about our transport, food and beverage, life science, medical devices, pharmaceuticals were all showing much more improved growth rates as we got into the third quarter. consumer products maybe was not as strong as we would have liked to have seen in terms of overall growth. and again, that may have to do with more access to factories and problems, particularly around food processing and things like that.
karen lau -- gordon haskett -- analyst
okay. and then, the cadence of sequential improvement, like, are you seeing, like a bigger ramp some timing for the summer and then it's just kind of petering out or it has the improvement sort of been steady over the course of the quarter?
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
just, i mean, it's difficult to say. i think, as i say, a lot of volatility. paul, do you want to comment?
paul todgham -- senior vice president of finance and chief financial officer
yeah, i mean that we don't spend a lot of time talking about month to month color, but we do see obviously that april was kind of a weak point, right? and we've improved since then and again still a bit too soon for us to say whether this is a v-shaped recovery or kind of some of the pulling in of orders are recovering from a quite a depressed q2.
karen lau -- gordon haskett -- analyst
okay. understood. thank you for the color.
operator
[operator instructions] our next question comes from the line of andrew buscaglia with berenberg capital markets. you may proceed with your question.
andrew buscaglia -- berenberg capital markets -- analyst
good evening, guys.
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
hi, andrew.
andrew buscaglia -- berenberg capital markets -- analyst
so you gave -- last quarter you gave a pretty strong guide for q3 and you exceeded it by quite a bit. so, i'm wondering where were you mostly surprised? i mean, that you called out the e-commerce logistics, consumer electronics, then you have to call it out some online learning working from home, kind of it seems like pickup in that activity. but where, i guess -- where were you guys surprised?
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
well, i'll kick off. paul can give some more color. i mean, certainly e-commerce fulfillment was very, very strong for us. consumer electronics or so i think came in stronger as we move through the quarter. but -- and then, geographically, americas certainly did better, i think, than we were expecting as we moved through the quarter.
paul todgham -- senior vice president of finance and chief financial officer
yeah. i mean, obviously growth versus prior year. consumer electronics and logistics really were the drivers, outperformance versus our guidance. we saw kind of steady improvement through the quarter. a lot of that really was driven by the base business as well. just converting orders more quickly than we're used to seeing, just higher average daily sales versus kind of what we had projected at the time kind of showing again a steady recovery. those are kind of big drivers of which the americas clearly saw it there. but we saw it pretty broad based across our regions.
andrew buscaglia -- berenberg capital markets -- analyst
okay. yeah, it's quite -- you haven't seen it quite a bit like that on your own guidance in some time. so it's just interesting that those trends are even stronger than you anticipated.
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
we're proud of the revenue results. we're not as proud about the guidance versus that. it's a very difficult business to predict.
andrew buscaglia -- berenberg capital markets -- analyst
yeah, i imagine. and i wanted to ask you too on the ai deep learning. you made a comment that the d900 was year's most successful product launch. what -- i guess what's behind that statement, it doesn't seem i get too material right now. and you're tying it to more automotive. so, as a follow-up, where -- if we were to try to model in some material impact next year from this, which end markets that we assume that comes in?
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. so, deep learning is a technology that's changing and expanding the served market of vision, right? and the d900 really brings very powerful kind of techniques for inspection, particularly on to this world best-selling smart camera platform we own called insight. and insight has tens -- hundreds of thousands of users who know how to program. and now they have all these extra tools available to them in the d900. so -- and what's wonderful is, that's a very wide spread product serves pretty much all the markets that we serve. and so it's bringing that technology. i think we would expect, yes, automotive but really almost all the markets that we serve we expect the d900 to be a big player. where it might be less of a kind of a move to growth overall would be in asia where it tends to be more interesting using pc-based vision software is loaded on two powerful computers and used in the factory. and that's generally not used in other markets in that way.
but fortunately in that market we now have sualab and the technology we acquired there, which is very powerful on pc platforms and useful for inspection. so, cognex, when you launch a new product, you don't see hundreds of millions of dollars in the first year. this is not like a consumer market, right? so normally it can tend to ramp. and we can -- it can approach a peak in the third year. so, i would sort of -- i would a temper your expectations. but the initial signs we see in the first six months in terms of its ram power is good as any i've seen. and what i really like about it is, it's getting us to new customers who couldn't use machine vision because it was either too difficult or it couldn't do the inspection that they currently use or it's going to existing customers who have applications and tasks they couldn't do before. and now we can do for them with the d900.
so, we're excited about expanding our served market. then to give you kind of another data point if you joined -- if you were with us at our analyst meeting last year. we sized the deep learning market globally and machine vision at that pointed about 100 million and we said we thought it was growing at 75%, right? so the ease of use, it's helping annually -- 70% annually. the ease of use certainly is helping to broaden the applications and the speed of adoption. but that may give you a sense of scale about what the overall opportunity is for a technology like that.
andrew buscaglia -- berenberg capital markets -- analyst
yeah, ok. thank you. that's helpful.
operator
our next question comes from the line of blake gendron with wolfe research. you may proceed with your question.
blake gendron -- wolfe research -- analyst
hey. thanks, everybody. i wanted to circle back on the third leg of the stool being automotive. somewhat scary to think if you had all three of your major end markets working at the same time. usr, a surprise on the upside, i know you're not going to give us an exact cadence of recovery in that end market. i guess, looking past the pandemic, things like electric vehicles, seemed to be, there is some pent up optimism, particularly around the battery technology breakthroughs that we've seen from tesla and others. so, i guess, my question is, where does cognex stand on sort of the ic to ev transition? what sort of uplift could we see from an intensity standpoint here just considering that technological inflections or really what drive your demand?
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
yes. well, first of all, thanks for the question. if i wouldn't say the third leg, if i was referring to automotive, i'd say the third wheel. but keeping that in mind as we talk about it, automotive is a big market for us where the majority of our business has been and will be for a while internal combustion engine tie back activities. but you're quite right to point to electric vehicles and battery manufacturer as being kind of the area where we see very challenging applications, huge capital investment, particularly in asia around battery manufacturer and techniques in that space where machine vision can really make a difference in terms of yield and performance and scaling up for that work that has to happen. so ev is still a very small part of our overall automotive revenue. it's growing very quickly and -- but i think it will be a while before it says the majority of our business based on what i see on new product plans from our customers.
blake gendron -- wolfe research -- analyst
got you. wanted to circle back on working capital. great execution in the quarter, particularly on collections. work and working capital go from here. and what are some of the puts and takes to free cash conversion? is it a segment mix sort of input? is it a customer mix input as deep learning and maybe some of the software-centric capabilities get to be a bigger part of the business that going to have a structural impact on working capital moving forward?
paul todgham -- senior vice president of finance and chief financial officer
yeah. i don't see a lot of changes structurally in working capital. so, thank you for the compliment. we're very happy but also pleasantly surprised by how good collections environment has been. our team has been working hard, but also just really good partnership with our customers too and so on. so, yeah, i mean, i think in terms of puts and takes, we need each customer kind of where they are and where they need to be. we look for opportunities to partner with them work with them, we obviously do have a tremendous balance sheet, which can be a source of competitive advantage for us in challenging times. but we've seen fewer issues with collections from customers than we might have expected, given the pandemic. it helps, that i think we are a priority investment for them and they can get more products, sometimes until they pay us. but generally speaking, we have a great relationship. and i don't see big changes going forward.
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
and i'll just -- it's rob here. i'll just build on something. i mean, if you followed cognex for a while, we're not like a normal company. we really believe strongly in paying our suppliers on time and getting the best support and having the best relationship with them. and keeping plenty of inventory to make sure we can supply the technologies that we have that have quite long roadmap. so, we're not looking to optimize working capital. we're looking to optimize high margin growth and the quality of our company.
the other thing i would say in dealing with some of these very large customers, some of them are very -- who are long-term payers, right? and as a pull into that, our balance sheet really gives us the air cover to do that without any concern.
blake gendron -- wolfe research -- analyst
understood. thanks for the time.

[operator instructions] our next question comes from the line of joseph giordano with cowen. you may proceed with your question.
joseph giordano -- cowen -- analyst
hey, thanks. so let me jump right in. just -- rob, just wanted to quickly clarify something you said. i think i missed the beginning of it. you said in asia there are customers there that are more inclined in some cases to use pc vision. was that for a particular application or i didn't hear exactly what you were referring to?
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
no, it's the market dynamics in general, right? there is a lot of very high quality capable engineers in china particularly and who are less, less expensive i think and more eager to deploy vision. for those customers, we have the best and most powerful pc vision suite in the world called vision pro. so, a lot of them favor using that and a lot of them who are very big manufacturers use it very effectively.
joseph giordano -- cowen -- analyst
got it. thanks.
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
joe, sorry, to clarify, are you asking about deep learning or were you asking about vision in general?
joseph giordano -- cowen -- analyst
i was just curious like, is this something, are you competing against pcbs vision for traditional like consumer electronic inspection like there and i didn't think that was the case. so just curious is to like where are you competing against that tech more often.
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. so you see predominantly the largest share of pc-based vision in asia and electronics is a big, big market there.
joseph giordano -- cowen -- analyst
sure. okay. thank you.

robert j. shillman -- chairman and founder
thank you very much. and i want to thank all of those who've called in and asked questions. machine vision plays an increasingly important role in automating the manufacture of items, the tracking of those items and even today the delivery of those items. in view of that and in view of our leadership position, we remain bullish on the long-term prospects for cognex despite the current difficult business conditions. and we look forward to talking to you next quarter and reporting, but i hope are going to be very good results. thank you, again.

greetings, and welcome to cognex fourth quarter 2020 earnings conference call. [operator instructions]
i would now like to turn this conference over to your host, ms. susan conway, senior director of investor relations. please go ahead.
susan conway -- senior director, investor relations
good evening, everyone. thank you for joining us today. with us are cognex's chairman, dr. bob shillman; president and ceo, rob willett; and chief financial officer, paul todgham. i'd like to point out that our earnings release and annual report on form 10-k are available on our investor relations website at www.cognex.com/investor. both contain highly detailed information about our financial results. during the call, we may use a non-gaap financial measure if we believe it is useful to investors or we believe it will help investors better understand our results or business trends. you can see a reconciliation of certain items from gaap to non-gaap in exhibit two of the earnings release. any forward-looking statements we made in the earnings release or any that we may make during this call are based upon information that we believe to be true as of today. things often change, however, and actual results may differ materially from those projected or anticipated. you should refer to our sec filings, including our most recent form 10-k for a detailed list of risk factors.
now i'd like to turn the call over to dr. bob.
dr. robert j. shillman -- chairman and founder
thanks, sue, and hello, everyone. welcome to our fourth quarter earnings conference call. as shown in the news release issued earlier today, cognex reported record fourth quarter revenue for 2020, and we also set a record for annual revenue as well. it was a challenging year. but with a lot of hard work, we did quite well and emerged in very good shape for 2021. this year marks a very important anniversary for cognex. we've not only been in existence for 40 years, but we continue to be the leader in our field. this is a significant milestone a few technology companies achieved. machine vision was in its infancy in 1981, but it is now playing a critical role in both industrial automation and in logistics where it ensures the quality and accurate delivery of virtually everything that you purchase. and by continuing to invest wisely in technology, we intend to continue to be the world's leading provider of machine vision and advanced bar code systems.
finally, as we also announced earlier today, this will be my last conference call as chairman of cognex. after 40 years at the helm, i've decided to retire from cognex's board of directors and also as an executive officer of the company. i will continue to be a cognoid as an advisor to the company. of course, i have mixed emotions about this transition, but i'm at that point in my life to make it, and it also happens to be a time of unusual strength at cognex. i'm very confident in rob's leadership and in the team's understanding of our business, our customers and our culture. and it gives me great comfort knowing that i'm leading the helm of this very special company in very capable hands.
now i'll turn the call over to my partner and cognex's super capable ceo, rob willett. rob, the microphone is yours.
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
wow! thank you, dr. bob. thank you, and good evening, everyone. before we discuss our financial results, i want to take a minute and thank dr. bob for his immense contributions to cognex and for instilling the enthusiastic entrepreneurial spirit that is the hallmark of our company. dr. bob and the unique culture he built over the past four decades will forever be a part of cognex. now for our financial results. 2020 was a roller coaster ride, both for the world and certainly for us at cognex. we entered 2020 optimistic about growth. 2019 had been a challenging year in which lower spending by customers in our two largest markets, automotive and consumer electronics resulted in our first revenue decline in nine years. however, after the global covid-19 outbreak in march 2020 and the related supply disruptions, business shutdowns and capital investment pullback, we recognized that the outlook for 2020 had changed. we no longer believed 2020 would bring a broad-based strength we had expected when we started the year. given the circumstances, we quickly took steps to adjust our operating expenses to align with more modest growth. these steps included a workforce reduction, which was difficult for us. and an organizational realignment that better focused our internal investments on high-growth opportunities and important operational priorities.
as a result of these changes, we've been better able to support cognoids and customers through our own difficult pandemic-related challenges. from a business perspective, the second half of 2020 was much more positive than initially expected. you can think of it as a tale of two halves. revenue in the second half of the year was up a surprising 41% over the first half. as a result, we reported good financial results for 2020, setting a 40-year record for annual revenue. revenue grew by 12% year-on-year, thanks largely to higher spending by customers in consumer electronics and logistics, where we benefited from strong partnerships with market and technology leaders that fared well during the pandemic. spending in the broader factory automation market has also improved from depressed levels in q2. in consumer electronics, revenue increased by approximately 30% year-on-year. it also represented roughly 30% of total revenue and became our largest market. much of our revenue in consumer electronics relates to the assembly of smartphones and the production of related components. in 2020, there was also a larger relative contribution from other electronic devices necessary for online learning and the work from home dynamic. logistics revenue grew by approximately 40% over 2019 due to growth in the e-commerce sector. now representing approximately 20% of total revenue, logistics surpassed automotive to become our second largest market.
we benefited from major e-commerce and omnichannel retailers investing in automation to enable higher throughput and cost reductions. other sectors of logistics such as bricks-and-mortar retail and airport baggage handling struggled in 2020. further, bright spots included medical related industries and semi, both of which grew double digits year-on-year. we're proud that manufacturers serving the healthcare industry are relying on cognex to help make covid vaccines available to the public. more specifically, cognex machine vision and deep learning are an integral components of production machines worldwide to ensure the highest quality standards and full traceability in covid vaccines. applications include inspecting vials for defects, ensuring vials of vaccines are filled to the correct level and a free of contaminants and ensuring that vaccine kits are packaged correctly. that's most of the good news. on the negative side, automotive revenue declined by approximately 20% year-on-year as business shutdowns further worsened already weak fundamentals. as a result, the automotive market, which was our largest market in 2019 dropped to third place in 2020. automotive is improving somewhat from its most depressed levels in q2 and increased q4 year-on-year for the first time in several quarters.
however, it remains at a significantly lower level than in recent years. let's talk now about cognoids, our people. our achievements in 2020 were the result of the dedication of cognoids around the world. they exemplified our strong culture by working hard and moving fast in a volatile environment to meet significantly increased demands from a few of our existing customers to win new customers and to successfully manage our supply chain. because of their efforts, we launched powerful new products that have made our superior vision tools easier to use and, therefore, available to a wider audience. the most important introduction in 2020 and one of our most successful product launches ever was the in-sight d900 smart camera. leveraging in-sights widely recognized easybuilder interface, the d900 enables both existing cognex customers and new users of machine vision to apply our vidi deep learning tools to inspect surfaces for defects. popular applications include the detection of scratches and chip surfaces that were previously too difficult to solve using traditional rule-based vision. we also integrated deep learning technology that we acquired with sualab. these techniques are now sold together with our vidi tools running on the cognex visionpro deep learning software platform and are being widely adopted by more sophisticated customs to solve their most complex vision problems. revenue from applications utilizing our deep learning technology more than doubled year-on-year in 2020.
as we look at the opportunities ahead, we believe we are just scratching the surface no pun intended of what we can accomplish. we believe deep learning and logistics will be major contributors to growth in the years ahead. now let's talk about 3d. last month, we launched the in-sight 3d-l4000, an exciting new smart camera platform for the fast-growing industrial 3d vision market. the 3d-l4000 leverages our successful in-sight intuitive spreadsheet interface, making it easy for our broad in-sight customer base to use powerful new vision tools created for true 3d inspections. under development for some time, the 3d-l4000 packs novel capabilities into a compact form factor without the need for a separate pc. exciting features include patented optics technology for superior image quality and the broadest range of 3d vision tools available in a vision system. we believe the 3d-l4000 is a breakthrough product that makes 3d as easy to use as 2d vision. it positions us very effectively against competitors who have significant sales and profits in this area. both cognoids and customers are excited about these new products and others we have in our pipeline.
now i will turn the call over to paul for details of the fourth quarter.
paul todgham -- senior vice president of finance and chief financial officer
thank you, rob, and hello, everyone. i'm pleased to report record fourth quarter revenue, cognex' first q4, greater than $200 million. at $224 million, fourth quarter revenue grew 32% year-on-year. it was also above the guidance we gave you last quarter. the biggest contributor to growth was the e-commerce sector of logistics, which was stronger than we expected. in the broader factory automation market, the positive momentum we experienced in q3 held up better-than-anticipated and was the biggest driver of our beat to guidance. consumer electronics grew nicely year-on-year and was down on a sequential basis as we expected. gross margin was 75% compared to 74% in q4 of 2019. the stronger performance was due to a favorable product mix and higher volume. gross margin and logistics, while still dilutive to the company overall, continues to improve. the restructuring program we announced last spring has been completed. final charges totaling $875,000 were recorded in q4. excluding those charges, the combined total of rd&e and sg&a costs increased by 15% sequentially and was roughly flat year-on-year. the increase sequentially was more than we expected due to higher incentive compensation related to our performance in 2020. i'm encouraged that cognoids earned strong sales commissions and bonuses in 2020. i can tell you, they've earned it.
as a result, we fully funded -- or sorry, as a reminder, we fully funded our company bonus pool in 2020 after not paying a bonus in 2019. we continue to realize savings in travel and entertainment, and from the restructuring actions. operating margin was 26% in q4, which was below the exceptional level we reported in the prior quarter, but 1,600 basis points higher than q4 of 2019. turning now to everybody's favorite subject, taxes. there were substantial discrete tax items recorded in all periods that make comparisons difficult. in q4 of 2020, discrete items combined for a net benefit of $14 million. the largest was savings we realized on our u.s. tax liability when we filed our federal tax return in october related to new irs regulations on the treatment of foreign taxes paid on acquired sualab technology. excluding all discrete tax items, the effective tax rate was 14% in q4 of 2020, 18% in q3 of 2020 and 18% in q4 of 2019. the slight decrease compared to our guidance in the prior periods was because we earned a greater share of profit overseas. reported earnings were $0.39 per share in q4 compared with $0.46 in q4 of 2019 and $0.49 in q4 of 2020 -- sorry, q3 of 2020.
on a non-gaap basis, earnings were $0.32 per share in q4 compared with $0.11 in q4 of 2019 and $0.47 in q3 of 2020, excluding discrete tax items and restructuring and other charges. looking at the change in revenue for q4 from a geographic perspective, we saw broad-based growth across all regions year-on-year. the americas reported strong growth, increasing by about 1/3 due to growth in logistics and incremental revenue from medical related industries, including companies scaling up production for covid related products. in europe, revenue also grew by 1/3 over q4 '19. logistics, consumer electronics and the broader factory automation market increased despite many businesses operating under significant restrictions. foreign exchange contributed about 600 basis points to that growth. revenue from asia increased by more than 25% year-on-year due to growth from consumer electronics, logistics and the broader market.
turning to the balance sheet. we ended 2020 with $767 million in cash and investments and no debt. this balance is below both the end of 2019 and the end of q3 due to a $2 per share special dividend paid in q4 or, as dr. bob likes to say, a very special dividend. our approach to capital allocation remains unchanged. we continue to manage cognex for the long-term while sharing success with shareholders. given how well we are weathering the current serious economic conditions and the fact that we have no debt, our board decided it was in the best interest of shareholders to return excess cash ahead of potentially higher tax rates.
now i'll turn the call back over to rob.
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, paul. in summary, cognex ended 2020 on a strong note, and our guidance for q1 is also very positive. even so, the business environment continues to be difficult and volatile. in addition, the strength we experienced in the second half was less broad-based than we'd like. we believe revenue for q1 will be between $225 million and $245 million, which represents growth of more than 40% year-on-year at the midpoint. we expect q1 will be the third quarter in a row in which revenue will grow by more than 30% as a result of substantial backlog of logistics orders that we intend to convert to revenue in the first half, predominantly in q1. gross margin is expected to be in the mid-70% range and likely lower than the gross margin we reported in q4, given the expected higher mix of revenue from logistics. operating expenses are expected to be flat to slightly down year-on-year. we expect savings due to our restructuring actions and lower travel and entertainment costs, offset by higher commissions from the strong revenue growth we are projecting for the quarter. lastly, the effective tax rate is expected to be 18%, excluding discrete tax items.
now we will open the call for questions. operator, please go ahead.

[operator instructions] our first question comes from the line of jim ricchiuti joined needham & company. you may proceed with your question.
jim ricchiuti -- needham & company -- analyst
hi. thank you. good afternoon. dr. bob, i wish you the best.
dr. robert j. shillman -- chairman and founder
thank you, jim.
jim ricchiuti -- needham & company -- analyst
so on to the outlook, it sounds like the mix of business that you're suggesting in q1 fair to say, rob, is that skewed a little bit more toward the logistics than you would normally see because of the order activity and what you have in backlog going into the quarter?
dr. robert j. shillman -- chairman and founder
yes. hi, jim. yes, it is. yes, i think we're seeing growth across most of the industries we serve in the first quarter, but the majority of the growth we're going to see in q1 is going to be a result of logistics and orders that we already have in the backlog.
jim ricchiuti -- needham & company -- analyst
and just with respect to logistics, it appears you now have another large customer officially that you're disclosing in your k, although you're not identifying that customer, but i believe it was 14% of revenues. can you give us a sense just as you think about the outlook for the logistics business, broadly speaking, in '21 and perhaps with this customer, your visibility, your line of sight into that business?
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
yes. well, you correctly point out that we do have another large over 10% customer now at cognex for the first time, having a second one. and it is a customer in logistics. and you asked about kind of visibility on the logistics business. we're seeing a lot of strong growth in that market. you can see we reported about 40% growth in revenue last year and a very substantial growth on deck here in the first quarter. i think we think the first quarter will probably be our highest logistics revenue quarter in a while, right? it is obviously larger than we think we will be reporting in the subsequent quarters. but we see broad-based strength across that whole area and a number of other good customers coming online that we'll be reporting revenue on and a lot of growth as we move through the year. in terms of visibility, there's some short-cycle business in logistics that turns more quickly from bookings into revenue. and then -- so probably less than half of it is that. and then there are some larger deployments that we do, which tend to be on our books, booked and then turning into revenue, sometimes 2, three quarters after it books and shows up in our backlog. so that's the kind of dynamics that we're looking at.
jim ricchiuti -- needham & company -- analyst
thank you. i'll jump back in the queue.
operator
our next question comes from the line of josh pokrzywinski with morgan stanley. you may proceed with your question.
josh pokrzywinski -- morgan stanley -- analyst
hi, good evening folks and dr. bob, congrats again on a successful and solid career.
dr. robert j. shillman -- chairman and founder
thank you, josh.
josh pokrzywinski -- morgan stanley -- analyst
so as long as we're kind of 10-k diving here. i guess maybe first question, i noticed, i think for the first time, i haven't scanned every single line, but rob, you mentioned china competition kind of upfront as a new risk in the business subscription. i didn't see that last year. anything that we should be aware of? i mean, china still seems like it's growing pretty well, but is there a market shift going on there that kind of bears pointing out? because certainly, last year wouldn't indicate it, but it's new language all the same.
dr. robert j. shillman -- chairman and founder
josh, i don't think there's anything too dramatic or radical going on there. i think over a number of years, we've seen our competitors in china switch from being sort of global competitors and seeing more and more aggressive local competitors going on coming into the market. so i think we're seeing that. and i think we're keenly aware of that, and we monitor the situation very carefully. and some of them try to compete on price, which can be difficult in machine vision, where there's a lot of technical expertise required, but certainly, they're getting better. so yes, we take them more and more seriously, and we watch them closely. and i would consider them a risk to the future of the business.
josh pokrzywinski -- morgan stanley -- analyst
got it. that's helpful. and then i note a lot of the 1q commentary focusing on logistics, i guess, rightfully so, it's consistent with what we hear from some of the other peers in that space. but the other two big markets that weren't really touched on, electronics and auto. electronics, we know that inventories are still low, lead times are still long. auto, i think some of the broader automation cohort has seen a lot of strength in china, in particular, how are those factoring into the 1q guide? or how is your visibility for those markets, just given that you haven't really touched on it as much.
dr. robert j. shillman -- chairman and founder
i think we expect to see all -- most or all of our markets grow q1 year-on-year, but the big growth we see coming from logistics. and i think consumer electronics, we saw a big year last year, and we still would expect to see some growth in q1 in that market. but generally, q1 is a low quarter for logistics -- i'm sorry, for consumer electronics. it's not a big -- it tends to be more -- q2 and q3 tend to be our big consumer electronics quarters. i often get asked this time of year, like how is the year looking for consumer electronics? and i give you the same answer really that i give every year, which is we really don't have visibility. we can share with you until sort of the may conference call. so i think we'll get a better sense of that overall. i think if we look back at consumer electronics last year, we saw it near the back end of the year. we didn't see much revenue from consumer electronics in q3 and we saw most of it in q3 and still some healthy revenue in q4. and i think that was due to the difficulty in standing up lines and getting component inventory coming out of the most serious covid conditions in china and elsewhere in the spring.
so that was the kind of the dynamic there. i think we're going to see more aggressive and faster deployment schedule, probably as we come into this year, but that's still relatively unknown. anyway, and then i think we were expecting a lot of 5g and a lot of other technology coming into phones last year. i think fair to say some of which we didn't see happen, and we hope and expect will now come into this year's builds, and it should help the electronics market. but also electronics can be a bit of an up and a down market. up, one year up, next year down, the next one up. and certainly, last year was more of an upmarket, so we have moderate expectations. you asked about automotive, as well. and i did say that the fourth quarter that we just reported was the first in a number of quarters that we saw year-on-year growth in automotive. and we're certainly seeing that pretty broadly across all markets, including china.
josh pokrzywinski -- morgan stanley -- analyst
got it. that's very helpful. thanks, rob. i'll get back in queue and congrats to the team.
dr. robert j. shillman -- chairman and founder

rob, just -- could you just speak to -- there's so much press here lately and the challenges seem to be increasing, [not decreasing] around just semi chip shortages, both from -- i'm curious the impact that you might see from that both on your own business and your own supply chain, but also just on how the customers are going to approach this increasing shortage scenario that we're seeing kind of globally? just your thoughts around that for '21?
dr. robert j. shillman -- chairman and founder
rick, well, first of all, for cognex, we're pretty capable like in terms of having plenty of component inventory at cognex. we're not afraid of having very significant inventory and of key components and chips really a part of that. so we're feeling comfortable at the moment about our ability to go on supplying on time for the foreseeable future. so we're feeling in good shape in that respect. later in the year, if we found there was massive [decommitment] on already ordered and accepted orders from our own suppliers. that might lead to trouble, but i'm not -- we're not concerned, at the moment. but then obviously, the other impact is more on our customers and specifically automotive. and i'd say that's a bit of a area of confusion at the moment, we're seeing stronger demand in automotive than perhaps we'd expected.
and so part of me wonders or part of the team wonders to what degree that that's in a panic buying or forward buying from customers who really don't need to be doing that from cognex. or to what degree it's really an uptick in the market overall. but certainly, you can read about it in the press that automotive, particularly, are -- there are plants from very large oems that are closed because they can't get components to go and in america, too. so we're certainly seeing that as well in terms of our sort of basic interaction with automotive. automotive is where we're seeing it mostly. i'm not seeing much of that affecting our electronics business. and then our semi business itself is putting up good numbers right now. we've seen good good growth in semi last year, and that appears to be continuing currently.
richard eastman -- robert w. baird & co. -- analyst
okay. and just to dovetail onto the automotive question, just numerous and really aggressive schedules to bring evs to market somewhere in the '23 to '20 -- '23 to '25 maybe time frame. and again, we're seeing a little bit of uptick here. it's probably off of a pretty trough kind of bounce around probably more around ice vehicles. but my question really is, when do you expect to maybe see some line of sight and start to get some traction that's really focused on the ev market, including kind of battery capacity. is that kind of push to '22, '23 for you? or how do you think about the timing there?
dr. robert j. shillman -- chairman and founder
yes. well, rick, first of all, i think about battery manufacturing, and that's a business that we see a lot of demand provision now, and we are very well positioned with -- particularly with deep learning, but really the whole range of our products. and it's a market we've worked on for a while and that we see -- and we do business really with all of the major players in that space, and we're definitely seeing very strong and improving demand in that market. i wouldn't say it's material yet to our business, but i think it can be in a relative -- in the medium-term in a relatively short period of time. so we see that. then we see, like you -- well, it's probably not like you. we see visibility with our major customers on their plans to bring to market electric vehicles. and certainly there -- generally, if a major brand owner, oem has -- is planning to launch a major electric vehicle, they're really bringing in vision in about 18 months in advance, right? so that's -- and they're introducing us to the line builder and they're specking the vision to scale that up, right?
and certainly, we're seeing some of the signs of that beginning. we, of course, have seen it over the last couple of years as well, but in a relatively small way, and we're starting to see that in a larger way. so that's kind of the positive side of it. and interestingly enough, electric vehicles, they have a lot of different things going on. obviously, they don't have the powertrain in what we used to see with the internal combustion engine costs. but certainly, there's a lot more sensors, right? and there's a lot of changes to the product, just whether it's even things like wheels and tires and other things that we're seeing opportunities around as a result of that switch. and then on the other side, i think investment in internal combustion engine vehicles, obviously, is being minimized, which is headwind in that market, too.
richard eastman -- robert w. baird & co. -- analyst
understood. yes. yes. and just to sneak in one last question. did 3d vision, as you define it consistently is -- has it grown to more than 5% of sales with all the puts and takes in the other markets? is it 10% of sales yet? or
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
it's less than 10%, and it did grow pretty healthily last year. i think we have much higher expectations of it in the next few years given the product launches we've announced recently.
richard eastman -- robert w. baird & co. -- analyst
got you. okay. very good. thank you.
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.

our next question comes from the line of joe giordano with cowen & company. you may proceed with you question.
joe giordano -- cowen & company -- analyst
hey, guys. dr. bob, i was born the same year you founded cognex, and sadly for me, i've accomplished a lot less in the last [indecipherable] years than you guys have. so congratulations and you'll be missed.
dr. robert j. shillman -- chairman and founder
thank you, joe. thank you very much. and i hope your next 40 is more productive than your first 40 then.
joe giordano -- cowen & company -- analyst
me too. rob, you've always categorized logistics potential as, on average, 50% a year. now that you've have a big customer there that's very material. it's a much larger business. it grew 40% this year. is that still your normalized expectation? and within that context, is that doable? unless that -- is it doable without the large customer growing at at least that pace?
dr. robert j. shillman -- chairman and founder
well, first of all, joe, at cognex, we're very ambitious and we have stretch goals. so i've described the 50% as a stretch [whole] number, but one we've been able to achieve or come close to for a number of years here with logistics. we grew about 40% last year. and i think we would have hit that or exceeded that 50% number, have some of the other logistics markets, but we expected very strong growth from coming into the year, notably, more bricks-and-mortar retailers and airport baggage handling to have put up the numbers we were hoping to. so certainly, that's the case. and then we do see a lot of diversification of our customers in general.
we have many more omnichannel retailers who are investing in a big way to have an e-commerce platform that complements their stores. so we expect to see other large obviously, maybe not 10% customers, but large customers as we move through the years ahead. and then our big customer there, obviously, is a major investor in automation and one, i think that still has a very small share of the overall market that it can address, so -- and global aspirations that i think we're hoping to and expected to keep up with. so it's certainly -- the potential is clearly there and the technology and the infrastructure we put in place to serve it is there. yes. and -- but there may be volatility along the way, particularly within quarters in that business.
joe giordano -- cowen & company -- analyst
understood. paul, when you think about this year and what you're able to accomplish in a world where people aren't traveling and is the way of doing business for you guys like fundamentally different in some respects? like should we think of sg&a percentage of sales structurally lower even as things start to come back going forward?
paul todgham -- senior vice president of finance and chief financial officer
i mean, yes and no, i think. i've been in finance for a while and every year, we would try to squeeze t&e to drive some profitability. and it turns out a global pandemic is actually more effective technique in reducing travel and entertainment than finance people, berating people, come forecast or budget time. but so we've been fairly conservative about our planning for t&e for this year, although, to be clear, we would like to be traveling more. we would like to be visiting customers more. we've pivoted nicely to online sales activities. but we really do value that face-to-face relationship with our customers and clearly with other cognoids, too. so it's a part of the -- i expect that will ramp up fairly slowly. we're going to get some savings on that in q1 because we're anniversarying largely a pre-covid world in q1. but i would hope that in the back half of the year, we'll see a little more. i think the nature of our activities, we do will be different. i think kind of when we choose to meet will maybe be different than we've done before.
one example of that being sales launches -- sales product launches. we launched our largest product, the d900 entirely virtually this year. and actually, there was some real benefits to doing that and that you don't have a whole bunch of people with nonrefundable tickets from around the world depending on a certain product launch timing. and if we decide actually, we want to hold that product for one more month. we're not left kind of holding the bag or making kind of difficult decisions. so -- and then to some extent, we obviously would look at real estate going forward. although, again, i think cognex will be a place where we always value the face-to-face collaboration, particularly for engineers, our solution providers. but on the margin, we did close 11 offices through the course of our restructuring or downsize and obviously, look at our real estate portfolio as well.
joe giordano -- cowen & company -- analyst
thank you.

our next question comes from the line of matt summerville of d.a. davidson. you may proceed with your question.
matt summerville -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
thanks and congrats to dr. bob as well. just one question here. when you think about kind of the sequential revenue cadence as we move throughout the year, should we be thinking about seasonality differently this year? you have a front end, maybe loaded logistics year versus kind of easy 1q comps in china, easy second quarter comps from some other parts of the world due to the lockdown and then you have kind of the moving pieces with ce. and i know it's hard to sort of guide out beyond one quarter. but maybe, rob, if you're able to give us some sense for how we should be thinking about that sequential cadence, that might be helpful.
dr. robert j. shillman -- chairman and founder
matt, in general, at cognex, we don't give annual guidance, but i think here's what we have said or can say is that we're expecting a large, unusually large first quarter as a result of logistics backlog turning into revenue. and we have a very healthy logistics business that is putting up great growth numbers. so i do expect good growth continuing through the year, but not to the degree that we've seen this what will be an unusual q1 for cognex. and then consumer electronics, it's been a pretty reliable, large contributor to growth in q2 or q3. that's -- or both, right? that's gone on for many years now, and i would expect to see similar things, and we'll have more of a sense of the timing of that when we talk to you at the next conference call in early may. and then q4 is always a strong quarter for our broad factory automation business. it tends to be a lot of year-end purchasing from markets like automotive and other general market, food, beverage, pharmaceuticals, medical. so as often, particularly in the u.s., where there's kind of a budget flush phenomenon that goes on. so i'm not able to give you specific, but i think that's the kind of cadence i would expect and i think q1, obviously, is going to be unusually large due to this very large logistics revenue that's going to hit us.
matt summerville -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
and then maybe as a follow-up, can you maybe comment as to the actionability of what you may have in the m&a pipeline? and how we should be thinking about share repurchases? you guys were pretty active in q1 and then kind of tabled things for the balance of 2020.
dr. robert j. shillman -- chairman and founder
i'll talk about m&a type stuff, and then i'll have paul talk about perhaps the other balance sheet issues. so at cognex, we're always looking at acquisition opportunities. and we really like to purchase technology companies with great engineers and technology who can bring it to cognex. and you've seen us do that with sualab and vidi and enshape and chiaro and other businesses that we've acquired over the last five years or so. so we're always working on that. and those deals happen when they happen and when they're actionable. so there's nothing specifically i can point to. and so that's kind of how the outlook is there. and -- but paul can speak to other aspects of the balance sheet.
paul todgham -- senior vice president of finance and chief financial officer
yes. and matt, i think as we've said before, the purpose of our stock buyback program is primarily to offset the dilution from stock-based compensation. so we repurchased, as you noted, 1.2 million shares in q1 of 2020, spent $51 million doing so at an average price of $42, which looks really good right now from a repurchase point of view. and that -- but that actually did cover the dilution from our 2020 annual grant during that first quarter. we don't take the buyback so time constrained that maybe looked last year. we do tend to issue the majority of our equity in the first quarter as we do through annual grant programs. but our kind of mandate from the board to buy back that dilution is really quite broad.
we would aspire to do it in year broadly, but timing within year or if it happened to carry over to some extent where we happen to be opportunistic and buy a little more, i would view all of that as sort of consistent with our philosophy. so we do have $280 million roughly remaining in our repurchase program. so i feel like we've got cash and dry powder. we will be issuing equity quite shortly. and we'll make those decisions in partnership with the board kind of quarter-to-quarter about when to be more aggressive and when to get ahead of dilution and use 10b5-1 trading plans as appropriate as well.
matt summerville -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
great. thank you guys.

our next question comes from the line of karen lau with gordon haskett. you may proceed with your question.
karen lau -- gordon haskett -- analyst
hi good afternoon everyone and my congrats to dr. bob on his retirement as well. so rob, i think two quarters ago, you initiated the cost reduction action i guess, with the promise that your $1 billion sales milestone has been pushed out because of the pandemic, right? if you keep growing at that range, you wouldn't have to wait very long to reach that milestone. so i guess the question is, at what point do you think you have to add back kind of people cost? and obviously, we saw very strong incremental margins for fourth quarter and in the 1q guide. so i was just curious, at what point, those costs have to come back? and is there something about perhaps the new way of selling or new ways of operating that might lend itself for salespeople to be much more productive than previous cycles so you may not have to add that so quickly.
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
karen, so i think if you go back and you look at cognex's headcount increases and our investments over the last three years, well, perhaps since 2017, you can see that our level of investment in our headcount additions have exceeded our revenue growth significantly. and i think coming into this -- into 2020 we're expecting strong growth. and then when covid hit, we realized that, that was going to be pushed out. so it became obvious that we needed to kind of adjust our headcount. but we also saw opportunities to shift headcount into areas where we saw stronger growth going forward, so logistics and deep learning being obvious examples. and yes, and then, i think it's been just a very volatile situation. so i think we restructured the company in a very healthy way for its future growth.
and i think we still have good capacity in the business to absorb more growth without adding a lot of significant headcount, but we'll have to see kind of how things develop going forward and where -- what rates of growth and what need for headcount we have in future. i would point to our engineering spend, which is a percentage of revenue was certainly relatively high and healthy. we spent more last year on r&d than we spent in any year in the company's history. so certainly, we're not -- we certainly haven't curtailed our r&d and engineering our product launch plans in any way. so in terms of where we may need capacity, it may be more in the sales force. but if you look at our numbers overall, it doesn't imply that we're understaffed or capacity constrained in most areas of the business, at least in the short term.
karen lau -- gordon haskett -- analyst
okay. so the incremental margins for now should be pretty sustainable and then you kind of have to reevaluate toward the middle of the year and see how the recovery trajectory is going, and we have to meet -- add additional salespeople as part of the process, right?
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
yes. yes. i mean, yes, i think we're watching the situation very carefully. you said margin, i mean, the only -- and i think as that relates to expense, that's probably correct. i think we did point out that we expect our gross margins to be a little lower in q1 as a result of more logistics business, which generally is -- its margins are improving nicely over time, but it still is dilutive to our gross margin. so that would be the only qualification i'd put on what you said.
paul todgham -- senior vice president of finance and chief financial officer
yes. and rob, i could add, on the operating expense point of view, a year ago, we were calling out roughly $25 million of kind of incremental opex going into our cost base in 2020 associated with a reset of our annual compensation plans, having not paid a bonus in 2019. and then a full year of sualab expenses, a portion of which is deep learning engineers and the team and the salespeople there as well and a portion of which is just the structure of the acquisition, which had a deferred compensation component that hits your opex over a 4-year period. we don't see sort of any major adds like that in the current year. i think there are some puts and takes, right? this quarter will be a little low on t&e. i hope in the back half will be a little higher.
for the year, we expect our t&e to be up slightly from a headcount. we're making a major investment, which we cited in our 10-k around a new crm and cpq, configure price quote and customer relationship management system. i think we've referenced that to about $10 million in spend, much of that capex this year, but some of that opex that we're bringing. so we have some puts and takes. but by and large, i don't think there's any sort of major resets, let's say, like there was from 2019 going into 2020. and then, of course, we have two more quarters of q1 and q2, where we should be seeing a healthy benefit from the restructuring actions we took last may.
karen lau -- gordon haskett -- analyst
got it. got it. that's very helpful color. and then i want to follow-up on the auto discussion. so rob, you talked about like the differences, the different disposure in ev, different components versus the ice exposure. historically, you have a very strong relationship with the tier one suppliers in all the supply chain. how is your competitive positioning on the ev component side? and are you seeing sort of a different competitive dynamics coming across different competitors, things like that. if you can give us a little bit of color on like how you're positioning ev versus your historical exposures?
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
yes, karen, i think one thing i'd point to is i think a lot of those tier 1, the suppliers, the cognex has had very strong and has been the majority of our automotive business. obviously, we continue to work very closely with them. but i think some of the kind of powertrain internal combustion type of, parts of their business, obviously, is declining and being replaced with ev battery business. and a lot of the technology that goes into making ev batteries has been really developed and is being scaled up by asian companies, right? so that's been kind of a shift where -- and the problems they're working on in some ways is very different. but fortunately, there are areas that cognex technology and very capable and substantial sales force in asia is very well equipped to deal with. so this is an area where we've been able to pivot our business in some ways, and it's more like electronics.
we've been working with those very sophisticated ev battery manufacturers, notably in korea and in china to meet their needs using some technology and capability that we perhaps had originally thought we would use in electronics. so overall, i think we're pretty well positioned. you see some of those names that are big ev suppliers. and also ev car manufacturers themselves who are making place in batteries are starting to be much more substantial customers of cognex. and probably at the expense of some of the tier one suppliers, notably in europe, who maybe over the long run are losing share to that shift that's going on in business.
karen lau -- gordon haskett -- analyst
okay. thanks helpful. thank you.

our next question comes from the line of andrew buscaglia with berenberg. you may proceed with your question.
andrew buscaglia -- berenberg -- analyst
congrats, dr. bob, and good luck.
dr. robert j. shillman -- chairman and founder
thanks, andrew.
andrew buscaglia -- berenberg -- analyst
actually, i had a really important question for you, though, before you go. i'm surprised no one asked it yet, but what does your departure mean for those really entertaining annual reports that you guys put out?
dr. robert j. shillman -- chairman and founder
well, i think you're going to like the one for 2020, and i was certainly involved in that one. and as an advisor, i'm going to continue to be a cognoid, i don't know if the press release made that clear, and an advisor to the board and the company. and i expect that they will still call on me for my input, my creative input into future annual reports. but i hope that there's no change in our philosophy of taking our work seriously but not taking ourselves seriously.
andrew buscaglia -- berenberg -- analyst
that's great to hear. so now for a couple of other questions i have. robert, you cited some interesting commentary on ai and deep learning in the quarter. it's starting to perk up in your sales. can you give us some sort of context around how you think about that in 2021. is this still -- is this going to be growing fast? so is this going to be popping up as meaningful to our revenue or margins or both? and then what end markets should we expect to see some additional movement from ai deep learning?
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
yes. thanks, andrew. and i've just got to add that there's no one more creative to tap than dr. bob for the annual report. so i think he just kind of want to keep his key advising role is help us with that. but yes. so about deep learning, i'll make some commentary on that. it's -- we see it as a technology that's kind of changing the vision space, and it's an area we're investing in and leading in a lot. it's primarily software driven. the gross margins are very good and highly accretive to our business. we said it more than doubled last year. it's still less than 10% of our business overall, but it is a big growth driver. it's happening really on two fronts. one is we're taking that technology and putting it into the smart camera in-sight platform that we have. and the d900 that we launched, one of our most successful product launches, perhaps if not the most successful product launch we've ever had, is using that technology and making it easily available. and so you can expect more of that to go on and i think, change the modular vision system, a smart camera type space that we serve.
and then also, it's really providing a lot to the very high-performance, high-processor requirement business that is our vision software business. and that's bringing a lot of technology, particularly into the electronics space now. and it's adding a lot of value, particularly around the inspection area. some of the technology we acquired from sualab is highly relevant in this space and is beginning to get traction with customers. some of its introduction was held back a little bit by not being able to get engineers on-site to customers during the covid situation, but we're seeing, i think, hopefully an end to that. and the real opportunity there is to replace human inspectors. and there are tens if not hundreds, many hundreds of thousands who are working on visually inspecting products that we think our technology in that space using vision software. and some of the large customers who are very technically sophisticated, see this potential and are working on it with us. so i think there are two avenues that we see deep learning changing, and we're expecting to continue to see really solid growth as the great engineering capability we have in that space bleeds more and more into our product line over the years.
andrew buscaglia -- berenberg -- analyst
interesting. okay. and everything's pretty fixed over, but are you able to give us a sense of the percentage of sales from each end market? because i did hear you say automotive is 1/3, i believe? or are you guys willing to break that out in the first two?
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
i think what we've said, and paul can come in here too, i think we said electronics was approximately 30% of our business overall. i think we said automotive -- did we mention that, paul?
paul todgham -- senior vice president of finance and chief financial officer
yes. yes. so logistics was second for 2020 at about 20%. automotive was also about 20%, but lower than -- slightly lower than logistics. and then kind of the remainder of our portfolio, which would include consumer products, food and beverage, medical, semiconductors would comprise the remaining 30%.
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
okay. not that you need a reason to read our very exciting annual report, which is coming up, but i think there's a little -- there are a few pie charts in there that break it down as well. i think you will enjoy it.
andrew buscaglia -- berenberg -- analyst

blake gendron -- wolfe research -- analyst
yes, thanks. good evening. thanks for taking me on here. and dr. bob, probably a short list of company founders that retire at least to a degree with company strength at an all-time high, so congrats.
dr. robert j. shillman -- chairman and founder
thanks, blake.
blake gendron -- wolfe research -- analyst
you talked about consumer tech. you've talked about the qualitative outlook there and maybe the puts and takes and on the periphery of this question. but i'm just wondering in terms of semi shortages and what we're seeing in terms of bottlenecks in the supply chain, how that impacts either the throughput and more the demand side on consumer tech or if it impacts your input costs, any meaningful degree?
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
yes. well, i think we spoke a little bit to that question earlier. is it related? we don't see shortages in our own supply chain. we're seeing our automotive customers struggle with it, but it doesn't -- we're unclear whether that means they're pulling forward. in consumer electronics, it's not clear to me at the moment that, that's having any impact. but as we know, that business scales later in the year. so we're really going to have a better answer to that question, i think, when we report next time.
blake gendron -- wolfe research -- analyst
okay. that makes sense. and then just to dig into 3d here a little bit. it sounds like it's an exciting growth avenue for yourselves in the broader market here in machine vision. i'm just wondering, specifically in manufacturing, as 3d applications grow, is there any cross-talk or cross communication with 2d vision? is there any cannibalization, i guess, of one versus the other as 3d gets a bit more popular here? how should we think about the interplay between 3d and maybe other major buckets of machine vision?
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
yes. i would say you probably wouldn't do things in 3d that you could do in 2d because it's easier and less expensive, less processor required, less optics required, right? so 3d, i think, is additive. and we're going to see lots of 3d and 2d together, right, in applications, and we certainly have those capabilities and more and more of our customers, they're using them. so perhaps the way to think about it is it's going to grow the market and it's going to lead to higher spend per customer to do more and more sophisticated things with their application. and i think we're near the top of the hour. so i think we'll -- dr. bob, i think we'll turn it over to you.
dr. robert j. shillman -- chairman and founder
okay. thank you. and i want to thank all of cognex's stakeholders, our customers, our employees, our vendors, our neighbors and our shareholders for helping us to grow and succeed over the past 40 years. i want to thank our customers for partnering with us through tough times. i want to thank our cognoids around the world both past and present, for their dedication to our mission. i want to thank our vendors for delivering high-quality components to us at fair prices and on-time even during part shortages. and i want to thank our neighbors where cognex has offices for providing us with safe and attractive neighborhoods in which we can work and play. and last but not least, i want to thank our shareholders who took the time to understand our company and its unique work hard, play hard, move fast culture, and who have maintained their trust in us through these years.

greetings, and welcome to the cognex first quarter 2021 earnings conference call. [operator instructions] [operator instructions]
i would now like to turn this conference over to your host, ms. susan conway, director of investor relations. thank you. you may begin.
susan conway -- senior director of investor relations
thank you. good evening, everyone. welcome to our first quarter earnings conference call. with us are rob willett, cognex's president and ceo; and paul todgham, our chief financial officer. we'll start with prepared remarks and then open the call for questions. i'd like to remind you that our earnings release and quarterly report on form 10-q are available in the investor relations section of our website at www.cognex.com/investor. both contain detailed information about our financial results. during the call, we may use a non-gaap financial measure if we believe it is useful to investors or if we think it will help them better understand our results or business trends.
you can see a reconciliation of certain items from gaap to non-gaap in exhibit two of the earnings release. any forward-looking statements we made in the earnings release or any that we may make during this call are based upon information that we believe to be true as of today. however, things can change, and actual results may differ materially from those projected or anticipated. for a detailed list of risk factors, you should refer to our sec filings, including our most recent form 10-k and our form 10-q filed tonight for q1.
now i'll turn the call over to rob.
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, sue. hello, everyone. thank you for joining us. now i know many of you are used to hearing dr. bob shillman kick off our calls. we'll miss him following his retirement as chairman of cognex's board of directors. if he were joining us today, he would probably say, ""wow, what a quarter!"" for me, i'll start with, we are pleased with our strong start to 2021. cognex reported record first quarter revenue, net income and earnings per share. we are also highly profitable, reporting an after-tax margin of 29%, demonstrating the substantial leverage we have in our business model. most importantly, we are feeling more positive about business activity overall than we have in many months. revenue for q1 was $239 million and in the top half of our expected range. the growth rate year-on-year was 43%, the third quarter in a row in which revenue grew by more than 30% year-on-year.
revenue also increased on a sequential basis, which is contrary to our typical seasonal experience. the biggest contributor to growth was logistics, which for the first time in our history, was our largest end market. we reported another record revenue quarter in logistics due to continued strong demand from the e-commerce sector. notably, we believe the strength we have been experiencing is broadening. sectors that struggled in 2020, such as brick-and-mortar retail and airport baggage handling are beginning to invest again. revenue from most manufacturing industries increased meaningfully year-on-year. highlights include automotive, which grew quicker than expected and at the fastest rate in some time. consumer products and food and beverage picked up noticeably. medical-related industries and semi continue to be strong. consumer electronics also grew year-on-year in q1.
as many of you are anticipating, we're ready to share our view of this year's spending cycle. for 2021, we believe revenue for consumer electronics will be modestly below the level we reported last year. this follows a very good year in 2020, during which consumer electronics was cognex's largest industry and grew by about 30% over 2019. we expect less investment in smartphone manufacturing and in devices needed for online learning and working from home. as for timing, we believe q3 will be our largest revenue-generating quarter for consumer electronics. however, in q3 this year, we expect a lower concentration of electronics revenue than we saw in q3 of last year. moving now to our supply chain. the team continues to do a good job navigating a difficult environment. supply chains are under pressure for most companies, including cognex, because of increased customer demand, lengthening component lead times, some vendors struggling to supply parts, elevated freight costs and covid concerns.
our close relationships with suppliers and our practice of holding substantial component inventory are helping us manage well through these challenges. let's talk next about new product development. since the start of the year, we introduced three powerful next-generation platforms that we've been working on for a number of years. first is the in-sight 3d-l4000, which we discussed on our february call. this exciting new smart camera platform leverages in-sight's widely used spreadsheet interface for the fast-growing industrial 3d vision market. we believe the 4000 is a breakthrough product that makes cognex's industry-leading true 3d vision tools as easy to use as 2d. as one customer summed up nicely, a new application can be up and running in minutes. the l4000 positions us very effectively against some of our competitors who have significant sales and profits in 3d vision. second, we launched the dataman 8700 series, our next generation of industrial handheld barcode readers.
the 8700 series reasserts our technology leadership for handheld barcode reading in automotive, medical devices, electronics and other industries. customers tell us its speed and accuracy in reading the most difficult codes, etched on metal and other surfaces leapfrogs the other products available today. oil resistance, robust industrial protocols, wireless communication options and a built-in oled display are all key differentiators for our new range of handheld readers. third, we introduced an edge platform for extracting more value from the billions of digital images generated daily by cognex products. cognex edge intelligence, or ei, helps customers understand the performance of devices deployed across facilities, quickly identify issues and take corrective action. we held extensive beta trials at ei with some of the world's largest logistics and consumer products companies.
they praised ei's ability to reduce costly downtime, provide immediate, actionable quality data and improve productivity. ei also easily integrates with industry 4.0 solutions from larger automation companies, providing access to valuable factory data for predictive analytics. i'm proud of the team's success introducing these products during covid. our first virtual launch about a year ago at the start of the pandemic was the in-sight d900 deep learning smart camera. today, we're successfully launching new products, training our sales engineers, distributor partners and customers, and holding technical discussions, trade shows and product demonstrations virtually. we're winning a lot of business in this manner and intend to continue to do so in 2021 and beyond. cognoids continue to work productively together and with our customers, partners and vendors. even though it's encouraging that life in most of our markets is starting to improve, we look forward to collaborating more in person as the world moves beyond the pandemic.
now i'll hand the call over to paul for details of the quarter.
paul todgham -- senior vice president of finance and chief financial officer
thank you, rob, and hello, everyone. as mentioned, revenue for q1 was $239 million, which is a new first quarter record. we're also pleased to deliver revenue within our expected range after substantial outperformance in q3 and q4 of 2020. we believe this demonstrates visibility is improving for both cognex and our customers. as expected, logistics ""delivered"" a quarter for us as the largest contributor to year-on-year growth and our fastest-growing end market. within logistics, the e-commerce sector was particularly strong. automotive drove the second largest contribution to growth, and we hope this marks the start of a longer road to recovery. medical-related industries were also very healthy. the semiconductor market was strong, too, though i'm lacking a good pun for that one.
the recovery in the broader factory automation market continues to gain traction. gross margin was 77% compared to 75% in both q1 and q4 of 2020. the increase versus prior year was due primarily to cost efficiencies related to higher sales volume, favorable product mix and the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes. in addition, certain lower-margin logistics orders we expected to deliver in q1 shifted to later in the year, contributing to the higher gross margin this quarter than anticipated. operating expenses increased by 1% year-on-year, which was slightly more than expected. higher incentive compensation and the translation impact of a weaker dollar were partially offset by lower travel and entertainment costs and savings realized from the restructuring program we announced last spring.
we also greenlit selective investments given our business strength. on a sequential basis, operating expenses decreased by low single digits due to final restructuring charges of $875,000 in q4 that did not repeat and the reset of annual commission plans in q1. we reported excellent operating leverage on the revenue growth. operating margin expanded to 33%, a dramatic increase over the 13% delivered in q1 of 2020. below operating income, investment income decreased by more than $3.5 million year-on-year, primarily because of lower yields on our portfolio in the current environment. we also reported a foreign currency loss of $1 million on the revaluation and settlement of receivable and payable balances. the effective tax rate was 18% in q1 of 2021, 17% in q1 of 2020 and 14% in q4 of 2020, excluding discrete tax items in all periods.
the increase compared to the prior periods was because we earned a greater share of pre-tax income in higher tax jurisdictions. reported earnings were $0.39 per share in q1 of 2021 compared with $0.12 in q1 of 2020 and $0.39 in q4 of 2020. excluding restructuring and other charges and discrete tax items, non-gaap earnings more than tripled to $0.36 in q1 from $0.11 a year ago, an increase from $0.32 in q4. as you know, we shy away from non-gaap metrics at cognex. however, with the large restructuring, inventory writedown and intangible asset impairment we took last year, we've been providing additional transparency to help investors understand our ongoing business results. for 2021, we intend to stick with the same methodology to maintain consistency with prior year comparisons.
looking at the change in revenue for q1 from a geographic perspective, we saw our growth broaden in all regions year-on-year. the americas was our best performing region, increasing by more than 75% year-on-year and delivering the largest contribution to growth. the increase was led by substantially higher revenue from logistics, medical-related industries, including medical devices and companies scaling up production for covid-related products continued to grow well. revenue from asia increased by more than 25% year-on-year due to growth from automotive, consumer electronics and the broader market. currency exchange rate fluctuations contributed about four percentage points to that growth. in europe, revenue grew in the high teens over q1 of 2020, about half of which was due to a weaker u.s. dollar.
logistics, automotive and the broader factory automation market increased despite many businesses operating under significant restrictions. turning to the balance sheet. cognex continues to have a strong cash position with $876 million in cash and investments and no debt. in q1, we spent $6.5 million to repurchase cognex stock. we plan to continue to buy back stock in q2 at a regular pace while maintaining flexibility to be more opportunistic. as announced tonight, our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.06 per share payable on june four to all shareholders of record as of may 21.
now i'll turn the call back over to rob.
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, paul. in summary, cognex had a strong first quarter and our guidance for q2 is also very positive. we believe revenue for q2 will be between $250 million and $270 million. at the midpoint, this range represents growth of more than 50% year-on-year from reduced levels in 2020. it's also the fourth quarter in a row with revenue growth in excess of 30%. notably, although it's not our practice to provide full year guidance, we would call out that comparisons are expected to get tougher in the second half. we expect growth in q2 will again be led by logistics, which continues to perform very well indeed. a recovery in automotive and the broader factory automation market appears under way and we believe will contribute nicely.
gross margin is expected to be in the mid-70% range. however, we believe it will be below the gross margin reported in q1 and recent quarters. we expect to recognize revenue on a few lower margin but strategically important logistics projects with large new customers that are rapidly adopting machine vision technology. operating expenses are expected to be flat to slightly up on a sequential basis. we expect increased sales and marketing activity and incremental growth investments will be largely offset by savings elsewhere. lastly, the effective tax rate is expected to be 18%, excluding discrete tax items.
now we will open the call for questions. operator, please go ahead.

[operator instructions] our first question comes from the line of josh pokrzywinski with morgan stanley.
brandy -- morgan stanley. -- analyst
this is brandy on for josh. i wanted to start with electronics and what's driving the guidance there. so i know last year, the mix was a lot higher -- mix was higher than usual in notebooks and tablets due to some of the work-from-home dynamics. so can you talk about the investments in that area and how they're trending versus smartphone investments?
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
yes. okay. so yes, i think we said that revenue from consumer electronics will be modestly lower this year. i think there was a lot of investment made last year that still is current and producing current models of electronics. so we see that. and i think some of the incremental spend around work from home electronics and products that we'll roll out for that are in the market currently. i think the electronics being a market where there can be big years and less big years, right? and so i think this is a less big year than some of the big ones we've seen in the past, like 2017 or either even 2020 that we just saw. but i still think it's a relatively positive year with quite a lot of good activity going on and the rollout of some key technologies like 5g still well under way. i think in the long run, what might make for bigger years like we saw last year or very large incremental revenue growth would be things like new technologies coming to market.
we've seen those in the past around sensors or new screens, technologies that are on the horizon, i think, include things like augmented reality. we're not expecting to see that necessarily hit investment in a big way, but -- in this year, but possibly in future. we do see opportunities for deep learning to eliminate cosmetic defects and also just the general continuing reduction of labor content is something that electronics customers we see investing and whether that's labor that causes quality control issues or whether it's just the cost and difficulty of sourcing labor in the current environment. all of those are kind of levers that we see kind of rolling up into our guidance this year or our expectation this year that it will be a good year but not a great year.
brandy -- morgan stanley. -- analyst
got it. that's helpful. and then just on the supply chain, within your own operations, just some of the pressures that you might have been seeing? and then for customers that you found that they held back on some purchases due to bottlenecks from their own suppliers?
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
yes, sure. so we think we're managing the current very challenging supply chain environment very well. i would say, i think it's the most challenging supply environment i've experienced in my 13 years at cognex. and i think we're navigating well between business activity picking up quicker than i think probably most of us expected, tight supply of certain components, particularly electronic components, including ics, leds, capacitors, resistors. deliveries are taking longer because of lower freight capacity and labor shortages, both for cognex and our customers, whether that's covid, causing quarantine of employees when there may be cases in workforces or just labor shortages, which i'm sure we're all reading about, people not coming back into the workforce at -- as quickly as we might have expected.
so i think we're seeing all of that. i mean -- and i think those are probably internal to cognex, i can speak to. but if i talk about our customers, clearly, i think they're probably much more impacted than we are, particularly in certain sectors such as automotive, where electronic components shortages are causing some of them to reduce production. what i would say is though i don't think we're seeing that in our orders. in fact, maybe we're seeing some kind of pre-emptive buying or order giving to us where they may be concerned about our supply shortages, which we communicate with them. we're not totally concerned about that. but still, i think there's a mentality out there reporting that may be going on in some industries. paul, anything you want to add?
paul todgham -- senior vice president of finance and chief financial officer
no, i think that's right. specific to your question about are people delaying orders, i think the answer is very little that we're seeing today. and yes, i would underscore rob's point about the toughest environment in 13 years, and it's been my toughest in 13 months at cognex [indecipherable]
operator
our next question comes from the line of richard eastman with baird.
richard eastman -- baird -- analyst
yes. just a couple of things. when you look at the second quarter or the second quarter guide, and you kind of parse out the growth from the first quarter to the second the second quarter, the incremental growth. could you just maybe speak to where that's coming from? in other words, is logistics -- was logistics kind of had a -- have a peak quarter in the first quarter? or maybe just kind of speak to the sequential growth rate and which industries might be driving that?
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
sure. i think, obviously, we don't give specific industry-related guidance. but i will say we expect another strong revenue quarter for logistics in q2 based on increasing demand and sizable backlog of orders we have to deliver. so i think this definitely, logistics would be the headline. but i think revenue from consumer products and food is increasing nicely. medical-related industries is growing faster than the company average overall. and consumer electronics is expected to increase due to the timing of annual spend. so i think there's a lot of different things that are helping to contribute to that.
richard eastman -- baird -- analyst
and if you -- just a quick question around -- i think you flagged the consumer electronics business having a good year, not a bigger year than last year, it'd be slightly down. but could you just speak to the weighting around consumer electronics. so it was a little bit of a question mark whether q2 sees the bulk of the shipments or q3 does?
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
yes. let me -- thank you. let me provide some clarity on that. so i think we're expecting q3 to be our largest quarter for consumer electronics, although not as large relatively as it was last year in q3. and overall, consumer electronics was our largest vertical last year and accounted for roughly 30% of total revenue.
operator
our next question comes from the line of joe giordano with cowen. so just trying to draw a line between some of the prepared comments and kind of what just said there. with consumer electronics being strongest in third quarter, about less than last year, but logistics kind of being strong, seemingly all year this year and some stuff being pushed from first quarter later a little bit out, rob, do you have a sense of like is 2q your high revenue quarter for the year? do you have that kind of sense yet?
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
i think generally, we don't kind of call quarters by overall. but i would say we're feeling confident, as you can see in the guidance, about q2, q3 is often a big quarter for us. and although i did say comparisons get harder, still, i think there's we're expecting a good quarter from a number of different industries as we move through the year. so i think we might expect a more level loaded year in terms of quarters as we go through this year. the normal situation in the underlying fa business, i think, holds, which is the first quarter is normally the slowest. the fourth quarter is often the strongest. certainly can't see out that far at this moment but i would expect that's a kind of underlying cadence with strength in logistics just going throughout the year and then strength in electronics most pronounced in q3.
i think to maybe say the obvious, logistics is just a great growth business for us. we're very excited to see how well it's continuing to deliver. we've invested a lot there. we have just great industry-leading technology. and we continue to be pleased with the strength we're seeing in that industry, but more just how broad it's becoming. it's not only e-commerce now. we're seeing investment returning to other areas of the market. so it's difficult to call how long the kind of extraordinary growth rates we're putting up now are. but in the long run, we said our stretch goal is to grow that business at 50%, and that's kind of what we've got our eyes on.
joe giordano -- cowen. -- analyst
that's very helpful. and more of a bigger picture question, how do you see yourself positioned in the 3d market now? i know you guys were kind of later entrants to that. i'm just curious of how do you think you kind of penetrated that market over the last few years? and where do you think you are relative to the competition like framed versus where you are and obviously very strong in traditional vision?
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
yes. thank you. so 3d vision, we think, is a very attractive market. we think it's a market that's still in its relatively early stages of development. technically, it's challenging, which we like because we're a technology company. i'd say we've invested quite a lot, and we haven't seen the kind of revenue growth that we would have hoped to have seen. but what we do see now is we're bringing to market some really great products. and i'd point to the 3d-a1000 we launched a little over a year ago that provides high-speed dimensioning and sorting of items and packages and logistics. and that's been a big success for us, i would say, and it looks very positive going forward. but perhaps more importantly, the 3d-l4000 platform that we just launched, it's a highly competitive product that combines true 3d vision and easy-to-use smart camera on the in-sight platform.
so generally, 3d has been a technology that's being run connected to a pc, like a high -- a very high-performance processor in a separate box and what this new range does taking kind of all the advances we've seen in chips, is we're able to have a very high-performance smart camera, single format, which customers really like in automation on the in-sight platform so that can just be programmed and then left to run. so that's something we're excited about. a lot of breakthrough optics that we've launched in that space also where the image acquisition that we have is very powerful. now to your question about kind of where are we. there's definitely a very large player in that market who we compete with, who has, by far, the largest market share, our main competitor from japan. and certainly, they've done very well in that market. i think we're bringing new innovations to that market that i hope will have our customers start to help us gain share in that space also. but so it's been a long road. we're starting to deliver, i think, well, and i'm optimistic.
paul todgham -- senior vice president of finance and chief financial officer
yes, certainly, we're early in the product life cycle in our recent releases, but we are seeing traction from a revenue point of view. and obviously, we don't go into details about growth by product segment, but it's -- we're very happy with the growth we're seeing from a relatively modest base.
operator
our next question comes from the line of matt summerville with d.a. davidson.
matt summerville -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
a couple of questions. first, maybe just to frame up logistics a little bit differently. can you maybe, rob, apply sort of a baseball analogy in terms of what inning we might be in, in your business as it pertains to the e-commerce side of logistics as well as the non-e-commerce side?
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
yes. matt, my problem is i grew up in england, so i played cricket, but paul knows a lot about baseball. but i'd say we're in an early inning if that's kind of what you're pushing for. i think -- here's what i would say about logistics. i think that this is a market that when you look at the integrators or even the adoption of technology in that market, it really -- until very recently was -- the market was really led by companies that sold conveyors and kind of equipment for moving products around with the idea you were basically having trucks stock stores with inventory to be removed. and obviously, the whole game has changed and that change is accelerating as you have e-commerce where really it's a whole integrated supply chain where product is being pulled in real time to match the demands of customers.
and there's a very big wave of automation investment. and obviously, you don't just see that with cognex, you see that with other players who have invested in this industry. it's also an industry where the integrators have gone through a lot of consolidation with some big companies moving in and making acquisitions in order to drive that. so i think we're in an early inning. and i think one also -- another data point i'd point you to is still what percentage of american purchases are really done online, and it's still relatively small, right? so i think we can expect to see that continue. i think the other -- maybe another metric i'd point you to is just the number of employees, people who are working in distribution centers. the cost and the difficulty of working in that kind of environment, particularly recently, all points to the opportunity for automation.
paul todgham -- senior vice president of finance and chief financial officer
a couple of data points, matt, to add. about a little over 18 months ago, we shared that we believe our -- the addressable market opportunity in logistics was about $1 billion and growing about 15% a year. now obviously, that was a kind of prepandemic data point, which i think has maybe changed the composition of that and who's profited most and so on, but generally feel like that's still a pretty good benchmark. and we also have talked about our ambition of stretch goal to grow the business 50% per year, obviously, a little bit spiky and so on, but logistics is our fastest-growing end market this quarter, and we grew 43% in revenue. you can extrapolate that we probably exceeded that.
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
yes. and i should just add, that's our served market. so if we got all the business that we can do in that market, the $1 billion a couple of years ago, obviously, it would be -- have grown significantly after that.
matt summerville -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
great. and then as my follow-up question, we've seen across sort of just the industrial tech space, an acceleration, if you will, in m&a activity, more actionable things coming into the funnel. obviously, you guys have a very strong balance sheet. can you talk about what you're seeing from an m&a standpoint in terms of actionability?
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
i think that's correct. we're seeing a lot more actionable targets and we're very selective. as you know, we have -- we're very concerned about cultural fit and growth potential and companies that integrate well with us. so we're very selective, but i would say, compared to a year ago or other times, many more actionable targets, a lot more activity going on and much more expectation. now we tend to be pretty cold and analytical about the whole thing. so we're not getting drawn into any -- we're not feeling in any rush to do anything. but you're absolutely right. we have a strong balance sheet. and the number 1 thing we'd like to do with our cash is acquire great companies who can help us in our journey.
operator
our next question comes from the line of andrew buscaglia with berenberg.
andrew buscaglia -- berenberg -- analyst
so i wanted to check on gross margins. great quarter for those. and you called for a little bit of a step down. i just want to confirm, is that just because of mix, probably more logistics versus consumer electronics?
paul todgham -- senior vice president of finance and chief financial officer
yes. certainly, that's -- as logistics is growing as a share of revenue, and we've shared previously, it does have a lower gross margin profile today, though it's been improving, i think that's one key aspect of it. we did have some higher-margin revenue in the quarter in q1 that we don't expect to repeat. so that's partly why the 77% we realized is higher than we've typically had and not a number we'd expect to hit again for some time.
and then specifically within logistics, as rob called out, we had some revenue that we'd expected to hit in the quarter, which is more of an investment with a newer customer for us that now we're going to see through the rest of this year, q2 to q4. and so that's a modest drag on our margins, but a great strategic move for us. so yes, we do expect logistics margins to still be generally in kind of our mid-70s range, but certainly lower than the last -- than we experienced this quarter and likely lower than we experienced in the past couple of quarters.
andrew buscaglia -- berenberg -- analyst
okay. okay. and then along with the gross margin question, you talked about some pretty interesting new products coming online. and i wonder, are some of the things you're doing pretty innovative in ai and deep learning in that, you might -- as they scale, would they have an effect on your gross margins that could nudge them above that mid-70% range long term? is that the kind of the goal? or i guess what do you foresee over the next few years with that?
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
well, we love gross margin at cognex. and one of the reasons we do is we think it's a measure of how innovative we are in the value of our technology. so that's certainly something that we take pride in and cognoids take pride in. in terms of areas where we're growing, and where we expect future growth, certainly, deep learning is very high-margin and a high-growth business for us. so i think the more mix we see and the more growth we see in that area, the higher gross margins we can expect to realize. and then some of the other product i mentioned, edge intelligence.
certainly, that's primarily a software and data-driven business for us and also with recurring revenue. so again, i would expect to see a lift in gross margin from that. and then i think it's important to add that we take a long-term view about these things. so paul mentioned a very exciting new and potentially large customer we have in the logistics space. and we've seen this in other industries where we're willing to invest and work alongside our engineers to help them and us develop that business for higher gross margins in future. so i do expect logistics to be improving and that also in the long run to be accretive to our gross margins.
operator
our next question comes from the line of jairam nathan with daiwa capital markets.
jairam nathan -- daiwa capital markets -- analyst
i just wanted to kind of spend a little time on automotive. and i noticed americas was up mostly because of logistics and medical, even put automotive there. that segment -- that sector seems to be the most impacted by the chip shortages. so i just wanted to kind of get your idea on your outlook for the year? do you think there might be some pushouts that might impact automotive this year?
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
okay. thanks for the question. i think there's quite a lot of stuff going on in automotive. i think overall, we're -- we've seen the automotive business globally accelerate faster than we expected in recent months and particularly around electric vehicles. so i think -- and i think we're all observing the world of automotive is changing, right? and the investment is more around electric vehicles and we're also seeing some larger capital projects coming in. so companies that might -- we might associate with europe or america, we may actually see investing heavily in battery resources that there may be oem sales for us in asia, for instance. so i think i see that kind of change going on. so the kind of most exciting increase we've seen in automotive in recent months has been coming out of asia. your second sort of area, i think you've kind of probed that as chip shortages, and is that going to impact our business, maybe in america or elsewhere in automotive.
and what we -- what i would say is not so far, it doesn't appear to be doing so. it's -- obviously, we're generally spending -- we're seeing increases in spend tend to be around capital projects. and even if automotive companies can't be producing because of chip shortages, i think some of their spend or a lot of their spend with us is -- relates to projects that may be for around new lines that they may be planning to launch in later quarters and later years. but that said, i think it's hard to have visibility about what happens beyond next -- this quarter we're currently in. i think there's potential disruption that may be longer term and longer second order effects from chip shortages. and i think we do expect the chip shortage problem or the supply chain challenges that we see and our customers see to go on for some time. so i think that certainly is an area we are watching closely. but it's certainly baked into our thinking on q2 guidance and how we're looking at the business overall.
jairam nathan -- daiwa capital markets -- analyst
and just as a follow-up, just want to look at europe. so excluding currency, it was up kind of probably in the low single digit -- sorry, high single digits and so -- and i know you mentioned lockdowns and stuff. but do you -- what's the outlook within europe? and what are some of the industries that kind of seems to be dragging you back there?
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
yes. so activity in europe was better than we expected in the first quarter, and it does continue to improve. but i would say it's behind what we see in the americas and the americas is behind what we see in asia, right? so europe certainly is the laggard there. so -- but i would say investment plans for automation in europe are gathering speed and the three big economies of europe are improving, germany, italy, the u.k. for us in our industry and even in terms of automation. and then growth in logistics in europe is also leading the way. we're seeing that's a great industry for us globally, and that applies to europe, too.
and then automotive is growing, again, in europe due to both general expansion and investment in electric vehicles. so -- and i would say, manufacturers are adopting machine vision and deep learning to improve throughputs and quality and reduce human interactions, and we see that in europe. one thing i'd also just point out is that over a number of years, we've seen some purchases of product for cognex move from europe to asia. it's the same business that is being purchased in a different location. so that sometimes can mean that revenue that you -- when associated with europe is now largely recognized in china.
paul todgham -- senior vice president of finance and chief financial officer
yes. and that wouldn't change the order of growth of our respective regions, but it's not trivial. it's a few million dollars. so it kind of does understate europe's growth rate and slightly overstates asia's.

[operator instructions] our next question comes from the line of joseph craig giordano, cowen and company.
joe giordano -- cowen. -- analyst
just, rob, curious. not looking for like dollar amounts but if you think about logistics last year, can you maybe talk us through the cadence of like the weightings by quarter at a high level and how that differs from what your kind of broad expectation is this year? and then for that new customer that you're onboarding in logistics, i know you're not going to name names, but any color in terms of like whether it's like a retailer, 3pl, parcel delivery, like what areas of logistics this new customer plays in?

yes. paul, why don't you talk about quarterization and then i'll talk about...
paul todgham -- senior vice president of finance and chief financial officer
yes. and joe, we're not going to obviously give full details here. but i think i think we communicated this largely last year. our logistics revenue generally grew through the year. so q1 was our lowest quarter last year in logistics. so the fact that it's kind of our biggest contributor to growth this quarter is partly from a very strong quarter this year, but also it was our lowest base. this year, we expected, as we said in february, for q1 to be our strongest quarter. we now realize that guidance was overly conservative. and i'd say we're expecting fairly broad-based relatively consistent strength throughout the year. so this year, it's having somewhat of a moderating effect on our revenue profile by quarter.
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
and then, joe, to address your kind of question about customer, i guess, broadening that we see in our customer base and logistics and the customer we were referencing. i think logistics for us and for our customers is kind of a journey. and we've -- they've -- a lot of the investment that we've seen earlier on with our technology in this space has been from kind of technology leaders, companies that are very technically savvy and kind of build business models around e-commerce.
but i think the way we're starting to see is perhaps companies that weren't -- didn't consider themselves e-commerce companies that have big resources and are making big plays to invest in the space to make sure that they're highly relevant in a new world where most commerce is done online, either picked up at store or delivered, and they're investing to catch up. so -- and that applies to a number of big famous names that we would associate with the retail space. and they now have, i would say, the technical sophistication and engineering ability and the will to invest in this space and they recognize what we have to offer based on other successes we're having in the market. so i think that's coming together very nicely for us.

operator
greetings, and welcome to the cognex second quarter 2021 earnings conference call. [operator instructions]. as a reminder, this conference is being recorded. i would now like to turn this conference over to your host, ms. susan conway, senior director of investor relations. thank you, maam. you may begin.
susan conway -- senior director of investor relations
thank you. good evening, everyone. welcome to our second quarter earnings conference call. with us are rob willett, cognex president and ceo; and paul todgham, our chief financial officer. well start with prepared remarks and then open the call for questions. id like to remind you that our earnings release and quarterly report on form 10-q are available in the investor relations section of our website at www.cognex.com/investor. both contain detailed information about our financial results. during the call, we may use a non-gaap financial measure if we believe it is useful to investors or if we think it will help them better understand our results or business trends. you can see a reconciliation of certain items from gaap to non-gaap in exhibit two of the earnings release. any forward-looking statements we made in the earnings release or any that we may make during this call are based upon information that we believe to be true as of today. however, things can change, and actual results may differ materially from those projected or anticipated. for a detailed list of risk factors, you should refer to our sec filings, including our most recent form 10-k and form 10-q we filed tonight for q2. now ill turn the call over to rob.
robert willett -- chief executive officer, president & executive director
thanks, sue. hello, everyone. thank you for joining us. as shown in todays news release, cognex reported the highest quarterly revenue in our 40-year history, along with terrific profitability for the second quarter of 2021. revenue was also at the top of the expected range we gave as guidance last quarter. revenue grew by 59% from q2 of 2020, making it the fourth quarter in a row in which we have recorded year-on-year revenue growth of more than 30%. this high level of achievement was made possible by the efforts of cognoids around the world. they worked hard to support customers and meet increasing order rates in a very difficult supply environment. logistics was again our largest end market in q2. we also reported another record revenue quarter for logistics due to continued strong demand from the e-commerce sector.
cognex is recognized as the technology leader in logistics by companies investing for improved productivity and throughput. thats leading to a broadening customer base for us. plus sectors that struggled in 2020, such as brick-and-mortar retail are restarting their automation plans. consumer electronics was a large contributor to growth in q2. revenue was higher than we expected because some business happened earlier than we anticipated. while the highlights for this quarter, it does not change our overall view of consumer electronics for the year. we continue to believe revenue from consumer electronics for 2021 will be modestly below the level we recorded last year. this is due to lower levels of investment in smartphone manufacturing and in devices needed for online learning and working from home when compared to a year ago. revenue from manufacturing industries increased substantially from depressed levels in q2 of 2020.
automotive set a new quarterly revenue record after being hard hit last year. other highlights included consumer products and food and beverage. semi also grew well year-on-year, medical-related industries did too. moving now to our supply chain. were facing the most difficult supply chain environment ive experienced in my 13 years at cognex. the use of cognex products is growing worldwide as manufacturers respond to labor shortages and increasing consumer demand. theyre implementing machine vision to improve their throughput and the quality of their products. at the same time, cognex and many other companies are under pressure from record long component lead times, vendors struggling to supply parts, freight delays and capacity constraints, labor shortages and covid concerns. at a time like this, were thankful we never focused on just-in-time inventory or squeezed our suppliers for short-term gains. our close long-term relationships with our suppliers have been helping us.
even so, the situation intensified as we move through q2, we continue to aggressively secure strategic components and move fast to certify alternative parts where we see shortages. our suppliers understand that, and our customers appreciate what were doing to accommodate their requests. lets talk next about new product development. the spring and summer are an exciting time at cognex. its when we bring our technical and sales leadership together for strategic planning. these are some of my favorite weeks of the year. theres a tremendous excitement within cognex about the new technologies and products we expect to introduce over the next few years and the growth opportunities ahead of us. cognex industry-leading vision tools are a key differentiator for us in solving our customers most challenging applications. our long-term development and investment in rd&e continue to make our vision tools progressively stronger, more accessible and easier to use. an example is visionpro 10, a recent major update to our pc-based vision platform. visionpro 10 enables customers to use cognex rules-based vision software and deep learning technology together more easily in a powerful development environment.
along with visionpro 10, we introduced smart line, the industrys first hybrid smart tool for pc vision that combines the high accuracy of 2d vision with the flexibility of deep learning. smart line quickly solves complex line detection for high-precision alignment applications in consumer electronics assembly and semiconductor manufacturing processes that are too challenging for traditional vision alone. furthermore, our new visionpro deep learning 2.0 software release which runs with visionpro 10, adds new deep learning capabilities from cognex that enable the high-precision measurement of scratches, blemishes, cracks and other defects. this is particularly valuable in demanding medical and electronics applications. were also leveraging a software advantage with new optics technology from investments weve made in image formation. an example is our new high-speed steerable mirror, which features next-generation liquid lens technology to significantly expand the field of view for our powerful dataman 470 fixed mount bar code reader.
the steerable mirror is ideal for quickly reading a high volume of bar codes at shorter working distances such as in pharmaceutical packaging aggregation as well as across large fields of view such as reading many bar codes on a large pallet in the warehouse. both applications previously required either the integration of multiple readers or the programming of pc vision and many high-resolution cameras. in other product news, we continue to make good progress transitioning our logistics business from customized to standard solutions. these standard solutions are easier to deploy and require less hands on engineering support from cognex. we believe this will enable us to scale more easily and report higher gross margins in logistics over the long term. its gratifying to see the hard work and ingenuity of cognoids come to market in innovations like these. they underscore the value of our long-term investments in rd&e. the decisions we make on where to invest and our work hard, play hard, move fast approach to business continue to serve us well. now i will hand the call over to paul for details of the quarter.
paul todgham -- senior vice president of finance & chief financial officer
thanks, rob, and hello, everyone. as mentioned, revenue for q2 was $269 million, which represents a 59% increase over a weak quarter a year ago and a new all-time revenue record. we were pleased to deliver revenue at the top of our expected range. we believe this demonstrates improved visibility and our success in navigating the difficult supply environment. its worth noting that q2 of 2020 was an unusual quarter due to covid and our own restructuring actions. q2 of 2019 provides another potential helpful comparison. revenue in this years q2 was 35% above that pre-covid period of two years ago. our three largest end markets, logistics, automotive and consumer electronics, all made strong contributions to year-on-year growth. we were particularly pleased that automotive exceeded our highest pre-covid level to set a new quarterly record. broadly speaking, growth in many sectors is running at a good clip.
gross margin was 75% and within our target range. our gross margin increased substantially year-on-year because of an $8 million excess inventory charge in q2 of 2020 resulting from last years economic disruption. on a sequential basis, gross margin declined as we expected due to revenue mix. we are beginning to experience cost increases associated with the current supply environment. given our software like gross margin and our customer-first philosophy, we are prioritizing customer demand, even if it means a modest short-term hit to the p&l. i want to remind you that in q2 of 2020, operating expenses included a restructuring charge of $15 million from a program undertaken to rightsize the team and a noncash impairment charge of $20 million, primarily to write down a portion of acquired intangible assets. excluding these charges, the combined total of rd&e and sg&a increased by 19% year-on-year and was in line with our expectations.
one driver of that increase was incentive compensation, which consists primarily of sales commissions and company bonus related to the higher revenue. travel and other sales and marketing activities are also higher this year, and we have higher expenses from incremental growth investments, stock-based compensation expense and the translation impact of a weaker dollar. savings, primarily from last years restructuring activities, have partially offset these increases. operating margin in q2 of 2021 was 34%, reflecting excellent leverage on the revenue growth. that compares very favorably to the operating loss we reported in last years q2, resulting from the charges for the restructuring actions, intangible asset impairment and inventory write-down. below operating income, investment income decreased by approximately $1.5 million year-on-year primarily because of lower yields on our portfolio in the current environment. the effective tax rate, excluding discrete tax items, was 18% in both q1 and q2 of 2021 compared to a benefit of 1% in q2 of 2020. on a non-gaap basis, earnings were $0.43 per share in q2 compared with $0.18 in q2 of 2020 and $0.36 in q1 of 2021, excluding discrete tax items and the three charges just mentioned.
looking at the change in revenue for q2 from a geographic perspective, growth broadened year-on-year in all regions. europe was our fastest-growing region, helped by currency exchange rates. revenue grew by more than 60% over a particularly challenging quarter a year ago. 10 percentage points of the increase was due to the weaker u.s. dollar. growth drivers includes automotive, logistics, consumer products and other industries in europes broad factory automation market. the americas increased by more than 50% year-on-year and delivered the largest contribution in absolute dollars. substantially higher revenue from logistics led the increase. automotive and medical-related industries also contributed nicely. revenue from asia also increased by more than 50% year-on-year. consumer electronics increased substantially due to the timing of this years spending cycle. automotive, semi and the broader market continued to grow well, particularly in asia outside of japan.
currency exchange rate fluctuations contributed about four percentage points to asias growth. turning to the balance sheet. cognex continues to have a strong cash position with $952 million in cash and investments and no debt. we spent $14 million to repurchase cognex stock in q2 and a total of $21 million year-to-date. we plan to continue to buy back stock in q3 at a regular pace while maintaining flexibility to be more opportunistic. as we announced tonight, our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.06 per share payable on september three to all shareholders of record as of august 20. now ill turn the call back over to rob.
robert willett -- chief executive officer, president & executive director
thank you, paul. in summary, cognex had a very strong second quarter in which we reported record revenue. it was also our fourth quarter in a row of revenue growth exceeding 30% year-on-year. we believe that growth is unsustainably high, and expect comparisons will moderate in the back half. for q3, we expect revenue will be between $275 million and $295 million. at the midpoint, this expected range represents growth of about 14% year-on-year. breaking it down in more detail, we believe logistics will be a growth driver in q3, both year-on-year and sequentially. the automotive and the broader factory automation market should continue to contribute nicely. we do expect some seasonal softness during the summer months as usual. we expect consumer electronics will be a headwind in q3.
you may recall that last years third quarter included a heavy concentration of electronics revenue that drove substantial year-on-year growth for the company overall. this year, we expect revenue will be more evenly split between q2 and q3, and that consumer electronics will show a modest decline in total for the year. we believe gross margin in q3 will be in the low to mid-70% range. as we discussed in our q1 call, were making a strategic investment in a high potential customer and logistics as its in the early phase of adopting cognex products. were working on a major deployment with them that we will substantially complete by the end of the third quarter. we also expect to go on expediting customer orders and paying higher component costs. we expect operating expenses will increase by mid-single digits on a sequential basis. were adding resources in both engineering and sales. were supporting large deployments of cognex products, were preparing for upcoming product launches, and were seeing the resumption of some expenses such as domestic travel in certain geographies. lastly, we expect the effective tax rate will be 18%, excluding discrete tax items. now we will open the call for your questions. operator, please go ahead.

[operator instructions]. our first question comes from the line of joe giordano with cowen. you may proceed with your question.
joe giordano -- cowen -- analyst
hi guys. good evening.
robert willett -- chief executive officer, president & executive director
hello, joe.
joe giordano -- cowen -- analyst
can you talk -- like given the supply chain, are there sales that youre just not able to get out the door because of that? or i know youre paying extra on the cost and expediting and things like that. but with sales, i mean, sales are great, but would they have been higher if not for these issues.
robert willett -- chief executive officer, president & executive director
so were like companies were struggling with the longer lead times and the issues we discussed in the call. but we dont think were losing any business, any material business that we can point to. but certainly, were seeing a large increase in backlog and delays in getting some orders out of the door. and we would size that as we would have been probably 5% larger. we would have grown 5% faster in the quarter if wed been in a normal supply chain environment.
joe giordano -- cowen -- analyst
thats very helpful on sizing that. -- in terms of the margin, if you were to normalize for supply chain, and this large customer -- are we back to like mid- to high 70s? is it like very isolated things that you can point to that are keeping it in the low to mid right now?
paul todgham -- senior vice president of finance & chief financial officer
yes. yes, joe, this is paul. thats right. yes, we broadened our range given some of the uncertainty in the supply market for next quarter, but there really are two major factors. the first being, i think, really concentrated in q3, the deployment of the strategic investment with a high potential logistics customer. and again, we started to recognize that in q2, but really, the bulk of that is in q3, and we dont expect much of that beyond that quarter. and then secondly would be the supply chain cost increases were seeing, freight component costs predicated on some commodity pricing and so on, and that may last a little longer than that. but overall, we stick to our common operating model. we do think kind of 75% operating margins on average is still a good benchmark for us.
joe giordano -- cowen -- analyst
perfect. and then just last one. we had some conversations with people in the pharma distribution market. and their sense is that its like extremely early in terms of like vision deployment and real like automation in that market. and it just seems like that could be a gigantic market thats kind of untapped. just curious as to how you think about that and where you play there and like how you think that market is relative to some of the others that you play like in terms of maturity?
paul todgham -- senior vice president of finance & chief financial officer
yes, its an interesting question. let me clarify. youre talking about medical or pharmaceuticals specifically. so in this one, were talking about like distribution of pills and medicines and things like that?
robert willett -- chief executive officer, president & executive director
yes. i mean, thats a fast-growing market for us, but it has similar dynamics that i see in many, many markets that we serve. obviously, these are high-value items that need to be tracked on an item level. so a lot of regulation coming. so our technology where we can help customers track and trace specific products, even specific pills, all the way through the supply chain, those have been things that have been valuable for some time and have been rolled out globally, and id say, increasing momentum. thats for sure. and in some ways, this links to common trends that we see everywhere, right? like item-level bar code reading, almost like license plates on cars with unique identifiers, where -- our vision is well positioned to do that better than anybody elses. so we see that. and then i think another trend that you might be observing in that industry that certainly plays a lot more broadly is just what one might call industry 4.0. its the capturing of images, the housing of them in the cloud, the using of data to improve and update supply chains in real time. these are things i think weve been seeing for a while, and theyre certainly gaining momentum and the potential is very large. but id almost might take the same statement i just made and apply it to consumer electronic components -- im sorry, electronic components, high-value items subject to counterfeit moving through the supply chain, wow, you particularly see that today, right? a lot of that stuff going on. so -- and again, the similar dynamics and the value of cognex vision to print and to reprinted bar codes that may be tiny reliably through the supply chain and help customers manage it more effectively. that applies -- and i could kind of go on to other industries to with the same kind of overview. so yes, but its not just pharma.
joe giordano -- cowen -- analyst

our next question comes from the line of jacob levinson with melius research. you may proceed with your question.
jacob levinson -- melius research -- analyst
good evening everyone
robert willett -- chief executive officer, president & executive director
good evening.
jacob levinson -- melius research -- analyst
i know you touched earlier in the call on some of the new products that you folks have been working on that are coming out saying it. i guess the question is in regards to deep learning, what has been the biggest advantage that, thats brought to the product portfolio. i mean, is it product cost? is it opening up new applications or just allowing higher throughput in your customer facilities. i mean, how would you characterize that?
robert willett -- chief executive officer, president & executive director
yes, deep learning is a technology that weve invested in a lot and are leading and its application is the more we develop it, the broader it is. but some of the initial applications where weve seen a lot more value, its opening up areas of inspection that we really just couldnt do before cost effectively or reliably, particularly looking at things like scratches or reading difficult-to-read numbers and letters in manufacturing, but -- perhaps were in noisy background, like scratches on an automotive part. doing things that really companies had relied on humans to do and not very effectively in the past. so certainly, weve seen very, very powerful applications for deep learning starting there. but in the example i was talking a little bit about today in our sort of smart line new technology. were able to differentiate the lines and different pieces of clear material that are being aligned in the manufacturer of a smartphone, for instance, or a screen where i think weve all gone through this experience where you bought a new smartphone and you put a cover, a scratch proof cover on it, that you kind of have to try to take down if you press down, trying to align the line of that -- the edge of that with the edge of the phone itself is an example of sort of the sort of thing that we are doing in our own lives, right?
lots of that is happening in manufacturing where different substrates are being aligned and there are different lines that have to be brought together. and a problem can be you can misconstrue one piece of material with another and line the wrong pieces up or not find the right lines to align together. so thats an example where deep learning is extremely powerful. and rules-based vision tools havent really been able to do that type of application. i could go on with many different applications like that where sometimes deep learning is just a far superior technology, and were seeing it get adopted more and more. but generally, were selling those tools and those capabilities for a premium in spaces that really havent been served by machine vision or served well in the past.
jacob levinson -- melius research -- analyst
thats super interesting. thank you. ill pass it on.

our next question comes from the line of josh pokrzywinski with morgan stanley. you may proceed with your question.
josh pokrzywinski -- morgan stanley -- analyst
hi, good evening guys.
robert willett -- chief executive officer, president & executive director
hi, josh
josh pokrzywinski -- morgan stanley -- analyst
can we just talk a little bit about the drivers of the sequential increase? i think, paul, you might have mentioned the kind of new pilot customer in logistics has a fairly chunky shipment in 3q and that sort of dissipates in 4q, i think that was in the context of gross margins. but how important is that in terms of the driver because you guys are coming off a pretty solid quarter. you said you can add a little bit of pull forward in electronics, if i heard you right, 3q pretty big step up. so just trying to figure out where that incremental bump comes from?
robert willett -- chief executive officer, president & executive director
yes. so from a q2 to q3 sequential drivers, the biggest would be consumer electronics. so even though we recognized more revenue in consumer electronics in the second quarter, we still have a step up. q3, its historically the largest quarter for consumer electronics. last year, it was dramatically higher given kind of delays with covid. this year looks a little more regular, but thats a nice step up. logistics is a modest contributor -- as again, were coming off, as you noted, some record quarters in a row, but it is -- we do expect to do a little more revenue in logistics in q3. say, those are the two major factors.
josh pokrzywinski -- morgan stanley -- analyst
got it and then i guess just sticking with logistics, i think some of the big integrators out there kind of talking about maybe a near-term plateau in activity just because the industry is so busy and theres been so much demand over the past 18 months that really the physical integration is sort of running in the bottlenecks. is that what you guys would expect where sort of the growth rates here over maybe the next several quarters are a little bit more modest just as a function of kind of getting the pig through the python on some of these bigger projects?
robert willett -- chief executive officer, president & executive director
i think what youre talking about is real in certain parts of the industry, i think, in big e-commerce deployments. thats perhaps in packaging, is there a parcel and package delivery, thats true. so i think we see -- and i imagine they see a big backlog that theyve got to digest the pig, if you like, in the python. but that still has a long way to run in terms of potential revenue coming through in the p&l. what we also see, i think, starting to accelerate that gives us a lot of enthusiasm or other smaller customers coming back to the table, particularly in brick-and-mortar activities and then also actually airport baggage handling starting to pick up. so id say we might see some of those big deployments kind of have to take a while to work through, but were seeing other markets coming in that have the potential to compensate as we go forward in time over the medium term.
josh pokrzywinski -- morgan stanley -- analyst
got it. good color. thanks, rob. thanks, paul.
operator
our next question comes from the line of rob mason with baird. you may proceed with your question.
rob mason -- baird -- analyst
good evening. i wanted to ask about the automotive growth that youre seeing right now. and maybe just to put it in a little bit better context. certainly, its -- 12 months ago, you probably would not have expected to be reporting an all-time record automotive quarter. but maybe just speak to the mix of that business today in terms of where its going around traditional platforms versus ev investment. and then also just maybe speak to the intermediate term along those same lines. i know its easy enough to suggest that ev investment may be growing faster as we go forward. but just what are the prospects today around some of the traditional platforms given that new model changes often drive demand for your products and there will be those. so if you could just speak to that and again, in the context of where we sit today with kind of this record quarter in automotive.
robert willett -- chief executive officer, president & executive director
sure. so automotive was our fastest-growing major end market in the second quarter. and youre absolutely right. i think when we came into the year, we didnt really expect to see this kind of recovery in automotive until the second half. but we did expect to see it coming back, perhaps not this strongly and this quickly. we experienced the fastest growth in asia, particularly in china where global activity for automotive is shifting due to the concentration of ev part suppliers. of course, ev battery manufacturing is certainly driving a lot of growth and then the execution of ev projects more generally and all the new kind of technology that requires, whether its inside the vehicle or outside, certainly our drivers. automotive revenue from the americas and europe is -- were also good growth drivers in the second quarter. and i would say chip shortages and the related plant shutdowns dont appear to be reducing demand for our business in automotive currently.
so the industry is becoming a lot more sophisticated with new players and a lot of new innovation coming into the market. so certainly, were seeing customers who havent been your traditional large customers in automotive for cognex, say, three or five years ago now, now being much larger users of our vision and our now technology. and then we also think the long-term potential for cognex in automotive includes applying deep learning for inspection and the increasing use of electronics in vehicles. so those are all driving it. i think also what youre getting at, ev certainly is becoming a larger and larger part, very significant growth. thats obviously the fastest-growing kind of general trend in the industry. but its still less than 50% of our automotive revenue, for sure, is ev related.
rob mason -- baird -- analyst
i see. okay. just one quick question around expenses that -- your operating expenses that you guided higher, it does sound like theres also -- between new products and some of the projects that youre working on, that helps elevate it. but would you -- typically, your expenses also go up a little bit in the fourth quarter from the third. -- given those dynamics that you have going on in the third, would you still expect that to be the case this year?
paul todgham -- senior vice president of finance & chief financial officer
i would say not sure yet. we like to stick to kind of one quarter ahead with our guidance. a couple of factors. we had a good year last year, and were having a great year this year, i would say, against kind of our own metrics. so -- and the second half of last year was stronger. so there is an element of more of our incentive compensation was backloaded last year than this year. so i think therell be some impact of that. but speculating on kind of sequential growth rates from q3 to q4, were not prepared to do at this time.
rob mason -- baird -- analyst
okay. thank you.

[operator instructions]. our next question comes from the line of andrew buscaglia with berenberg. you may proceed with your question.
andrew buscaglia -- berenberg -- analyst
good evening guys,
robert willett -- chief executive officer, president & executive director
hello.
andrew buscaglia -- berenberg -- analyst
regarding consumer electronics, you kind of reiterated that will be down this year, the sales. do you feel better or worse about that market than you did last quarter? or is it kind of the same?
robert willett -- chief executive officer, president & executive director
i think in general, the same, right? i think we recognize that this is a market that has cycles and trends and bigger years and smaller years. and i think its coming together much as we expected and as we told you last quarter.
andrew buscaglia -- berenberg -- analyst
okay. so no real change there. i was just checking on -- given component shortages and all that. and a question i had around -- so 1/4 of your sales or call it, you got consumer electronics down slightly. automotive is doing well. logistics is probably your best segment right now. but you still got 1/4 of your sales that when you kind of do the math on how the year is shaking out, must be doing pretty well, like a bunch of like kind of hodgepodge areas. whats -- can you talk more about like kind of like the non-- the business that you dont really talk a ton about, but that quarter of your market seems to be doing really well. and what is really driving that? or what areas are driving that?
robert willett -- chief executive officer, president & executive director
its really very, very broad-based. i mean, when we look across our end user markets, i mean so many of them are growing in excess of 30% and certainly, medical related. i mentioned them early in my opening remarks. is medical-related pharmaceutical, food and beverage, semiconductor, right? so just really just general broad-based investments. and i think were certainly seeing a very strong demand for machine vision on a broad basis. and i think it has to do with a lot of the trends weve been talking about for a long time. and in some ways, some of them are being accelerated by the big changes were seeing in the global economy, perhaps challenges customers seeing about labor, labor shortages and the need to get more productivity going and just, i think, a great environment for investment. so i think those mean that were seeing very broad-based demand. i mean, also, we talked about industry 4.0. and i think the interest that pretty much any serious manufacturer of discrete products has these days as they really want to use the digital data in their businesses to manage it more effectively and more securely. and i think certainly, vision is playing strongly into that.
andrew buscaglia -- berenberg -- analyst
yes. okay. and maybe lastly, the new product you talked about, are we already seeing that impact your revenues -- or im talking about the ai deep learning stuff. is that already influencing yourselves today? or is that -- can you -- is that kind of more in 22.
robert willett -- chief executive officer, president & executive director
theres a very -- its a very recent launch. its been a lot of work, probably a three-year journey to some of whats been a pretty major product release. so were already working with major customers on this deployment. but generally, the users of those products are going to be oems, more sophisticated customers. so i wouldnt expect to see major revenue contribution from that product probably until some quarters out. but then its a source of major competitive advantage for us. the product visionpro that we talked about, this is the tenth release. its a very major release. the product itself is 20 years old. so its the most established vision software platform in industrial manufacturing. its so many users are trained on it and know how to use it. and were giving them a lot of more powerful tools and a lot of better user capabilities. but generally, its a very sophisticated product, and it tends to be deployed over quite some period.
paul todgham -- senior vice president of finance & chief financial officer
yes. i think deep learning is accretive to our growth rate, both sequentially and on a year-on-year basis. and its probably more of the products we launched last year that are sort of the biggest contribution to that, right? the d900 and visionpro deep learning 1.0, were seeing meaningful uptake of those products. and now were excited to launch visionpro deep learning 2.0.
andrew buscaglia -- berenberg -- analyst

hi. thanks for taking my question. i just -- i wanted to kind of dig a little deeper on autos. from what i understood, cognex is, i say, stronger presence with the suppliers, tier one suppliers than the oems. im just wondering, with evs and the oems taking a bigger interest in battery manufacturing, are you seeing a change in your exposure within autos? and i just had one more after that.
robert willett -- chief executive officer, president & executive director
its a really interesting question. i observed the same things going on that youre describing. i think historically, and if we go back over the last few years, certainly about 2/3 of our automotive business was with component suppliers, tier one automotive and perhaps a third was with what you described as oems, the brands. the big brands we all get into and drive around in. and thats -- and certainly, were seeing a potential trend where thats going to be shaken up, and you can see some of the big brands are intending to have more of the component part of the business and the technology part inside their four walls and less outsourced to big tier one partners, right? that trend is going on, but then theres kind of a countervailing thing, which is you have strong technology players, particularly in the battery manufacturing area who really have outstanding technology that i think is not -- its going to be very difficult for those brands, oems to replicate.
so definitely, its kind of shaking up. and then as i would say, also, theres a lot of electronics going into cars. so i think were going to see some really interesting things happen in that space where traditionally, companies we thought of as consumer electronics brands, were probably going to see more and more of their types of technology being a bigger part of the bill of materials of automotive. so really exciting. the good news is, i think cognex is really well positioned with all of those groups and really well recognized. so i think well do pretty well as that industry shakes out. but in the end, more dollars to the brand owners versus the suppliers. the hard call, i would say.
jairam nathan -- daiwa capital markets -- analyst
okay. and another question was on growth outside of asia. you mentioned semiconductors in there. and i was wondering if -- are you seeing any -- is that driven by some of the semiconductor manufacturing kind of expanding out of china or diversifying out of china?
robert willett -- chief executive officer, president & executive director
well, a relatively small part of cognex overall business is now in zunyi, certainly less than 10% in recent years, around 5% or so. and so i think we have to put it in context. but we are seeing a very strong demand in those markets. and i think its really -- i consider, pretty tied to what were reading about the shortage of semiconductor capacity and the investment thats going on and the new -- as always, the new semiconductor technologies that are moving through and into production. so certainly, we are seeing very strong demand as those companies invest in that area.
jairam nathan -- daiwa capital markets -- analyst
and one last one, if i may. we are hearing about covid restrictions in malaysia hurting chip supplies. and i just wanted to -- so i think your subcontractors are based out of indonesia. but how do you kind of handicap that risk of a more extended lockdown in indonesia or something?
robert willett -- chief executive officer, president & executive director
so youre right. we have our largest subcontract partner who does a lot of the manufacturing of our products is based on a small island just off singapore in the country of indonesia. its a very well-managed free trade zone, which has significant connections to singapore. were seeing that situation with covid being very well managed in that area, both by that free trade zone and by our supplier, very high rates of vaccination and testing among employees and we havent experienced significant supply chain challenges, and were feeling very confident about the way its being managed. but of course, its like any supply chain at the moment. its at risk from changes that go on. but right now, good news to report on that.
paul todgham -- senior vice president of finance & chief financial officer
yes. and in terms of the availability of chips, obviously, thats the situation were monitoring very closely. were buying aggressively, right, to secure component parts. its part of whats reflected in our gross margin guidance and monitoring that situation. but overall, i feel like were continue to manage through this pretty well.
jairam nathan -- daiwa capital markets -- analyst

joe giordano -- cowen -- analyst
have a follow-up here. just a quick one. if i was to look at your entire pc vision deep learning portfolio now like d900 and the visionpro 1.0, how big is that as a percentage of sales roughly on an annual basis? and like what would be like a good -- what looks like an internal target for five years from now at a percentage of sales basis? like how big can that be for you guys if things go according to your runway?
robert willett -- chief executive officer, president & executive director
yes, its an interesting question. i dont want to be too specific about that from -- for competitive reasons. its still less than 10% of our overall business. and we aspire to growing at close to 100% per year. thats a stretch goal. were aggressive at cognex, but certainly, we really think it has that kind of potential. and were seeing very strong growth continuing last year, this year and the demand for it as we look out.

greetings, and welcome to the cognex third quarter 2021 earnings conference call. [operator instructions] as a reminder, this conference is being recorded. i would now like to turn this conference over to your host, ms. susan conway, senior director of investor relations. thank you, ma'am. you may begin.
susan conway -- senior director of investor relations
thank you. good evening, everyone. welcome to our third quarter earnings conference call. with us are rob willett, cognex' president and ceo; and paul todgham, chief financial officer. we'll start with prepared remarks, and then we'll open the call for questions. i'd like to remind you that our earnings release and quarterly report on form 10-q are available on the investor relations section of our website at www.cognex.com/investor. those contain detailed information about our financial results. during the call, you may use, we may use a non-gaap financial measure if we believe it is useful to investors, if we think it will help them better understand our results or business trends. you can see a reconciliation of certain items from gaap to non-gaap in exhibit two of the earnings release. any forward-looking statements we made in the earnings release or any that we may make during this call are based upon information that we believe to be true as of today. however, things can change, and actual results may differ materially from those projected or anticipated. for a detailed list of risk factors, you should refer to our sec filings, including our most recent form 10-k and the form 10-q we filed tonight for q3. now i'll turn the call over to rob.
robert j. willett -- chief executive officer, president and executive director
thanks, sue. hello, everyone. thank you for joining us. as shown in today's news release, cognex reported the highest quarterly revenue in our 40 year history for the third quarter of 2021. demand for cognex products is high worldwide as manufacturers implement machine vision to improve their throughput and the quality of their products. revenue grew by 13% over a high growth quarter in q3 of 2020. it was at the midpoint of the range we gave as guidance in august. logistics was again our largest end market in q3 and the biggest growth driver. we reported another record revenue quarter in logistics, beating the prior record set last quarter. demand continues to be strong, particularly in the e-commerce sector where cognex is widely recognized as the technology leader for machine vision. e-commerce and omnichannel retailers are investing in automation and cognex' industry-leading products to help them fulfill orders rapidly, reliably and cost effectively. furthermore, sectors that struggled in 2020, such as traditional brick and mortar retail are investing again in logistics automation to compete more effectively for e-commerce sales. among other industries we serve, revenue grew well in automotive, semi and medical related industries, particularly life sciences. an exception was consumer electronics, which was a substantial headwind in q3 as expected. you may recall that last year's third quarter included big incremental investments in new smartphone technologies and capacity for online learning and remote work demands that drove substantial growth for cognex.
this year, consumer electronics revenue is expected to be modestly lower overall and is more balanced between q2 and q3. turning next to gross margin. the challenging supply environment intensified in q3, like many companies were encountering record long component lead times, vendors struggling to supply parts, freight delays and capacity constraints, labor shortages and covid concerns. at cognex, customer first is our number one company value. we prioritize quality and delivery ahead of cost with an eye to delighting customers and maintaining our exceptional reputation. in q3 we were tenacious in living these values and added significant incremental costs in order to supply customers on time. while most of the supply chain impact related to higher costs for chips, expedited freight and designing out unavailable components, we also experienced longer delays on some higher-margin product sales that we now expect to recognize as revenue in q4 and beyond. furthermore, we provided a higher level of support on a large deployment by a customer in logistics that we discussed on our august call. we view this as the worthwhile cost of winning share with a customer that we believe has high potential for substantial future business with us. combined, these factors reduced our reported gross margin to 70% in q3. while many companies would applaud a 70% gross margin, we're dissatisfied given the high value software content in cognex products.
we view the lower margin business associated with the customer in logistics as a one quarter phenomenon. however, we anticipate the supply situation will continue to be a drag on our gross margin for the next several quarters. we've taken mitigating actions, including new product designs and pricing initiatives to offset incremental costs at the operating income level. supply challenges notwithstanding, there are macro trends underway that we believe will benefit cognex for years to come. these include the rise of e-commerce, the transition to electric vehicles and the shortening of supply chains. coupled with today's cost pressure and labor shortages, market conditions are favorable for automation and machine vision. the excitement was apparent last month at the vision show, a major machine vision trade show held in stuttgart, germany. cognex's booth was busy and well attended. the show had a more european-centric attendance this year, reflecting challenges of travel to and from the americas and asia. we heard very favorable feedback from many manufacturers and automation leaders about our deep learning products. they're enthusiastic about the power and performance that cognex' industry leading technology provides them as they seek to improve their productivity and product quality. we believe this underscores the value of our long-term development and investment in rd&e. cognex' industry leading vision and id technologies are key differentiators for us in solving our customers' most challenging applications as they implement automation. now i will hand the call over to paul for details of the quarter.
paul d. todgham -- senior vice president of finance and chief financial officer
thanks, rob, and hello, everyone. revenue for q3 was $285 million. as rob mentioned, that's a new record for quarterly revenue, surpassing the prior record set last quarter. as expected, the growth rate moderated in q3 from the 30 plus percent pace that we reported for the previous four quarters. we delivered revenue at the midpoint of our expected range in a difficult supply environment. it's worth noting that revenue was 55% above the pre-covid period of two years ago. two of our three largest end markets, logistics and automotive made strong contributions to year on year growth. other sectors also grew at a good clip, including life sciences and semi. as expected, consumer electronics was a substantial headwind in the quarter. even though q3 was our largest revenue-generating quarter for consumer electronics this year, it was down significantly from last year, primarily due to the timing of the industry's annual spend. reported gross margin for q3 was 70% and lower than both q3 of 2020 and the prior quarter. it was also at the low end of our guidance range. as rob mentioned, an unfavorable revenue mix and higher supply chain costs contributed to a gross margin that was below what we typically report. there were three parts to the unfavorable revenue mix. first, we made a strategic decision around a major deployment by a high potential customer in logistics that was completed in the quarter.
second, shipments of certain higher-margin products were delayed due to supply constraints. and third, we were able to fulfill logistics orders earlier than anticipated in the current supply environment. remember that logistics is an emerging market for machine vision. our gross margin in that sector is improving but is currently lower than our business overall as the market develops. regarding supply, we are incurring higher costs to secure components and expedite customer orders. we anticipated some of that in our guidance. however, the supply situation intensified more than expected as we move through the quarter and continues to be a headwind for us. operating expenses increased by 3% on a sequential basis, which is at the low end of our guidance range. looking year on year, operating expenses increased by 18% over q3 of 2020, which was a particularly low quarter due to our restructuring actions the previous quarter. higher costs included incremental investments in sales and engineering headcount and variable incentive compensation. we also experienced an unfavorable impact from currency exchange rate fluctuations. operating margin was a healthy 31% in q3 of 2021, even so, it compares unfavorably with an exceptional 38% in q3 of 2020 and 34% in the prior quarter due to this quarter's lower gross margin and higher operating expenses. regarding the tax provision, we recorded substantial discrete tax items in all periods that make comparisons difficult. in q3 of 2021, discrete items combined for a net benefit of $6 million. the effective tax rate, excluding discrete tax items, was 18% in both q2 and q3 of 2021 and in q3 of 2020. reported earnings were $0.44 per share in q3 compared with $0.49 in q3 of 2020 and $0.43 in q2 of 2021.
on a non-gaap basis, earnings were $0.40 per share in q3 compared with $0.47 in q3 of 2020 and $0.43 in q2 of 2021. that's excluding discrete tax items and restructuring and other charges that we removed for comparison's sake. looking at the change in revenue for q3 from a geographic perspective. revenue from the americas increased by over 30% year on year and delivered the largest contribution in absolute dollars due to growth in logistics. in europe, revenue increased by 8% and that includes a one percentage point contribution from currency exchange rates. strong growth in logistics, automotive, consumer products and other industries in europe's broad factory automation market, was largely offset by a decline in revenue from consumer electronics. revenue from asia increased by 1% year on year. continued growth in automotive, logistics, semi and the broader market, plus a five percentage point contribution from currency exchange rates was offset by lower revenue from consumer electronics. turning to the balance sheet. cognex continues to have a strong cash position with $985 million in cash and investments and no debt. we spent $27 million to repurchase cognex stock in q3, and a total of $48 million year to date. we plan to continue to buy back stock in q4 at a regular pace, while maintaining flexibility to be more opportunistic. as we announced tonight, our board of directors has increased the quarterly cash dividend by 8% to $0.065 per share. we believe this demonstrates their continued confidence in cognex' financial strength and long-term growth prospects. the dividend is payable on december three to all shareholders of record on november 19. also noteworthy on the balance sheet is the increase in our inventory balance this year. we are bringing in components to support customer orders and replenish some strategic inventory and we're doing so at higher costs. now i'll turn the call back over to rob.
robert j. willett -- chief executive officer, president and executive director
thank you, paul. moving next to guidance. we expect revenue for the fourth quarter will be between $210 million and $230 million. at the midpoint, we expect revenue will be relatively flat year on year. we expect consumer electronics and logistics will be quieter in this year's final quarter. last year in q4, we reported growth exceeding 30% year on year for cognex overall due to higher spending by customers in those end markets. in consumer electronics, we expect annual revenue in 2021 will be modestly lower overall, and we believe that will play out in q4 as well. in logistics, we expect a low growth quarter primarily because customers are digesting large deployments of cognex products as they turn their attention to fulfilling orders for the upcoming holiday season. another factor we considered in our revenue guidance was the supply environment. we believe the situation will continue to be challenging and constrain revenue growth in q4. we expect to exit the year with a substantial backlog. looking at gross margin, we believe the higher supply chain costs we're incurring for components and freight will continue to flow into cost of goods sold. as a result, we believe gross margin in q4 will be in the low 70% range. i want to point out that we've not changed our long term gross margin target from the mid-70% range. in the near term, we expect our pricing actions to roughly offset the gross margin dilution at the operating income level. longer term, we expect our gross margin will return to our mid 70% target range as the higher cost to expedite component deliveries recedes. we expect operating expenses will increase by mid single digits on a sequential basis. we expect higher spending around various growth initiatives within cognex. this includes adding resources in engineering and sales, furthering new product development and increasing sales and marketing activities. lastly, we expect the effective tax rate will be 18%, excluding discrete tax items. now we will open the call for questions. operator, please go ahead.

[operator instructions] our first question comes from the line of josh pokrzywinski with morgan stanley.
josh pokrzywinski -- morgan stanley -- analyst
rob, paul and sue. just a question on logistics. i guess how large was this pull forward in 3q? and how are you seeing kind of that market evolve maybe more downstream? obviously, a lot of stuff has to come together for these implementations? like are there bottlenecks that are beyond the scope of cognex projects that are holding up that supply chain as well?
robert j. willett -- chief executive officer, president and executive director
well, q3 was our largest revenue quarter ever in logistics, and it did benefit from some customers wanting product from us sooner, right? so i'm not sure that we want to cite that specifically, i'll ask paul in a moment. but we did benefit from some of that. to answer your question, certainly, deployment in logistics does depend on integrators and their readiness to implement more complicated systems and integrations downstream from us. so that can dictate some of the timing on the implementation of systems. broadly, i think our supply has been pretty good, very good in that industry. so i don't consider that being much of a drag on what we wanted to do. it's been more downstream from us in terms of customers willingness to receive products and integrate his readiness to integrate it. and there certainly have been delays, i would say, downstream from us that has perhaps slowed some of the implementation for our customers.
paul d. todgham -- senior vice president of finance and chief financial officer
and in terms of the revenue outlook, josh, in q2, i think we quoted that we believe supply constraints held us up by about 5% in revenue growth in the quarter. and we'd assumed roughly a similar drag in q3, kind of 5% of orders that were pushed out that will be harder to full. it ended up being a little larger than that as certain supply situations intensified and the logistics but we were able to partially offset that by more favorable supply conditions in logistics. so again, it was small, it was sort of a moderate impact, but it was a modest benefit against other decreases in ability to supply customers as quickly as we expected.
josh pokrzywinski -- morgan stanley -- analyst
got it. that's super helpful color. and then we've just heard from some of your distributors that the model there is maybe a bit more direct anything from like a corporate level that you guys are doing differently with respect to your distributors and kind of direct sales force as you guys have kind of expanded the business and found some of these new markets?
robert j. willett -- chief executive officer, president and executive director
no, i don't think there's anything radical to communicate there. i would say about 70% of our business currently is moving through direct sales overall. and certainly, every year, we evaluate our distributors, and we're looking for those who can provide more value added and are investing in that business. so it's a continual process of evaluating those relationships going forward. but i don't think there's a major change. we have some great partners who supply products in locations and into industries that they serve very, very well, and they're a very important part of our model.
operator
our next question comes from the line of jacob levinson with melius research.
jacob levinson -- melius research -- analyst
if we could just spend a second on the consumer electronics side. i know there's usually some volatility in that market depending on your customers' investment cycles, but at the risk of getting ahead of ourselves here. is that a market that gets better going into 2022? or do you have any visibility in what's coming down the pipeline there over the next couple of quarters?
robert j. willett -- chief executive officer, president and executive director
yes, i'll add some color. we don't really give guidance for '22 and often what happens is we have a clearer view of how the electronics market is shaping up, normally around our april conference call. so that in may, that's when we would sort of share more of the view for the year. i would say this, it's been a lackluster year for consumer electronics after growing more than 30% in 2020. unlike last year, customers, our customers are focused on upgrading existing lines and not making big incremental investments for new smartphone technologies and new capacity for online learning and remote work demands, this is a market that can cycle. and so often in the past, after lower years, we have more higher periods of investment. it's too soon to make that call currently. but manufacturers turn to us to help them bring new products to market and to realize productivity and quality gains. so example of things that we would do for them, help them as they miniaturize products and how they bring new technologies that are challenging to assemble such as wireless charging stations, micro led displays, smart watches, virtual and augmented reality headsets. as they look to eliminate cosmetic defects and as they implement automation in a world of labor shortages and less desirable jobs and health concerns around the world. and i see demand for those continuing to be very strong for a long period. it's more of a matter of how they play out in investment cycles. this year with the down cycle after a pretty good upcycle last year.
jacob levinson -- melius research -- analyst
okay. that's helpful. and just switching gears quickly to the auto side of things. it feels like every day, we get a new mega project around electric vehicles and battery manufacturing. on the battery side, i mean, is that a market where you see the same kind of upside potential in terms of applying machine vision as you would get in traditional combustion platforms or other big verticals for you guys like consumer electronics for that matter in terms of the content?
robert j. willett -- chief executive officer, president and executive director
so certainly, ev battery manufacturing is a really attractive and high potential market for cognex. we see, we continue to see automakers crystallize investment plans toward battery manufacturing and retrofitting of existing assembly capacity toward evs. we're having a very strong year in automotive and certainly the ev part of it and the battery part of it is a very major contributor toward that. and we, longer term, for cognex, we see this continuing, and we see more and more applications for our world-leading deep earnings for inspection and increasing the use of electronics in automobiles, definitely driving further revenue for us. so after what was really a couple of difficult years for us in automotive in '18 and '19. we're really starting to see a very healthy this year and a lot of optimism, i think, about what we're going to be able to do for those customers, particularly around ev in the medium to long term.
operator
our next question comes from the line of joe ritchie with goldman sachs.
joe ritchie -- goldman sachs -- analyst
so i think my first question really just wanted to understand the pricing dynamics and the gross margin dynamics over the next several quarters. so clearly, it sounds like you're not really putting through any surcharging and at this juncture, feeling it in the margins for all the increased logistics costs. is there may be potentially going to be like a change of philosophy going forward given what you're seeing from a freight perspective? and then secondly, on gross margins over the next several quarters, will it be kind of in the low 70s for the next few quarters because of the decreased inflationary costs?
robert j. willett -- chief executive officer, president and executive director
yes, let me, i'll kick it off. it's rob, and then i'll invite paul to comment. so we've taken pricing actions that we implemented at the, in the latter part of last quarter, which we think have been pretty well received in the marketplace. and we're pleased with how we've implemented them. and we think on a dollar level, it's going to offset the gross margin dilution we're seeing from supply chain costs that are hitting us. we think those supply chain costs are temporary. they may go on for a number of quarters. but certainly, some of the actions we've had to take around expediting freight or paying for paying very high prices in, from brokers and in the gray market to make sure we can supply on time. we don't think those are going to be things that are going to continue for many quarters, but certainly for a few. so that's kind of how we're seeing it overall. i'll invite paul to comment more on some other surcharges and situations that we're seeing.
paul d. todgham -- senior vice president of finance and chief financial officer
sure. yes. and joe, i think to understand our gross margin outlook, at least for q4, it helps to understand q3 and we can speak in comparison and then we won't go into any detail about next year, except for just to say that we think it will be challenging through the first half of next year. so in q3 we think about our business as having a typically kind of mid-70s, 75% gross margin, and there were really three factors in q3 that brought us down to the 70%. and they were roughly equal or keep it simple. so the first was helping this customer in logistics deploy a large installation of our technology. so that's both kind of idiosyncratic to cognex and also specific to q3, and that was expected. it was built, it was reflected in our guidance and will not repeat. second, we are incurring higher costs, particularly for components and freight to ensure customer deliveries, and that was mostly expected in our guidance, too. and then third, supply constraints did disproportionately affect sales of our higher margin products in the quarter, which led to a higher percent of sales in logistics broadly. so that resulted in a less favorable revenue mix. and that was largely unexpected. so that's why we were on the lower end of our guidance for q3. if we then turn to q4 and you think about those three factors, the first factor goes away. the second factor intensifies, and the third factor largely goes away as well. so it really is that second factor getting a little bigger. so that led us to give guidance at the low 70% range, but we do expect we'll do better than we delivered this quarter. in terms of the pricing, as rob said, we're looking to offset these incremental costs, most of which we believe are temporary at the operating income level. so naturally, that's going to have somewhat of a dilutive impact on price, on gross margin in the near term. you can build a simple model there. but essentially, you offset about one of three of your gross margin impact, but you offset 100% at the operating income dollar level.
joe ritchie -- goldman sachs -- analyst
got it. that's super helpful. and then maybe just one follow-on. i notice you have some reasonable visibility in a given year on your electronics growth rate for a year, typically around the march, april time frame. i guess just given the supply chain issues that, that specific end market is experiencing. i don't know, how do you think about 2022? is it in your conversations with your customers, do you think you're going to have reasonable visibility by then? or is it too early to tell at this point?
robert j. willett -- chief executive officer, president and executive director
i would expect we'll have a good sense of how things are shaping up by the time we talk with you in early may. yes, i think we're really part of their implementation plans. we have very long and deep relationships with many of the major players in that industry, and we'll be able to give you, i think, i expect visibility at that point.
operator
our next question comes from the line of joe giordano with cowen & co.
joe giordano -- cowen & co -- analyst
this is robert in for joe. yes, i just wanted to know if you could quantify how much revenue wasn't recognized in the quarter due to some of the supply component charges on those high margin products. that would be helpful.
paul d. todgham -- senior vice president of finance and chief financial officer
yes. yes. i mean, again, we went in thinking we might have about a 5% constraint to growth on the quarter. and in the end, we may be faced about $10 million more in incremental revenue that was pushed to subsequent quarters. so combined, kind of we're in that general range, if you look at our base, it's kind of a little about $20 million or so.
analyst
okay. that's helpful. and then i know you said backlog is elevated going into end of the year. was there any change in placing orders from customers like toward the end of the quarter as these supply chain issues kind of increased?
robert j. willett -- chief executive officer, president and executive director
yes. we've certainly seen a dynamic. i wouldn't say it's around the end of the quarter. we've seen a dynamic where customers are giving us orders with longer lead times. because i think they're concerned about supply generally and they're trying to plan their own implementations with some more reliability. so that's a dynamic i see that's been going on, i'd say, for certainly more than a quarter now, more than three months in terms of what we see. it's helping actually helping give us visibility so we can supply them reliably. but that was not an end of the quarter phenomenon.
analyst
okay. no, that's helpful. and then just one more, if i may. just, rob, just on the deep learning step that you mentioned, just is that still on track to be around your aspirational goal of 100% growth this year? and how is that kind of looking?
robert j. willett -- chief executive officer, president and executive director
i don't think we're going to give specific forecast by product area. i would say we're very pleased with that technology and how it's performing, and we're seeing extraordinary and strong growth in that area. the only areas where it may not be growing as quickly as we would aspire to would be in consumer electronics where deployment of it is somewhat correlated to the slightly down year we're seeing in that industry. but that's a long term play for us, and we're very pleased with the progress we're making with the technology.
operator
[operator instructions] our next question comes from the line of andrew buscaglia with berenberg capital markets.
andrew buscaglia -- berenberg capital markets -- analyst
so automotive backorder perked up the first time in a while, was that your fastest growing segment again? and then you mentioned life sciences picking up. what exactly drove that?
robert j. willett -- chief executive officer, president and executive director
yes. so i think we're seeing a strong year for automotive. and it certainly was another strong quarter. i think i mentioned earlier that logistics really is our fastest growing market, certainly. and i think i'm right in saying that it was our fastest growing market last quarter also. but we've seen a really nice strong rebound in automotive this year, which is very pleasing.
paul d. todgham -- senior vice president of finance and chief financial officer
yes. automotive was accretive to our growth rate in the quarter but didn't compare with the growth rate we had in logistics and the dollar contribution of logistics.
robert j. willett -- chief executive officer, president and executive director
and then turning to your question about life sciences. life sciences is a market we've been kind of working away hard for a very long period, and it's sort of it's an oem market where one is specified into life science oem machine builders, big names in the medical and life science world. and we measure our success internally by design wins, and that's the number of machines that we get specified into. and then we've been having really a lot of success in design wins over a number of years, approximately 20 design wins per year. and what we're seeing, as i think we expected is those design wins are turning into revenue and orders and bookings, sometimes three, four years after we've been selected to supply those customers and the rollout of their products. and their products are machines that are used in hospitals and medical facilities to analyze medical samples often blood for instance. and so what we're seeing is that those products are entering the market and are starting to purchase from us. and what i really like about that business. i like many things about that business. but what i really like is the consistency and long-term prospects for those orders. we expect those machines to have about a seven to 11 year life, and we expect to see pretty reliable business from them, and it's coming in nicely. it's outgrowing cognex overall, and i think it will provide a nice repeating, consistent additional revenue stream for us over a very long period where we continue to win design wins.
andrew buscaglia -- berenberg capital markets -- analyst
okay. that's helpful. and you mentioned you were at the vision show recently. i'm wondering what some of the commentary from customers around maybe some of the newer setting things you're working on with ai deep learning? and then maybe any commentary or any update around plans for kind of getting into more subscription-based services that i think you guys alluded to back in your last analyst day?
robert j. willett -- chief executive officer, president and executive director
yes. so there's, it's normally a once every two year show in stuttgart, germany called the vision show, it's kind of industries get together, i would say where it's a lot of technology companies coming as well. and so it's a great venue in which to see the industry. and i was pretty pleased with what i saw there in terms of how our plans are resonating with customers and with the other technology i see at other companies in the industry. we heard a lot about our deep learning capabilities. we meet with some of the most sophisticated customers and is very engineering focused, who comes to that meeting. and i certainly heard a lot about the power of our tools, how they're getting easier to implement and how they fit into overall product road maps for big automotive companies, tier one automotive suppliers, electronics companies, particularly, but a whole range of machine builders and how they are seeing those technologies roll out in their road maps. and it was pleasing to hear them say that they see this as an area where they plan to invest and where they see us as the strong technology leader in the industry. so there's certainly that. and then you had a second part to your question. recurring revenue. yes. so, we do see, we do have a small amount of recurring revenue, particularly around software licensing and our business for vision software and for deep learning capabilities. and we're seeing that kind of come into the business, but it's not a material part of our business. it's going to be a long road, i think, for us to generate substantial recurring revenue, but it is a focus for us. it is designed to our product road maps and we are getting it, i think, as we expected.
paul d. todgham -- senior vice president of finance and chief financial officer
we also launched our edge intelligence product, which has also has a recurring revenue component to it. and then actually tied back to your life sciences question, andrew, even though life sciences from a revenue recognition point of view, is not strictly speaking, subscription or recurring revenue. there's a predictability to it that i think does actually sort of help us and drive that recurring revenue, again, even if the accounting treatment is a little different.

operator
greetings, and welcome to the cognex third quarter 2022 earnings conference call. at this time, all participants are on a listen-only mode. a question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [operator instructions] as a reminder, this conference is being recorded.
it is now my pleasure to introduce your host, ms. susan conway, senior director of investor relations. thank you. please go ahead.
susan conway -- senior director of investor relations
thank you. good evening, everyone. welcome to our third quarter earnings conference call for 2022. leading today's call are rob willett, cognex's president and ceo; and paul todgham, our chief financial officer.
i'd like to remind you that our earnings release and quarterly report on form 10-q are available in the investor relations section of our website at www.cognex.com/investor. both contain detailed information about our financial results. during the call, we may use a non-gaap financial measure, we believe it is useful to investors or if we think it will help them better understand our results or business trends. you can see a reconciliation of certain items from gaap to non-gaap in exhibit 2 of the earnings release.
any forward-looking statements we made in the earnings release or any that we may make during this call are based upon information we believe to be true as of today. however, things can change, and actual results may differ materially from those projected or anticipated. for a detailed list of risk factors, you should refer to our sec filings, including our most recent form 10-k and our form 10-q filed tonight for q3. now i'll turn the call over to rob. 
rob willett -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, sue. hello, everyone. thank you for joining us. when we spoke with you in august, we were in the middle of managing two challenges in our business: one, concerned june fire at our primary contract manufacturer and the other related to overcapacity at a few of our large logistics customers.
let me start by giving you an update on how we have been addressing both of those challenges. turning first to the fire. we believe that business disruption is now behind us. the leadership team and i appreciate the hard work and collaboration of cognoids and our suppliers in the aftermath of the fire.
they demonstrated the best of our culture during a difficult time. together, they helped replenish the significant component inventory positions that were destroyed in the fire and fulfill customer demand more quickly than we anticipated. these efforts led to strong shipments at quarter end, which allowed us to reduce the negative impact of the fire on q3 revenue to roughly $40 million, or about half of what we estimated in our original guidance. this also resulted in exceeding the updated guidance we published in september.
moving next to logistics. as we reported in august, our largest customer and other e-commerce technology leaders are taking a post-pandemic timeout to absorb excess capacity. this follows two years of heavy investment through q3 of 2021, which you may recall was a record-setting quarter for both our logistics revenue and cognex overall. despite slower current spending by a few customers, we believe our long-term prospects and logistics are as exciting as they have ever been.
there are several reasons for our confidence. first, cognex customers include many e-commerce and omnichannel retailers that are early in their adoption of machine vision. second, we believe more growth collectively will come from europe and asia than the americas. third, there are other market adjacencies and logistics such as pashto and post, where we have a small presence today and superior solutions that position us well to grow.
and lastly, we see many applications beyond barcode reading where our machine vision technology is increasingly being used to solve new problems in logistics fulfillment. we believe that logistics will continue to be an important growth driver for us. it has emerged as the largest, and we expect it will remain the fastest-growing sector in our served market. we estimate the logistics segment to be a $2 billion market growing by 20% long term.
our differentiated technology and the opportunities we see in logistics gives us confidence we can continue to be a share gainer and grow this part of our revenue by 30% over the long term. next, let me turn to a broader view of our served market and our expectations for longer-term growth. the excitement we have about our future was apparent at our analyst day event in september. we see tremendous value in bringing the investment community to our headquarters in natick.
they had an opportunity to meet in person with cognoids, experience our culture firsthand, and see live demos of our products. we received a lot of great feedback from the event. at analyst day, we introduced an updated view of our served market. the new estimate is $6.5 billion, up 55% from our previous estimate of $4.2 billion that we shared with you in 2019.
we believe the market will grow by 13% over the medium to long term. as a reminder, we calculate our served market estimate ourselves because there is no reliable third-party source. our served market reflects a relatively narrow definition of how big our business could be if we won every dollar of opportunity in the markets where we are focused. also, at analyst day, we updated our long-term target for cognex revenue growth to 15% on a compound annual basis.
we expect to continue to outperform market growth, thanks to our strong product pipeline, our focus on high-growth end markets and the strength of our reputation with leading manufacturers. at this point in the year, i spent a lot of time with our sales force, conducting in-depth reviews of our customers by geographic region. i'm excited about the new products and solutions we are introducing. they will help us scale our business more quickly and will enable a wider and less technical profile of customer to use our sophisticated and powerful technology.
our new modular vision tunnels are an example of this. these pre-configured standard solutions are part of our plan to develop the opportunity for cognex machine vision and logistics. they make it easier and faster for customers to solve complex vision problems using cognex technologies, products, and our edge intelligence data analytics software platform in high-speed, high-throughput operations. another example is the dataman 8700 lx, the latest addition to our highly successful next-generation series of industrial handheld readers.
lx stands for extreme label reading and is highly accurate in reading the most challenging label-based codes in a fraction of a second 150 milliseconds. the 8700 lx outperforms other handheld products available today and is being embraced by leaders in cloud computing and high-performance ev battery manufacturing, among other segments. lastly, we were pleased to publish our first comprehensive sustainability report during the quarter. we have a great story to communicate.
cognex machine vision and deep learning technology plays an important role in making manufacturing more efficient and reducing its environmental impact. this report was developed by a cross-functional team of cognoids. it demonstrates the strong progress we are making on our esg journey. i'll stop here for now.
paul, the microphone is yours for details of the quarter.
paul todgham -- chief financial officer
great. thanks, rob, and hello, everyone. revenue was $210 million in q3. that level represents a decline of roughly 25% from both last year's record-setting performance and q2 of 2022.
it was better than we expected when we gave our updated q3 guidance, but still lower than we would have anticipated earlier in the year. the business disruption from the fire caused revenue from most end markets to decline in q3 year on year and all to decline on a sequential basis. the quarter was also impacted by lower revenue from large customer projects in logistics. and with approximately two-thirds of our revenue coming from outside of the united states, currency exchange rates had a negative impact, leading to a 5 percentage point drag on revenue growth in the quarter.
looking at the change in revenue for q3 from a geographic perspective. each primary region was also negatively impacted by business disruption from the fire. asia decreased mid-single digits, excluding a 6 percentage point negative impact from currency exchange rates. large order revenue from consumer electronics made a positive contribution in the quarter.
revenue from europe decreased low teens, excluding a 12 percentage point reduction from currency exchange rates. lower revenue from logistics and declining business confidence impacted revenue across the region. in the americas, revenue decreased by more than 40% year on year due to the slowing of large investments by a small number of customers in logistics. gross margin was 73% in q3 compared to 70% in q3 of 2021 and 72% in the prior quarter.
gross margin was better than our guidance due to leverage on our fixed costs given the higher-than-expected revenue level, while partially offset by unfavorable fx. the 3 percentage point increase year on year is due to a more favorable revenue mix this quarter. the improvement in gross margin on a sequential basis is due to lower broker premiums for stairs components. in regards to broker buys, the premiums we've been paying are trending down.
however, we expect the negative impact on gross margin will pick up again in q4. while the supply environment is improving, it will take a few quarters to higher price components that are in inventory to work their way through our p&l. operating expenses in q3 included a noncash charge of $3 million related to the fire, primarily for idle production capacity given temporarily lower business levels. excluding that charge, the combined total of rd&e and sg&a line by 2% year on year and 4% on a sequential basis, which was slightly favorable to our guidance.
lower incentive compensation and the favorable impact of currency exchange rates more than offset the incremental investments we've been making in sales and engineering headcount and other related costs. operating margin was 19% in q3 of 2022 compared with 31% in q3 of 2021 and 24% in the prior quarter on a gaap basis. excluding the fire loss, operating margin was 20%, 31% and 30%, respectively. the leverage we have in our income statement worked against us in q3 despite the benefit provided by a better gross margin and lower operating costs.
the effective tax rate in q3 was 16%, excluding discrete tax items as expected. reported earnings were $0.19 per share in q3 compared with $0.44 in q3 of 2021 and $0.34 in q2 of 2022. on a non-gaap basis, earnings were $0.21, $0.40 and $0.41 per share, respectively, excluding discrete tax items and the fire loss. turning to the balance sheet.
cognex continues to have a strong cash position with $818 million in cash and investments and no debt. proceeds of $27.6 million from insurance claims related to the fire were received in october and after the balance sheet date. as we announced tonight, our board of directors has increased the quarterly cash dividend by 8% to $0.07 per share. we believe this demonstrates their continued confidence in cognex's financial strength and long-term growth prospects.
before i turn the call back to rob, i'd like to welcome nathan mccurren as cognex's new head of investor relations. nathan joined us last week from lime, where he served as head of investor relations and treasury, and brings to cognex prior experience across ir and other finance functions at iron mountain, goldman sachs, and general mills. he joins sue conway, who many of you know. sue established our ir program and developed it over the past 26 years.
we're excited for nathan to now lead the investor relations team and enhance our engagement with the investment community. now i'll hand the microphone back to rob.
rob willett -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, paul. let's talk now about our guidance for q4. we expect revenues for q4 will be between $235 million and $255 million. that range represents a strong rebound from an artificially low level in q3 due to a return to more normal production lead times.
it also includes a remaining $20 million catch-up on customer deliveries following the fire. at the midpoint, we expect revenue will be roughly flat on a year-on-year basis. we expect to continue to experience lower large project activity in logistics. reflected in this guidance is a 10 percentage point headwind to year-over-year growth from the strong u.s.
dollar. i want to clarify that this is a 10 percentage points, not basis points as there was a typo in the press release. we believe gross margin in q4 will be in the low 70% range. the supply environment is improving, and that's leading to lower broker buy activity.
however, the impact of what we've already purchased and is in inventory will take a few quarters to flow through our income statement. we expect the combined total of rd&e and sg&a will increase by low single digits on a sequential basis due to the timing of incentive compensation. the effective tax rate in q4 is expected to be 16% excluding discrete tax items. now, we'll open the call up for questions.
operator, we're ready to go ahead with questions.
",":
operator
thank you. the floor is now open for questions. [operator instructions] the first question today is coming from joe giordano of cowen. please go ahead.
joe giordano -- cowen and company -- analyst
hey, guys. good afternoon.
rob willett -- president and chief executive officer
hi, joe.
joe giordano -- cowen and company -- analyst
hey,i just wanted to get a sense on the fourth quarter like how much of this is underlying demand and how much is kind of backlog delivery? i know you called out $20 million specifically is like a catch-up. but how much is just stuff that you've been booked over the year? and how much do you feel like is truly new business and reflective of what conditions on the ground are?
rob willett -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. let me kind of speak to that more generally for everyone on the call. so, our revenue guidance in q4 is roughly flat year on year. our expectation for the quarter, it's driven primarily by four things, right? there are two headwinds and two tailwinds.
and joe, i think you're talking about one of the tailwinds that we have. so first of all, headwinds, a few large customers and logistics are currently spending less on new fulfillment centers than a year ago. and we also expect a roughly 10 percentage point negative impact from currency rates in the quarter. the tailwinds, things that are helping us, expected growth from the broader factory automation market and then there's about $20 million of revenue shifted from q3 resulting from a catch-up on customer deliveries following the fire.
so, i think that $20 million gets a little to your question, joe. business activity in the broader factory automation market is holding up, although it's less robust than it was a year ago, particularly in asia, and we're not expecting a big budget flush this year overall. so, it's generally kind of how i would think about the fourth quarter.
joe giordano -- cowen and company -- analyst
just given where we are in the year in november, i'm guessing you have a pretty good idea of where your big markets, your critical markets are going to come in. so maybe if you can take us through logistics, consumer electronics, where there's been a lot of negative headlines in automotive, maybe as to what growth looks like for 2022 full year for those markets.
rob willett -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. yeah, yeah. yeah, i mean, i'll start out and encourage paul to say a little more. generally, we don't give sort of that full year position until after the year is over.
i think what we've already said is that we're expecting a growth in our electronics market. i think we've said around in double digits, low double digits. obviously, we're expecting significant contraction in our logistics business, right? automotive overall, i think probably moderate performance in that market and similar in other markets overall. so that's kind of -- and then obviously, we've got headwind from currency, which is pretty significant at this point.
paul, would you like to give any more color?
paul todgham -- chief financial officer
no, i mean, i think that's right. after q3, we're now down on logistics year on year. so, we know -- we said we'd be down for the year. we're now there.
and with q3 going to be the most down as we've sort of communicated last quarter. consumer electronics is playing out really as we expected and communicated in our last earnings call. and again, automotive gets a little bit clouded by the fire impact and currency and so on. but we're generally pleased by what we're seeing in ev and there's tentativeness elsewhere.
the broader market in europe, for instance, there are some tentativeness in automotive. 
joe giordano -- cowen and company -- analyst
and just last for me. is there any way to kind of like -- i know you talked about the gross margin in the quarter? how much benefit in the quarter are you getting from less like large customer deliveries of mixed negative logistics stuff versus like the benefit that you got from less broker? i'm trying to just understand like what that looks like. how much up versus how much down and then where net out? you know what i mean?
paul todgham -- chief financial officer
sure. yeah. so you'll recall, a year ago was our low point for gross margin. we reported a 69% gross margin.
and at the time, we were calling out three factors. one was broker buys. one was a strategic project in the logistics space that was particularly low margin, it was sort of a co-investment in something that would lead to productized solutions like the machine vision tunnels that we -- the modular vision tunnels that rob spoke to today. and the third was some supply chain issues that were particularly impacting some of our highest margin vision products.
so those are the three factors that kind of jointly brought us from our typical mid-70s to the 69% or 70% we did. this quarter, the broker buy impact was pretty comparable year on year, i would say. and again, that's a little bit artificially low just by virtue of what we sold in this quarter, and it's going to be a little higher next quarter, which is why we brought our guidance down slightly versus what we've communicated. so that's the impact.
fx was about a 120 basis point negative impact to gross margin for the quarter. and then our pricing actions are offsetting our component cost inflation, which really is our strategy. so those are the real drivers. revenue mix was favorable this quarter versus a year ago.
it's favorable within the quarter -- within the year in q3, just by virtue of a little lower logistics mix this quarter, and we'll have a little more of that next quarter.
joe giordano -- cowen and company -- analyst
thanks, guys.
operator
thank you. the next question is coming from joe ritchie of goldman sachs. please go ahead.
joe ritchie -- goldman sachs -- analyst
thanks. good afternoon, guys.
rob willett -- president and chief executive officer
hi, joe.
joe ritchie -- goldman sachs -- analyst
i know that you guys don't give guidance for a full year. but i'm hoping that you maybe can kind of contextualize like how to think about logistics in 2023. i know that your long-term growth rate is you expect to grow 30%. but i'm trying to just get an understanding of your views on the market versus your ability to potentially outgrow the market with, as you mentioned earlier, new use cases and applications for your technology.
rob willett -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. i think to kind of contextualize that, we have significant and growing base of regular logistics customers, right? and they're growing, and they're growing very strongly outside the u.s. and that -- and we expect that to continue, right? and we're expecting continued strength in that to be one of the fastest-growing parts of our business. it's less than half of our logistics business, but it's -- i mean last year, it was.
and -- but the growth dynamic and the broadening of those customers and the geographic broadening is really a great thing for us. then we have this other dynamic that we're speaking to a lot, which are large technology e-commerce players, and there are a few of those, right? and one, i think we focus on a lot of your questions often do, but there are a few of those customers, and they really are going through a similar phenomenon where they're taking this kind of time out from investing, having really overbuilt capacity and seeing some more challenging environments post-pandemic, right? so, i think the big challenge and one that's hard to call is when will that investment cycle turn, and those companies start investing more heavily again. i don't think it's in the first half of next year. i feel confident in saying that.
but at some point, we're very confident it will return. and we just have so much value to add and we all see that. and we have so much new technology to bear beyond barcode reading that we're very confident about that coming back. but i certainly am not expecting it in the first half of next year.
paul todgham -- chief financial officer
and joe, i'd maybe add -- so the full year view on logistics is tough to call because of kind of the timing of when that might come back. but we are up against tough compares in the first half. we -- q1 this year 2022 was our highest quarterly revenue level and also our highest quarterly growth rate, and we did have a strong quarter in logistics in q1 this year, kind of broad-based across all of our logistics customers, including large customer activity. so, we're up against a tough compare.
and then the question really is, when does the large customer business come back in the -- is it back half of 2023? is it 2024?
joe ritchie -- goldman sachs -- analyst
yeah, paul, that's helpful. and maybe sticking with you for a second and talking about the gross margins a little bit more. so, can you maybe just help me understand again why the gross margin step down in the fourth quarter? what is it specifically about what you sold through in q3 that maybe helped gross margins? and then as you start to think about the first half of next year, if logistics doesn't come back as you have that tough comp, i mean, you should get a pretty decent benefit at least on the gross margin side from mix. if there's any way to quantify that, that would be helpful.
paul todgham -- chief financial officer
yeah. yeah. so first, maybe just the biggest phenomenon for our gross margins over the last five quarters has been our broker buys. so -- and it helps to understand, there's really sort of two factors with broker buys.
there's the volume of the buys we're making and then the timing of when that flows to the p&l. so, there is a lag effect. we commit to the value. we receive it in inventory before it becomes a finished good that's then sold through.
so, what we're seeing right now, joe, is the volume of the buys, it spiked a bit right after the fire as we quickly replenish inventory, and it's come down very significantly through the rest of q3. so, we're optimistic that we are headed in the right direction with regard to a return to our normal levels. and now we're dealing more with the lag effect of -- it will take a few quarters for that to flow through our p&l. so, part of why q4 is a little worse than q3 in our guidance is that factor.
we're going to take a little more broker buys to the p&l. we have a little more fx expected. we quoted a 10 percentage point impact on q4 versus the 5 percentage points we had in q3 as a revenue impact, and that there's a corresponding impact to gross margin. and then overall revenue mix, which -- in q3, we benefited from quite high electronics business, which is generally gross margin accretive to us.
it's high software content and a lower logistics mix. so that lower logistics mix may benefit us to some extent next year. but i think it's smaller than the broker buy factor that's really been driving our gross margin over the last five quarters.
joe ritchie -- goldman sachs -- analyst
ok. that's helpful. thank you both.
operator
thank you. the next question is coming from josh pokrzywinski of morgan stanley. please go ahead. 
josh pokrzywinski -- morgan stanley -- analyst
hi. good evening, rob, paul, and sue.
rob willett -- president and chief executive officer
hi, josh.
josh pokrzywinski -- morgan stanley -- analyst
hi, there. so, first question on the fourth quarter guide and this $20 million catch-up. if you could just remind us how much is left, if any? and if there's any change to the part of the business that you thought was sort of lost as a function of out-loaded product, there was some way to backfill that with newer stuff or some other work around you on?
paul todgham -- chief financial officer
yeah. so strictly, the financials. back in august, we said we had an $80 million impact of the fire in q3, $20 million of that business we thought would be lost and $60 million of it we thought would shift from q3 to subsequent quarters. and then in a follow-up, there was sort of how long might that take? and we said kind of two quarters.
so, we thought there might be some impact in q4 and some in q1. the $20 million fire loss impact we estimated really was dead on. in some cases, it was a product that was being sunset and maybe a couple of last buys of that product that once the components were lost, we weren't going to get back into the product or unable to get back into it. and some of it is maybe just quick cycle readers or vision systems for which if a customer couldn't get it in time, they would either not do the project or get it from a competitor.
so that's pretty much played out as we've expected. we're still in the process of migrating customers to newer products and so on, but that wasn't really a major factor in the product loss, i would say. and then of the $20 million shifted, we really think we're going to realize all of that in q4 rather than have any overhang going into next year. again, the replenishment has been quicker than we expected.
and so, we thought a couple of months ago or three months ago, we might be holding some product back to deliver to customers. but because of how quickly we've gotten back into supply, we're not needing to do that at all, and business is good. supply chain businesses are good.
josh pokrzywinski -- morgan stanley -- analyst
got it. very comprehensive, super helpful. i appreciate it. and just on logistics.
i know that you are kind of reluctant to want to call the full year, especially the first half, second half dynamic. but maybe thinking about outgrowth differently and kind of your customer mix versus how you think the market may be different. i think folks like honeywell and qian are teeing up kind of down 30-ish type numbers. you talked about 10 points of outgrowth in kind of your core business.
would you think about if the market were to be down that much, your outgrowth formula would hold? or there's some sort of mix or comp issue that you think would be more of a distinguishing factor?
rob willett -- president and chief executive officer
and to clarify that, josh, are you talking about this year, current year or next year? 
josh pokrzywinski -- morgan stanley -- analyst
next year, 2023. 
rob willett -- president and chief executive officer
right. yeah. i think the first thing i would say is we have some -- you know this about cognex, we're the technology leader in our industry, and we have exposure to some of the most sophisticated companies in the space, right? so -- and that's a wonderful thing because they teach us so much. and many of the technology leaders then go from them to other places and bring cognex technology with us.
but in this case, it does expose us to a few big players who really are not looking to invest, particularly in greenfield sites as we move into next year. and our exposure that was more than 50% of our business last year was related to that. so, i would think our exposure to that part is going to be down more than the companies that you quoted to perhaps have a broader exposure to broader conveying and material handling, right? but on the upside, i think we have exposure to the base -- the rest of our business, the large groups of customers who we're gaining share in, we have great technology to offer them. so, i would expect there, we would be outgrowing the general industry as customers are really looking to add and spend more on technology enhancements than perhaps on basic conveying and material handling.
so that's perhaps a little context for you.
josh pokrzywinski -- morgan stanley -- analyst
that was a great answer. i found that really helpful. thanks, rob. and best of luck, guys.
rob willett -- president and chief executive officer
thank you. 
operator
thank you. the next question is coming from jake levinson of melius research. please go ahead.
jake levinson -- melius research -- analyst
good evening, everyone.
rob willett -- president and chief executive officer
hi, jake.
jake levinson -- melius research -- analyst
just wanted to get a sense of -- or do you have visibility, i guess, i should say, into the inventories in the channel? and i'm just thinking, you've obviously got some markets like logistics that are not in such great shape. i'm sure there's some fire impact in there potentially to make things even more complicated, but any color you could give would be helpful.
rob willett -- president and chief executive officer
sure. jake, i'd say a wonderful thing about cognex is that there is really almost no inventory in our channel, right? we have a -- we sell about two-thirds of our business is direct and a third is through partners. and for those partners, we very much encourage them not to hold inventory. we think it's a wonderful thing about our model, and we deliver product to them very quickly, of course.
when we had a fire, that's a problem. but they're really -- we actually have found that the rest of the automation universe that we're selling into has much longer lead times than we do, right? so, plcs, as you're probably aware, a lot of them are on six-month lead times and other automation equipment. so, we supply quickly around products, and there's very little kind of a dampening in our channel around that. there are just very few examples, certainly much less than 10% of people who sell cognex carry any significant inventory at all.
jake levinson -- melius research -- analyst
ok. got it. and just switching gears for a second. on the consumer electronics side, not looking for a 2023 view here, but just trying to get a sense of you've got data points showing that people are buying through smartphones and pcs and whatnot after the last couple of years, but it seems like the capital spending side, maybe is holding in better.
so just curious what your -- are your customers investing ahead of new product launches or new types of technology within that? i'm just trying to get a sense of the difference between maybe the production rates versus the capital spending side. 
rob willett -- president and chief executive officer
yes. i think, jake, there are a few things going on there. one is we kind of asked this question around this time every year. and our answers will have really a good picture of the electronics business next year come april.
that's when things sort of really kind of locked in for the year. it's been a good year for us relative to the rest of our business in electronics. and i think maybe a phenomenon again where we're really connected to the technology leaders in the industry that's sort of more high-end and more advanced consumers of manufacturing technology. so, they've been investing, and that's very promising.
so, what kind of drives that kind of up or down year, generally kind of new technologies coming into the market, whether it's in smartphones itself or in other similar type technologies or consumer electronics technologies? and there's always a lot of exciting stuff going on in that industry. it's more a matter of when is it coming to market. and how much the timing plays out next year versus in future years. so that's what we know in april.
but there's another phenomenon going on, which is of interest here is, i think many of the players in electronics are looking to diversify their supply chains. and so, we're seeing investments and incremental investments outside of china, which is a positive thing for cognex, and i would expect that to keep playing out over the coming years. i think we're well positioned, and we've seen this trend coming and we're supporting strongly and being asked to the big players in that space moving to multiple different markets where we have strong presence and are investing. so i do think that's a net gainer for us.
and obviously, particularly recently, as we've seen with covid lockdowns and some challenges going on. i only think the kind of impetus toward that is going to increase as we move through the next few years.
jake levinson -- melius research -- analyst
that's great. thank you. i'll pass it on.
operator
thank you. the next question is coming from jim ricchiuti of needham and company. please go ahead.
jim ricchiuti -- needham and company -- analyst
hi. good afternoon. i'm wondering if you could talk a little bit more about that $20 million catch-up that you're anticipating in q4. can you give us a sense as to which markets that might be concentrated in?
rob willett -- president and chief executive officer
yes, jim, it's very broad-based. certainly, automotive would be among it, but electronics and other markets, we -- it's really a general catch-up across our general product range, not specifically logistics, i would say, but more general factory automation.
jim ricchiuti -- needham and company -- analyst
and not necessarily have a larger project focus associated with it?
rob willett -- president and chief executive officer
no. 
jim ricchiuti -- needham and company -- analyst
ok. rob, at analyst day, you guys talked about opportunities that you see in some of the underserved markets, at least underserved for cognex. and i'm wondering how you're going to be going about that in terms of redeploying existing sales resources. or do you anticipate having to step up hiring as you go after some of these other market peers that you talked about?
rob willett -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, jim, thanks for that question. so, we're in the process of cognex of bringing to market some really exciting technology called edge learning. and what that is, is it's very, very powerful deep learning vision that's kind of pretrained and deployed to smart cameras or basic vision systems but then easy to sell, right? and so that's going to bring us to a lot of customers that we really couldn't serve before, right? customers who aren't sophisticated, aren't programmers of automation or machine vision technology. so, as we roll that out, we're going to need more coverage, right? and the sophistication or the technical sophistication of the sales force, we're going to need to do that is going to be less, right? so certainly, we do expect to be recruiting and training and deploying over quite a long period as that product range rolls out, more sales noise, as we call them, to do that.
and we'll expect to see that, i think, we'll be talking about that in quarters to come. 
paul todgham -- chief financial officer
and i think, rob, it's fair to say, outside of sales, we really are sort of as we are setting plans for next year and so on, we really are deploying -- redeploying existing resources and whether that's on the engineering team or g&a functions. it's really the sales phenomenon.
rob willett -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. it is a sales phenomenon.
jim ricchiuti -- needham and company -- analyst
got it. thanks very much. 
operator
thank you. the next question is coming from jairam nathan of daiwa capital markets. please go ahead.
jairam nathan -- daiwa capital markets -- analyst
hi, thanks for taking my question. so i just wanted to concentrate a bit on the asia ex china number. it was down about 20%, excluding currency. and in the past, it has been -- i think you guys have talked about autos being strong.
and i was just wondering what are some of the puts and takes there on fire impact, a bigger, bigger impact in that region?
rob willett -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. i'll come in and i'll invite paul also to comment. i think sales activity in asia outside of china was pretty mixed in the bid. we did observe slowing activity and project delays in japan and korea.
one phenomenon i would point to is, well, what customers continue to have aggressive plans for electric vehicle manufacturing. some of the plans that we're seeing are moving and investment that we were seeing getting lined up for those markets in asia, excluding china. as a result of some of the government regulation that's been going on, are now shifting geographies and investments we were expecting to see, certainly in korea and japan and some other markets are now being deferred and being moved to europe and america. so that's certainly a phenomenon.
in semiconductor, continue to grow, but growth rate was slowing. so, i think it's a little bit of color. and then i think we continue to see good progress in logistics, but we do have some larger e-commerce players in that market that we're speaking about who really also had a similar phenomenon to what we're talking about, and one very large and successful player in that market really did slow down their spending very sharply post-pandemic.
paul todgham -- chief financial officer
yeah. and, jairam, i just want to make sure there's no confusion over the data. china was roughly flat versus a year ago, with about 5% growth in constant currency, offset by 4% in currency. and really, it was other asia, which is korea, india, asean, japan, and so on, that was down about 20% in constant currency for the factors rob cited.
so, within china, we had strength in electronics and then we did see some fire impact certainly and other factors to sort of offset and then more broad-based bunches in other asia, as rob described.
jairam nathan -- daiwa capital markets -- analyst
ok. no, thanks for the detailed answer. just on logistics, like you talked about expanding beyond barcode reading and expanding into some of the parcel and post customers. so, i'm just trying to understand like what kind of timing should we think about like where you are in the process.
and when should we start seeing some wins -- business wins there?
rob willett -- president and chief executive officer
well, i think the modular vision tunnel that we just about today is certainly a very strong first step into some of those markets. and we saw already in trials with a number of key companies in those markets. so that's -- i think that's the first step, and i think you're going to see a lot more technology from us coming that will make us very competitive in those markets over the next number of quarters. so, i think it's the beginning, and it's starting to feel much more tangible around cognex.
jairam nathan -- daiwa capital markets -- analyst
ok. and a final question, if i may, on seasonality in 2023. so, should we without the fire impact next year, should we kind of go back to normal seasonality of 1q being the weakest and improvements in 2q and 3q?
rob willett -- president and chief executive officer
i think we've got this phenomenon q1 of last year -- sorry, this year was very strong because of logistics. in fact, i think it might have been our strongest quarter, and that's really not expected in q1 of next year. i think if we strip that out, then we're dealing with some of the normal seasonality, which q1 tends to be lower quarter for factory automation. and i've seen no reason it wouldn't be, again, given some of the dynamics we see in europe and elsewhere.
so, i think we certainly have some of those factors playing i did just want to go back to something you said earlier. so, i made the point that we see growth outside of china for investments. so -- and the reason that may not be apparent when you look at the other asia numbers and some of those purchases may be being made inside china, right, for contractors who may be then moving it outside of china or out through our european region. if that's confusing to anybody.
i'm really speaking to underlying trends in geographical movement rather than where you may see the bookings. sorry, the revenue.
jairam nathan -- daiwa capital markets -- analyst
yeah. no. understood. thank you.
thank you for the details.
operator
thank you. the next question is coming from matt summerville of d.a. davidson. please go ahead.
will jellison -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
hi. this is will jellison on for matt summerville today. good evening.
rob willett -- president and chief executive officer
hi, will.
will jellison -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
i wanted to start out by referencing something you said at the very beginning of the call, and that is with the business impact of the fire largely behind you at this point. can you speak to any lessons or best practices you feel cognex might have gained from the experience in terms of supply chain management or how to handle supply risk moving forward?
rob willett -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. we've done a lot of analysis and soul-searching on that question, matt, and we're not quite done. we continue to work on it. one thing to point out is, i think we had recognized this as a risk factor in our business for some time, and we're in the process of addressing it, and the fire came when we were not in the final quarter, i would say, but approaching it.
and there's a sports metaphor, they're not an annual calendar metaphor, anyway. but we've -- we're in the process of starting up a second contract manufacturer, a very substantial and accomplished business. and i think had we been there, we would have been in a much stronger position. we've certainly looked a lot at where we hold our inventory and our strategic component inventory and having that in more diverse location is important.
i think like a lot of companies, we're thinking about kind of diversifying our regional presence where we source and manage products from. i think like a lot of companies through this kind of period we've been going through with supply chain, just making sure that we have very strong relationships with our component and technology suppliers is important. i think -- that's one where we've come out of this really well. i would say, i think one of the reasons we've outperformed what we had expected to do is despite some very different component supply environment that we've been in the relationships we have with our component suppliers are very, very good, and they came through for us.
they moved us to the front of the line in some cases, in many cases. why? because we're very sophisticated users of their components, processors, imagers, they really like working with us, and we have very collaborative relationships. but the other thing is we pay on time, and we're very proud of cognex of being a company that's good to its word, it treats us supply as well and pays on time. and i think that came through for us in this relationship, where the ceos of some pretty major component suppliers came through to help us.
i think if there's maybe another thing, we did -- coming out of this, not maybe we absolutely did. we did a comprehensive assessment of our insurance programs. and i think we were pleased with how we were insured in many regards, but still are opportunities and tunes up that we've done as we've gone through this difficult lending experience. and then finally, as you would expect, we've taken more protective measures around such things as fire protection, etc., across the business in multiple locations globally.
so, it's been an important learning experience for us, which thalassemia team will continue to engage, and we have a meeting next month, where we will be doing a full debrief on that internally.
will jellison -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
understood. that's great. thank you for that color, paul. and my follow-up  excuse me, rob, thank you for that.
i wanted to ask a follow-up about edge intelligence. and i'm thinking how interesting it is that it unlocks this opportunity for you to serve those markets that you haven't quite paid as much attention to in the past? -- what i want to better understand about edge intelligence is if there's any sort of ip protection or high degree of know-how that helps that software and your ability to create value with it, not be imitated by somebody who might want to serve those same markets in the future?
rob willett -- president and chief executive officer
yes. yes. thank you. i just want to just a point of order, which is we have these two terms going on at cognex, which i know confuses everybody.
we have edge learning and edge intelligence, right? and the comments i made previously were about learning, which is taking -- and i think that you're asking -- i think your question is really about that deep learning technology that we're applying to the edge, right? that's -- yes, yes, good. so, edge learning, yes, it's -- so we have some fabulous technologists at cognex that have come to us largely through two acquisitions that we've made over the last six-or-so years and the acquisition of vidi and sualab. and these are foremost technologies in taking deep learning, a technique where you create a very sophisticated model and show examples. it's example-based training of what's good and what's bad.
and we -- and then we can that this technique of edge learning takes that very sophisticated pre-trained model and deploys it into very simple hardware that then is easily programmed. and if you have a chance to see demos either with us here or on our website, you can see that we can train these products and the insight 2,800 is perhaps the best example. if it's so far -- we're just a few examples of good and bad, very simply programmed. so that's -- and this technology is the technology we've developed in-house.
it's proprietary to cognex. no one else has it. in our market today. and our ability to apply that in a factory context, rather than in a kind of lab or a consumer-type context is, we believe, very powerful and something we continue to develop and think we have a significant lead in.
will jellison -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
thank you, rob.
operator
thank you. our next question is coming from damian karas of ubs. please go ahead.
damian karas -- ubs -- analyst
hi. good evening, everyone.
rob willett -- president and chief executive officer
good evening.
damian karas -- ubs -- analyst
covered a lot of ground. thanks for all the helpful details. and i'm sorry if i missed this, but related to your commentary about working down some of the broker premium costs from inventory. i'm just curious what's the spread between the spot purchases today and those inventory levels just to kind of give us a sense for the level of the gross margin tailwind that you should have ahead?
paul todgham -- chief financial officer
yeah. sure, damian. so, this is paul. it was smaller this quarter, but when it was at its worst, which was really q4 last year, q1, q2 this year, it was about a 400-basis-point impact on our gross margin, give or take, 50 basis points or so.
so, very significant. and i do think as you're covering many companies, you hear a lot of talk about freight and component cost inflation and some element of broker buys. my read from studying our peers is we're sort of unique in this being such a large phenomenon. and partly, that's because we do airfreight already today.
so, we haven't been substituting ship for air like some peers or others in the automation industry have. and that we've been, i think, doing quite a good job of offset core component inflation with the pricing actions we took since implementing a pricing strategy sort of mid to -- around the summer of last year that we've been executing against. so, what it's been, this quarter, it was lower than that, maybe call it half of that or so. and i do expect to see that winding down, but we're going to be carrying some amount of that into the first half of next year.
damian karas -- ubs -- analyst
ok. great. and could you just remind us how much exposure you have in semis? and how should we think more broadly about the customer mix within consumer electronics? thanks.
rob willett -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, broadly, semiconductor is about 5% of cognex's business. it's been performing very strongly over the last year. so, it's probably a little north of that at -- yes, at the moment, like 7% or so. and yeah, it's  my take on it is we've seen a lot of strong investment.
we're going to kind of see that moderate for a while now. and then we're all reading about big investments that are going on in new regions. so, i expect that will start to come back later, but i'm not expecting that to be a factor next year for us. it will probably be in further years out.
that's my take on it at the moment.
operator
damian, do you have any additional questions? we'll move on to -- the next question is coming from rob mason of baird. please go ahead.
rob mason -- baird -- analyst
yes. good evening. thanks for taking the questions. rob, i wanted to see just real quickly, if you could maybe wrap up your geographic deep dive.
when you mentioned the geographies in your prepared remarks, you called out some of the swing factors, logistics being one obvious. but when you spoke to europe, you talked about a lower confidence level there, but you did not make a similar comment about americas, and i'm just trying to understand if there's a distinction to be made there and if there's lower confidence in europe, how it's manifesting itself right now?
rob willett -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. hi, rob. i think that's a good question. and i -- i think there is a difference.
when you look at our americas numbers, they look bad because of logistics, right? but if we peel that away, i mean, outside a few large logistics customers, we actually saw emerging strength in our americas broader market. we actually saw the quarter business activity tracking ahead of our own forecasts. we saw larger products -- projects moving forward at a better rate than earlier in the year. we observed investments, i would say, more around kind of reshoring, relocating back to the americas, in places, particularly such as mexico.
so, we're a pretty strong player in the americas market. and we were pretty pleased to see that, and it was perhaps stronger than we expected. and kind of in contrast to what some of the understandable challenges that they're seeing in europe with their energy crisis and they're heavy reliance, i think, on internal combustion engine automotive, which is still something that i think is a drag in our markets there. it will turn around as ev investment starts to come in, but they're not there yet, nor are we there yet in america.
rob mason -- baird -- analyst
that's helpful. and within the americas, you would just put that activity, that stronger activity under the umbrella of broader automation, you wouldn't necessarily call out any particular verticals.
rob willett -- president and chief executive officer
no. i mean, automotive is a very important vertical for us in the u.s. so obviously, that's a part of it. but no, we saw general strength yeah.
yeah. we saw them. yeah, yeah, definitely.
rob mason -- baird -- analyst
ok. very good. and just last question. the currency headwind that you noted for the fourth quarter, i'm not sure i would have modeled that high on my own, and it's a big step-up sequentially.
is that if we run that out, run currency -- current spot rates forward, would that be the type of currency headwind you would take into the first half? or is there something unusual about the fourth quarter in your geographic mix?
paul todgham -- chief financial officer
i don't know i haven't necessarily looked at the first half yet, rob. but obviously, we'll be -- if i think about next year, we didn't have major currency impact in q1 and q2, we had a little bit. so, i think it will be moderated a bit by -- we did  year to date, we've had about 5 -- 4 points of currency year to date, 4 points in q3. so, you can kind of back into q1 and q2 from that.
so, i would say that's a compare that we're not up against q4 to q4. so, it will moderate a little bit just based on that, i would say, rob.
rob mason -- baird -- analyst
ok. very good. thank you.
operator
thank you. the next question is a follow-up coming from joe giordano of cowen. please go ahead. 
joe giordano -- cowen and company -- analyst
appreciate it. let me take a quick follow-up here. rob, you mentioned logistics, you think maybe the bigger opportunity for you is in europe and asia? is that any meaningful percent of your logistics business at this time? and what's like a realistic time frame if it's not, when it could be?
rob willett -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. i mean we have a nice and growing business in logistics outside the americas. i'm not sure i'm ready exactly the size for you at this point. but no, they're starting to be significant and where asia definitely is large and getting large and as is europe.
so, yeah, that's -- and then we've had success with some large customers here in america, which has kind of skewed our business here. but obviously, we're an american company, and we have great resources we can deploy quickly here. so, it's not unusual to see growth start first here and go elsewhere. but now, we're building off a nice base of business in both those markets, and we're starting to see sophistication around e-commerce fulfillment and other logistics markets there.
so we're feeling positive about those.
paul todgham -- chief financial officer
and joe, the only thing i would add is although most of our large customer business is concentrated in the americas, it isn't exclusive of the americas. so, there may be a little bit of noise in the numbers, for instance, in q3, logistics was a contributor -- the biggest contributor to our revenue decline in europe, and that was more large customer activity than the broader base of business that we've been growing and continue to grow.
joe giordano -- cowen and company -- analyst
ok.
operator
thank you. this brings us to the end of the question-and-answer session. i would now like to turn the floor back over to mr. willett for closing comments.

operator
greetings, and welcome to the cognex fourth quarter 2022 earnings conference call. at this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. a brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [operator instructions] as a reminder, this conference is being recorded.
it is now my pleasure to introduce your host, nathan mccurren, head of investor relations. thank you. please go ahead.
nathan mccurren -- head of investor relations
thank you, donna. good evening, everyone, and thank you for joining us. with me on today's call are rob willett, cognex's president and ceo; and paul todgham, our cfo. our results were released earlier today.
the press release and annual report on form 10-k are available on the investor relations section of our website. both the press release and our call today will reference non-gaap measures. you can see a reconciliation of certain items from gaap to non-gaap in exhibit 2 of the press release. any forward-looking statements we made in the earnings release or any that we may make during this call are based upon information that we believe to be true as of today.
our actual results may differ materially from our projections due to risks and uncertainties that are described in our sec filings, including our most recent form 10-k filed tonight for 2022. with that, i'll turn the call over to rob. 
rob willett -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, nathan. hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us. we continue to navigate a challenging environment. our fourth quarter results were largely in line with our guidance but are not representative of our long-term growth expectations.
the focus of my remarks today will be on the near-term challenges we're facing, and then on the reasons why we remain excited and confident in our long-term growth opportunities. our largest challenge within our logistics business, we continue to see a post-pandemic slowdown with a few of our largest e-commerce customers who have temporarily reduced their investments to absorb excess capacity. looking beyond this temporary pause, we continue to expect logistics to be our highest growth end market over the mid to long term. we also saw lower new business activity in the quarter.
bookings were below our expectations and generated less revenue in quarter than is typical. despite these challenges, revenue increased on a constant-currency basis by 1% for the full year compared to 2021, a year where we reported strong growth of 28%. outside of logistics, revenue from the remainder of our end markets grew in 2022 roughly in line on a constant-currency basis with what we would expect over the long term. as our history demonstrates, we can experience periods of softness in between periods of robust growth.
our revenue growth target of 15% is a multiyear annual target. with that lens revenue of over $1 billion in 2022 represented double-digit annual growth compared to 2020 and 2019. gross margin is 71% in q4 and 72% for the full year, which was in line with our latest expectations. margins in both periods were below our long-term target mid-70 % level due to the elevated purchase of scarce components through brokers.
before i go into detail on our end markets and an outlook for q1, i'd like to turn it over to paul to walk you through more of the results.
paul todgham -- chief financial officer
thank you, rob, and hello, everyone. revenue was $239 million in q4, a 2% decline year on year or an increase of 4% on a constant-currency basis. this includes the approximately $20 million catch-up from deliveries that were delayed in q3 following the fire. in addition to the slowness with a few large e-commerce customers throughout the quarter and slower business activity more broadly at the end of the year, foreign currency translation lowered revenue by $45 million or 4% in 2022 and by 6% in the fourth quarter.
looking at the change in revenue for q4 from a geographic perspective, each primary region grew year on year on a constant-currency basis. asia increased by 9%, excluding an 11 percentage point reduction from currency exchange rates. revenue growth from semi and automotive more than offset softness from the challenging environment in china. revenue from europe increased by 4% excluding an 11 percentage point reduction from currency exchange rates.
growth was led by revenue from automotive and consumer electronics that offset a decline in logistics. in the americas, revenue grew by 1% year on year. lower investments by a few large customers and logistics were offset by growth in automotive, consumer electronics, food and beverage, and medical-related industries among others. gross margin was 71% in q4 compared to 72% in q4 of 2021 and 73% in q3.
the decline from q3 is due to the significant premiums we've been paying to replenish component inventory destroyed in the fire. these purchases negatively impacted gross margin by approximately 500 basis points in the quarter and approximately 400 basis points for the year. we are pleased our broker buy activity is winding down, now that we've replenished post-fire and the supply environment has improved. we expect it will take a couple of quarters for the higher-priced components to work their way through the p&l, resulting in a minimal impact by the second half of 2023.
moving on to operating expenses. our reported operating expenses included a fire loss in both q3 and q4 of 2022 and a modest restructuring charge in q4. excluding these charges, q4 operating expenses increased by 3% from q3. comparing year on year, operating expenses decreased by mid-single digits, primarily due to the favorable impact of currency exchange rates and lower incentive compensation.
these benefits were partially offset by the incremental investments we've been making in sales and engineering headcount. operating margin on a gaap basis was 23% in q4. non-gaap operating margin was 24% in q4, an improvement from 23% in q4 of 2021 and 20% in q3. this level of profitability is below our 30% long-term target due to lower gross margin and operating deleverage from revenue softness.
the effective tax rate excluding discrete tax items was 22% in q4 and 16% for the full year. reported earnings were $0.32 per share in q4. non-gaap earnings per share were $0.27 in q4 compared with $0.30 in q4 of 2021 and $0.21 in q3, excluding the one-time charges mentioned earlier in tax adjustments. turning to the balance sheet.
cognex continues to have a strong cash position with $854 million in cash and investments and no debt. the strength of our balance sheet enabled us to aggressively replenish components lost in the june fire. as a result, we caught up on customer deliveries quickly during the second half of the year and ended 2022 in a healthy inventory position. during the year, we also had a substantial return of capital to shareholders with over $200 million of share repurchase activity and more than $45 million of dividends paid.
now, i'll turn it back over to rob for color on our end markets and on our outlook.
rob willett -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, paul. i would like to now give a little historical context. you may remember, we went through a restructuring in 2020. as part of that action, we reorganized our r&d and engineering teams.
these teams is focused on groundbreaking edge learning technology and standard product architectures that can deploy on innovations more efficiently and at a faster rate. as a result of these improvements, we now have many new products coming to market in 2023. recent product launches include our new dataman 580. this fixed-mount barcode reader is designed for five and six-sided cognex modular vision tunnels for use in the most demanding logistics applications.
pairing this product with cognex 3d vision systems helps logistics customers to apply a label on a package in a spot that does not cover other information on that package, a surprisingly difficult task to automate. this results in optimizing processes by increasing line speeds and traceability without lowering read rates. in another product launch, we expanded the capabilities of our in-sight 2800 vision system to include deep learning-enabled optical character recognition. this allows customers to deploy powerful ai-based ocr technology regardless of their skill level.
prior industry solutions required hours of programming by highly trained engineers preventing many companies from automating this type of inspection. now, models can be set up and deployed directly on the device in minutes, with this view as 10 sample images. food and beverage manufacturers will be able to easily read expiration dates, even on curved metal surfaces. electric vehicle manufacturers can quickly locate and read the alphanumeric text etched on the bottom side of ev batteries for traceability.
and logistics businesses can decipher codes and text on a variety of package types to ensure proper routing and prevent rework. we believe these products and many others planned for 2023 launch position us to broaden the market we serve and capture more share. with that, let's jump into more detail about what we're seeing in each of our end markets. our largest end market in 2022 was automotive, which represented approximately 25% of our revenue.
we reported record revenue from automotive and double-digit growth year on year in constant currency. this is primarily driven by the increase in electronic components in vehicles and the ongoing transition to electric vehicles. the transition to electric vehicles has generated an increase in new model introductions and demand for ev batteries. we have strong relationships with the major ev battery manufacturers who projected continued growth within asia and new growth in the americas and europe.
in the fourth quarter, we acquired sirius advanced cybernetics gmbh, or sac, a german computational lighting company. combining sac's capabilities with cognex's vision and ai tools equips us with an industry leading offering for battery inspection. the sac acquisition will support our strategy to capture a larger share of the high-growth battery inspection market. moving on to logistics.
logistics represented approximately 20% of our total revenue in 2022. after over 60% growth in logistics in 2021, annual revenue from logistics contracted by 25% in 2022. aside from the few large e-commerce customers who reduced investment, revenue from the remainder of our logistics business grew both in the quarter and year. we believe logistics will continue to be an important growth driver for us over the long term.
the market is still in the early stages of adopting machine vision. most companies are still highly reliant on labor and very few warehouses globally are realizing the full potential of automation. an example of the type of opportunities that exist in logistics is a recent win with a fortune 50 retailer that was previously a relatively small customer of ours. in 2022, we deepened our relationship with this company, who had previously announced a multibillion-dollar investment to enhance its shopping experience.
they're establishing regional sortation centers and converting in-store stock rooms into sortation centers to pack and ship orders direct to consumers. cognex was chosen to provide machine vision because of our best-in-class algorithms that can reliably read barcodes at angles. our tunnel solution enabled our customer to increase the number of products on a high-speed conveyor by reducing the gaps between them while still reading barcodes at near-perfect read rates. after initial wins and excellent execution support that customers asked cognex to add value in additional areas, such as converting manual operations to automated tunnels to offset labor shortages and costs in existing regional distribution centers.
shifting to consumer electronics. our third largest end market in 2022, representing approximately 20% of revenue, consumer electronics grew in the mid-teens year on year on a constant-currency basis. growth was primarily driven by the premium end of the smartphone market with an additional contribution from other consumer electronics products, such as tablets and accessories. we had particularly strong demand for our deep learning and 3d solutions in this market.
turning now to our outlook. we expect revenue in the first quarter will be between $180 million and $200 million, which represents a meaningful stepdown year on year. you may recall that the first quarter of '22 was an exceptionally strong one for us as we reported an unusual sequential increase in revenue, led by our second highest quarter ever for logistics. we had strong demand broadly across our business, even from consumer electronics, which is typically quiet in q1.
we also caught up on $20 million of orders in backlog caused by supply chain delays in the fourth quarter of 2021. in contrast, new business activity at the end of 2022 was slower than we anticipated and we've had a slow start to 2023. lower activity with our largest logistics customers continues, and we're also seeing a broader slowdown across many of our end markets as customers are wary of committing to significant investment. we believe gross margin in q1 will remain in the low 70% range.
the supply environment has improved and our broker buy activity has wound down, but the impact of what we've already purchased will take a couple of quarters to flow through our p&l. we expect operating expenses in q1 will increase by approximately 10% on a sequential basis, excluding the charges related to restructuring and the fire in q4. this increase is driven by investments we are making in our new emerging customer sales force, along with merit increases and a weaker u.s. dollar.
throughout 2023, we expect to see a ramp-down in the impact of broker buys and a ramp-up in our emerging customer sales force investment. from an operating margin standpoint for the year, we expect these two drivers to roughly offset. we expect the emerging customer initiative to broaden our reach, increase penetration, and further diversify our customer base. representing potentially hundreds of thousands of businesses, this custom segment is looking for automation solutions that are easy to implement, easy to use, and provide the highest performance.
our newest edge learning and id products position us well for this initiative. to directly reach these customers, we're expanding our sales force. we've already hired the initial sales noise focused on this segment. we will onboard and train more in the quarters ahead.
we expect costs from this initiative to ramp through the first three quarters of this year. while our continued investment during a slower growth period will result in near-term operating deleverage, we believe it's an important initiative for long-term growth. we remain committed to tightly managing operating costs in this environment, and we also believe it's important to continue to invest in high roi initiatives. we're excited our long-term growth prospects though timing is uncertain, we expect large e-commerce customers to shift back into investment mode, ev battery growth to continue, china to more meaningfully reopen and our emerging customer initiative to start to deliver.
i'm proud of how cognoids responded in a year with many challenges. it gives me even more confidence in having the right team to deliver strong growth and new customer value together in the years to come. now we will open the call for questions. operator, please go ahead.

operator
thank you. the floor is now open for questions. [operator instructions] we do ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up, but you may rejoin the queue for any additional questions that you have. our first question today is coming from josh pokrzywinski of morgan stanley.
please go ahead.
josh pokrzywinski -- morgan stanley -- analyst
hi, good evening, all.
rob willett -- president and chief executive officer
hi, josh.
josh pokrzywinski -- morgan stanley -- analyst
just first question on sort of the 1q guide. i know that we've gone through a decent amount of, call it, off-cycle revenue volatility with the fire and some of the supply chain stuff and the catch-up on the other side, backlog position in e-commerce. but should we think of 1q was kind of representing normal seasonality without any kind of unusual big items as we think about the rest of the year? i know you don't give guidance, but just trying to make sure there's no other kind of noise in there.
rob willett -- president and chief executive officer
right, yes. so, q1 is looking slow. we've seen slow periods like this before and we've come out of them and delivered meaningful growth. i think you know that our business inflects quickly and it's not kind of backlog driven as some of our peers are.
and additionally, we're comparing to what is a particularly tough q1, given last year's unusually high revenue from logistics and other markets. but i think it's also fair to say that we see lower pmi data across all of the regions that we serve in our regular business, and that's certainly reflected in the activity that we're seeing, which is at a lower rate than we were expecting a few months ago. and then, of course, as i think i've explained quite a lot, the logistics business is really at a very low level. really as a result of the large customers really pulling back on e-commerce spending.
so that's the kind of color that we're looking at. for those of you who have followed cognex for a long time, we know that historically, q1 was always our lowest quarter. that somewhat got changed with large logistics orders coming in or sometimes high consumer electronics business in q1, but this looks like a quarter without any of that.
josh pokrzywinski -- morgan stanley -- analyst
got it. that's helpful. i appreciate that color. and then just thinking about something you said in the prepared remarks there, i want to make sure i understand better.
a reduction in broker buys through the year, which sounds like a good guy. and then you mentioned a ramp in some of these target investment customers -- sorry, i get the exact phrasing wrong. but both of those sound good? or are you saying it's a ramp in the expense to develop that sales force, that product capability? is it a ramp in the expense or that customer revenue?
paul todgham -- chief financial officer
it's a ramp in the expense, josh. this is paul. so, the way to think about this is, we had about 400 basis points of broker buy impact to gross margin in our 2022 results. so, think of it is around $40 million or so, $0.5 billion of revenue.
we're expecting to see roughly a $25 million to $30 million reduction in that expense this year, ramping up over time. we still expect in the first quarter to have reflected in our low-70s gross margin about 300 basis point to 400 basis point impact of broker buys. but we should see a $25 million to $30 million investment -- savings to gross margin from broker buys and that's roughly comparable to the level of investment we expect to make in our emerging customer initiative in opex. so it's an increase over -- ramping up over the first three quarters.
so there are some of that reflected in our q1 opex guidance, which is why we see the sequential -- one part of the sequential opex increase from q4, but we'll expect to see more of that in q2 and q3.
josh pokrzywinski -- morgan stanley -- analyst
crystal clear. thanks, paul.
operator
thank you. the next question is coming from joe ritchie of goldman sachs. please go ahead.
joe ritchie -- goldman sachs -- analyst
thanks. good afternoon, everybody.
rob willett -- president and chief executive officer
hi, joe.
joe ritchie -- goldman sachs -- analyst
hey. so, i wanted to touch on the logistics commentary a little bit further. so, as you kind of think about the rest of the year, clearly, there is volatility throughout the year in 2022. it sounds to me like things have kind of worsened and so, while logistics might have been down 25% for the year is probably down a lot more maybe in the fourth quarter.
i'm just trying to understand going forward, where would you expect logistics, particularly the bottom just based on what you see in the conversations that you're having with your customers.
rob willett -- president and chief executive officer
so, yes, so logistics represent about 20% of revenue in 2022, approximately $225 million, and it was our second largest market, right? and it contracted. and we saw that contraction kind of increases we earn through the year was relatively strong in the first half. and then i think it's really a story of two different customer types. we've got regular logistics customers who are growing nicely, and we expect those to continue to grow, little less than half of that overall logistics business roughly.
and then we've got large customers, very few of them, some of them pretty famous businesses, and they've all really overinvested for a period through covid and then now have really reined in investments. some of them are going through restructuring. and that's going on right now and we expect they'll emerge from that. and then as we get through the year, they'll start to invest again.
that may not happen until late in the year or even next year, right? but we do expect to see more investment going on. but even at those customers, there's still significant work that goes on with kind of productivity improvements, regular business, regular automation projects. so that's not like that business has gone away completely. but certainly, a lot of the greenfields, really all of the greenfields for some of these bigger customers have been stopped or significantly delayed.
so that's really the state of play.
paul todgham -- chief financial officer
and, joe, to your question about quarterly versus annual growth rates and so on, again, we don't consistently provide data on each end market by quarter. but i think we did call out in the q3 earnings that was a -- q3 2022 was a particularly unfavorable comparison. it was very low for logistics in 2022, and that was i think our highest ever logistics quarter in q1 of 2023. so certainly, that quarter was difficult.
in q4, our growth rate or contraction in logistics was pretty comparable to the year on year. and then i would say we're up against another tough compare in q1. q1 was the biggest logistics quarter of 2022. and then, obviously, there were some announcements about pauses in new capacity expansion and so on that muted our logistics revenue from q2 to q4 last year.
joe ritchie -- goldman sachs -- analyst
got it. that's super helpful. if i could ask just one more. it is interesting, it was very helpful to get the color on the 2022 baseline, right, for the three biggest end markets.
i feel bad asking for like the fourth but i'm curious, as like one of the end markets maybe just emerged and now is like a sizable percentage of your business as well. and if you maybe want to provide -- i don't know if it's in like food and beverage or consumer products or semis, but just provide some color around that end market and what your expectation is for 2023?
rob willett -- president and chief executive officer
well, yeah, joe, i think we talked about our big end markets, right, consumer electronics, automotive being largest consumer electronics and logistics. and then other markets for cognex are pretty broad, and they include medical-related industries, consumer products, food and beverage, product security. so i think if i'm understanding your question correctly, you're really asking about those kind of markets in general. they provide good solid growth for us in line with our overall growth expectations.
and there's variation among those markets. but generally, they continue to grow much in the way the rest of the business does. but let me ask for clarification. were you asking about a specific market or something?
joe ritchie -- goldman sachs -- analyst
yeah. i was just wondering whether one of the end markets has grown to be more substantial than the others. and what's really been driving that? it sounds like you're pretty well diversified behind the big three.
rob willett -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. i mean we've got some nice growth drivers. i could talk at length about life sciences and some of what we're seeing in those spaces and food and beverage. but i don't think that's really going to -- moving the needle in terms of our results in a significant way currently.
paul todgham -- chief financial officer
and i think we've spoken to this before, but obviously, over the last couple of years, semiconductor has -- which is generally small for us, kind of might have been 5% of our business two or three years ago and still below 10%, but it certainly has experienced quite robust growth. so obviously, we're seeing some cyclicality there. we are starting to grow medical-related overall is about 10% of our business, which we discussed at analyst day. but generally speaking, yeah, the trends across that diverse range of our business with the exclusion of kind of semi, which is more volatile, i would say, have been fairly consistent.
rob willett -- president and chief executive officer
and building on that, i think the medical business is growing nicely and steadily. and the semi business has had a great run. and i think we're into a slower period as many semiconductor companies are reporting as we look at 2023.
joe ritchie -- goldman sachs -- analyst
ok. thank you for the color.
operator
thank you. the next question is coming from joe giordano of cowen. please go ahead.
joe giordano -- cowen and company -- analyst
hey, guys.
rob willett -- president and chief executive officer
hey, joe.
joe giordano -- cowen and company -- analyst
i wanted to just follow up on logistics a little bit. obviously, it's not surprising to hear the commentary about the large players. and i think most people appreciate that the outside of those mega players kind of like ground floor logistics is much stronger. but rob, you talked about the declining globally.
when does that start to impact that group of customers? is it likely that pmi is trending lower below 50, that logistics or even for those people who are behind, but are they still going to reflect the economic cycle and likely decline in that sort of environment?
rob willett -- president and chief executive officer
right. so, joe, i think your question is how is sort of lower pmi affecting our base logistics business is that that's what you're getting at?
joe giordano -- cowen and company -- analyst
yes.
rob willett -- president and chief executive officer
yes. yes. we have really strong underlying technology and growth trends in our base logistics business, and we still have a relatively low share and a lot of great growth drivers. so i would say that as we're looking at that business, we're expecting good strong growth from it as we look forward.
but it's not immune either to pmi activities. so we do see customers more tentative about placing orders longer cycles to close business, etc., in that space, too. but the underlying growth prospects are very good, i think, really regardless of kind of the kind of pmi data, we're seeing now, although it will slow it down a little bit.
paul todgham -- chief financial officer
yes. i mean a good number of those customers delayed some investments early in covid and are just now, i can speak to my former employer, for just getting back to -- put those plans back in place. and potentially again depending on the consumer exposure they have. in many cases, the consumer data is a little more robust than the manufacturing production data we've seen.
so i think in a low pmi environment, we might see a higher percent of projects delayed, but generally, the investment cycles of building a new distribution center and so on tend to transcend a shorter-term economic cycle.
rob willett -- president and chief executive officer
and then i would say, as we look at that business, too, we really have so much opportunity to grow our business in europe and asia where we have still low share and a lot of competitive advantage. so certainly, we're expecting outsized and seeing outsized growth in those areas of our business.
joe giordano -- cowen and company -- analyst
ok. so just is it fair to say that that base business and logistics in the environment that we're in right now, you'd still expect it to grow? i mean things can obviously change between now and the end of the year. but given where things are, that would be a fair statement to make.
rob willett -- president and chief executive officer
yes.
joe giordano -- cowen and company -- analyst
ok. and then my follow-up would be on the emerging customer stuff that you're doing. where are you on the actual products? like i know you're talking about developing like smart sensors and things that are easier to use and kind of like a different type of product than you've done historically. so i know you're ramping up the cognoids and getting the sales organization ready to support this, but where are you on the products themselves?
rob willett -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. right now, we have a good range of very, very competitive products for emerging customer sales noise to sell, right? and there are more coming. but we're out in the field, and they are very well equipped to close a lot of business that they see at these small customers.
joe giordano -- cowen and company -- analyst
i'll pass it on. thanks, guys.
operator
thank you. the next question is coming from guy hardwick of credit suisse. please go ahead.
guy hardwick -- credit suisse -- analyst
hi, good afternoon.
rob willett -- president and chief executive officer
hello.
guy hardwick -- credit suisse -- analyst
i know you gave a -- in your preamble, you referred to a slow start to the year. obviously, logistics is well known, and you also referenced the semiconductor end market. are there any other markets which are showing weakness? could you expand a little bit on that?
rob willett -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. i think broadness is -- i think weakness is pretty broad in general as you described and as witnessed in pmi data overall. i think if there's anything else that i would -- well, if there are some other things broad themes i'd draw, one is, obviously, at the start of the year, we're still seeing covid-related disruption in china, right? and i think, obviously, rising interest rates creating challenges in approving capital. and really, a lot of our business is driven by capital spend, right? and then i think there's a couple of regulatory things i would call out.
so the inflation reduction act, it's going to drive a lot of ev battery investment in the united states. and it's going to draw some of that investment away from asia and europe. so we're seeing projects that we were expecting to be winning and installing in europe or in asia have been delayed because they're moving into america. so that's going on.
and a somewhat similar dynamic with the chips act restricting exports to china is causing some changes among those customers where, i think, near term, they will be spending less. long term, i expect them to be equipping more facilities outside of china. so that's causing some delays also.
guy hardwick -- credit suisse -- analyst
so just as a follow-up, if tier 1 logistics capex comes back in 2024, i mean, what are your logistics partner integrators telling you do discussions on projects have to start really by the middle of this year have any impact in 2024, given typically 18-month lead times?
rob willett -- president and chief executive officer
yes, you're right. was there a question there? i mean, generally --
guy hardwick -- credit suisse -- analyst
what are your partner integrators telling you in terms of potential outlook longer term? if you want to return back to the logistics growth that you referenced at the investor day, you've got to have kind of recovery in 2024.
rob willett -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. so i think maybe one thing to understand is for those big customers, we do directly with the company itself, right? and we're working often with their engineers on implementing their technology plans and their rollout. and then we think of integrators really has more capacity to help execute their plans, right? so we see we're in a dry period. it's not clear to us exactly when it comes back, certainly not in this first half.
and i think beyond that, we'll share more information when we have something more solid and meaningful this year. we think it will come back. we think we're optimistic about that. but the timing of it, is it second half? is it 2024? we're not clear ourselves on that.
and i don't think our customers necessarily are clear on that either.
guy hardwick -- credit suisse -- analyst
ok. thank you.
operator
thank you. the next question is coming from jacob levinson of melius research. please go ahead.
jacob levinson -- melius research -- analyst
hi. good evening, everyone.
rob willett -- president and chief executive officer
good evening.
jacob levinson -- melius research -- analyst
just on this acquisition, sac that you did in the quarter sounds pretty interesting. but can you help us understand a little bit about how that -- what the differentiation is, what the technology that they're really doing and, i guess, why is that so important in battery inspection process in particular?
rob willett -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. yeah. thank you. i appreciate the question.
so something that goes on in machine vision is you acquire an image, right? and then you use vision tools to decode and make sense of that image, right? and cognex, i think, is undisputed in our ability to make sense of and to interpret images, and particularly with our deep learning technology, we really have phenomenal capabilities in that area. but image acquisition is something where we felt we really wanted to do better relative to our competitors. and we saw a big need in this market to do that. the company, sac, that we've acquired is really a leader in this area of computational lighting or computational optics.
and what that technology does is it -- think of it like a dome of light that sits on top of an image that's being analyzed. and there are leds that are lit up in a very controlled and specific way using very sophisticated software to create almost like a 3d image of what's underneath them. and in this case, it very often is illuminating dense and scratches on the surface that's being analyzed. they can do it very quickly and almost with 3d-type capability.
and this technology is better at doing that than any other that we've seen in the market so far. and what is that going to allow us to do, it's going to help us serve some really important needs in battery production, in ev battery production. and looking at material like even just take the outside of a cylindrical battery that is pretty widely used and widely out there in the world of ev. dense and scratches can cause fire and other problems and have done, right? so it's a very hot topic for sure.
as companies are rolling out new ev battery technology and they're building billions of dollars of manufacturing capability, this is a technology we think will be highly prized and will help us drive growth in years to come in that space. so that's a little bit of an overview.
jacob levinson -- melius research -- analyst
super interesting. and just one for paul quickly. i know you guys prior to the fire in indonesia that we're embarking on a supply chain diversification plan for lack of a better description, but maybe you can just update us on what you've been able to qualify some other contract suppliers or manufacturers rather?
paul todgham -- chief financial officer
yes, sure. thanks, jacob. i think we've reflected in our previous qs and in this k. really, since 2021, we've been bringing online a second contract manufacturer, as well as a couple of sites for our primary contract manufacturer.
and we're making good progress there. the second manufacturer is producing at this point in q1. so we're happy with that and has the capacity to do quite a bit more, and we'll continue to ramp that up over this year. so this will be a journey.
it is a progress, but i think we are headed in the right direction, as well as there are broader efforts to diversify some of our supply chain risk, including distribution centers, we move to a much larger distribution center in the americas, for instance, earlier in 2022 and looking at potential opportunities globally for distribution and warehousing.
jacob levinson -- melius research -- analyst
perfect. good luck in '23, guys. thank you.
operator
thank you. the next question is coming from jim ricchiuti of needham. please go ahead.
jim ricchiuti -- needham and company -- analyst
all right. thank you. you've given some commentary, some color around many of the end markets. and rob, i'm wondering if you would maybe talk a little bit more about your expectations for automotive.
you've got some puts and takes. obviously, the ev market still seems like it's fairly healthy. what's your sense as you look at the automotive part of your business this year?
rob willett -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. i think we're pretty optimistic about the automotive market overall. i mean, revenue from automotive in 2022 grew 13% in constant currency, which is above what we expect for that market over the long term. and we do see a lot of multiyear investment in new capacity, particularly ev battery, manufacturing capacity getting teed up, right? and we also see more of that investment going into the united states.
i mean we're a very, very strong share and a very, very strong team able to execute on the needs of those companies. and then we have the sac acquisition that i mentioned, which brings a really powerful tool to bear into what is a very difficult manufacturing problem. and our deep learning capabilities in general and our edge learning tools really, i think, are going to be very valuable in those applications. so yeah, i think we remain pretty optimistic about the outlook for automotive over the coming quarters and years.
jim ricchiuti -- needham and company -- analyst
and i know that you don't normally have a lot of color on the consumer electronics market. the question i had more in that area is around the reports that we've all been seeing about more production, consumer electronics shifting to places like india including for applications around smartphones. first of all, are you seeing any signs of that? and how soon -- how far out if that were actually occurring and is it going, would you see orders as that capacity gets built out in places like that?
rob willett -- president and chief executive officer
i think some major smartphone manufacturers are on a multiyear journey to diversify their manufacturing footprint. and i think various recent -- various things that have been going on in the world are certainly continuing to drive that kind of sentiment. for sure, production is being moved to other markets such as india and vietnam, and we've been seeing that over a number of years, and it's definitely continuing and gathering pace. and yes, we are certainly receiving orders and doing business for a business that historically might have been done in china or is now being done in india.jim ricchiutiok.
thank you.
operator
thank you. the next question is coming from rob mason of baird. please go ahead.
rob mason -- baird -- analyst
yes, good evening. i have a question about --
rob willett -- president and chief executive officer
hi, rob.
rob mason -- baird -- analyst
good evening. i had a question about the buildout of the emerging customer sales force. if you think about at the end of this year or maybe even over the course of the next two years, what percent of your sales headcount would you expect that sales force to comprise?
rob willett -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, i do think we're going to get that information just for competitive reasons. we have competitors in this space that are very tight-lipped about their own investments, etc. but certainly, if you do the math on kind of what paul told us about investment, it's going to be a significant number of heads we would expect to add this year and train and put into the field. and then i could see this as being an initiative that's going to build, really deliver for us over many, many years as our products get better for that market and our sales force becomes more established.
maybe there's another kind of trend or data point i'd point to is like certainly plus years ago when we were talking, and about 50% of our business was going through distribution, right? but as our products have got more powerful and easier to implement and our business has got bigger, it's really 70% of our business now is direct and only 30% through distribution. so certainly, we recognize that continued growth is going to mean continued end-user direct sales headcount. and that's a path we're on and we'll continue to be on.
rob mason -- baird -- analyst
i see. ok. and then just as a follow-up, maybe going a little bit the last questioner, but just around consumer electronics. and again, i know you don't have great visibility at this point in the year.
but just sizing up the year that you just had, which i think played out better overall than maybe you were thinking at the outset of the year. are you seeing anything, any indications that would support, i guess, growth this year, just given the typical cadence that that business often is on? or is there anything that you would call out that we should think about as we try to model out 2023?
rob willett -- president and chief executive officer
rob, i think you're right in the characterization of last year. we as normal last year, as i'll tell you now, we really don't have a clear picture of how it's going to play out and we'll have a much better picture when we talk next in may, and we'll give you, i think, a clearer read at that point. and then last year, yes, we bought high single digits and our growth rate was substantially north of that, right. so as the year played out.
but there are things that drive our growth in electronics. and i think there are factors that are coming together quite nicely as we look out over longer periods, right? certainly, continued waves of investment in consumer electronics. there's a lot of new innovation coming, and we see it, particularly in areas like virtual reality and augmented reality. we see electronics manufacturers beginning to diversify their supply chains outside of china, particularly.
and generally, that's new equipment that we're helping them install in those markets. and then i think a really major trend really links to deep learning and edge learning, which is the desire to replace there are millions of visual inspectors that are working in these markets today where i think covid has made customers particularly sensitive to their vulnerability to large numbers of human inspectors. and as a result, i think we're seeing a lot more interest in applying our technology to help address that vulnerability that they have. so i don't really know how this year is going to shape up.
i have a lot of optimism about our future in electronics, and we'll have a clearer view on this year's kind of capex and timing and spending. we certainly expect to, at least maintain, if not gain share with some of those large consumer electronics customers that we have where we've built such great relationships over time. and you can see one of them referenced as one of our largest customers last year as they have in a number of years.
rob mason -- baird -- analyst
fair enough. thank you.

thank you. the next question is coming from paul chung of j.p. morgan. please go ahead.
paul chung -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
hi, thanks for taking my question. so just on opex, you have a large kind of sequential increase here in the first quarter. but does that opex level kind of stay at that north of $110 million kind of quarterly run rate for the rest of the year? or i think you mentioned some offsets, but how do we think about overall opex levels as we exit '23?
paul todgham -- chief financial officer
yeah. hey, paul. this is paul. again, we don't have full year guidance on that.
but i think our increase of about -- what we said about 10% sequentially, that's driven by a few factors. it's driven by our investment in our emerging customer sales force. it's driven a little bit by just a weaker dollar, which helps us from a revenue perspective but hurts us a bit from an opex perspective, some investments in product launches, and so on. i think this is a decent starting point to sort of model the year.
i think if i were to compare versus a year ago, with this guide, if we're up 10% on average sort of sequentially or approximately 10%. we're up a little less versus q1 2022. but we are expecting to see some of our emerging customer expenses to ramp up a little bit over time. so i could see us being up a little more than like in the sort of 5% to 10% range overall for the year.
again, that's a combination of being very, very disciplined about discretionary expenses and investing in a couple of really important long-term growth initiatives.
paul chung -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
great. that's very helpful. and then just a follow-up on product mix by vertical. so consumer electronics continues to kind of shrink relative to logistics and auto given the growth rates there.
but how do we think about longer-term gross margin impact? i think you mentioned in the past that kind of logistics comes in at slightly relatively lower gross margin. so how do we think about those moving pieces as we kind of model out gross margins longer term? thank you.
paul todgham -- chief financial officer
yeah. i mean i think on a long-term basis, our mid-70s gross margin target is really the right way to think about that. and i expect and hope that you will be able to see that in the second half of this year. by far, the biggest contribution to getting back to that will be the wind-down of the broker buys.
and again, from a new purchase activity, that wind down has already occurred, absent some new crisis emerging, and now it's just a function of how it flows to our p&l in the current quarter we're in and next quarter and ideally, by then, we're mostly through it. the mix between industries, certainly, as logistics remains slightly dilutive to our margins overall. we have some good initiatives including the modular vision tunnel and session some of the standardized solutions that we've spoken about before, and rob spoke about in the prepared remarks. that i think will help on that front.
but overall, the product mix factors and the industry mix factors, i feel like we're quite manageable within our mid-70s target. obviously, as we continue to grow, we get some leverage on our fixed costs that may offset if a disproportionate out of that might be coming from a slightly lower gross margin area.
paul chung -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
great, thank you.
operator
thank you. the next question is coming from matt summerville of d.a. davidson. please go ahead.
matt summerville -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
thanks. so really just have one at this point, rob. just curious about that emerging customer initiative. i guess why now? why not a year ago? why not a year from now? what sort of end markets and applications are you targeting? is this broad from a geographic standpoint? and maybe more importantly, how much does this widen your tam? thank you.
rob willett -- president and chief executive officer
great. yes. thanks for the question. well, why now is because we got the products, right? we've been launching.
we've been developing this edge learning technology, which is really -- and you can see it in our in-sight 2800, and you can see it in the ocr version we just launched, which it really takes -- cognex has kind of been famous in our life for serving the most challenging applications. the most sophisticated companies in the world want to work with us and their engineers on the most difficult machine vision problems and we've shined in that segment. but now, edge learning technology takes a lot of the power of our technology and makes it really available for people who aren't trained automation engineers or vision experts. and that, together with our id products, which are also becoming increasingly easy to use and powerful means we have a vascular products finally that we can put into the hands of relatively inexperienced sales noids that we train and send out to do that.
so that's what this initiative looks like. that's why we're doing it now. certainly, our competitors have some very strong share in those segments of the market, and we're looking forward to sharing our products with those types of customers. they're going to be very broad ranges of customers.
they're going to be customers who work in a lot of -- who manufacture in a lot of different industries who may not have a lot of automation already, may not use machine vision already, and that's -- but are keen to adopt the technology and what it can do for them. so that's kind of how to think about it. geographically, yes, the potential is to deploy very diverse globally around these types of initiatives.
matt summerville -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
thanks. and then rob, if you've mentioned this already, i apologize. but can you maybe talk about -- it sounded like 2022 auto had a record year for you guys, up double-digits constant currency. what's your kind of big picture expectation for auto and ev battery this year particularly with the ongoing cutover to ev? just maybe your overall thoughts on how auto plays out this year versus 2022.
rob willett -- president and chief executive officer
yes. automotive grew in 2022, about 13% in constant currency. and we've seen some good momentum and strong growth potential there. it is ev and ev batteries and the use of more and more electronics in automotive design sensors and entertainment, etc., which is really, i think, driving the use of machine vision that's somewhat offset, but certainly not completely offset by a reduction in internal combustion engine type business, powertrain, which is where most machine vision used to be sold in that segment.
we're feeling optimistic about the long-term growth drivers for that. there will be some pun-intended bumps in the road around the timing of deployment of some of the ev spend, i think, which will lead to some volatility in that. but i think over -- i think we think we're in a pretty good three-year period with what's going on in the industry with our capabilities, the sec acquisition we discussed a lot of drivers, i think, really, again, no pun intended, helping us grow that business over the years to come.
paul todgham -- chief financial officer
yes, if you want a little bit of color kind of by quarter, rob gave some feedback about the slow start to the year more broadly. i will say automotive is a piece of that, right? references to some legislation that are potentially along with pmi, leading to some delays in investment and reshuffling the plans and so on auto would be a piece of that. historically, automotive is one of our less volatile industries quarter on quarter and so on. so i think we think we're off to a slower start this year.
and then if we looked against last year, obviously, q3 was a particularly low quarter for automotive, just given the fire and other factors. so those would be the sort of relevant call it, q1 being low, q3 ideally would be up. so a little more back half optimism.
matt summerville -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
thank you, guys.
operator
thank you. the next question is coming from jairam nathan of daiwa. please go ahead.
jairam nathan -- daiwa securities -- analyst
hi, thanks for taking my question. i just wanted to kind of dig a little deeper on this auto opportunity, especially on the battery side because it seems to be kind of incremental to what you -- what cognex had before, and especially with ira and the shift to u.s. if you kind of compare what you saw in china over the last two years in terms batteries, can you size the opportunity in some way or in a different way? i think in last year, you gave us an addressable market of $1.5 billion in automotive, i believe. is that has -- can that number grow given what we are seeing in ira or what that included the battery opportunity?
rob willett -- president and chief executive officer
yes. i think we talked generally about the size of our automotive market and the long-term growth potential. yes, we sized it at $1.5 billion. and we see estimated long-term market growth of 10%.
i think over -- that's going to cycle up and down over time periods, but i definitely think ev battery investment and the timing about when it comes, is going to and it helped drive higher growth rates for us last year and could -- and i hope to see that again in the years to come. we obviously see great need for our technology in that space. so i think what some of what we've been doing recently, such as the sec acquisition means that we would hope to gain more share in that space and have better and more deployable solutions for customers. so we'll see how that plays out.
we'll see what our competitors come with also. but we're optimistic about that. and then i think you mentioned, and it's another thing that potentially lifts our business here is the ira investment plans from the u.s. government will mean much more investment in the united states, where we just have big share and a great reputation and a lot of experience with u.s.
automotive companies who are obviously putting up the money to do this. so yes, we're optimistic about the space.
jairam nathan -- daiwa securities -- analyst
and just finally, related to that, i think, historically, you guys have talked about how you are more focused on the auto supply base rather than the oems. is that still the case? or do you see some of that changing, especially given the move away from ice?
rob willett -- president and chief executive officer
yes, it's a really interesting question. so yeah, i think historically, we've seen the majority of our automotive business being with tier 1 automotive suppliers. and that dynamic may change over time. you're seeing a lot of kind of joint ventures and relationships between brand names and then big asian technology suppliers.
we see that playing out in partnerships. and then you see also pure-play companies that are really going to business to manufacture batteries. so certainly, there's plenty of change going on in that space. but quite where that ends up, i wouldn't claim to know.
we tend to look at applications and needs and often those are driven by the end users themselves and how they're executed can be through third parties. like tier 1s or in partnership between end user brands and tier 1s. so yes, it's an evolving space. one, i look forward to talking with you about in the future.
jairam nathan -- daiwa securities -- analyst
ok, thank you. thanks a lot.

operator
greetings, and welcome to the cognex fourth quarter 2022 earnings conference call. at this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. a brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [operator instructions] as a reminder, this conference is being recorded.
it is now my pleasure to introduce your host, nathan mccurren, head of investor relations. thank you. please go ahead.
nathan mccurren -- head of investor relations
thank you, donna. good evening, everyone, and thank you for joining us. with me on today's call are rob willett, cognex's president and ceo; and paul todgham, our cfo. our results were released earlier today.
the press release and annual report on form 10-k are available on the investor relations section of our website. both the press release and our call today will reference non-gaap measures. you can see a reconciliation of certain items from gaap to non-gaap in exhibit 2 of the press release. any forward-looking statements we made in the earnings release or any that we may make during this call are based upon information that we believe to be true as of today.
our actual results may differ materially from our projections due to risks and uncertainties that are described in our sec filings, including our most recent form 10-k filed tonight for 2022. with that, i'll turn the call over to rob. 
rob willett -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, nathan. hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us. we continue to navigate a challenging environment. our fourth quarter results were largely in line with our guidance but are not representative of our long-term growth expectations.
the focus of my remarks today will be on the near-term challenges we're facing, and then on the reasons why we remain excited and confident in our long-term growth opportunities. our largest challenge within our logistics business, we continue to see a post-pandemic slowdown with a few of our largest e-commerce customers who have temporarily reduced their investments to absorb excess capacity. looking beyond this temporary pause, we continue to expect logistics to be our highest growth end market over the mid to long term. we also saw lower new business activity in the quarter.
bookings were below our expectations and generated less revenue in quarter than is typical. despite these challenges, revenue increased on a constant-currency basis by 1% for the full year compared to 2021, a year where we reported strong growth of 28%. outside of logistics, revenue from the remainder of our end markets grew in 2022 roughly in line on a constant-currency basis with what we would expect over the long term. as our history demonstrates, we can experience periods of softness in between periods of robust growth.
our revenue growth target of 15% is a multiyear annual target. with that lens revenue of over $1 billion in 2022 represented double-digit annual growth compared to 2020 and 2019. gross margin is 71% in q4 and 72% for the full year, which was in line with our latest expectations. margins in both periods were below our long-term target mid-70 % level due to the elevated purchase of scarce components through brokers.
before i go into detail on our end markets and an outlook for q1, i'd like to turn it over to paul to walk you through more of the results.
paul todgham -- chief financial officer
thank you, rob, and hello, everyone. revenue was $239 million in q4, a 2% decline year on year or an increase of 4% on a constant-currency basis. this includes the approximately $20 million catch-up from deliveries that were delayed in q3 following the fire. in addition to the slowness with a few large e-commerce customers throughout the quarter and slower business activity more broadly at the end of the year, foreign currency translation lowered revenue by $45 million or 4% in 2022 and by 6% in the fourth quarter.
looking at the change in revenue for q4 from a geographic perspective, each primary region grew year on year on a constant-currency basis. asia increased by 9%, excluding an 11 percentage point reduction from currency exchange rates. revenue growth from semi and automotive more than offset softness from the challenging environment in china. revenue from europe increased by 4% excluding an 11 percentage point reduction from currency exchange rates.
growth was led by revenue from automotive and consumer electronics that offset a decline in logistics. in the americas, revenue grew by 1% year on year. lower investments by a few large customers and logistics were offset by growth in automotive, consumer electronics, food and beverage, and medical-related industries among others. gross margin was 71% in q4 compared to 72% in q4 of 2021 and 73% in q3.
the decline from q3 is due to the significant premiums we've been paying to replenish component inventory destroyed in the fire. these purchases negatively impacted gross margin by approximately 500 basis points in the quarter and approximately 400 basis points for the year. we are pleased our broker buy activity is winding down, now that we've replenished post-fire and the supply environment has improved. we expect it will take a couple of quarters for the higher-priced components to work their way through the p&l, resulting in a minimal impact by the second half of 2023.
moving on to operating expenses. our reported operating expenses included a fire loss in both q3 and q4 of 2022 and a modest restructuring charge in q4. excluding these charges, q4 operating expenses increased by 3% from q3. comparing year on year, operating expenses decreased by mid-single digits, primarily due to the favorable impact of currency exchange rates and lower incentive compensation.
these benefits were partially offset by the incremental investments we've been making in sales and engineering headcount. operating margin on a gaap basis was 23% in q4. non-gaap operating margin was 24% in q4, an improvement from 23% in q4 of 2021 and 20% in q3. this level of profitability is below our 30% long-term target due to lower gross margin and operating deleverage from revenue softness.
the effective tax rate excluding discrete tax items was 22% in q4 and 16% for the full year. reported earnings were $0.32 per share in q4. non-gaap earnings per share were $0.27 in q4 compared with $0.30 in q4 of 2021 and $0.21 in q3, excluding the one-time charges mentioned earlier in tax adjustments. turning to the balance sheet.
cognex continues to have a strong cash position with $854 million in cash and investments and no debt. the strength of our balance sheet enabled us to aggressively replenish components lost in the june fire. as a result, we caught up on customer deliveries quickly during the second half of the year and ended 2022 in a healthy inventory position. during the year, we also had a substantial return of capital to shareholders with over $200 million of share repurchase activity and more than $45 million of dividends paid.
now, i'll turn it back over to rob for color on our end markets and on our outlook.
rob willett -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, paul. i would like to now give a little historical context. you may remember, we went through a restructuring in 2020. as part of that action, we reorganized our r&d and engineering teams.
these teams is focused on groundbreaking edge learning technology and standard product architectures that can deploy on innovations more efficiently and at a faster rate. as a result of these improvements, we now have many new products coming to market in 2023. recent product launches include our new dataman 580. this fixed-mount barcode reader is designed for five and six-sided cognex modular vision tunnels for use in the most demanding logistics applications.
pairing this product with cognex 3d vision systems helps logistics customers to apply a label on a package in a spot that does not cover other information on that package, a surprisingly difficult task to automate. this results in optimizing processes by increasing line speeds and traceability without lowering read rates. in another product launch, we expanded the capabilities of our in-sight 2800 vision system to include deep learning-enabled optical character recognition. this allows customers to deploy powerful ai-based ocr technology regardless of their skill level.
prior industry solutions required hours of programming by highly trained engineers preventing many companies from automating this type of inspection. now, models can be set up and deployed directly on the device in minutes, with this view as 10 sample images. food and beverage manufacturers will be able to easily read expiration dates, even on curved metal surfaces. electric vehicle manufacturers can quickly locate and read the alphanumeric text etched on the bottom side of ev batteries for traceability.
and logistics businesses can decipher codes and text on a variety of package types to ensure proper routing and prevent rework. we believe these products and many others planned for 2023 launch position us to broaden the market we serve and capture more share. with that, let's jump into more detail about what we're seeing in each of our end markets. our largest end market in 2022 was automotive, which represented approximately 25% of our revenue.
we reported record revenue from automotive and double-digit growth year on year in constant currency. this is primarily driven by the increase in electronic components in vehicles and the ongoing transition to electric vehicles. the transition to electric vehicles has generated an increase in new model introductions and demand for ev batteries. we have strong relationships with the major ev battery manufacturers who projected continued growth within asia and new growth in the americas and europe.
in the fourth quarter, we acquired sirius advanced cybernetics gmbh, or sac, a german computational lighting company. combining sac's capabilities with cognex's vision and ai tools equips us with an industry leading offering for battery inspection. the sac acquisition will support our strategy to capture a larger share of the high-growth battery inspection market. moving on to logistics.
logistics represented approximately 20% of our total revenue in 2022. after over 60% growth in logistics in 2021, annual revenue from logistics contracted by 25% in 2022. aside from the few large e-commerce customers who reduced investment, revenue from the remainder of our logistics business grew both in the quarter and year. we believe logistics will continue to be an important growth driver for us over the long term.
the market is still in the early stages of adopting machine vision. most companies are still highly reliant on labor and very few warehouses globally are realizing the full potential of automation. an example of the type of opportunities that exist in logistics is a recent win with a fortune 50 retailer that was previously a relatively small customer of ours. in 2022, we deepened our relationship with this company, who had previously announced a multibillion-dollar investment to enhance its shopping experience.
they're establishing regional sortation centers and converting in-store stock rooms into sortation centers to pack and ship orders direct to consumers. cognex was chosen to provide machine vision because of our best-in-class algorithms that can reliably read barcodes at angles. our tunnel solution enabled our customer to increase the number of products on a high-speed conveyor by reducing the gaps between them while still reading barcodes at near-perfect read rates. after initial wins and excellent execution support that customers asked cognex to add value in additional areas, such as converting manual operations to automated tunnels to offset labor shortages and costs in existing regional distribution centers.
shifting to consumer electronics. our third largest end market in 2022, representing approximately 20% of revenue, consumer electronics grew in the mid-teens year on year on a constant-currency basis. growth was primarily driven by the premium end of the smartphone market with an additional contribution from other consumer electronics products, such as tablets and accessories. we had particularly strong demand for our deep learning and 3d solutions in this market.
turning now to our outlook. we expect revenue in the first quarter will be between $180 million and $200 million, which represents a meaningful stepdown year on year. you may recall that the first quarter of '22 was an exceptionally strong one for us as we reported an unusual sequential increase in revenue, led by our second highest quarter ever for logistics. we had strong demand broadly across our business, even from consumer electronics, which is typically quiet in q1.
we also caught up on $20 million of orders in backlog caused by supply chain delays in the fourth quarter of 2021. in contrast, new business activity at the end of 2022 was slower than we anticipated and we've had a slow start to 2023. lower activity with our largest logistics customers continues, and we're also seeing a broader slowdown across many of our end markets as customers are wary of committing to significant investment. we believe gross margin in q1 will remain in the low 70% range.
the supply environment has improved and our broker buy activity has wound down, but the impact of what we've already purchased will take a couple of quarters to flow through our p&l. we expect operating expenses in q1 will increase by approximately 10% on a sequential basis, excluding the charges related to restructuring and the fire in q4. this increase is driven by investments we are making in our new emerging customer sales force, along with merit increases and a weaker u.s. dollar.
throughout 2023, we expect to see a ramp-down in the impact of broker buys and a ramp-up in our emerging customer sales force investment. from an operating margin standpoint for the year, we expect these two drivers to roughly offset. we expect the emerging customer initiative to broaden our reach, increase penetration, and further diversify our customer base. representing potentially hundreds of thousands of businesses, this custom segment is looking for automation solutions that are easy to implement, easy to use, and provide the highest performance.
our newest edge learning and id products position us well for this initiative. to directly reach these customers, we're expanding our sales force. we've already hired the initial sales noise focused on this segment. we will onboard and train more in the quarters ahead.
we expect costs from this initiative to ramp through the first three quarters of this year. while our continued investment during a slower growth period will result in near-term operating deleverage, we believe it's an important initiative for long-term growth. we remain committed to tightly managing operating costs in this environment, and we also believe it's important to continue to invest in high roi initiatives. we're excited our long-term growth prospects though timing is uncertain, we expect large e-commerce customers to shift back into investment mode, ev battery growth to continue, china to more meaningfully reopen and our emerging customer initiative to start to deliver.
i'm proud of how cognoids responded in a year with many challenges. it gives me even more confidence in having the right team to deliver strong growth and new customer value together in the years to come. now we will open the call for questions. operator, please go ahead.
",":
operator
thank you. the floor is now open for questions. [operator instructions] we do ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up, but you may rejoin the queue for any additional questions that you have. our first question today is coming from josh pokrzywinski of morgan stanley.
please go ahead.
josh pokrzywinski -- morgan stanley -- analyst
hi, good evening, all.
rob willett -- president and chief executive officer
hi, josh.
josh pokrzywinski -- morgan stanley -- analyst
just first question on sort of the 1q guide. i know that we've gone through a decent amount of, call it, off-cycle revenue volatility with the fire and some of the supply chain stuff and the catch-up on the other side, backlog position in e-commerce. but should we think of 1q was kind of representing normal seasonality without any kind of unusual big items as we think about the rest of the year? i know you don't give guidance, but just trying to make sure there's no other kind of noise in there.
rob willett -- president and chief executive officer
right, yes. so, q1 is looking slow. we've seen slow periods like this before and we've come out of them and delivered meaningful growth. i think you know that our business inflects quickly and it's not kind of backlog driven as some of our peers are.
and additionally, we're comparing to what is a particularly tough q1, given last year's unusually high revenue from logistics and other markets. but i think it's also fair to say that we see lower pmi data across all of the regions that we serve in our regular business, and that's certainly reflected in the activity that we're seeing, which is at a lower rate than we were expecting a few months ago. and then, of course, as i think i've explained quite a lot, the logistics business is really at a very low level. really as a result of the large customers really pulling back on e-commerce spending.
so that's the kind of color that we're looking at. for those of you who have followed cognex for a long time, we know that historically, q1 was always our lowest quarter. that somewhat got changed with large logistics orders coming in or sometimes high consumer electronics business in q1, but this looks like a quarter without any of that.
josh pokrzywinski -- morgan stanley -- analyst
got it. that's helpful. i appreciate that color. and then just thinking about something you said in the prepared remarks there, i want to make sure i understand better.
a reduction in broker buys through the year, which sounds like a good guy. and then you mentioned a ramp in some of these target investment customers -- sorry, i get the exact phrasing wrong. but both of those sound good? or are you saying it's a ramp in the expense to develop that sales force, that product capability? is it a ramp in the expense or that customer revenue?
paul todgham -- chief financial officer
it's a ramp in the expense, josh. this is paul. so, the way to think about this is, we had about 400 basis points of broker buy impact to gross margin in our 2022 results. so, think of it is around $40 million or so, $0.5 billion of revenue.
we're expecting to see roughly a $25 million to $30 million reduction in that expense this year, ramping up over time. we still expect in the first quarter to have reflected in our low-70s gross margin about 300 basis point to 400 basis point impact of broker buys. but we should see a $25 million to $30 million investment -- savings to gross margin from broker buys and that's roughly comparable to the level of investment we expect to make in our emerging customer initiative in opex. so it's an increase over -- ramping up over the first three quarters.
so there are some of that reflected in our q1 opex guidance, which is why we see the sequential -- one part of the sequential opex increase from q4, but we'll expect to see more of that in q2 and q3.
josh pokrzywinski -- morgan stanley -- analyst
crystal clear. thanks, paul.
operator
thank you. the next question is coming from joe ritchie of goldman sachs. please go ahead.
joe ritchie -- goldman sachs -- analyst
thanks. good afternoon, everybody.
rob willett -- president and chief executive officer
hi, joe.
joe ritchie -- goldman sachs -- analyst
hey. so, i wanted to touch on the logistics commentary a little bit further. so, as you kind of think about the rest of the year, clearly, there is volatility throughout the year in 2022. it sounds to me like things have kind of worsened and so, while logistics might have been down 25% for the year is probably down a lot more maybe in the fourth quarter.
i'm just trying to understand going forward, where would you expect logistics, particularly the bottom just based on what you see in the conversations that you're having with your customers.
rob willett -- president and chief executive officer
so, yes, so logistics represent about 20% of revenue in 2022, approximately $225 million, and it was our second largest market, right? and it contracted. and we saw that contraction kind of increases we earn through the year was relatively strong in the first half. and then i think it's really a story of two different customer types. we've got regular logistics customers who are growing nicely, and we expect those to continue to grow, little less than half of that overall logistics business roughly.
and then we've got large customers, very few of them, some of them pretty famous businesses, and they've all really overinvested for a period through covid and then now have really reined in investments. some of them are going through restructuring. and that's going on right now and we expect they'll emerge from that. and then as we get through the year, they'll start to invest again.
that may not happen until late in the year or even next year, right? but we do expect to see more investment going on. but even at those customers, there's still significant work that goes on with kind of productivity improvements, regular business, regular automation projects. so that's not like that business has gone away completely. but certainly, a lot of the greenfields, really all of the greenfields for some of these bigger customers have been stopped or significantly delayed.
so that's really the state of play.
paul todgham -- chief financial officer
and, joe, to your question about quarterly versus annual growth rates and so on, again, we don't consistently provide data on each end market by quarter. but i think we did call out in the q3 earnings that was a -- q3 2022 was a particularly unfavorable comparison. it was very low for logistics in 2022, and that was i think our highest ever logistics quarter in q1 of 2023. so certainly, that quarter was difficult.
in q4, our growth rate or contraction in logistics was pretty comparable to the year on year. and then i would say we're up against another tough compare in q1. q1 was the biggest logistics quarter of 2022. and then, obviously, there were some announcements about pauses in new capacity expansion and so on that muted our logistics revenue from q2 to q4 last year.
joe ritchie -- goldman sachs -- analyst
got it. that's super helpful. if i could ask just one more. it is interesting, it was very helpful to get the color on the 2022 baseline, right, for the three biggest end markets.
i feel bad asking for like the fourth but i'm curious, as like one of the end markets maybe just emerged and now is like a sizable percentage of your business as well. and if you maybe want to provide -- i don't know if it's in like food and beverage or consumer products or semis, but just provide some color around that end market and what your expectation is for 2023?
rob willett -- president and chief executive officer
well, yeah, joe, i think we talked about our big end markets, right, consumer electronics, automotive being largest consumer electronics and logistics. and then other markets for cognex are pretty broad, and they include medical-related industries, consumer products, food and beverage, product security. so i think if i'm understanding your question correctly, you're really asking about those kind of markets in general. they provide good solid growth for us in line with our overall growth expectations.
and there's variation among those markets. but generally, they continue to grow much in the way the rest of the business does. but let me ask for clarification. were you asking about a specific market or something?
joe ritchie -- goldman sachs -- analyst
yeah. i was just wondering whether one of the end markets has grown to be more substantial than the others. and what's really been driving that? it sounds like you're pretty well diversified behind the big three.
rob willett -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. i mean we've got some nice growth drivers. i could talk at length about life sciences and some of what we're seeing in those spaces and food and beverage. but i don't think that's really going to -- moving the needle in terms of our results in a significant way currently.
paul todgham -- chief financial officer
and i think we've spoken to this before, but obviously, over the last couple of years, semiconductor has -- which is generally small for us, kind of might have been 5% of our business two or three years ago and still below 10%, but it certainly has experienced quite robust growth. so obviously, we're seeing some cyclicality there. we are starting to grow medical-related overall is about 10% of our business, which we discussed at analyst day. but generally speaking, yeah, the trends across that diverse range of our business with the exclusion of kind of semi, which is more volatile, i would say, have been fairly consistent.
rob willett -- president and chief executive officer
and building on that, i think the medical business is growing nicely and steadily. and the semi business has had a great run. and i think we're into a slower period as many semiconductor companies are reporting as we look at 2023.
joe ritchie -- goldman sachs -- analyst
ok. thank you for the color.
operator
thank you. the next question is coming from joe giordano of cowen. please go ahead.
joe giordano -- cowen and company -- analyst
hey, guys.
rob willett -- president and chief executive officer
hey, joe.
joe giordano -- cowen and company -- analyst
i wanted to just follow up on logistics a little bit. obviously, it's not surprising to hear the commentary about the large players. and i think most people appreciate that the outside of those mega players kind of like ground floor logistics is much stronger. but rob, you talked about the declining globally.
when does that start to impact that group of customers? is it likely that pmi is trending lower below 50, that logistics or even for those people who are behind, but are they still going to reflect the economic cycle and likely decline in that sort of environment?
rob willett -- president and chief executive officer
right. so, joe, i think your question is how is sort of lower pmi affecting our base logistics business is that that's what you're getting at?
joe giordano -- cowen and company -- analyst
yes.
rob willett -- president and chief executive officer
yes. yes. we have really strong underlying technology and growth trends in our base logistics business, and we still have a relatively low share and a lot of great growth drivers. so i would say that as we're looking at that business, we're expecting good strong growth from it as we look forward.
but it's not immune either to pmi activities. so we do see customers more tentative about placing orders longer cycles to close business, etc., in that space, too. but the underlying growth prospects are very good, i think, really regardless of kind of the kind of pmi data, we're seeing now, although it will slow it down a little bit.
paul todgham -- chief financial officer
yes. i mean a good number of those customers delayed some investments early in covid and are just now, i can speak to my former employer, for just getting back to -- put those plans back in place. and potentially again depending on the consumer exposure they have. in many cases, the consumer data is a little more robust than the manufacturing production data we've seen.
so i think in a low pmi environment, we might see a higher percent of projects delayed, but generally, the investment cycles of building a new distribution center and so on tend to transcend a shorter-term economic cycle.
rob willett -- president and chief executive officer
and then i would say, as we look at that business, too, we really have so much opportunity to grow our business in europe and asia where we have still low share and a lot of competitive advantage. so certainly, we're expecting outsized and seeing outsized growth in those areas of our business.
joe giordano -- cowen and company -- analyst
ok. so just is it fair to say that that base business and logistics in the environment that we're in right now, you'd still expect it to grow? i mean things can obviously change between now and the end of the year. but given where things are, that would be a fair statement to make.
rob willett -- president and chief executive officer
yes.
joe giordano -- cowen and company -- analyst
ok. and then my follow-up would be on the emerging customer stuff that you're doing. where are you on the actual products? like i know you're talking about developing like smart sensors and things that are easier to use and kind of like a different type of product than you've done historically. so i know you're ramping up the cognoids and getting the sales organization ready to support this, but where are you on the products themselves?
rob willett -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. right now, we have a good range of very, very competitive products for emerging customer sales noise to sell, right? and there are more coming. but we're out in the field, and they are very well equipped to close a lot of business that they see at these small customers.
joe giordano -- cowen and company -- analyst
i'll pass it on. thanks, guys.
operator
thank you. the next question is coming from guy hardwick of credit suisse. please go ahead.
guy hardwick -- credit suisse -- analyst
hi, good afternoon.
rob willett -- president and chief executive officer
hello.
guy hardwick -- credit suisse -- analyst
i know you gave a -- in your preamble, you referred to a slow start to the year. obviously, logistics is well known, and you also referenced the semiconductor end market. are there any other markets which are showing weakness? could you expand a little bit on that?
rob willett -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. i think broadness is -- i think weakness is pretty broad in general as you described and as witnessed in pmi data overall. i think if there's anything else that i would -- well, if there are some other things broad themes i'd draw, one is, obviously, at the start of the year, we're still seeing covid-related disruption in china, right? and i think, obviously, rising interest rates creating challenges in approving capital. and really, a lot of our business is driven by capital spend, right? and then i think there's a couple of regulatory things i would call out.
so the inflation reduction act, it's going to drive a lot of ev battery investment in the united states. and it's going to draw some of that investment away from asia and europe. so we're seeing projects that we were expecting to be winning and installing in europe or in asia have been delayed because they're moving into america. so that's going on.
and a somewhat similar dynamic with the chips act restricting exports to china is causing some changes among those customers where, i think, near term, they will be spending less. long term, i expect them to be equipping more facilities outside of china. so that's causing some delays also.
guy hardwick -- credit suisse -- analyst
so just as a follow-up, if tier 1 logistics capex comes back in 2024, i mean, what are your logistics partner integrators telling you do discussions on projects have to start really by the middle of this year have any impact in 2024, given typically 18-month lead times?
rob willett -- president and chief executive officer
yes, you're right. was there a question there? i mean, generally --
guy hardwick -- credit suisse -- analyst
what are your partner integrators telling you in terms of potential outlook longer term? if you want to return back to the logistics growth that you referenced at the investor day, you've got to have kind of recovery in 2024.
rob willett -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. so i think maybe one thing to understand is for those big customers, we do directly with the company itself, right? and we're working often with their engineers on implementing their technology plans and their rollout. and then we think of integrators really has more capacity to help execute their plans, right? so we see we're in a dry period. it's not clear to us exactly when it comes back, certainly not in this first half.
and i think beyond that, we'll share more information when we have something more solid and meaningful this year. we think it will come back. we think we're optimistic about that. but the timing of it, is it second half? is it 2024? we're not clear ourselves on that.
and i don't think our customers necessarily are clear on that either.
guy hardwick -- credit suisse -- analyst
ok. thank you.
operator
thank you. the next question is coming from jacob levinson of melius research. please go ahead.
jacob levinson -- melius research -- analyst
hi. good evening, everyone.
rob willett -- president and chief executive officer
good evening.
jacob levinson -- melius research -- analyst
just on this acquisition, sac that you did in the quarter sounds pretty interesting. but can you help us understand a little bit about how that -- what the differentiation is, what the technology that they're really doing and, i guess, why is that so important in battery inspection process in particular?
rob willett -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. yeah. thank you. i appreciate the question.
so something that goes on in machine vision is you acquire an image, right? and then you use vision tools to decode and make sense of that image, right? and cognex, i think, is undisputed in our ability to make sense of and to interpret images, and particularly with our deep learning technology, we really have phenomenal capabilities in that area. but image acquisition is something where we felt we really wanted to do better relative to our competitors. and we saw a big need in this market to do that. the company, sac, that we've acquired is really a leader in this area of computational lighting or computational optics.
and what that technology does is it -- think of it like a dome of light that sits on top of an image that's being analyzed. and there are leds that are lit up in a very controlled and specific way using very sophisticated software to create almost like a 3d image of what's underneath them. and in this case, it very often is illuminating dense and scratches on the surface that's being analyzed. they can do it very quickly and almost with 3d-type capability.
and this technology is better at doing that than any other that we've seen in the market so far. and what is that going to allow us to do, it's going to help us serve some really important needs in battery production, in ev battery production. and looking at material like even just take the outside of a cylindrical battery that is pretty widely used and widely out there in the world of ev. dense and scratches can cause fire and other problems and have done, right? so it's a very hot topic for sure.
as companies are rolling out new ev battery technology and they're building billions of dollars of manufacturing capability, this is a technology we think will be highly prized and will help us drive growth in years to come in that space. so that's a little bit of an overview.
jacob levinson -- melius research -- analyst
super interesting. and just one for paul quickly. i know you guys prior to the fire in indonesia that we're embarking on a supply chain diversification plan for lack of a better description, but maybe you can just update us on what you've been able to qualify some other contract suppliers or manufacturers rather?
paul todgham -- chief financial officer
yes, sure. thanks, jacob. i think we've reflected in our previous qs and in this k. really, since 2021, we've been bringing online a second contract manufacturer, as well as a couple of sites for our primary contract manufacturer.
and we're making good progress there. the second manufacturer is producing at this point in q1. so we're happy with that and has the capacity to do quite a bit more, and we'll continue to ramp that up over this year. so this will be a journey.
it is a progress, but i think we are headed in the right direction, as well as there are broader efforts to diversify some of our supply chain risk, including distribution centers, we move to a much larger distribution center in the americas, for instance, earlier in 2022 and looking at potential opportunities globally for distribution and warehousing.
jacob levinson -- melius research -- analyst
perfect. good luck in '23, guys. thank you.
operator
thank you. the next question is coming from jim ricchiuti of needham. please go ahead.
jim ricchiuti -- needham and company -- analyst
all right. thank you. you've given some commentary, some color around many of the end markets. and rob, i'm wondering if you would maybe talk a little bit more about your expectations for automotive.
you've got some puts and takes. obviously, the ev market still seems like it's fairly healthy. what's your sense as you look at the automotive part of your business this year?
rob willett -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. i think we're pretty optimistic about the automotive market overall. i mean, revenue from automotive in 2022 grew 13% in constant currency, which is above what we expect for that market over the long term. and we do see a lot of multiyear investment in new capacity, particularly ev battery, manufacturing capacity getting teed up, right? and we also see more of that investment going into the united states.
i mean we're a very, very strong share and a very, very strong team able to execute on the needs of those companies. and then we have the sac acquisition that i mentioned, which brings a really powerful tool to bear into what is a very difficult manufacturing problem. and our deep learning capabilities in general and our edge learning tools really, i think, are going to be very valuable in those applications. so yeah, i think we remain pretty optimistic about the outlook for automotive over the coming quarters and years.
jim ricchiuti -- needham and company -- analyst
and i know that you don't normally have a lot of color on the consumer electronics market. the question i had more in that area is around the reports that we've all been seeing about more production, consumer electronics shifting to places like india including for applications around smartphones. first of all, are you seeing any signs of that? and how soon -- how far out if that were actually occurring and is it going, would you see orders as that capacity gets built out in places like that?
rob willett -- president and chief executive officer
i think some major smartphone manufacturers are on a multiyear journey to diversify their manufacturing footprint. and i think various recent -- various things that have been going on in the world are certainly continuing to drive that kind of sentiment. for sure, production is being moved to other markets such as india and vietnam, and we've been seeing that over a number of years, and it's definitely continuing and gathering pace. and yes, we are certainly receiving orders and doing business for a business that historically might have been done in china or is now being done in india.jim ricchiutiok.
thank you.
operator
thank you. the next question is coming from rob mason of baird. please go ahead.
rob mason -- baird -- analyst
yes, good evening. i have a question about --
rob willett -- president and chief executive officer
hi, rob.
rob mason -- baird -- analyst
good evening. i had a question about the buildout of the emerging customer sales force. if you think about at the end of this year or maybe even over the course of the next two years, what percent of your sales headcount would you expect that sales force to comprise?
rob willett -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, i do think we're going to get that information just for competitive reasons. we have competitors in this space that are very tight-lipped about their own investments, etc. but certainly, if you do the math on kind of what paul told us about investment, it's going to be a significant number of heads we would expect to add this year and train and put into the field. and then i could see this as being an initiative that's going to build, really deliver for us over many, many years as our products get better for that market and our sales force becomes more established.
maybe there's another kind of trend or data point i'd point to is like certainly plus years ago when we were talking, and about 50% of our business was going through distribution, right? but as our products have got more powerful and easier to implement and our business has got bigger, it's really 70% of our business now is direct and only 30% through distribution. so certainly, we recognize that continued growth is going to mean continued end-user direct sales headcount. and that's a path we're on and we'll continue to be on.
rob mason -- baird -- analyst
i see. ok. and then just as a follow-up, maybe going a little bit the last questioner, but just around consumer electronics. and again, i know you don't have great visibility at this point in the year.
but just sizing up the year that you just had, which i think played out better overall than maybe you were thinking at the outset of the year. are you seeing anything, any indications that would support, i guess, growth this year, just given the typical cadence that that business often is on? or is there anything that you would call out that we should think about as we try to model out 2023?
rob willett -- president and chief executive officer
rob, i think you're right in the characterization of last year. we as normal last year, as i'll tell you now, we really don't have a clear picture of how it's going to play out and we'll have a much better picture when we talk next in may, and we'll give you, i think, a clearer read at that point. and then last year, yes, we bought high single digits and our growth rate was substantially north of that, right. so as the year played out.
but there are things that drive our growth in electronics. and i think there are factors that are coming together quite nicely as we look out over longer periods, right? certainly, continued waves of investment in consumer electronics. there's a lot of new innovation coming, and we see it, particularly in areas like virtual reality and augmented reality. we see electronics manufacturers beginning to diversify their supply chains outside of china, particularly.
and generally, that's new equipment that we're helping them install in those markets. and then i think a really major trend really links to deep learning and edge learning, which is the desire to replace there are millions of visual inspectors that are working in these markets today where i think covid has made customers particularly sensitive to their vulnerability to large numbers of human inspectors. and as a result, i think we're seeing a lot more interest in applying our technology to help address that vulnerability that they have. so i don't really know how this year is going to shape up.
i have a lot of optimism about our future in electronics, and we'll have a clearer view on this year's kind of capex and timing and spending. we certainly expect to, at least maintain, if not gain share with some of those large consumer electronics customers that we have where we've built such great relationships over time. and you can see one of them referenced as one of our largest customers last year as they have in a number of years.
rob mason -- baird -- analyst
fair enough. thank you.
operator
thank you. the next question is coming from paul chung of j.p. morgan. please go ahead.
paul chung -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
hi, thanks for taking my question. so just on opex, you have a large kind of sequential increase here in the first quarter. but does that opex level kind of stay at that north of $110 million kind of quarterly run rate for the rest of the year? or i think you mentioned some offsets, but how do we think about overall opex levels as we exit '23?
paul todgham -- chief financial officer
yeah. hey, paul. this is paul. again, we don't have full year guidance on that.
but i think our increase of about -- what we said about 10% sequentially, that's driven by a few factors. it's driven by our investment in our emerging customer sales force. it's driven a little bit by just a weaker dollar, which helps us from a revenue perspective but hurts us a bit from an opex perspective, some investments in product launches, and so on. i think this is a decent starting point to sort of model the year.
i think if i were to compare versus a year ago, with this guide, if we're up 10% on average sort of sequentially or approximately 10%. we're up a little less versus q1 2022. but we are expecting to see some of our emerging customer expenses to ramp up a little bit over time. so i could see us being up a little more than like in the sort of 5% to 10% range overall for the year.
again, that's a combination of being very, very disciplined about discretionary expenses and investing in a couple of really important long-term growth initiatives.
paul chung -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
great. that's very helpful. and then just a follow-up on product mix by vertical. so consumer electronics continues to kind of shrink relative to logistics and auto given the growth rates there.
but how do we think about longer-term gross margin impact? i think you mentioned in the past that kind of logistics comes in at slightly relatively lower gross margin. so how do we think about those moving pieces as we kind of model out gross margins longer term? thank you.
paul todgham -- chief financial officer
yeah. i mean i think on a long-term basis, our mid-70s gross margin target is really the right way to think about that. and i expect and hope that you will be able to see that in the second half of this year. by far, the biggest contribution to getting back to that will be the wind-down of the broker buys.
and again, from a new purchase activity, that wind down has already occurred, absent some new crisis emerging, and now it's just a function of how it flows to our p&l in the current quarter we're in and next quarter and ideally, by then, we're mostly through it. the mix between industries, certainly, as logistics remains slightly dilutive to our margins overall. we have some good initiatives including the modular vision tunnel and session some of the standardized solutions that we've spoken about before, and rob spoke about in the prepared remarks. that i think will help on that front.
but overall, the product mix factors and the industry mix factors, i feel like we're quite manageable within our mid-70s target. obviously, as we continue to grow, we get some leverage on our fixed costs that may offset if a disproportionate out of that might be coming from a slightly lower gross margin area.
paul chung -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
great, thank you.
operator
thank you. the next question is coming from matt summerville of d.a. davidson. please go ahead.
matt summerville -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
thanks. so really just have one at this point, rob. just curious about that emerging customer initiative. i guess why now? why not a year ago? why not a year from now? what sort of end markets and applications are you targeting? is this broad from a geographic standpoint? and maybe more importantly, how much does this widen your tam? thank you.
rob willett -- president and chief executive officer
great. yes. thanks for the question. well, why now is because we got the products, right? we've been launching.
we've been developing this edge learning technology, which is really -- and you can see it in our in-sight 2800, and you can see it in the ocr version we just launched, which it really takes -- cognex has kind of been famous in our life for serving the most challenging applications. the most sophisticated companies in the world want to work with us and their engineers on the most difficult machine vision problems and we've shined in that segment. but now, edge learning technology takes a lot of the power of our technology and makes it really available for people who aren't trained automation engineers or vision experts. and that, together with our id products, which are also becoming increasingly easy to use and powerful means we have a vascular products finally that we can put into the hands of relatively inexperienced sales noids that we train and send out to do that.
so that's what this initiative looks like. that's why we're doing it now. certainly, our competitors have some very strong share in those segments of the market, and we're looking forward to sharing our products with those types of customers. they're going to be very broad ranges of customers.
they're going to be customers who work in a lot of -- who manufacture in a lot of different industries who may not have a lot of automation already, may not use machine vision already, and that's -- but are keen to adopt the technology and what it can do for them. so that's kind of how to think about it. geographically, yes, the potential is to deploy very diverse globally around these types of initiatives.
matt summerville -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
thanks. and then rob, if you've mentioned this already, i apologize. but can you maybe talk about -- it sounded like 2022 auto had a record year for you guys, up double-digits constant currency. what's your kind of big picture expectation for auto and ev battery this year particularly with the ongoing cutover to ev? just maybe your overall thoughts on how auto plays out this year versus 2022.
rob willett -- president and chief executive officer
yes. automotive grew in 2022, about 13% in constant currency. and we've seen some good momentum and strong growth potential there. it is ev and ev batteries and the use of more and more electronics in automotive design sensors and entertainment, etc., which is really, i think, driving the use of machine vision that's somewhat offset, but certainly not completely offset by a reduction in internal combustion engine type business, powertrain, which is where most machine vision used to be sold in that segment.
we're feeling optimistic about the long-term growth drivers for that. there will be some pun-intended bumps in the road around the timing of deployment of some of the ev spend, i think, which will lead to some volatility in that. but i think over -- i think we think we're in a pretty good three-year period with what's going on in the industry with our capabilities, the sec acquisition we discussed a lot of drivers, i think, really, again, no pun intended, helping us grow that business over the years to come.
paul todgham -- chief financial officer
yes, if you want a little bit of color kind of by quarter, rob gave some feedback about the slow start to the year more broadly. i will say automotive is a piece of that, right? references to some legislation that are potentially along with pmi, leading to some delays in investment and reshuffling the plans and so on auto would be a piece of that. historically, automotive is one of our less volatile industries quarter on quarter and so on. so i think we think we're off to a slower start this year.
and then if we looked against last year, obviously, q3 was a particularly low quarter for automotive, just given the fire and other factors. so those would be the sort of relevant call it, q1 being low, q3 ideally would be up. so a little more back half optimism.
matt summerville -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
thank you, guys.
operator
thank you. the next question is coming from jairam nathan of daiwa. please go ahead.
jairam nathan -- daiwa securities -- analyst
hi, thanks for taking my question. i just wanted to kind of dig a little deeper on this auto opportunity, especially on the battery side because it seems to be kind of incremental to what you -- what cognex had before, and especially with ira and the shift to u.s. if you kind of compare what you saw in china over the last two years in terms batteries, can you size the opportunity in some way or in a different way? i think in last year, you gave us an addressable market of $1.5 billion in automotive, i believe. is that has -- can that number grow given what we are seeing in ira or what that included the battery opportunity?
rob willett -- president and chief executive officer
yes. i think we talked generally about the size of our automotive market and the long-term growth potential. yes, we sized it at $1.5 billion. and we see estimated long-term market growth of 10%.
i think over -- that's going to cycle up and down over time periods, but i definitely think ev battery investment and the timing about when it comes, is going to and it helped drive higher growth rates for us last year and could -- and i hope to see that again in the years to come. we obviously see great need for our technology in that space. so i think what some of what we've been doing recently, such as the sec acquisition means that we would hope to gain more share in that space and have better and more deployable solutions for customers. so we'll see how that plays out.
we'll see what our competitors come with also. but we're optimistic about that. and then i think you mentioned, and it's another thing that potentially lifts our business here is the ira investment plans from the u.s. government will mean much more investment in the united states, where we just have big share and a great reputation and a lot of experience with u.s.
automotive companies who are obviously putting up the money to do this. so yes, we're optimistic about the space.
jairam nathan -- daiwa securities -- analyst
and just finally, related to that, i think, historically, you guys have talked about how you are more focused on the auto supply base rather than the oems. is that still the case? or do you see some of that changing, especially given the move away from ice?
rob willett -- president and chief executive officer
yes, it's a really interesting question. so yeah, i think historically, we've seen the majority of our automotive business being with tier 1 automotive suppliers. and that dynamic may change over time. you're seeing a lot of kind of joint ventures and relationships between brand names and then big asian technology suppliers.
we see that playing out in partnerships. and then you see also pure-play companies that are really going to business to manufacture batteries. so certainly, there's plenty of change going on in that space. but quite where that ends up, i wouldn't claim to know.
we tend to look at applications and needs and often those are driven by the end users themselves and how they're executed can be through third parties. like tier 1s or in partnership between end user brands and tier 1s. so yes, it's an evolving space. one, i look forward to talking with you about in the future.
jairam nathan -- daiwa securities -- analyst
ok, thank you. thanks a lot.

robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, john and hello everyone. thank you for joining us today. i am pleased to report our results for the third quarter of 2018. we have a tough comparison to the exceptional record setting results that we reported in q3 of 2017. other than that comparison, this year's q3 results were very good. we reported the second best revenue, net income and eps from continuing operations in the company's 37-year history.
revenue in q3 was $232 million, down 13% from last year's record setting performance and up 10% on a sequential basis. it was also slightly above our guidance for the quarter.
gross margin in q3 was slightly higher, both year-on-year and sequentially, mainly attributable to a favorable mix toward higher-margin products. we continued to invest in sales and engineering for our long-term growth. although the rate of increase has slowed in recent quarters, we are committed to delivering industry leading vision and id products to our growing customer base. we believe that we invest more in industrial machine vision and barcode reading technology than any company in the world. and it is that investment that will continue to drive our growth and profitability over the long term.
in q3, operating margin expanded on a sequential basis to 34%, demonstrating the substantial leverage that incremental revenue has on our business model. during the quarter, cognex performed well in many end markets. of course, one significant exception was consumer electronics, which is our largest market. as we expected, revenue in q3 from consumer electronics was substantially below the extraordinary level reported a year ago. excluding consumer electronics, revenue grew in mid-single digits year-on-year.
looking at our performance in our second and third largest markets, revenue from automotive was flat year-on-year in q3 after growing much faster than expected in many quarters. demand softened in our major regions during the summer months. since then, we've seen a sequential improvement in the americas and europe.
in logistics, our q3 comparisons do not reflect the strength we see for cognex products. better viewed on an annual basis, revenue from logistics has grown more than 50% in the first nine months of this year. at this point in the year, i spent a lot of time in the field with our sales force, visiting large customers and prospects to understand their requirements and their plans for automation in 2019 and 2020. this year i came back more excited than ever about how cognex machine vision and id will improve quality and delivery and drive down costs.
many large retailers are now planning to follow the example of the world's largest e-retailers in automating their distribution centers. that should mean a lot more business for cognex in the years to come. interest is particularly high for our ai-based deep learning vision. cognex deep learning vision technology allows manufacturers to perform inspection tasks that were previously very difficult or impossible for rule-based machine vision. many of our ai customers are now moving from trials where they train our deep learning tools to factory floor deployment in industries such as medical devices, automotives and consumer electronics. the development of our sales force continues to be a critical part of our effort to broaden and grow our business. in the third quarter, we recruited, trained and equipped many sales noids (ph) that will build the capacity we need to drive future growth. we've made good progress in increasing the reach of our sales channels to access new and growing markets for machine vision and develop closer ties with customers.
i will now turn the call over to john for financial details from the third quarter.
john j. curran -- senior vice president of finance & administration and chief financial officer
thank you, rob. as we go through the financials, please note that our results reflect the retroactive adoption of the new revenue standard that took effect on january 1 of this year. the sale of certain accessories that we historically reported on a net basis are now reported on a gross basis. this does not change our gross margin dollars, but our gross margin percentage has decreased from historical rates by 1 to 2 percentage points.
now for our q3 highlights. as rob noted, q3 revenue was $232 million, a decrease of 13% year-on-year. this decline is primarily attributable to the exceptional growth we achieved in q3 of last year across our business, led by consumer electronics.
gross margin of 75% was up slightly year-on-year and within our long-term target range. operating expenses totaled $95.5 million for the third quarter, an increase of 10% year-on-year. our spending was slightly above guidance, mainly due to the higher than expected revenue in the quarter. while we continue to be prudent in terms of discretionary spending, investing for the future remains key to our success. this includes maintaining our strong commitment to engineering and the continued expansion and development of our sales team. turning to our new erp system, we successfully implemented sap in q3 and used it to close the quarter. there is still more work to be done to fully implement the new system, but we believe it provides an excellent foundation for future growth.
operating margin in q3 was 34%, an increased of 4 percentage points compared with q2 of 2018 and driven primarily by the higher revenue level. the 8-point decrease in operating margin from a year ago mainly reflects last year's record breaking revenue and our previously mentioned investments in engineering and sales.
moving next to taxes, if we exclude discrete items, our tax rate was 16%, as expected. our discrete items in the quarter fell into three categories, with the largest related to the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017. in finalizing our 2017 tax returns, we recorded a net benefit of $7.7 million based on new regulatory guidance for the 2017 tax act. we also recorded $2.8 million in benefits associated with the exercise of employee stock options and $1.7 million in benefits primarily related to the release of tax reserves.
on a gaap basis, we reported earnings of $0.45 per share for q3 of 2018. this compares with $0.57 per share in q3 of last year. looking at revenue year-on-year from a geographic perspective, in the americas revenue increased over q3 of 2017 due to growth in several end markets including logistics, automotive and life sciences. internationally, revenue declined because of this quarter's substantially lower contribution from consumer electronics. lower spending by large customers in oled display and smartphone manufacturing was most noticeable in europe and to a lesser extent in our other asia region. it was partially offset by growth in automotive and other industries. also impacted by lower oled smartphone related revenue was our greater china region.
moving on from the income statement, our balance sheet remains very strong. we exited the quarter with $809 million in cash and investments and no debt. we continue to have sufficient capital to support our organic growth objectives, our m&a plan and for sharing our ongoing success with our shareholders through stock buybacks and dividends. in that regard, we repurchased nearly 400,000 shares of cognex stock in q3 and we plan to continue to buy back stock in q4 subject to market conditions and other factors. as announced tonight, the board has authorized a new $200 million stock repurchase program, which will begin once our current $150 million plan is completed. about $53 million remains available under the existing plan.
also our board of directors has increased the quarterly cash dividend to $0.05 per share. this is payable on november 30th to all shareholders of record on november '16.
with that i will turn the call back to rob.
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, john. in terms of guidance, we expect that fourth quarter revenue will be between $180 million and $190 million. at the midpoint that range represents a slight increase year-on-year. we expect a $15 million headwind from last year's high level of investment in oled display and smartphone manufacturing. we will be glad to have those tough comparisons behind us as we move into next year. excluding this oled smartphone reduction, we expect year-on-year growth in q4 of approximately 10%. that's slower than we'd like due to softness we're seeing in china where customers are becoming more cautious and slowing their spending plans.
gross margin for q4 is expected to continue to be in the mid 70% range and lower than we reported tonight for q3. operating expenses are expected to be roughly flat on a sequential basis. lastly, we expect the effective tax rate will be 16% excluding discrete tax items.
we will now open the call to questions. operator, please go ahead.

operator
thank you. (operator instructions) our first question comes from the line of jim ricchiuti with needham & company. please proceed.
james ricchiuti -- needham & company -- analyst
hi, good afternoon. i wonder if you could talk a little bit, rob, about the business ex consumer electronics, which is clearly going to be more volatile. but just i wonder if you could talk about what you're seeing in the market, just in light of some of the concerns, the concerns being some slowing in the automotive market and it looks like that cuts across geographic regions as well as potential implications from the trade tariff issues in china as it may relate to demand in some of your other regions.
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. hi, jim.
james ricchiuti -- needham & company -- analyst
hi, rob.
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
you're asking a pretty broad -- a broad question there.
james ricchiuti -- needham & company -- analyst
i know.
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
but i'll start answering it and perhaps in your follow-up, you can go to specific areas.
james ricchiuti -- needham & company -- analyst
sure. sure.
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
okay. so i'd say, in q3 we performed well in most end markets against some tough comparisons. we had some good -- good growth in america from logistics, automotive grew but not as quickly as it has been, from life sciences. and in europe, i think we saw some slowing down in automotive, greater china we saw broad slowing down, and -- but, i think really, europe, china and asia in q3 were down year-on-year a lot due to the decline in consumer electronics. so, i think when one strips that out, we saw general growth across all of our major regions with the exception of china. so that's kind of a bit about the industries overall.
you asked a little bit, jim, about automotive. so, let me kind of speak a little to automotive. so automotive was slower than normal in the americas and europe and it's always slower in summer in europe, but it was slower this year. but what we've seen in both americas and europe is it has improved in recent weeks. i think europe may have been slower in automotive through the summer, partly to do with some of the new emissions regulations that i think was causing a bit of a bottleneck in automotive production, and probably spending in work in automation. so, we saw that happening. we've seen a lot of growth in automotive over the years, over the last few quarters, i should say. and in the long run, we expect it to grow at 10% and it's been growing faster than that, but in the last quarter, it grew more slowly than that. so, i would say in the long run though, automotive isn't showing any signs of saturation. i think it's just more tentativeness among customers.
so then, jim, if i turn to sort of q4 outlook and we think about the markets, we still have, obviously as i talked about, lingering headwind from some oled smartphone and you were asking specifically not about that. i think other than china, we expect a decent but not exceptional growth among many of our end-user markets. and i think as we said excluding that smartphone oled business, we would expect about 10% business growth for the rest of the business and i think we're going to see slowing in china. so you can think better than that across the other regions in general.
so i don't know if that answers your question.
james ricchiuti -- needham & company -- analyst
no, that's helpful, rob. i have one follow-up because you suggested, i think the logistics portion of the business you might have experienced somewhat slower growth than normal in q3 and yet, if i heard you correctly, you're expecting that to pick up again. and i'm just wondering what occurred in q3 that was somewhat unusual relative to recent quarters?
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
yes, and i want to be clear, our logistics business is growing really quickly. and, we just happen to have a lower revenue quarter in q3. really more it was a matter of timing. it's not to do with the overall growth. the business in logistics is growing very, very quickly. it has grown more than 50% in the first three months -- sorry, three quarters of this year and we expect it to grow on very -- go on growing very rapidly.
james ricchiuti -- needham & company -- analyst
okay, thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of josh pokrzywinski with morgan stanley. please proceed.
josh pokrzywinski -- morgan stanley -- analyst
hi. good evening, guys. just wanted (ph) to follow up on that question. i think probably lower visibility in auto and consumer electronics, more broadly than when we entered the quarter, you mentioned some tough comps and auto, but i think the industry dynamics there maybe changed a little bit more recently in terms of willingness to spend some production misses. maybe same thing on the consumer electronics side. we've seen a bit more weakness there than just the tough comps. when you guys look out into, i guess, beyond 4q and into kind of the next year at large, would you say your visibility is at a normal place or maybe a little tighter than usual because i'm just trying to understand how much of the bullet we're seeing here is tough comps versus a bit more of a macro deceleration?
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
sure, josh. and you -- and you'd like me to talk about both auto and consumer electronics in that regard?
josh pokrzywinski -- morgan stanley -- analyst
i think that's probably where we've seen the most demand interruptions, so -- and are clearly important markets for you guys. so those would be helpful, rob.
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
yes. so i think our automotive market, we have a long -- we have lots of tight customer relationships with major brand owners and tier 1 automotive parts suppliers in automotive. so we have a pretty good view out three years. what we tend not to be able to call so well shorter term interruptions, whether it's around regulatory things or some of the dislocation we've seen around emission standards, diesel problems, even supply chain part, shortages and interruptions that have been going on in that market. so, that's why i think our business can perform more or less well in a given quarter.
i think in the long run assuming kind of a reasonably stable trading environment, we expect that business to grow 10%. and i think your question was more about next year and beyond. i mean, that's how we overall think of that market in general, right? i think if we then turn more to consumer electronics, it's almost like everything i've said, but kind of more extreme and more volatile, right? so there we tend to see companies implementing and executing their road maps on a much shorter-term basis, more in a six to nine months kind of window. they may be planning rollouts of new products now that we'll be seeing in the market next spring and summer or fall and we expect their investment in automation and machine vision to be growing much more quickly than automotive.
there we think 20% long-term growth or above is what we expect in that industry, but the volatility in those markets can come from the readiness and the adoption of new technologies. so obviously we've all spoken a great deal over the last few quarters about oled technology. there was massive investment in that in capacity in 2017 really for vision anyway and we're seeing a much slower year this year. it's a difficult call to say when the next round of capacity expansion and major investment would go on. but there is still a great deal of investment going on in yield to improve the yield of screen production where there are still many people involved visually inspecting. so there's ongoing business in that area but in terms of the volatility and the timing and investment that's what can drive some of the spend.
and then obviously, in the smartphone market where there is (ph) fairly all the major players, then of course the big ones, a lot can do -- have to do with the timing and the number of new products introduced in that space and the number of features, new technologically complex and difficult to manufacture features that go into those products. so, again, that can drive what's going on in that space. and obviously, we don't comment on specific customers and their plans. but more features, more models, more changes to form factors or technology will drive higher growth for us and we remain very confident about our growth potential in that market over the next few years.
josh pokrzywinski -- morgan stanley -- analyst
got it. and then just as my follow-up, rob, you've added a lot of new sales talent in the last, call it, four quarters. how do you view kind of the ramp time on those folks getting out there in the field? and do you -- are you starting to go a lot more direct maybe to mirror your big competitor a bit more in terms of the path to market?
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
we have been adding a lot of sales noids, as we call them, over the last few years and they allow us to reach more customers and particularly service larger more sophisticated customers better understanding their needs. we see about 60% of our business going direct although may vary quarter by quarter and about 40% through partners. partners are very important to cognex's go-to-market strategy. they allow us to -- some of them are systems integrators who have very sophisticated technology and application skills for our vision and they do business that we as a company don't wish to undertake directly ourselves, particularly for small and medium-sized customers and in other cases they serve regions or industries that they can serve better than we can.
and thirdly, i would say we are a vision-specific company but we sell products into a broader factory automation ecosystem. so very often, our products are sold with motion control, robots, plcs and we have no intention of selling those products. so we may be selling only one vision system or sensor with a number of those other products and those partners have the economies of scale and have the customer relationships to sell those into smaller accounts. so that works well. but our market is growing quickly and we continue to invest in cognex salespeople as we harvest all the great r&d product development that we're bringing to market and they're allowing us to do that better and faster than we were able to before.
josh pokrzywinski -- morgan stanley -- analyst
got it. that's helpful. and because i know it's a big deal around there, happy halloween.
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of richard eastman with robert w. baird. please proceed.
richard eastman -- robert w. baird & co. -- analyst
yes, good afternoon. rob, you had mentioned earlier when you were kind of speaking of the fourth quarter revenue guide and kind of suggesting at the midpoint of that guide call it $185 million. without the smartphone and oled, the business would be up maybe 10% at the midpoint. and i'm curious -- so, again, we tend to target 20% and we talked a little bit about automotive, but it just -- so the general slowdown for talking about 10% without the troublesome areas of smartphone oled, is the thought is that automotive is still against tough comps or there is still tough comps in the underlying revenue number or are we just expecting somewhat of a drag on the macro industrial spend into q4?
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
hi, rick. the slowdown as we kind of size it out, there's a $15 million headwind around oled-ian smartphone, right? and then we're going to get to, at the midpoint as you say, about -- we would see about a 10% growth rate net of that slowdown. why is that not 20%, the biggest single reason would be china. we are seeing slowdown in the business in china, really across all industries in that space, it's not like -- it's not we can point to electronics or automotive as the main part, it's a broad slowing down in that market.
and i would point out, as you look at cognex and you look at other companies, that we really sell and have close relationships on a direct basis with our end users, even if we sell through partners. so generally we know where well north of 90% of all of the business we sell goes. and so we have a pretty good sense of the funnel playing out. and i think other companies that may be reporting are more insulated from that and user position as a factor of distributors buying and holding inventory. so slightly (ph) my take on it there is, we may have a better view about what's going on in china than some of the other automation players reporting who rely on partners and don't see end user business. so i think going back to your question that there is the $15 million oled headwind, there is -- and then there is the china situation driving a lot of our slowdown.
richard eastman -- robert w. baird & co. -- analyst
do you think that the china situation, was there any pull forward of business relative to any concerns over tariffs kicking in kind of in the fall, speaking to china in particular, because we hit second quarter 50% (ph) -- if my memory serves me right, 55% growth in auto in china. and so is it your sense -- i mean, we all saw the pmi slowdown in september in china. i mean it's been slowing but it hit the 50% mark. but i'm curious if you -- is there any way to tease out that tariff benefit and did you benefit from any kind of pull forward in sales relative to tariff concerns in china?
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
i think as i said we don't have a situation where customers and particularly partners pull forward and hold inventory that's without sort of -- they don't sort of stock up and destock. it would be hard though, however to know whether our customers were buying ahead of tariff issues. it's possible that they may have been. i was with the china sales force. we did kind of drill into and discuss those types of issues. so i think the answer is possibly, but not something i can say definitively to you.
richard eastman -- robert w. baird & co. -- analyst
yeah, i understand. and just lastly, just to finish off the thought -- train of thought, but if -- again with some of these concerns whether they're auto whether they're ce whether they're all oled, if trends continue through the fourth quarter and you're looking at '19 where perhaps maybe we get off to mid to high single-digit type of revenue growth rate, are you prepared at this point to just -- to slow investment in the business just to accommodate if that pauses short term, mid term or longer term?
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
your question, rick, relates to 2019 outlook, and i think it's a little early to kind of call that one. but we're going to meet as a leadership team for a bottoms up detailed review of our product line and geographic plans for next year. and where there is opportunity for us to prioritize investments into faster growing areas certainly and to taper investments into -- from slower growing areas. at the moment that's kind of how it looks to me is sort of a steady state, but we will be watching very closely to see how the outlook is and what goes on in the meantime.
so we've successfully managed through turbulent times in the past and i've had a lot of experience of that both at cognex and before. but our revenue at cognex has grown organically in nine of the last 10 years. so we're certainly not heading for the bunkers at this point, but you can see as you look at our sequential spending patterns over the last few quarters that we have been slowing down and matching more closely expense rate growth to revenue growth. that said, cognex is a technology and growth company. we're bringing a lot of really exciting technologies and products to market over the next year, year and a half. so we don't want to inhibit the growth and adoption of those technologies based on hitting some sort of shorter-term expense growth constraints. so we are bearing all that in mind, i guess (inaudible) what i would say, and you can bet, we're going to think very carefully and act on it.
richard eastman -- robert w. baird & co. -- analyst
got you. okay, great, thank you for answering the questions.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of matt summerville with d.a. davidson. please proceed.
matt summerville -- d.a. davidson & co. -- analyst
thanks. couple of questions. first, can you comment on your inventory levels coming out of q3? you mentioned that some of that was the result of perhaps some safety stock in advance of the standing up of the sap, erp system and talk about what you think about the potential timing of drawdown and then i have a follow-up as well.
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
sure. thanks, matt. so our inventory balance at the end for q3 included some strategic purchases we made for our erp implementation that were really not needed in the end because it went smoother i think than we were expecting in that regard. and then we also have some fair amount of inventory related to new product introductions that we'll be seeing this quarter and next quarter where we're building up product in-house rather than through a subcontract manufacturer. so we're building that. that's really -- that's why it went up and we do expect to see inventory balance to come down in the fourth quarter. so we do expect to report lower inventory balance at year-end than you saw at the end of q3.
matt summerville -- d.a. davidson & co. -- analyst
and then just a follow-up on china. can you maybe talk about when during the third quarter you started to see your business there kind of (ph) outside of consumer electronics? so when you started to see your business tail off and do you feel that it's now stabilized at a lower level or is it still in the process of rolling over?
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
i think we really began to see the slowdown as we came out of august and we moved into september and we saw that continue into october. and the answer is no, we don't know what's going to happen now. we're watching it very closely. and i think we're trying to tailor off our internal forecast to what we're seeing in our sales funnel and spending patterns. but it's not -- i wouldn't say that necessarily had settled and i think it could go up or down relatively rapidly from on a week-to-week or month-to-month basis.
matt summerville -- d.a. davidson & co. -- analyst
thanks, rob.
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
i just wanted to revisit a point -- i just wanted to revisit a question that rick mentioned as well about -- concerning q4 demand and our thoughts about q4 demand. i think it's fair to say at the end of every year in industrial companies this is what's referred to as the budget flush. we have particularly in strong years that's kind of a move to spend capital at the end of the quarter -- at the end of the year and i would say in that regard, we are taking a relatively prudent view about what's going to happen at the end of this year and certainly at the end of last year. we saw a pretty significant budget flush and had a lot of our sales noids maxing out their quotas and booking a lot of business with customers who wanted to spend budget. so we don't expect that kind of a wave of strength at the end of the year this year based on what we're seeing in the marketplace.
matt summerville -- d.a. davidson & co. -- analyst
thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of jairam nathan with daiwa asset management. please proceed.
jairam nathan -- daiwa capital markets -- analyst
hi. thanks for taking my question. it's daiwa capital markets actually. so you guys mentioned consumer electronics being -- you have a long-term view of increasing the 20% range. i just wanted to kind of understand what are some of the drivers behind that you're seeing. you know smartphone sales kind of not growing too high -- too much. the features -- are there any -- the features set is probably, you're not seeing a lot of innovation coming from the smartphone manufacturers and the feature set. so i just wanted to try to understand what gives you the confidence and i had a follow-up.
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
sure. yeah, thanks for your question. so i think we all see that the handset unit production rates and the increases in average sales price at the high end of the market, so we sort of see those dynamics going on. so i think we all have foresight into those.
what really is going to drive cognex vision sales though in the market, well, one in the long term is there is a lot of labor still in the production of smartphones that the large manufacturers want to take out. so in many cases, the products are becoming too small for human hands to manufacture and the yield and quality that can be achieved with human versus automation and particularly vision makes vision or a long-term focus of investment for the engineering teams.
so that's certainly part of it. the other part of it is and i that's where i take issue with what you said is i think there is still many features -- advanced technology features that are being planned for introduction in the smartphone market. so as we look across and we really do deal with many of the large players in that market, many of the players overall, certainly there are technology features that are in their, roadmaps that make the adoption -- which makes the use of vision in implementing them very important and give us the sense that we could see strong future growth from that market. and then we spoke also about the oled screens and the investments in screens, which are very, very important to long-term road maps in that industry and very difficult and investment intensive to manufacture. so all of those give us the sense under right our sense of why we expect long-term investment and growth in machine vision in that market.
jairam nathan -- daiwa capital markets -- analyst
thanks. and just finally on -- with regard to competition, as the -- as you're seeing the environment kind of getting a little more sensitive here, do you -- are you seeing customers being a little -- asking for more -- being a little -- a lot more price competitive or are you seeing kind of -- does that open up a opportunity for competitors, lower cost competitors?
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
the answer to that is no. i mean machine vision is very difficult to do and the competitive advantage of the advantage products from us and a few of our competitors is very substantial. so in general, this is not a market driven by price, it's the market still driven by technology.of course, we could drop price to try to win share but that's never been something that we wanted to do, it's not what we're about as a company nor i believe it is (ph) really what about our major competitors are about.
jairam nathan -- daiwa capital markets -- analyst
okay. thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of paul coster with jpmorgan. please proceed.
paul coster -- j.p. morgan securities -- analyst
yes, thanks for taking my questions. i just want to follow-up from jim ricchiuti's question from earlier on regarding logistics. although i take your point that year-to-date has been very strong. there was something in your prepared remarks, rob, just related to this to some recent change. what was the point of interim remark of logistics?
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, paul, i mean the point, the point was really there was no point. it was just -- we've had, -- it was just a revenue, it was just a timing of revenue for logistics in americas in the quarter was slower than we've seen, and it really had just to do with the timing and a few customers where bookings turned into revenue, simple as that. the market is great and growing strongly and we'll -- we have reported growth year-to-date in the first nine months of over 50% and we see no change in that profile going forward.
paul coster -- j.p. morgan securities -- analyst
okay. got it. right. and then you also mentioned that there is a new product cycle coming. is it across the entire range of products and is it a new feature set at the same price points or is it product extension or are you reducing prices? just give us some sense of what you're doing here and what are you doing to mitigate the risks, of, a, customers weight and so the new products are available now and/or -- but you have some execution challenges in bringing products to market?
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
yes. so we really don't talk about specific new product introductions that are coming up. but in general, what i can say is we continue to invest significantly in r&d and we have products being launched pretty regularly in most quarters. so you can expect to see new products from us this quarter, next quarter, second quarter of next year coming to market. we don't telegraph specifically what those are going to be but when we do launch them then we end of life other products and that can lead to increased pricing and demand opportunities as well.
paul coster -- j.p. morgan securities -- analyst
great. got it. thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of joe giordano with cowen and company. please proceed.
joseph giordano -- cowen and company -- analyst
hey, guys.
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
hi, joe.
joseph giordano -- cowen and company -- analyst
just quick on a clarification. the $15 million headwind is that -- that's oled, is it budgeted also like the large customer spillover from 3q into 4q last year? is that -- are those -- both of those numbers included in that $15 million.
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, so the $15 million is smartphone and oled. so predominantly on the smartphone front.
joseph giordano -- cowen and company -- analyst
okay. and then on the fourth quarter guide, i'm just curious as you look at what the trends that are happening, particularly in china, how like haircut is that fourth quarter? are you holding conditions as of today, flat, or are you anticipating like a continuation of a downward trend into that guide? i just want to understand the baseline expectation in there.
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
generally, we never forecast specific regions and specific quarters in terms of growth. i think our message to you is we've seen a decline in that market. we look at our sales funnel and we don't expect the kind of growth, in fact we don't expect growth in that market year-on-year in q4 and we've baked that into our guidance. but other than -- second to the smartphone oled piece that's the second piece that is giving us headwind, meaning we won't be reporting 20% growth, we will be reporting more like 10% growth, net of the oled smartphone piece.
joseph giordano -- cowen and company -- analyst
and then i guess that kind of gets me to the follow-up. on the 20% longer-term view, what's like the baseline level of activity that you need to be able to drive that kind of growth? how do you -- how do we frame your ability to outgrow markets when you think about your most important regions, like do we need some sort of certain level of -- whether it's gdp or pmi in a region like china, like how do you think about that?
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
well we see vision as a technology that's expected to grow at about a 10% growth -- the markets -- the main vision markets that we serve we expect them to grow at a 10% rate. and then we are the market leader investing and bringing to market the best technology and we have the best brand. and then we have some specific market segments that we're in, logistics being a good example, 3d, life sciences, some of the new markets that we've entered, mobile terminals, that can bring our growth rate well above that rate, right? so -- and obviously historically looking back our id business has put out some awesome growth rates well north of that 20% goal over the most recent years and we would expect it to go on doing so. that's kind of one piece.
the other piece is that if you look back over a three-year period or a five-year period, you see compound annual growth rates of in excess of 20%. so we've been doing that and we're also investing in our sales force to the point where we can reach more and more customers and grow with the business. so what we've always said is we are not going to do 20% every quarter or every year, right? we're going to see (ph) some years. as you look back on history we've tended to have in almost years like we had last year and some years slower growth although we have grown in nine of the last 10 years. so that's how we think of it.

thanks, guys.
operator
thank you. (operator instructions) our next question comes from the line of bobby eubank with chevy chase trust. please proceed.
bobby eubank -- chevy chase trust -- analyst
good evening, guys.
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
hi, bobby.
bobby eubank -- chevy chase trust -- analyst
could you update on vidi? i know you mentioned strength there and customers moving from training their models to deployment. are we over the $10 million revenue market or expectations for that in 2019? and then if you could update on your acquisition pipeline, i know you guys haven't done any acquisitions this year. but is there any talent out there that you can find a more reasonable valuation or think could be complementary to your product set? thanks.
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
great. obviously your question is really about deep learning and acquisitions. so we made a very important acquisition of technology in vidi in april of last year and we've been introducing that technology to customers and making it easier to deploy and by most recently putting it inside of visionpro system of vision software, but this is very sophisticated technology that we continue to develop and make easier to use. and the reception has been very good. for this technology and it's allowing customers to perform machine vision tasks that were either extremely difficult or impossible for them to perform in the past and the way i think about it is these are tasks that are more like human tasks where instead of rule based vision where one may be measuring something precisely is an angle 90 degree or 90.1 degrees or as a whole the right with a part or the distance from another hole, these are the sort of tasks today that human beings inspect and we are good at seeing like are these glue lines, they may not be straight exactly because glue tends to glob (ph) and move around when it's dispensed, right, but are they continuous and they in the right kind of areas.
our solder balls in electronics application are they generally the right size and in the right place even though their makeup and size may look different to machine vision or even chocolates which may be being dispensed and don't have a regular form if you think about them always, particularly high end but are generally correct or incorrect. these are just kind of accessible examples of what deep learning technology can do. we've been starting to see a lot of well since we began to introduce the technology we've seen a lot of customers taking our technology and looking at that problems with it, and it's an area that's getting a lot of attention and we've seen a lot of purchase of training licenses where customers are becoming familiar with the technology. and now we're seeing it being deployed by many of our most sophisticated customers into their production. i'm not going to give specific growth numbers or dollar numbers out at this time, but it is certainly beating the expectations we have for growth when we acquired the company and it is many, many millions of dollars.
your second question has to do with acquisitions. we made a significant number of acquisitions in '16 and '17, i think six acquisitions we made and we haven't made acquisitions since then. but we continue to engage with potential targets and look for similar things that we liked in those companies we acquired. great technology, great engineers, great cultural fit, vision related good growth potential that we can integrate. so we've certainly engaged with and in the end decided not to proceed with a number of companies this year in that space. and then as you think of our cash on our balance sheet, certainly some of that we would like to deploy to acquire some larger companies and we continue to cultivate and engage them, but we have haven't certainly in the last few years been successful convincing any of those companies to sell themselves to cognex but we continue to ask.
operator
thank you. (operator instructions) our next question comes from the line of joe giordano with cowen and company. please proceed.
joseph giordano -- cowen and company -- analyst
hi, guys. thanks for taking the follow-up. just quick one on -- curious about the integration of vidi into the insight platform and how much of that can be kind of the combined and where are you now and where do you see that ultimately going?
robert willett -- president and chief executive officer
i'll definitely talk about how we've combined it and where we see it now, but i am not going to comment on where it's going, only in general terms, maybe. okay, so when we acquired vidi, they had, what we thought and still think they had the best deep learning technology for industrial applications that we've ever seen and we were really impressed with what they could do. they also had a number of rule based vision tools that allowed them to do such things as find the object that they wanted to work on quickly and these are things that we do exceptionally well at cognex through a technology known as patmax and patmax redline. so when we bought those two technologies together and brought them up inside visionpro, some of our vision tools helped the vidi technology operate better. it was complementary.
the other thing is cognex we have excellent user environment. we hear regularly from customers that they standardize and they really like our insight and our visionpro user interfaces and environment. so bringing vidi into that environment also makes it more accessible to all the thousands of customers today who are standardized and use those user interfaces. so that's been sort of a quick and easy win for us. in the longer term, we think this technology has a long way to run as we make it easier to use and more accessible to more and more of our customers. and, of course, the actual technology profile underneath that processor development and programming techniques around deep learning and plus our own experience of seeing more and more examples to train on mean that our technology in that area is developing very, very quickly. so it's an exciting area, perhaps one we will give you more of a preview next year when you come for analyst day.
