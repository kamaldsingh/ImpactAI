good day, everyone, and welcome to the fourth quarter of 2020 minerals technologies earnings call. today's call is being recorded.
at this time, i would like to turn the call over to mr. erik aldag, head of investor relations for minerals technologies. please go ahead, mr. aldag.
erik aldag -- head of investor relations
thank you, kiara. good morning, everyone, and welcome to our fourth quarter 2020 earnings conference call. today's call will be led by chief executive officer, doug dietrich and chief financial officer, matt garth. following doug and matt's prepared remarks we will open it up to questions.
i'd like to remind you that beginning on page 14 of our 2019 10-k, we lists the various risk factors and conditions that may affect our future results. and i'll also point out the safe harbor disclaimer on this slide. statements related to future performance by members of our team are subject to these limitations, cautionary remarks and conditions.
i'll now turn the call over to doug. doug?
douglas t. dietrich -- chief executive officer
thanks, eric, and good morning, everyone. i appreciate you taking the time to join our call and i hope you're all staying safe and healthy. i'll start by providing my perspective on what we achieved in 2020 from a strategic and operational standpoint, and the various dynamics we successfully managed through. i'll then discuss some of the highlights of our performance in the fourth quarter. matt will provide a more detailed look at our financial results and i'll conclude the prepared remarks with insight into how we see 2021 shaping up, touching on our key priorities, growth initiatives and market trends.
as you saw from the release last night, we finished 2020 with a strong fourth quarter. before i go through the quarter, however, i want to take some time to provide my perspective on the full year, which will put this quarter into context.
to characterize the year, managing through this pandemic has challenged us on every front and i'm very proud of all of our employees for their unwavering commitment, agility and execution focus, all key qualities that define our culture and our company. our performance reflected the strength of our diverse mix of businesses and high value product portfolio, which enabled us to expand our positions with existing customers and capture opportunities with new ones.
proactive operational measures to reduce costs and increased pricing led to an improved margin profile. in addition, we successfully implemented virtual tools and evolved our processes to help improve efficiency, connectivity with our employees and customers. protecting the health and safety of our employees is one of our core values. since the onset of the pandemic, we put in place a robust series of protocols to protect our employees while ensuring the safe and efficient operations of our facilities.
while implementing these new work practices, our employees stayed focused on improving our safety performance which resulted in 2020 having the lowest recordable injury rate in mts' history, a testament to the strength of our people, capabilities and processes that we were able to swiftly adapt, retool, and embrace the change and drive our safety culture forward.
now let me take you through how the year unfolded from an operational and commercial perspective. agility is the word that comes to mind as we managed through significant demand changes in our end markets, uncertain customer order patterns, and production curtailments.
the global pandemic, which continues to affect demand in our industrial end markets had the most notable impact in the second and third quarters. during this time, we focused on making several operational adjustments at our plants, including maintenance activities and manufacturing process improvements and when the markets recovered in the last four months of the year, we were well positioned to take advantage of the higher volumes.
our consumer-oriented businesses in both performance materials and specialty minerals remained consistently strong throughout 2020. much of this performance was driven by our global pet care business, which grew by 7%, but also through solid increases in personal care, edible oil purification and other food and pharmaceutical applications.
after experiencing large volume drops in our minerals businesses in the second quarter, many of our end markets, including automotive, residential construction and steel steadily improved throughout the back half of the year. in contrast, some of our other end markets such as paper and large environmental and building projects are still recovering.
while the demand environment was volatile this past year, our team's disciplined execution and aggressive cost control put our company in a good position to leverage improving sales into income. these efforts resulted in higher overall operating and ebitda margins compared to 2019.
taking measures to enhance our operational efficiency, including variable cost adjustments and structural overhead savings, as well as through continued price increases, productivity improvements, and higher sales of new products.
generating sustained cash flow and creating flexibility around our capital structure have been top priorities. during 2020, we delivered strong free cash flow of $175 million, slightly higher than last year. we used the cash generated to reduce net debt by $122 million and returned $48 million to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.
i speak often about our culture of continuous improvement, but i wanted to describe how this deeply ingrained operating model is a key reason why we quickly adapted to a dynamic environment to deliver these results. people and their engagement in the company are what drives this mind-set and it's a unique recipe for mti to be agile. we conducted 8,600 problem solving kaizen events and received nearly 65,000 suggestions from our employees throughout 2020 keeping at a similar pace to last year.
to put this in context, each day, on average, nearly 24 kaizen events are being held and we're receiving 178 suggestions from our employees across mti on how to improve our daily processes. this is a significant level of involvement in our continuous improvement culture, especially as many of these activities occurred virtually this past year. there are countless examples of how we've transformed our processes and capabilities to drive efficiencies, improve collaboration and further demonstrate our value proposition to our customers in a virtual existence.
we successfully implemented tools that allow us to remotely commission a new pcc satellite or that can support trialing and commercializing new products and applications. we can now perform specialized maintenance assessments remotely without our engineers having to be physically present at the plant and we've developed a webinar series that allows our technical teams to virtually engage with a broader group of customers and more quickly provide them with our value-added solutions.
these tools are becoming a significant competitive advantage to our company and will remain a permanent part of how we work in the future. we also advanced our strategic growth initiatives during the year. we remain the leader in green sand bond systems for the global foundry market. there are significant opportunities to leverage our deep technical expertise and value proposition with customers in large foundry markets such as china and india.
this year, we both expanded our customer base and further extended our penetration into china as sales of our pre-blended products increased by 17%. we're the world's largest pcc producer with the most advanced portfolio of technologies, including high filler and summer packaging and paper waste recycling.
our objective is to increase pcc volumes globally through base filler contracts in underpenetrated regions by capitalizing on growing opportunities in adjacent markets where we can deploy these latest solutions.
in 2020, we commissioned three new satellites, which total over 200,000 tons of new capacity and our growth continued on a strong track in china where pcc sales increased by 13% over last year. we've invested in strengthening our capabilities, resources and new technologies for our consumer-oriented products, which is delivering results as these more resilient products comprise 25% of our total portfolio.
while our pet care business has contributed to much of this strength, as we grow our global portfolio of premium products and enter new channels such as e-commerce, we are also growing other specialty applications including edible oil purification, personal care and fabric care.
our new product development efforts progressed well in 2020 as we continued to accelerate the pace of commercialization and drive new revenue prospects. we commercialized 44 value-added products and incorporated sustainability indicators as part of the new product development process to ensure we are meeting both our own environmental goals as well as our customers.
the last pillar of our growth strategy is m&a where we maintain an active pipeline of potential mine to market opportunities. we made a small acquisition of a hauling and mining company, which further strengthened our vertically integrated position at our bentonite mines in wyoming; and we pursued an acquisition of elementis, who we feel is a strong strategic fit with our company. through this process, we demonstrated our commitment to remaining disciplined in our approach to deploying capital for inorganic opportunities.
the results we achieved in 2020 under challenging conditions underscore the power of our operating culture, the resilience of our global market-leading positions and the strength of our financial foundation. we finished with momentum across many of our businesses and we are exiting 2020 in a stronger position than when we entered it.
with that backdrop, let me go through the takeaways for the fourth quarter. as discussed on our last call, we expected that demand trends in many of our major end markets would continue to strengthen through the final months of the year and that's largely how things played out, with some of the markets we serve, especially transportation and industrial, improving more than we expected. these dynamics helped drive sales of $432 million, an 11% sequential improvement.
financially, we generated $61 million of operating income and earnings per share of $1.08, both sequential and year-over-year improvements. despite the lower year-over-year sales, overall operating margin improved 90 basis points sequentially and 220 basis points compared to last year. in addition, our ebitda margin was up 170 basis points.
cash flows remained robust through the fourth quarter, capping off a strong cash flow year. operating cash flow for the quarter was $92 million, up 16% compared to last year. free cash flow was $72 million, up 8%. we made progress to lower our debt levels by paying down $80 million. we also returned $17 million to shareholders through dividends and repurchases.
i'll take a moment to briefly highlight the progress we made with our growth initiatives in the quarter. our metalcasting business performed well. we saw strong demand from north american foundries and our growth momentum in china accelerated with sales increasing by 29% over last year. demand for our portfolio of consumer products remained strong and sales in our household, personal care, and specialty product line were up 6% over last year.
ground calcium carbonate and talc businesses had a solid quarter, supported by significantly improved demand for our applications that go into the automotive and residential construction markets. on the pcc front, we ramped up production at our new facility in india and our 150,000 ton satellite in china came online at the end of the quarter, and we resumed production at our satellite in wickliffe, kentucky.
in specialty pcc, sales were up 23% over last year as our new capacity expansions supported the increased demand for our latest sealant products. in refractories, we signed three additional five-year contracts, building on the two contracts from last quarter to supply our refractory and metallurgical wire products in the u.s. contracts combined represent $14 million of incremental revenue on an annualized basis.
i want to share some of these specific highlights as they help round out a solid operational, financial and strategic quarter for mti and lay the foundation for growth in 2021.
with that, i'll turn it over to matt to walk you through our financial results in more detail. matt?
matthew e. garth -- senior vice president, finance and treasury & chief financial officer
thanks, doug. i will review our financial results, the performance of our four segments, as well as our outlook for the first quarter. i'll then turn it back over to doug for additional perspective on the year ahead. and now, let's review the fourth quarter results.
sales in the fourth quarter were 11% higher sequentially and 2% below the prior year. gross margin, operating margin and ebitda margin improved versus the prior year as our actions on pricing, productivity and cost control have resulted in higher levels of profitability. our effective tax rate for the quarter was 18.6% versus 17.6% in the prior year and 19.8% in the third quarter and we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 20% going forward.
earnings per share, excluding special items was $1.08 and reported earnings was $0.91 per share. special charges included acquisition related expenses, costs associated with the cyber security incident and a non-cash pension settlement charge.
now moving to the bridges on the right side of this slide, you can see that lower volume had a $12 million impact on sales versus the prior year, which was partially offset by favorable pricing. operating income was $8 million higher than the prior year as the impact from lower volume was entirely offset by pricing and cost actions as well as the favorable mix of earnings. operating margin improved by 220 basis points versus the prior year.
and now, let's turn to the full year highlights. full year sales were 11% lower than 2019. we experienced the most profound impacts of the covid-19 pandemic on our end markets in the second and third quarters of 2020. demand improved gradually across several end markets in the third quarter and accelerated in the fourth quarter. despite the challenging market environment, we improved our margins versus the prior year through the actions we took on pricing and cost over the last 18 months and the efficiencies we realized in 2020, including reducing sg&a by $13 million or 6% versus 2019.
earnings per share excluding special items was $3.99 and reported earnings was $3.29 per share. sales bridge on the top right of this slide shows that we faced nearly $200 million of top line impact from lower volume in 2020, which translated to a $51 million operating income impact. we offset more than half of this impact through favorable pricing and cost actions and operating margin improved by 30 basis points versus the prior year. company is positioned very well for profitable growth and further margin improvement as volumes returned with continued end market recovery.
and now, let's review the segments in more detail, starting with performance materials. fourth quarter sales for performance materials were slightly above the prior year and 6% higher sequentially. metalcasting sales grew 6% versus the prior year and 17% sequentially as foundry production improved in north america and demand remained strong in china. household, personal care and specialty product sales were also strong, up 6% versus the prior year on continued strong demand for consumer-oriented products.
pet care, personal care and edible oil purification all realized double-digit year-over-year growth in the quarter. environmental products and building materials experienced typical seasonal volume reductions in the fourth quarter as well as continued delays for new commercial construction projects, which resulted in lower sales sequentially and versus the prior year.
operating income for the segment was $30.3 million, up 31% versus the prior year. operating margin was 15% of sales versus 14.8% in the third quarter and 11.5% in the prior year. continued pricing actions, variable cost control and expense reductions resulted in significant margin expansion for this segment.
we expect continued strength for most product lines in this segment through the first quarter. we expect some leveling-off from the acceleration in demand that we saw in the fourth quarter and we also expect the project-oriented businesses to remain at lower levels in the first quarter. so overall, we expect first quarter sales to be similar to the fourth quarter.
and now, let's move to specialty minerals. specialty minerals sales were $138.9 million in the fourth quarter, 2% below the prior year and 11% higher sequentially. paper pcc sales increased 12% sequentially as paper mill operating rates gradually improved and we ramped up a new satellite in india. we also restarted our satellite in wickliffe, kentucky and we brought online our 150,000 ton satellite in china, the company's largest pcc satellite to-date.
specialty pcc sales were strong, up 23% versus the prior year and up 13% sequentially on robust demand from consumer-oriented markets, residential construction and automotive end markets. processed minerals sales increased 10% versus the prior year and 8% sequentially on strong residential construction and automotive demand. operating income, excluding special items, was $21.9 million, up 13% versus the prior year despite the lower sales. operating margin was 15.8% of sales compared to 14.3% in the third quarter and 13.7% in the prior year.
looking ahead, we expect continued strength in specialty pcc and processed minerals and sequential growth in paper pcc as our new satellites ramp up. and overall for the segment, we expect first quarter sales to be modestly higher sequentially.
now let's review the refractory segment. refractory segment sales were $73.9 million in the fourth quarter, up 1% versus the prior year and 25% higher sequentially as steel mill utilization rates continued to gradually improve in north america and europe. operating income increased 7% versus the prior year and 52% sequentially to $11.1 million and represented 15% of sales compared with 12.3% in the third quarter and 14.2% in the prior year.
steel utilization rates are currently hovering around 75% in north america and 70% in europe, up from a low point of around 50% in the second quarter of 2020. a further improvement in steel mill utilization will depend upon the strength of demand from construction, automotive and infrastructure end markets going forward. and at this point, we expect the first quarter to be similar to the fourth quarter from a market perspective, although note that our laser equipment sales are typically weighted more heavily toward the second half of the year.
now let's move to energy services. the energy services business continued to experience customer project delays in the fourth quarter. sales were $16.8 million and operating income was $600,000. activity increased sequentially in the deepwater basins where we operate, however, it remains below prior year levels. and now looking to the first quarter, we expect similar levels of activity to the fourth quarter.
now let's move to our cash flow and liquidity highlights. fourth quarter cash from operations was $92 million versus $80 million in the prior year and free cash flow was $72 million versus $67 million in the prior year. we deployed $20 million of capital during the quarter to grow the business, develop our mines, and improve our operations.
we paid $80 million of term loan debt in the fourth quarter, bringing our net debt to $562 million and our net leverage ratio to 1.8 times ebitda. we also repurchased $15 million of shares in the fourth quarter, bringing the 2020 total to $41 million. despite the end market challenges we experienced in 2020, we generated higher cash flow than the prior year, increased liquidity by $229 million and reduced net debt by $122 million, all of which has further strengthen the company's balance sheet. this balance sheet strength provides us with significant flexibility for how we deploy capital for the most attractive opportunities.
now, let me summarize our outlook for the first quarter. we expect similar market conditions in the first quarter to what we experienced in the fourth quarter. i'd like to note that we experienced relatively favorable operating conditions in the fourth quarter. we typically experience higher mining and energy costs while operating in the colder months which could lead to temporarily higher costs in the first quarter.
in performance materials, we expect continued strength in consumer-oriented markets with some leveling off from the acceleration we saw in the fourth quarter and we also expect continued strength in metalcasting.
in specialty minerals, our paper pcc business is positioned for growth with 150,000 tons of capacity ramping up in china. we expect continued solid demand for specialty pcc and processed minerals driven by residential construction and consumer-oriented products.
in our services businesses, we expect stable refractories demand to be partially offset by fewer laser equipment sales in the first quarter and we expect demand for our deepwater filtration and well testing services to remain at similar levels and we expect to see activity increasing in the second quarter. overall, we expect first quarter sales at around the same level as the fourth quarter.
with that, let me turn it back over to doug to provide some perspective on the year ahead. doug?
douglas t. dietrich -- chief executive officer
thanks, matt. let me now provide some perspective on our markets and touch on some high level operational and strategic themes for the year. as we look ahead, this will be another dynamic year. and with the momentum across many of our businesses, 2021 is shaping up to be a solid year for mti.
we expect our consumer oriented businesses to maintain their strength from last year and continue their solid growth trajectory. our metalcasting, specialty pcc, ground calcium carbonate, and talc businesses which primarily serve transportation and residential construction sectors are recovering nicely, and in some cases, exceeding pre-covid demand levels.
our refractories business is benefiting from gradually improving steel utilization rates and current indications point to continued strength in steel end markets. in our paper business, base demand in north america and europe should improve during the year and asia will remain on its strong track. we also see a full year volume growth from the new satellites that started up in late 2020 and we have two additional satellites totaling approximately 70,000 tons that will come online in the middle of this year.
finally, it will be a slower start to the year for our energy services, building materials and environmental products business, though we anticipate project activity picking up in the second quarter. across the portfolio, we have a number of attractive projects in hand that will accrue to volume growth in 2021. we'll be focused on accelerating our geographic expansion in our core product lines.
new product development remains a key priority for us. we've made significant progress to improve the speed of execution, increase the number of products we commercialize, and enhance the impact of our latest solutions. over the past five years, we've cut the time from development to market in half; but at the same time, increased our sales from new products by more than 50%. these metrics should continue to strengthen in 2021.
some notable technologies to highlight include water remediation solutions to address pfas, pcc for packaging and tissue applications, enhanced formulations for edible oil purification and our 100% carbon-neutral pet care product. many of these new products are helping us penetrate more consumer oriented applications and adjacencies with customers.
with our solid financial footing, we have the resources to execute on the initiatives i just mentioned. in addition, our strong balance sheet with debt at targeted levels gives us the flexibility to also deploy capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases as well as toward acquisitions. continuous improvement at the core of how we operate, we will develop new innovative ways to adapt and enhance our virtual tools to drive more value by improving our connections with customers, speed with which we solve problems, and further enabling internal collaboration.
lastly, sustainability and esg leadership has been a focus of ours for a long time. over the past several years, we're taking meaningful steps to embrace these activities -- i'm sorry, embed these activities deeper into our company. few items to highlight, we're on track to meet our -- meet or exceed our environmental reduction targets in six focus areas. more than half of our new product pipeline is now geared toward sustainable solutions. we'll continue to advance and strengthen our broad range of esg initiatives this year and look forward to publishing our 13th annual report in july.
in closing, i want to thank our global team. our company's strengths have been showcased during these times of adversity. i'm proud of how we've responded with agility and perseverance. heading into 2021, our team is engaged, focused on operating safely and efficiently and align behind our culture. with positive momentum that we generated at the end of last year, we're well positioned to execute on the attractive opportunities in front of us.
with that, let's open the call for questions.
",":
operator
all right. [operator instructions] we'll take the first question from daniel moore with cjs securities.
daniel moore -- cjs securities, inc. -- analyst
thank you. doug, matt, good morning, and thanks for taking the questions.
douglas t. dietrich -- chief executive officer
hi, dan.
daniel moore -- cjs securities, inc. -- analyst
so, why don't we start with a little bit of a crystal ball on maybe some of the -- a couple of the businesses that are still being impacted. and if we look specifically at performance materials, environmental and building materials are still at a pretty low base $110 million, $115 million combined revenue or so in 2020. look out two to three years, not looking for the cadence of recovery, but where do you see those business getting back to in a sort of post-covid world and what kind of incrementals should we be thinking about?
douglas t. dietrich -- chief executive officer
yeah, i'm not going to go that far out dan. but i think they get back to where they were, for sure. a couple of things to consider, there is a mix of influences here and i'll pass it over to jon hastings to give a little more color. there are still some acute kind of impacts from covid and sites being closed and limited activity going on at current waterproofing sites around the world. that's primarily in europe at the moment.
at the same time, like an -- in our building products. same thing with environmental products in big landfill remediations and some of our higher end resistex type industrial landfill, complex landfill environment, same thing is happening.
in energy services, we still have a solid pipeline this year of projects. we've had a couple of them demobilize in december due to covid outbreaks, being rescheduled. we'd look probably toward the beginning of the second quarter. so things are still shifting around with -- for some of those covid related issues.
the challenge is, some of that is you know -- we are not in the building envelope above ground, we're in the below-ground. so when you're digging new holes and waterproofing new holes and we still have a solid pipeline of those projects, but they haven't broken ground yet. we expect them to.
we're also in our kind of slow period in the winter for these businesses and probably construction starts to ramp up in the second. we see that rate that we are at in 2019 coming back this year, but it's going to be that rate more in the second and third quarter. and i guess i gave a little more details. jon, do you have anything to add to that, at least on environmental and building.
jonathan j. hastings -- group president, performance materials
hi dan, this is jon. thanks, doug. yeah, a couple of things just to highlight. and as doug said, covid certainly threw a curveball at us, induced a lot of delays, delays with -- in manpower, delays in funding of new projects. if you think about environmental with all the landfills, it's dependent on municipal budgets. we are starting to see that change. we're getting an increasing number of submittals and project proposals. so we're looking at q2, q3 as to ramping back up and this is one of the last sectors within performance materials to recover from the covid induced downturn.
keep in mind, like doug said, with building we're in more than just the big building projects that you see with office buildings and office complexes, we're also in infrastructure. so we are involved in tunnelling projects, metro stations, other types of business and it's all of that together that we're watching and we see the uptick. so yes, we've had some challenges over the past couple of quarters, but we're not straying from our long-term strategy.
environmental, we've got products that really do a really good job of preventing groundwater contamination from hazardous waste. we also have great waterproofing technologies. we're recognized as the world leader. we are efficient in manufacturing them and distribute them to the projects when they do go. we've got a healthy pipeline and so we think this will continue to rebound as we go into the q2 and q3. hope that helps.
daniel moore -- cjs securities, inc. -- analyst
no doubt, no doubt. yeah, just kind of thinking about it from a longer-term perspective. shifting gears, metalcasting returned to nice growth and clearly seeing -- you've got some easy comps coming up. from sort of q4 revenue as a base, how is -- how the incremental revenue is still ahead in terms of recovery. and then, how do you see the beyond that longer-term growth expectations once we're fully recovered and just kind of remind us of the ramp and the opportunity that's ahead of you in china, in particular?
douglas t. dietrich -- chief executive officer
yeah, i think there's a couple of things. let's start with north america. and i think we're seeing some demand shift. i'll tell you we've been keeping really close tabs on our order books in north america and we're seeing strong demand and from indications that we have from our customers, their pipelines and back orders -- their pipelines are thin and they've got long list to back orders. and so we see that continued strong pool certainly out through the first half of this year at a minimum. so north america is looking very strong across all automotive, truck and industrial testing applications.
we noted that in china we grew almost 30% just in the fourth quarter and that is driven by -- and on top of that, in the year, we increased our blended products by 17% over last year. that's coming from a couple of places. that's coming from not only just strong demands, based demand for auto build rates, heavy truck and industrial applications in china, also coming from new customers. and -- so we're starting to expand that addressable market to a broader base and moving the kind of core base into that blended system.
so the strategy we've had in place for the past decade is continuing and it's continuing to accelerate. i'll also note that the difference between -- i keep reminding that difference between the penetration rate of a blended product in north america, which is 90% -- 90%-plus of the foundry's use are blended products. that's still only around 25% maybe in china.
and so, that market is four times bigger than the united states and with the under-penetrated customers that don't use the blended product whether ours or another's, there's a long way to go and that -- so we see that continue -- that raise, maybe not 30% every quarter, but we've averaged 10% to 12% every year for the past five years. and that could accelerate a little bit, but we see that continuing for sure through 2020 and funnel faster.
daniel moore -- cjs securities, inc. -- analyst
very helpful. okay. maybe one more and shifting back to the more near-term, what was overall revenue growth in january? was it relatively flat, in line with your guide? and then just trying to making sure i triangulated the commentary, for fiscal q1 we're thinking revenue relatively flat sequentially with maybe slightly lower adjusted ebit margins, given some of those input costs, is that the right way to think about it?
matthew e. garth -- senior vice president, finance and treasury & chief financial officer
yeah dan, that's what the guidance would tell you, looking very much similar to the fourth quarter overall, from a sales perspective. we did note a few of those cost items that we called out on the -- really the mining costs on a quarter-over-quarter basis, given the cold weather factors that may take place.
daniel moore -- cjs securities, inc. -- analyst
got it. okay, that's very helpful. thanks, matt. i'll jump back with any follow-ups. thank you.
operator
[operator instructions] we'll take the next question from steve o'hara with sidoti.
stephen o'hara -- sidoti & company, llc -- analyst
hi, good morning. thanks for taking the questions.
douglas t. dietrich -- chief executive officer
hi, steve.
stephen o'hara -- sidoti & company, llc -- analyst
hi, just looking at the margins, maybe following up on the last question. pretty -- i would say very solid performance in the fourth quarter kind of given pandemic etc. i mean, and you noted cost increases in some areas. but i mean, was there anything in there that you don't feel sustainable in terms of margin performance where you think you got a benefit either maybe a competitor wasn't operating or something like that where it's kind of due to the pandemic or it is increases other than what you noted so far, kind of building back toward where you wanted to be?
douglas t. dietrich -- chief executive officer
no, there is nothing to note. i think that's -- i think it really is the performance and all of the things that have come together that we've been working on for a while; a, it's been really securing cost control in all senses but with good performance in our productivities that we generated a 4% productivity this year over last year. that's pretty average to what we do. we've done 5% before, 6% in some years. so with the lower volume, that's pretty good result for the company given what we went through.
so a normal productivity improvement year, some good variable cost control. we've made some changes, as matt mentioned, in our overheads that we think are permanent. we've seen good volume environment in many of our -- a good mix of that volume as well, which we think will continue forward and strong pricing. we've done a lot of making sure that our product's pricing reflects the value that we derive and that's not something that just happened in the fourth quarter. we've been working through making sure that our products are priced appropriately and moving and demonstrating that value proposition.
and i think we do that -- we've done that very effectively over the past couple of years. so i think that's just kind of comes together and i think, as i mentioned, we took the time in the second and third quarter to really hunker down and make some changes and we had all of our employees doing really valuable work in the plants to improve processes. a lot of those kaizen events i mentioned occurred over the summer months to retool some things, to perform maintenance and -- because we knew the volumes would come back and when then they did, i think we're in a good position to have it come through.
so i think this is a sustainable kind of level. i think we're in a different level than we were last year. that's why i mentioned i think we're exiting this year stronger than we went into it. that said, we still have some other product lines that haven't recovered yet. and so as we see the growth in not only paper volumes with new volumes coming on and those accruing to us. as building and environmental and those energy services projects come back, there is more volume to be had on this cost base.
and so that's why we're confident that the mix will move around a little bit as we go through the year and that will change and we'll have some short-term energy costs, probably in the first quarter. but, i think we're at a different level and i think we're focused on continuing to sustain this and maybe move it further.
stephen o'hara -- sidoti & company, llc -- analyst
okay, thank you. that's helpful and maybe just jumping to the building products and i know this is mainly used in -- or building materials, i guess mainly used in res -- non-res construction. and i'm just may be less familiar with the product market, but i mean is there an opportunity to enter the res market or is it just the cost basis of the products you sell is high enough where it doesn't really make sense on the res side or is there kind of an established market that is not -- it's not kind of the same product mix that you guys are doing?
douglas t. dietrich -- chief executive officer
jon, you want to take than one?
jonathan j. hastings -- group president, performance materials
sure. doug. talking about the diversification of building products, we -- like i said earlier, we're in a variety of different projects. it's the large commercial construction activities as well as infrastructure, so tunnels and metro stations and things of that nature. we do look at our water proofing. we do have the capability of supplying small projects. most of the residential projects that we see, either single family and multifamily, don't require a large subterranean water proofing.
but we are looking and we're continuing to look at ways we can deploy our technologies, for example in green roofs or other applications in the building envelope. so there are opportunities there for us. we do have technologies. we do market in those spaces. it's not big volume for us, but we continue to try to explore and expand the way we go into those technologies as well. hope that helps.
stephen o'hara -- sidoti & company, llc -- analyst
yeah, that's very helpful. thanks. i'll jump back in queue. thanks for the time.

alright, the next question is from rosemarie morbelli with g. research.
rosemarie morbelli -- g. research -- analyst
thank you. good morning, everyone.
douglas t. dietrich -- chief executive officer
hi, rosemarie.
rosemarie morbelli -- g. research -- analyst
i was wondering if you could talk of the potential impact or potential benefit from any infrastructure bill that may come up.
douglas t. dietrich -- chief executive officer
i think we operate, obviously, in construction steel. i think the short answer is we would benefit from that, rosemarie. so infrastructure is going to pull on lot of building products. it's going to pull on steel, it's going to pull into, as jon just mentioned, probably our water proofing projects, even some of our environmental solutions.
so i think that -- and we've talked about this several years ago when we anticipated an infrastructure bill. yes, i think we would benefit from that across many parts of our company.
rosemarie morbelli -- g. research -- analyst
can you put a dollar amount?
douglas t. dietrich -- chief executive officer
it depends on the infrastructure bill, i think. but i think the largest -- no i can't right now put a dollar amount on it for you rosemarie. i would say that there is some ins and outs to this. i think it would benefit a lot -- all our refractories business and steel, that's for sure. our ground calcium carbonate businesses and our talc businesses that go into a lot of -- kind of construction applications, our building products business, our water proofing, our infrastructure water proofing would benefit from that.
if it's a very targeted infrastructure program, it might be different than broad in terms of rail, help our metalcasting business. we do supply foundry into -- our own systems into foundry markets to supply into the rail market. so i think it depends on how broad it is. but in general, if you're talking about highways, tunnels, infrastructure in cities, rail, it's going to be pretty much broad across the company. i would say at least 60% of the company could be impacted by that positively.
rosemarie morbelli -- g. research -- analyst
thank you. that is very helpful actually. and then, if i look at the fourth quarter margins, they are substantially -- except for energy, they are substantially above last year. is that something that could be -- that over the longer term, you can reach on an annualized basis?
douglas t. dietrich -- chief executive officer
yes, i think so. we feel that the changes we've made, how we've improved some businesses that were -- we've been working at improving some of our business that were lower margin over the past couple of years through new technologies, better pricing and mix within some of those product lines. we've been deliberately growing through those -- through new technologies. our consumer-oriented businesses which have, in general, accretive to our margins.
so we've taken the time to do short-term items that we feel are out of balance like pricing and longer-term items where we're focused on technologies and higher margin areas of our business to grow that more quickly and we're doing that, and it's also, we see that there is some opportunities as we grow these, some of these consumer-oriented products globally.
i'll note that our pet care business grew 7% this past year. we've improved the margin profile of that business significantly over the past few years and we're also growing it geographically. so we talk a lot about metalcasting and paper pcc growing geographically, but these specialty products, fabric care products, the bleaching earth and also that pet care business is growing, and in fact our pet care business grew 23% i think it is -- 23% in china this past year.
so we're doing a number of things to change the profile. this year we took out some costs, some structural costs. we did some of that last year as well. so rosemarie, i think, given the product portfolio, the pricing, the cost control and changes to our overhead structural costs, yes, i think that this number is a sustainable number, i think we can improve upon it. we are looking at -- we've got some short-term cost challenges like some transportation that's getting tight around the world that we're moving through.
we've got some energy that comes around in the winter months and some affects our mining costs, but we think those are short-term and we'll manage through them to be able to sustain this type of margin.
rosemarie morbelli -- g. research -- analyst
so if you look at those consumable product lines, what would be the geographic split currently?
douglas t. dietrich -- chief executive officer
well, our pet care business right now, let's just start there, is largely north america, europe, continental europe focused. however, we've been growing that business over the past year in the uk and we've also been growing that business as i just mentioned in asia and china being one of the larger markets.
our specialties business in terms of animal health is europe focused, but we also see opportunities with our customer base in asia, bleaching earth similarly, and our fabric care business is -- really is very global. we operate, if you recall, i think i've mentioned before in a lot of dry laundry detergent both in softeners and surfactant granules and that's largely outside the united states, it's much more in areas of india, southeast asia, china where dry laundry detergent is still in use. so we're growing those. and those are -- those are some rapidly growing markets for laundry detergents. and so in that consumer oriented group, we're growing those areas and that's in performance materials.
in the specialty minerals group, our pcc, our specialty pcc goes into not only automotive sealants but it also goes into pharmaceuticals and food applications and we've recently expanded our two facilities, one in the us and one in the uk. and so we're growing in those kind of consumer applications in both areas. but we've had some real notable growth in europe, in some of those consumer products with specialty pcc. so it's kind of around. it's all of our -- it's all of those product lines and it really is kind of around the world where we see that growth occur.
rosemarie morbelli -- g. research -- analyst
thanks, doug. that is really very helpful. and just one last question if i may. have you given up on elementis?
douglas t. dietrich -- chief executive officer
i can't comment on that right now rosemarie. what i can tell you is that you saw through the releases, the offers that we made. and i think elementis is a strong strategic fit. we felt we made a very strong offer for both their shareholders and our shareholders. and we look to get some engagement. unfortunately, that didn't happen. and that's where we are now. so i'm going to leave it at that.
rosemarie morbelli -- g. research -- analyst
okay, thanks. good luck.
operator
all right. the next question is from mike harrison with seaport global securities.
michael harrison -- seaport global securities llc -- analyst
hi, good morning. maybe just to kind of -- i don't want to ask specifically about elementis, but maybe just comment on the m&a pipeline kind of assuming elementis is in the past, any possibility of some activity in 2021 on the m&a front?
douglas t. dietrich -- chief executive officer
yeah, hi, mike. i will say that we have -- we've got a portfolio of things that we think fit well with the company. i'll give you it's -- they're mine to market. we think we've got capability in the company as we take unique reserves around the world and turning them into specialized functional additive. that's what we do. that's -- we bought amcol, it's very similar when mti bout amcol, similar strategy.
we like -- there is portfolios of similar minerals that we operate in and there is also new minerals that are in markets that we currently serve. and so we've -- but i think, in general, we feel we need to know the element, the mineral, it has to fit into our capabilities from a technology standpoint. and there are other small and larger companies out there and pieces of companies that we have our eyes on. and we think that they can become actionable at some time. we're patient in many cases and we're also very diligent in what we think they're worth.
and so i think you saw that demonstrated what i just said, i think that kind of rounds out how we viewed elementis. we have small things in our pipeline that fit to help us support our reserves and growth around the world, when we're growing in regions like china and elsewhere and we look to make sure that we can sustain that growth and so that's part of the pipeline.
and we think that there is some other smaller pieces to bolt on to our core markets to not just organically grow in those groups. we think we can accelerate that inorganically along that same core product line. so it's a mix of things, both, small some larger, but they all fit that kind of framework of mine-to-market, that technology that we have in adapting minerals to make them specialty, could be our same mineral could be different. but it's something that combines into that market -- those markets that we serve. hopefully that helps.
michael harrison -- seaport global securities llc -- analyst
yes. so that's helpful, thanks. and then wanted to ask, as we're thinking about the margin progression next year, i know you mentioned that about two-thirds of the cost reduction in 2020 would be permanent. that suggested that a third of it comes back at some point and presumably, there is some kind of incentive comp reset. but just how much of a headwind should we think about those factors being on an operating income basis in 2021 versus '20?
douglas t. dietrich -- chief executive officer
matt, do you want to take that?
matthew e. garth -- senior vice president, finance and treasury & chief financial officer
sure. remember, mike, so what we said was we had about $13 million of reduction. included in that $13 million reduction were some costs related to the cyber event. so really on a year-over-year basis you are looking more in like the $15 million range just from an overall expense perspective. so that two-thirds ends up being about $9 million to $10 million, which we would think is sustainable.
now, as you're looking at 2021, that is a combination of some t&e coming back, some positions that we held off on being filled. but that will all be dependent on the growth coming back, right? so, as doug said, we're very disciplined, very prudent with how we spend and we're looking at the growth as it's coming back, and we'll assign expense levels commensurately with those volumes. so two-thirds being permanent and that other piece will merit out as sales come back.
michael harrison -- seaport global securities llc -- analyst
all right. and then the last question i had is on the kind of the raw material front. with your mine-to-market strategy, i feel like you have some insulation from a lot of raw material dynamics. but i am also sure that there are other areas where you are probably going to have to manage through some inflation in '21. what are the segments or product lines where you maybe have some concerns or you are most focused on raw material inflation? and maybe how much of a price lag headwind should we be thinking about for the first half of '21?
douglas t. dietrich -- chief executive officer
maybe i will start with that, matt. i think you're right. we do have -- we're vertically integrated in a majority of our minerals businesses. and so those -- the inflation that would affect those would be much more on the energy side; so diesel fuels, natural gas, etc.
we have a program in place. we look to buy that energy. we think there's some short-term, as matt mentioned, in the winter months, that's a normal occurrence for us and that's why mining costs tend to go up and some of our drying costs for that mineral go up in the winter.
the things we buy, we buy as a precursor to our pcc around the world. however, all of that is formulaic. if we absorb higher costs, we pass that through in pricing and there's a lag. there's some delay in some of our contracts, anywhere from a month to six months. and so that automatically gets pushed through and i think you saw that in 2018, '19 happen. so that's kind of protected in those contracts.
in our refractories business, we do buy magnesium oxide and that has, over history, it moves around in terms of pricing based on demand. we've made a lot of structural changes and some in the past year or two to improve our vertical integration in that product. and so, we maximize the use we have. we can make our own sintered magnesium oxide, which you take magnesite and you put it in a kiln and you make it into what we use in our plants in turkey.
and so we've been maximizing the use. we're probably 25% integrated. probably 50% of our total european business is vertically integrated and we have also built strategic relationships and taken some longer-term positions with -- buying positions with those supply chain.
so we feel through 2021, we are in very good position with the actions we took in 2020 from a cost -- from a raw material cost positions. so i think the things that give us a little concern going into this year, maybe a little bit of energy short-term, transportation is, as i think you're seeing kind of around the world, is becoming tight, both in truck and ship.
and we don't move things between countries very often, we're very localized. we buy and sell and manufacture in the country, so we don't import-export a lot. but truck freight is one of the areas we're keeping our eye on. but we generally are very able to pass that through in terms of our pricing and make sure on a delivered basis, we're covered.
michael harrison -- seaport global securities llc -- analyst
all right. thanks for the color there.
douglas t. dietrich -- chief executive officer
yeah.
operator
all right. the next question is from david silver with cl king.
david silver -- cl king & associates, inc. -- analyst
yeah. hi and good afternoon. i kind of feel like the movie back to school. i have one pcc-oriented question but it has about 17 parts here. but no, i was wondering if d.j. could maybe just to start off, if we could just talk a little bit about the large scale project in china that came on? and in particular, i guess i was hoping you might shed some light on maybe a typical ramp up for that large scale project. and i guess, i would just say, where do you think it is now and over what period of time does it -- does it take 12 months to ramp up to the nameplate capacity or a different time period, the cadence there?
and then secondly also on pcc, i'm looking at my new project list and i was just wondering if you could maybe highlight, i think i have two or possibly three projects; one in europe and one or two in india that are scheduled to come on either kind of right about now or later on, let's say, the first half of 2021. so just a highlight on the cadence of the additional new projects?
and then, finally, i was just wondering, in the fourth quarter, there was a nice recovery there sequentially, but if you could peg kind of a utilization rate on the pcc side, that would be helpful? thank you.
douglas t. dietrich -- chief executive officer
okay. d.j., you want to take that?
d.j. monagle, iii -- group president, specialty minerals and refractories
sure. so let me start with utilization rates. so, i am going to try and work back to where you began. so, on utilization rates around the world, right now we're as projected, as we thought we would see going into the fourth quarter.
europe was probably in the 70% sort of operating rates and looks like they are a little slow coming up to 75%. north america is back into the mid-80s and they will probably be up to 90% by the second half of 2021. that's how they look. that's over a lower base with the shutdowns that went on. so those markets where those operating rates influence our sales are -- have got a pretty solid trajectory going on.
and of course, asia is less driven by operating rates and more by our penetration rate. so let me try and address kind of the 200,000 tons that, to which doug was referring that basically came on.
in india, that plant that we have was some 45,000 tons and that's probably by the end of the first quarter will be, probably, 80%, 90% in terms of its utilization, that is dependent on the customers pull based on the market. but the pcc plant itself and our process of penetrating into their grades and making a smooth transition should be finished -- pretty much finished probably in the second quarter.
the china satellite that started off really just in december is really just getting going. it's reasonable to think that it's at about a 50% sort of utilization right now. that will come up over the second quarter and probably be in the neighborhood of 60% plus, maybe 70% at the end of the second quarter. but that will be up full speed by probably the beginning of the fourth quarter is -- it would be the normal sort of trajectory. we have got some customers in china that move very fast, so it will be somewhat dependent on their customer needs.
and then you mentioned two other satellites that will be coming on in 2021. one is in india and that will -- we thought we'd be starting that in q2. the pandemic has slowed that one down. so both that one and the one in europe will be ramping up more in the third quarter and that european one will be supporting penetration into packaging.
so, i would say that by the end of the year based on those grade mixes that we ought to be seeing running at a rate that's pretty close to design. i hope that helps.
david silver -- cl king & associates, inc. -- analyst
yeah. no, that's great. thank you very much. that sounds very derivative [phonetic].
douglas t. dietrich -- chief executive officer
one other perspective -- sorry, one other perspective i give you is just to put all that kind of in a broader time period. we're kind of -- we're looking right now, given all that happened in 2020 and what we're bringing, what we've -- some of the shutdowns that we saw in 2020 and all that we've brought on and we will be bringing on as d.j. just mentioned.
if you go back to our full year 2019 volumes, we see 2021 the ins and outs of all that, we see 2021 being a higher volume than '19. so i know it's the ramp ups and the timings and the signings and the buildings and all that takes some time. but when you step back, you say from 2019, all of the market changes that have happened and some of the shutdowns we experienced last year, plus everything that we're bringing online and will be bringing online in the first half or by the middle of this year, we see that being a volume positive over where we left 2019.
and in addition, we still see a lot of business development activity happening. we have a nice pipeline of base filler contracts that we are continuing to work through. i think our portfolio of potential packaging opportunities has expanded from where we were in the middle of last year.
and i mentioned a couple of new technologies further out that we think move us into other markets than packaging as well into other fiber markets and maybe tissue. so i want to present that to you from a broader perspective, longer term perspective of the next year or two.
david silver -- cl king & associates, inc. -- analyst
okay, thank you for that. i know we are in -- we're past the top of the hour, so thank you. but just briefly, i was hoping doug might be able to add a little strategic context to the broad base price increase that was announced a few weeks ago. so 3% across the board with certain product lines' highest value is 10%. so when i see an announcement like that, i kind of scratch my head and i say is this because -- doug, is this because you are going on offense or is this because you feel that this is necessary to -- for defensive purposes, i guess, cost increases or logistics issues that you raised earlier?
and then i also kind of scratch my head and i say, well, why is talc meriting a 10% increase whereas many of your other bigger or more popular product lines are skewing to the lower proposed price increase. so i guess, i would -- i was wondering if you could put that in a little perspective.
douglas t. dietrich -- chief executive officer
sure. well, i don't want to sound weird but i don't think it's either. i don't think it's offensive or defensive. i think i got in my mind many cases pricing costs have nothing to do with each other and we price the products on the value that we feel that they bring in the marketplace. and we feel that in many cases our products have tremendous value and in the applications we're putting them into.
and then on the other side of it, we work to make sure that we are the lowest cost most competitive supplier we can be. and so we work every day at lowering and securing our input costs and productivities and variable cost controls to make sure no matter what we are the lowest cost provider of the highest valued products.
and so i think what that is, is as i mentioned, we make sure we look at what our products do and how they create value and that they're priced accordingly. now, we have to take, obviously, the market into -- the market and other substitutions that they may have or other product choices they have into account. and when we do all of that, we feel that these are the appropriate changes to make. so i think it's maybe either neither or some of both, david, i guess, is what i guess i'd answer your question, offensive and defense.
david silver -- cl king & associates, inc. -- analyst
yeah. the answer is frequently it depends, right. last question just real quick for matt. most of the industrial companies that have reported that i track have noted a currency tailwind this quarter, weaker u.s. dollar. and i may have missed it, i didn't hear it in the -- i didn't see it in the presentation slides, i didn't see it in the press release last night. so wasn't there a meaningful currency tailwind translation or otherwise that is included in the results that maybe you could tease out or call out for us? thank you very much.
matthew e. garth -- senior vice president, finance and treasury & chief financial officer
yeah. certainly. certainly, david. not much. it is on the bridge and as you can see there, it is not significant. that being said, the businesses which have the biggest translation opportunities for us from an economic perspective are the pcc business and also on refractory side and that's where you're seeing it this quarter. but in the fourth quarter, it wasn't significant.
david silver -- cl king & associates, inc. -- analyst
okay. that's it from me. i really appreciate it. thank you very much.
douglas t. dietrich -- chief executive officer
thanks, david.
operator
all right. and the next question is from silke kueck with jpmorgan.
silke kueck -- jpmorgan chase -- analyst
hi, how are you?
douglas t. dietrich -- chief executive officer
hi, silke.
silke kueck -- jpmorgan chase -- analyst
i have just a few questions. international paper said they may intend to spinoff their printing paper business and it just felt like a business that's going to consume some pcc. does it matter at all to mtx or it doesn't?
douglas t. dietrich -- chief executive officer
[speech overlap] yeah. i will start and give it to d.j. i don't think -- it doesn't change anything currently with our contracts. it doesn't change anything with how we operate with them. i do think it changes things from a conversation and a focus standpoint.
actually i think it could be a good thing or a much bigger piece of that new entity and i think the technology that we have and the money that we feel we can save through those technologies and enhance their products would be -- is a very good conversation that we'll be having. d.j., anything to add to that?
d.j. monagle, iii -- group president, specialty minerals and refractories
i do, doug. so, silke, the way i'm looking at it, just to build on what doug said. contractually everything is fine and so the base businesses will remain. but if i look at where international paper, the part that is staying as international paper is, they focus more on packaging and our ability to come to them with some higher value-added products as they keep working that strategy is enhanced as demonstrated by what we're doing with them and their new product that they're launching out of selma.
the flip side on this, new company that i'll be focused on in coated freesheet. no question that that helps us position some of the newer products that we have both for high filler technologies and some of these environmental issues, where that group is likely more empowered to really take advantage of these and we think we can help them pretty substantially in improving their performance.
silke kueck -- jpmorgan chase -- analyst
and similarly, pulp prices have really moved and that has -- maybe they went out like $650 a ton in september and now they are close to like a $1,000 a ton. do those -- does that assist minerals technologies in accelerating pcc usage or was mtx agnostic to a higher pulp prices?
d.j. monagle, iii -- group president, specialty minerals and refractories
doug, is it ok if i take that?
douglas t. dietrich -- chief executive officer
yeah. go ahead, d.j.
d.j. monagle, iii -- group president, specialty minerals and refractories
so, silke, it absolutely helps us on these business development programs. so for those customers in our existing satellites or contracts remain in place and they're built to go through the ups and -- the peaks and valleys of any pulp pricing.
but our business development pipeline is very robust. i can't say that we've had increased calls, because the phone lines have been pretty busy, but especially our asian customers or potential customers have, i would say, a heightened sense of interest and a heightened sense of pace in looking at a standard pcc in printing and writing grades and i do think that that's attributed to what they see as the long-term prospects for pulp pricing.
so it does help our value equation tremendously and it does further differentiate us from any other mineral alternatives. so pulp pricing in general helps us with these new projects.
silke kueck -- jpmorgan chase -- analyst
and if i can ask like a last question just on the same subject, how long does it take for a new customer to phase in the product? my memory is that in the old days, it used to take -- it use to take several months because you have to like take one line offline and try the product and try it at various stages and -- like, does it take a year to win a new customer or can you do it in a couple of months or like, how long does the process take?
d.j. monagle, iii -- group president, specialty minerals and refractories
so two different ways of looking at our technologies, for the base pcc, from the time it takes when we sign the deal, it's reasonable to think that nine months to a year before we get the plants up and running and then a few months to transition into our product.
for some of our high filler technologies, where we can promote something to an existing customer, getting through those great structures probably takes six months plus, but that's a sort of pace for those two items.
silke kueck -- jpmorgan chase -- analyst
okay. and my last question is for matt. in terms of, i was wondering if you can share your thoughts about capex for 2021 and any operating cash flow or free cash flow targets you may want to share? thank you.
matthew e. garth -- senior vice president, finance and treasury & chief financial officer
yeah. no. sure. thanks, silke. and as you saw in 2020, it was a strong repeat of what we did in 2019 with free cash flow in that $175 million area, with capex in the mid-$60 million area. so, as you look at 2021, we are expecting capex to rise to around $80 million.
we will be investing in additional growth areas for the company. sustaining capex will largely remain similar to what you saw in 2020. so that additional capex that we are spending is coming from return seeking opportunities.
from an overall free cash flow perspective, look, what we've told you over the past several years is that we expect the company to be able to produce above $150 million of free cash flow. and as we look at 2021, that's obviously what the team will be working to do and we'll continue to update you on that as we move through the year.
silke kueck -- jpmorgan chase -- analyst
okay, thanks much.
operator
all right. at this time, i'd like to turn the conference call back to mr. dietrich for any closing remarks.

operator
[operator instructions] good day everyone and welcome to the first quarter 2021 minerals technologies earnings call. [operator instructions] and at this time, i would like to turn the call over to erik aldag, head of investor relations for minerals technologies. please go ahead.
erik aldag -- head of investor relations
thanks, lisa. good morning everyone, and welcome to our first quarter 2021 earnings conference call. today's call will be led by chief executive officer, doug dietrich and chief financial officer, matt garth. following doug and matt's prepared remarks, we'll open it up to questions. i'd like to remind you that beginning on page 15 of our 2020 10-k, we list the various risk factors and conditions that may affect our future results. and i'll also point out the safe harbor disclaimer on this slide. statements related to future performance by members of our team are subject to these limitations, cautionary remarks, and conditions. now i'll turn the call over to doug. doug?
douglas t. dietrich -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks for the introduction, erik, and good morning everyone. we appreciate you joining today's call to discuss our first quarter 2021 results, and i hope you're all staying safe and healthy. i'll take you through the sales and operating highlights of our strong start to the year and touch on current market trends. i'll then turn it over to matt to review our financial results in more detail, and discuss our expectations for the second quarter. i'll finish up the call today by outlining the progress we're making with a broad range of growth initiatives. last year, our teams throughout the world, worked hard to efficiently operate our facilities, to protect our employees, serve our customers, and simultaneously position us to capitalize on the recovery. as a result of these actions and our continued focus on responding to this dynamic environment, we're well positioned to leverage the momentum from the end of the year to deliver a strong first quarter. before going through the quarter highlights, i wanted to share that we will be discussing our business results today in three operating segments rather than four. as detailed in our earnings release last night, we have realigned our energy services segment and combined it with the environmental products -- product line, in performance materials. i'll take you through this further when i speak about our growth highlights.
our first quarter performance was highlighted by sales and operating growth in every segment. specifically, we drove solid geographic growth in our core product lines, increased volumes through capacity expansions and new pcc satellite start-ups, and improved sales from recently commercialized value-added products. in addition, we continued with our proactive operational measures including pricing and productivity improvements and overhead cost control, all of which drove income and cash flow higher compared to last year. demand in many of our major end markets continued to trend upward. several of our markets recovered to pre-covid levels. these dynamics helped drive sales of $453 million, an increase of 5% sequentially and up 8% compared to last year. generated $59 million of operating income and earnings per share of $1.17, up 4% and a record first quarter eps for our company. in addition, cash from operations and free cash flow were up 68% and 142% respectively over last year.
as we discussed on our earnings call in february, we expected the demand conditions in our end markets would continue to strengthen through the first quarter and that's how conditions played out. consumer-oriented markets such as pet care, fabric care, and food and pharmaceutical remained robust through the first quarter, continuing our growth trajectory. automotive and residential construction markets remained strong. steel markets further improved from the fourth quarter with utilization rates reaching close to 80% in the us, and our paper end markets continue to rebound from a slow 2020. project oriented businesses including environmental products and building materials are recovering and indications point to continued improvement through the second quarter. these mostly favorable end market conditions drove sales growth across the majority of our product lines. performance materials, sales in our household personal care and specialty business increased 14% driven by our global pet care platform, but also double-digit increases in other specialty applications that we've been investing in to enhance our technology and manufacturing capabilities, including fabric care, personal care and edible oil purification.
metalcasting business performed well, as sales grew 32% driven by strong demand in both north america and asia from foundries serving automotive, heavy truck, and agriculture markets. in both regions, improved foundry conditions that we saw in the fourth quarter maintained that trajectory through the first. specifically, metalcasting sales in asia were up 52% over 2020 with much of this growth coming in china. penetration of our blended products has also accelerated in china, and sales increased 62% compared to last year. in addition, we continue to extend our value proposition with customers beyond china. last quarter in india, which is this -- which is the second largest casting market globally, sales of our blended products were up 21% over 2020. within our specialty minerals segment, our specialty pcc business had another strong quarter with sales up 17% over last year. our new capacity expansions are supporting increased customer demand for our food and pharmaceutical and high performance sealant products. in addition, we benefited from exceptionally strong demand, higher than usual in a first quarter for our ground calcium carbonate and talc products that serve the automotive and residential construction markets. paper pcc sales increased 5% driven by improving end market conditions and the ramp up of new satellites. in fact, the net of the mill closures over the past year, the new capacity additions that occurred in 2020, paper pcc volumes this quarter were slightly above the first quarter of 2019. finishing up our sales highlights, our refractory segment had a great quarter with sales increasing 7% over 2020 and margins remaining at 16.2%. this was achieved despite lower laser equipment sales, commissioning of new orders continues to be difficult due to covid travel restrictions.
we also had a solid operating quarter. our performance reflects our team's disciplined execution with managing costs, implementing pricing measures, and driving productivity improvements. as a result, margins expanded across the majority of our businesses. strategically implemented price increases across our portfolio, these increases have fully offset the higher raw material, energy, and logistics costs we are beginning to see. our margins dipped slightly for the company as a whole this quarter, this was primarily due to higher corporate expenses. we see margins above 14% in the second quarter, and have the potential to move higher toward the second half of the year with continued improvement across our businesses. now let me turn it over to matt to review this and take you through the financial results in more detail. matt?
matthew e. garth -- senior vice president, finance and treasury and chief financial officer
thanks, doug. i will review our first quarter results, the performance of our segments, as well as our outlook for the second quarter. now let's begin by reviewing the first quarter results. overall sales in the first quarter were 5% higher sequentially and 8% higher than the prior year as the majority of our end markets remained strong and each of our segments grew sales versus the prior year, now that we combined the energy services segment into environmental products within the performance materials segment this quarter. operating income was $58.8 million or 1% higher than the prior year. as doug mentioned, operating margins improved across the majority of our businesses as shown in the margin bridge on the bottom right of this page. however, a few discrete items impacted our overall margin in the quarter. first, our environmental products and building materials businesses have yet to experience a meaningful recovery due to ongoing project delays and covid related restrictions. lower contribution from these businesses had an unfavorable impact on our margin of approximately 80 basis points in the quarter. second, while our underlying corporate expenses were stable, we experienced higher than usual mark-to-market adjustments related to the change in stock price during the quarter. this is a normal adjustment we make every quarter, and we are calling it out today because of the size of the variance, which was approximately $3.5 million year-over-year. adjusting for these impacts, the rest of mti grew operating margin by 60 basis points over the prior year. continued pricing actions more than offset inflationary cost pressures on raw materials, energy, and logistics. in addition, we continue to drive productivity with a 6% year-over-year improvement in the number of hours worked per ton. going forward, we expect operating margin to expand as our project oriented businesses recover and corporate expenses return to a more normal level. earnings per share of $1.17 was a record for our first quarter, and was 4% above prior year and 8% above the fourth quarter, excluding special items. our effective tax rate for the quarter was 18% and we expect our full year effective tax rate to be approximately 20%.
now let's review the segments in more detail starting with performance materials. first quarter sales for performance materials were $230.9 million, 5% higher sequentially and 9% higher than the prior year. metalcasting sales increased 6% sequentially and 32% versus the prior year as foundry demand remained strong in both north america and china. household, personal care, and specialty product sales increased 7% sequentially and 14% versus the prior year on double-digit growth across several consumer-oriented product lines. building material sales grew 11% sequentially and were 18% lower than the prior year as project activity started to increase late in the first quarter. meanwhile, environmental products moved through a challenging quarter with sales down 4% sequentially and 29% versus the prior year. operating income for the segment was $29.8 million, 9% higher than the prior year. operating margin was 12.9% of sales, at the same level as the prior year. just as a note, these results include the consolidation of energy services into the segment. operating margin was impacted sequentially by seasonally higher energy and mining costs.
i'd like to take a moment to provide some insight on the strength of the margins in this business. excluding environmental products and building materials, which had a weaker quarter than last year, operating margins for the rest of this segment were above 15% in the quarter. as our project oriented businesses recover, we expect overall segment margins to improve accordingly. and looking to the second quarter, we expect continued strength in household and personal care with some leveling off from a strong start to the year. meanwhile, the environmental products and building materials product lines are seeing signs of recovery as more of the types of projects that we serve are getting under way. now overall for the segment, we expect a strong second quarter with sales at similar levels to the first quarter. we also expect operating margin to improve on a sequential basis, primarily due to incremental contribution from our project oriented businesses, continued pricing actions, and continued productivity.
now let's move to specialty minerals. specialty mineral sales were $147.8 million in the first quarter, 6% higher sequentially and 8% higher than the prior year. paper pcc sales were 8% higher sequentially and 5% higher than the prior year, as paper mill operating rates continue to improve and all regions grew sales sequentially. in addition, ramp ups continued for our three new paper pcc satellite plants in china, india and the united states. specialty pcc sales increased 4% sequentially and 17% versus the prior year as automotive, construction, and consumer demand remains strong. process mineral sales increased 5% sequentially and 10% versus the prior year on strength in residential construction and automotive markets. segment operating income was $21.1 million, 4% higher than the prior year. operating margin was 14.3% of sales, and was temporarily impacted by seasonally higher energy costs. looking ahead to the second quarter, we expect continued strength in specialty pcc and processed minerals. second quarter is typically a seasonally stronger quarter for these product lines as construction activity ramps up. however, the seasonal dynamics may play out differently this year given the strong start we saw in the first quarter. we expect paper pcc demand to remain steady, and our new satellites will continue to ramp up. we expect a temporary impact on volumes as north american paper makers take their typically scheduled maintenance outages in the second quarter. now overall for the segment, we expect second quarter sales to be similar sequentially, and we expect higher margin on more favorable operating conditions and continued pricing actions.
now let's turn to the refractories segment. refractory segment sales were $73.9 million in the first quarter, at same level as the fourth quarter, and 7% higher than the prior year, as continued improvement in steel mill utilization rates was offset by fewer laser measurement equipment sales compared to the fourth quarter. segment operating income was $12 million and represented 16.2% of sales compared to 15% in the fourth quarter and 16.2% in the prior year. mill utilization rates improved to 78% in north america and 72% in europe in the first quarter, up from 75% and 70% respectively in the fourth quarter. and looking ahead, we expect the second quarter to be similar from a market perspective. note that there are several customer furnace relines scheduled for the second quarter, and these relines [phonetic] result in temporarily lower demand for refractory products. in addition while our laser equipment sales are typically weighted to the second half of the year, we're also facing delays on laser equipment installations and servicing during the ongoing covid restrictions. and overall for the segment, we expect sales to be relatively flat on a sequential basis and operating margins to remain strong.
now let's take a look at our cash flow and liquidity highlights. first quarter cash from operations was $51 million versus $30 million in the prior year, and free cash flow was $33 million versus $14 million in the prior year. we deployed $18 million of capital during the quarter to grow the business, develop our mines, and improve our operations. we used a portion of free cash flow to repurchase $20 million of shares in the first quarter, and we have repurchased $37 million so far under our current $75 million program. the company is in a solid financial position with over $650 million of liquidity and a net leverage ratio of 1.8 times ebitda. our balance sheet strength provides us with significant flexibility for how we deploy capital to the most attractive opportunities.
now let me summarize our outlook for the second quarter. in performance materials, we expect continued strength across the segment with the recovery of our project oriented businesses, which will improve segment margins. specialty minerals, we expect similar market conditions and typical north american paper mill maintenance outages. our new pcc satellites will continue to ramp up, including a new packaging satellite in europe starting at the end of the first quarter -- second quarter, and our margin should also benefit from improved operating conditions and pricing. in refractories, we expect market conditions to remain strong with temporarily lower refractory products volume due to the timing of scheduled customer furnace relines [phonetic]. and overall for the company, we expect second quarter sales to be similar to the first quarter. we see continued strength and recovery across our end markets and in particular our project oriented business should start to see meaningful increases in activity. the only area of uncertainty is the potential impact of semiconductor shortages that may temporarily impact automotive and steel market end demand. now from an operating margin perspective, we expect to return to above 14% of sales as we continue to implement pricing actions, proactively manage inflationary cost increases, and drive productivity improvements. we also expect another quarter of strong free cash flow. in summary, we have the elements in place to deliver another strong performance in the second quarter. with that, i'll pass it back over to doug to discuss the progress on our growth strategy. doug?
douglas t. dietrich -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks, matt. before opening the call to q&a, let's take a few minutes to highlight the progress we continue to make with our strategic growth initiatives. as i touched on earlier, our portfolio of consumer products which represents approximately 25% of our total sales, remains a key part of our growth strategy, and we delivered double-digit sales increases in these core business. we continue to see opportunities to organically grow them. geographic expansion of our core product lines is one of our growth strategies and asia is a key region for that growth. the first quarter sales in asia increased 33% with all of our major countries contributing. it was driven by broad base of businesses, new pcc capacity coming online at our sites in china and india, continued penetration of our green sand bond products, and an expanding customer base in fabric care, pet care, and edible oil purification. specific highlight in the quarter was our pcc growth where we signed a contract with buying paper for a 50,000 ton satellite in china, which should be operational in the second quarter of 2022. 200,000 tons of new production capacity that came online at the end of last year in china and india will further contribute to volume growth this year as they fully ramp up. we're also on track to commission two additional satellites this year totaling over 70,000 tons, one for our packaging application in europe and another for a standard pcc plant in india. for the past several years, we've invested in developing new technologies for treating industrial waste water and other environmental water challenges. our fluoro-sorb product that addresses pfas contamination is one example of these newer technologies.
as i mentioned earlier, we realigned energy services into environmental products. with this combination, we will accelerate the deployment of these technologies, as we bring together the technical knowledge and capabilities in our current environmental products business with the high flow rate processing expertise that we've built in energy services. this new structure will improve collaboration and better align complementary technologies and capabilities to further drive growth. new product development is an integral part of our growth strategy and we've taken significant steps to improve the speed of execution, increase the number of products commercialized, and enhance the impact of our latest solutions. [indecipherable] mention our new product pipeline, our total portfolio comprises over 300 products from early stage development to commercialization, representing around $800 million of revenue at full potential. this is an increase of about 30% compared to where we were two years ago. we continue to expand sales of our latest specialty pcc products which are supported by our capacity expansions. specific to the first quarter, we launched several new bentonite based formulations for construction drilling applications. acquisitions are also an important part of how we intend to grow and move mti to a higher return, more balanced portfolio. continue to see a strong pipeline of minerals based opportunities that align with our strategic initiatives, and we have the balance sheet strength and flexibility to pursue them. as always we'll maintain our disciplined approach to m&a.
to summarize our call today, the covid pandemic has challenged our normal ways of working, and higher virus rates continue to affect several of our regions. our culture of connectivity and collaboration has enabled us to differentiate mti with our customers, maintain our strong safety and operating culture. we'll continue to build on these strengths during 2021. even though a few of our end markets are only now beginning to improve, we had a solid first quarter with strong momentum across the majority of our businesses. with favorable demand trends in our markets, our new technology launches, capacity additions, and continued strong operating performance, we have the elements in place to go from one of our most challenging years to one of our strongest. with that, let's open up the call to questions.

thank you. [operator instructions] we'll take our first question from mike harrison with seaport global securities.
michael harrison -- seaport global securities llc -- analyst
hi, good morning. congrats on the nice start to the year.
douglas t. dietrich -- chairman and chief executive officer
hi, mike.
michael harrison -- seaport global securities llc -- analyst
the household and personal care business, i think most people associate the pet care business there as being the biggest piece and maybe you can talk about the strength and opportunities you're seeing there, but it sounded like you're seeing growth in other areas. you mentioned fabric care, health and beauty, maybe some of the edible oils or other food and beverage applications. maybe talk a little bit more broadly about what's driving the strength in hpc.
douglas t. dietrich -- chairman and chief executive officer
sure. thanks, mike. so let me start off and then i'll probably pass it off to jon hastings to give you a little bit more color there. yes, the household and personal care business, the largest portion of that business is pet care. and as you know we've been investing in both organically and inorganically growing that portion of that segment or that business. we see a lot of opportunities to continue to invest organically specifically there, but we've also invested a lot in -- not a lot, but we've invested in our other product lines there, which, as you mentioned edible oil purification and in fabric care, and those are starting to expand not only from our traditional geographies but also into asia as a big area for them, and beyond that. and so yes, we are investing in those. we see a lot of opportunities to grow them organically. i don't know, jon, you want to give -- is there anything you can give him more color in some of those product lines and how we're seeing that traction going forward?
jonathan j. hastings -- group president, performance materials
sure, happy to, doug. and hi, mike. couple of things. start with edible oil purification. one of the reasons that we're able to grow is we have a very unique deposit -- mineral deposit in turkey and that we've been able to mine. we built the plant, we run all sorts of trials with customers and over the course of the past couple of years, we've continued to expand that business as they see the value in that unique mineral deposit. that business continues to grow just year-on-year, first quarter we doubled the size of the business to the prior year and that was even up from the prior year before that. so customers are recognizing the value and they continue to see excellent application of the mineral, and we continue to grow.
in addition, if you look at our personal care business, we continue to invest in and expand our capability of supplying personal care products around the world but predominantly here in the united states. those again are unique technologies that the customers really enjoy and apply into their specific uses, and we continue to grow that business. pet care already you know pretty well. we are expanding in different geographies, some new markets we continue to expand with new channels including e-commerce. we introduce new skus and new innovation products all the time and we continue to grow more than twice the market growth. so all sorts [phonetic] of different opportunities. fabric, you know, i'll wrap up with fabric. we have a business that mainly goes into dry laundry detergents. and as those markets continue to grow in different areas of the world, we supply the products out of several different plant sites. and again, we continue to experience the benefits of the technologies and linking up with some of the key producers of the laundry detergents. so again, a variety of different reasons for growth, but i hope that provides a little clarity.
douglas t. dietrich -- chairman and chief executive officer
mike, i'm just going to add one last thought there, and that is, when we talk about personal care, everything that jon just mentioned, is we have a fundamental capability in the company. many of these are bentonite based products, they're technologies that are around the adaptation of that mineral or a tangential technology that's come from that adaptation of that mineral to personal care, to edible oil purification, pet care, fabric care. so they stem from a really deep foundation in the company to be able to supply these products in this kind of market, and that's why we feel investing in it organically, even inorganically is something that really fits well with the company.
michael harrison -- seaport global securities llc -- analyst
all right. and then over on the metal casting side, i think you mentioned that the semiconductor shortage and maybe other supply chain issues is something that is an area of caution on the outlook there, maybe talk in a little bit more detail, if you've seen a meaningful reduction in foundry demand at this point or kind of how they're running and approaching the auto business.
douglas t. dietrich -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes. we supply the automotive industry through a variety of products, both in our minerals biz -- specialty pcc through automotive rheology modification for sealants, of course through our foundry products, and around the world. right now, we haven't -- we're keeping our eye on it. we've seen some impact, i think from -- right now, a lot of the supply chains are very thin downstream. we know the automotive makers are continuing to build and -- inventories of those and we're seeing that continued pull through in our foundries and through our minerals based businesses. that said, we are also aware of some of the commentary, and we've seen a couple of shifts, a couple of days taking out. what we do see and what we do know right now is that if this becomes a little bit more of a challenge here in the second quarter, we think that will be short-lived and that will be made up through the sort of the back half of the year. so a little hard to predict, the best knowledge we have right now is what we've given you in our current forecast. but we're keeping our eye on it, but we think if anything that comes through the second, will just be made up in the back half of the year.
michael harrison -- seaport global securities llc -- analyst
all right. and then maybe one for matt. the free cash flow was obviously very nice in the first quarter here, maybe some thoughts on the cash flow -- free cash flow outlook for this year compared to the $175 million you did last year.
matthew e. garth -- senior vice president, finance and treasury and chief financial officer
i mean, mike -- and good to talk to you. and typically when we come into a year, we tell you we were targeting about $150 million of free cash flow. obviously a very strong start to here in 2021, but as we look through the rest of the year, we continue to think that the $150 million is a good target. embedded in that would be around $80 million to $85 million of capex. that's about $20 million higher than what we did last year. and really that capex is being directed toward the very strong growth opportunities we have across the businesses. as we've talked about in our performance review here today, a lot of our product lines are in either sold out nature or a very strong demand nature. and so being able to make investments that are paying off quickly and are high return in ourselves is really what the priority of that cash flow is and how we're deploying it, thus the increase in capex here this year.
michael harrison -- seaport global securities llc -- analyst
all right, sounds good. thanks very much.

our next question comes from rosemarie morbelli with gabelli research. please go ahead.
rosemarie morbelli -- gabelli research -- analyst
thank you. good morning, everyone.
matthew e. garth -- senior vice president, finance and treasury and chief financial officer
hi, rosa [phonetic]
rosemarie morbelli -- gabelli research -- analyst
so looking -- still looking at your consumer-oriented product lines, that is the largest business but you are obviously growing the other categories. is a margin difference substantial between pet and for example edible oil, my best guess is that pets would be the lower margin.
douglas t. dietrich -- chairman and chief executive officer
well, without getting specifically into the margins, they're all strong margins. i would say, yes, there are some differences, but there's also -- you know, there's some differences by product category, by region. our positions are different, whether you're talking about some bulk products versus some very high specialty products in europe, i would say our edible oil purification is a very specialized product, it's a very high value product. i'll leave it at that. and so i would say that's probably a little on the higher end of the spectrum in that segment. but there is a range of them, and i will tell you that they are improving. we've made significant progress with all of them in terms of our investments in productivity, our investments in efficiencies around the production, but also in driving what we feel is the value added pricing of each of them. and so we're continuing to move those margins north and we still think that through additional scale and those investments that we intend to make, we can drive that even further.
rosemarie morbelli -- gabelli research -- analyst
thanks. still staying with turkey and the bentonite mine, that was a higher quality bentonite than what you had somewhere else, high purity and lightness and so on. did they -- when you acquired it, did they have anything other than pet care applications, or have you been developing the other applications from scratch from that particular resource?
douglas t. dietrich -- chairman and chief executive officer
well, let me talk about -- we have a very high quality bentonite around the world. and so -- but i think you're referring to is our sivomatic pet care acquisition.
rosemarie morbelli -- gabelli research -- analyst
right.
douglas t. dietrich -- chairman and chief executive officer
that -- yes, that did come with those mines in turkey. it is a very -- from a color standpoint, very white and and that leads to what we've done in terms of bringing that as a premium product into the pet care market. and so we've actually developed that very premium white market in europe. and so, yes, the bleaching earth products, that is a mine that mti has had and we've developed this bleaching earth product around the uniqueness of that mineral. but we also have mines elsewhere in the world that can support similar application. so it just happens that we're basing it on those mines for now and that's helped us grow not only throughout europe, but also in that edible oil through new broader markets that i mentioned through southeast asia and into asia. so it's well positioned to help us continue to expand that customer base, like we did in the first quarter.
rosemarie morbelli -- gabelli research -- analyst
okay. and still staying on the bentonite, you mentioned that you are developing quite a few new projects bentonite based. can you give us a little more details on what those new products might be or end market applications?
douglas t. dietrich -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah, sure. we -- again, with our bentonite reserves around the world and obviously the technologies and the capability of the company to adapt to different end uses. one, i just want to highlight, this quarter, we've launched a couple of new -- i know it's different, we haven't talked about it, but some drilling products. and why that's important is because we've seen some really strong customer feedback from our latest products in the drilling area. and when i talk about drilling, i'm taking about large tunneling infrastructure drilling but also horizontal directional drilling. and we've taken some feedback from customers, there is challenges out there around the world and we've adapted some new products to them and recently launched them and the feedback has been very positive. so we think that highlighting not only the capabilities around pet care and around foundry, we wanted to bring a little bit more to some other areas of the company that we focus on that we can adapt our bentonite based products to deliver more value, and that was one example.
other examples i mentioned today in water treatment. we talk a lot about our fluoro-sorb product for wastewater treatment, or that particular pfas wastewater issue. we've got other technologies behind similar to that type of pfas, but other contaminant issues that we've been developing, and they're all surrounded with the technologies that we have in the company. so we've got a nice portfolio, i mentioned 300 different products, $800 million potential in value but there are around a broad range of things, continuing to improve our core products, but developing new ones and infrastructure drilling around our wastewater treatment, which we think is a big area that we can grow into as a company. and that's also behind combining the technologies of not only the mineral technologies, but the processing technology that we have in energy services that we think the two of those together are really going to bring a nice portfolio of opportunity to us.
rosemarie morbelli -- gabelli research -- analyst
thank you. that was very helpful.
operator
our next question comes from dan moore with cjs securities.
brendan -- cjs securities, inc -- analyst
good morning. this is brendan on for dan. just wanted to ask about the monthly cadence of your revenue and demand recovery this quarter and then anything you could -- you can speak to about april as well.
matthew e. garth -- senior vice president, finance and treasury and chief financial officer
yeah. as we came into the year, i think i mentioned that the first quarter, typically we have some seasonality. we actually didn't experience that seasonality here in the first quarter. those businesses that are impacted year after year from that seasonality are your performance minerals business, your performance materials business where you get some slowdowns in customer demand as well as some changes in the mining, a picture that we have in those businesses. demand remained strong throughout the quarter coming in from january at a very good rate from the fourth quarter. i think if you recall what we said in the fourth quarter about the first quarter that we had very strong momentum, that did continue at a nice ratable rate across january, february and march. what you are starting to see and i think doug talked about it a bit, you are seeing some of the movement in the demand for metalcasting just based on one or two days from some of our customers, most of that did continue through in our forecast that we're giving you. so you have that there. but for the rest of the portfolio, you see a very strong look here in april, that momentum is continuing. at the same time, like i said, you saw in the project-oriented businesses, a pickup coming in march, and that is going to be what we're going to see happening in the april, may, june timeframe to help offset some of the things we talked about that are going to take place in the refractories segment where you're going to have some relines, some customer revenue is going to come out, same thing temporarily, same thing is going to happen in your paper pcc businesses when the paper mills take outages. so those revenues are ramping up in the project-oriented businesses. the rest of the portfolio remains very strong outside of those couple of temporary items and that are going to keep sales in a similar basis to where we are in the first quarter.
brendan -- cjs securities, inc -- analyst
that's good then. and then could you speak more on any signs that you are seeing a recovery in demand in the two you called out, the environmental services and the building materials?
matthew e. garth -- senior vice president, finance and treasury and chief financial officer
yeah, i mean i think in march we told you -- sorry, i just told you here in this presentation, you're starting to see some of those projects that we have our products on starting to pick up decisions to be made to begin that commercial construction activity where we participate would be in that underground water proofing through the envelope. so you're starting to see those projects begin to be led that is helping some of the covid related delays that we have seen are now releasing. so people are getting back on to the project site. and that is helping to drive those volumes in those businesses.
douglas t. dietrich -- chairman and chief executive officer
brendan, i'm going to just add a couple of things, one is, i think our -- kind of as you termed that the cadence of our sales this year is quite a bit different than normal. right? and i think you're probably seeing that across for many other companies. we had expected a bit of a slow down seasonally with weather that happens in construction, residential construction, but i'll tell you, with supply chains where they were with the automotive, our demand through the first quarter has been -- was very strong, and we see that continuing through the second. there is some typical things we'll see with some shutdowns of paper mills for maintenance items, those are going to be typical this year. but as we go back what we see going on now is even through today with the strong demand we're seeing across our businesses, we still haven't seen that rebound in several of our product lines and we call them our project-oriented product lines. but we see them building through the second quarter and actually see that strength and even stronger in the back half of the year. and a lot of our offshore environmental products, a lot of our offshore oil drilling, we see a much stronger back half of the year. that's offshore, it usually comes back later than onshore and we see that actually rebounding through the second and even more strongly in the back half of the year. the same thing with our building, waterproofing and those environmental projects. so a little bit different. usually, that's a very strong second and third, and actually we think that's all kind of shifting out and the seasonality is kind of blending through this year, but we think that momentum is gaining through the second and we actually see that that's going to continue through -- potentially continue through the back half of the year. [indecipherable] different this year.
brendan -- cjs securities, inc -- analyst
yeah. okay, thank you very much.
operator
our next question comes from david silver with cl king. please go ahead.

yeah, hi, good morning. so i was hoping to maybe start with a couple of questions on your pcc business. and in particular i was hoping that dj or doug might be able to provide kind of a snapshot of your new project pipeline, or your new project funnel, i forget how you characterize it. but with the global economy reopening and a lot more activity in a number of industries, i mean, is this the type of environment where we might see a quicker pace of project decisions. just maybe if you could highlight what's in the project funnel and based on your experience in other cycles is this the type of environment where maybe the cadence at which customers complete their due diligence and decisions get made is maybe a little bit quicker paced. thank you.
douglas t. dietrich -- chairman and chief executive officer
okay, thanks, david. yeah, let me pass that to dj monagle, he'd give you some insight on kind of current paper market conditions and our pipeline of opportunity.
d.j. monagle, iii -- group president, specialty minerals and refractories
thanks for the question, david. so in general, i'd say that, just to give you kind of the backdrop, we're seeing demands increase, we're seeing extremely strong operating rates in the us which is helpful, and a lot of pull especially from asia for interest in our products. so as i translate that strong demand to what balances that demand is when you shift to us there is some risk of change, but -- so the value is there, the risk of change is still there, but we are seeing increase in pull. if i were to give you some further dimension behind that what we're seeing in particular, things like the baiyun paper project where a chinese paper maker approached us and we were able to convert that into a signed agreement in a relatively short time. we've got a couple of more conversations that we're having with folks in that same sort of light who are offering that same sort of economic value equation. and one of the things that they're getting ready for is they see a major paper maker like chenming putting out a higher quality paper in the region, and they want to be more competitive both from a quality standpoint and the economic standpoint. by the way, another tailwind on that is very high pulp prices right now which are helping our value equation. so, strong demand in china, that continues. strong demand in india as well, that continues. and these are what i would say traditional pcc applications in printing and writing grades. we are seeing some pull also in china for some of our new packaging offerings and -- but that's a little earlier stage in the development. the other thing in terms of our pipeline i'd say in the other areas around the world, not china and india, is there's been some trials and some pull for a new variant of our new yield product. this is a product that we're having good trials with and this helps a customer release some environmental pressures, provides high value pigment that we're able to do more than just help them with the cost equation. and we've got advanced trials in that and i would hope that we're able to commercialize at least one of those soon in particular in europe. then further back in the pipeline, i would say most of the stuff that's early stage is about some of our penetration in the packaging. and those are traditional pcc projects, but also a couple of new products that we're trying to capitalize on and get into the market.
david silver -- cl king & associates, inc. -- analyst
if i could just follow up on a couple of points. so first of all, i'll be stealing your risk of change comment, i kind of like that description. but you mentioned the us market, and some time ago you secured a restart, i guess the wickliffe paper project in kentucky. i was wondering if maybe you could just provide a real quick update on the progress there and whether that trend toward restarting domestic capacity might continue. and then secondly, on your packaging comments, would you say that the packaging opportunities you see are more a continuation i guess of the liner board area of packaging or are you potentially pursuing additional sub sectors i guess within packaging grade papers? thank you.
d.j. monagle, iii -- group president, specialty minerals and refractories
so let me try and take them in the sequence with which you offered them up, david. so, first off, happy about the way wickliffe came on, it's come on strong and we're seeing good volumes and it's indicated in all the comments that matt had made regarding our growth. what i would tell you is, i don't see a lot of restart. so what we see happening is 95% operating rates in north america, demand over the short-term probably increasing as schools and folks come back to work. we'll have to see how that shapes up. but certainly as we get into the fall, we would expect an increased -- somewhat of an increase in demand. that demand might be offset by greater imports. so that is a calculation that we see going on across the board in the industry.
what we are also seeing, though, and this is going to dovetail into the packaging comment. international paper converted their selma operation last year to -- from printing and writing grades to a packaging grade. we were able to help in that transition. they offered a new premium white top linerboard. so because we had a pcc plant on site, we were able to modify our product to help with their strategic goals. we see a similar thing going on in north america at a place like jackson alabama where pca or packaging corporation of america has announced that they will be converting those machines from free sheet opportunities to a packaging opportunity. and it remains to be seen exactly how we'll be able to assist them in that, but they've got the strategic capability that we offer them to go into those white top linerboard grades.
we are seeing -- in terms of our broader packaging portfolio, we're seeing a couple of things. in the white top grades, like i mentioned at selma, like i mentioned at jackson, like we discussed is coming on in the second half of this year in europe. those are linerboards with a white top and our pcc products can be modified to assist there. we've got some excellent coding pccs that are really good in solid whiteboard, that has a premium application or premium printing demand, and something that once -- someone wants to show nicely on the shelf. so we're seeing increased pull for that product, both in china and in the us.
and then finally, we do have some new products that we're orienting toward very traditional brown grades of paper and those are variants off of some of our environmentally oriented projects like new yield has an application there, but we do have some new technologies that we're looking to put into just straight brown boxes and we're in the early stages of that as well. so lots of things going on, but i don't see a lot of conversions back to printing and writing grades in the us other than wickliffe, but in general, i see us being able to help with that transition that we see in packaging in particular, apparently.
douglas t. dietrich -- chairman and chief executive officer
so david, back to your original question -- sorry to interrupt. i think really the question is, is the environment different today for an improvement or a speed of opportunity capture? i think in some ways similar and some ways, yes, it is different. and i think we've done that because we've broadened our product offering and our portfolio for not only just base filler, which is improving, we have a number of opportunities for just those because of the conversions and the cost savings and quality requirements that are needed in the market, also new technologies around packaging and our environmental solutions. and as our customers are challenged with those with higher quality great packaging as dj just mentioned, but also the environmental challenges, we have those technologies too. so i think we positioned ourselves to put ourselves into place to capture more. and i think our pipeline of opportunities, if you ask that to dj, has grown because of that. and so, yes, i think we are well positioned to accelerate on new opportunities on a broader range of areas.
david silver -- cl king & associates, inc. -- analyst
okay, that's great. and then maybe i do have kind of an m&a or capital deployment related question. so in the past several weeks. the topic of outside interest in elementis has kind of cropped up again. and, you know, there are some similarities with the new suiter, there are some differences, et cetera. but i'm just wondering, doug, if you could comment on kind of the m&a pipeline that you see, and again, whether the -- you used opportunity capture, but is the environment one where you think valuations might be elevating or rising and therefore some of your pipeline opportunities might be just out of your comfort zone in terms of valuation, or maybe if you could just characterize at this stage how you see the opportunity set and the overall environment valuation and the willingness to deal as you see here. thank you.
douglas t. dietrich -- chairman and chief executive officer
sure. well, look, i commented acquisitions are going to be a way that we see able to grow the company. we've got a nice portfolio of things that we've been looking at that we think fit with our strategy and our growth strategy, and things that we feel are core to what we do and that we feel we can extend value on. that said -- and again, many of those are in our core product lines, they deal with our core minerals or their tangential and adjacencies to what we do, but pretty close to a market that we currently serve or a mineral that's of a technology that we're very, very comfortable with, it's deep into our kind of culture of the company. that said, i think two things have happened. i think there has been -- there is a lot of money out there. so i think that could play to higher valuations. but i also think that through the past year, companies may have made some decisions about things they want to keep and they don't want to keep. and so i think we'll watch -- and so i think there might be some opportunities that come up, things that people decide that now is the time that we got to be moving on from these that -- and we'll be looking at those that might fit us. of course, as i mentioned, we're going to be disciplined in what we feel we can deliver value for. and if things get too heated, then that's ok. we keep very disciplined about how we're going to approach m&a and how we're going to deliver value for that cash, because we have options for that cash. we have options to put that money into ourselves and we've got plenty of opportunities to grow organically. we've talked about many of them today. we have opportunities for shareholders in terms of direct returns and when we see good opportunities for m&a that we think have the highest return value, we'll pursue those.
david silver -- cl king & associates, inc. -- analyst
all right. that's great, thank you very much.

we'll take our next question from silke kueck with jp morgan.
silke kueck -- jpmorgan chase -- analyst
hi, good morning, how are you?
douglas t. dietrich -- chairman and chief executive officer
good, silke, how are you?
silke kueck -- jpmorgan chase -- analyst
good. i have a question about your guidance. and so this is like the third quarter in a row that you're giving like flat sales guidance. and i think in the fourth quarter you beat that sales guidance, by, you know, i don't know, like $40 million or so, and in the first quarter you beat it by $20 million and you're giving like flat sales guidance again. and usually, that's like a step up of like [indecipherable] million from the first and second quarter. and i understand that you started strong and there was some shutdowns, but those happen every year. and so why the conservative sales guidance? so is it -- or is it just the very low end of what you think you plan to achieve?
matthew e. garth -- senior vice president, finance and treasury and chief financial officer
no, silke, i think what we do every quarter is try and give you the best perspective on what we see at the time. and obviously there is favorability, there is also risk in our forecast. and so we manage those as we move through the quarter. i think what you've seen over the last, call it two or three quarters, is a return of the markets that has been very strong. and that has helped drive volumes faster i think, than what we or anyone else has been expecting. and so, yes, that plays through. here in the first quarter, remember, and i think you just spoke to it, we typically see a seasonal impact in our first and fourth quarters of about 10% in sales. and what we just said was we didn't really see a lot of that in the fourth quarter, we didn't see it in the first quarter. and so you're operating at a very strong rate across those businesses that are typically seasonally impacted. and so that carries through to the second quarter. right. when you would typically see that nominal -- normal seasonal bump up that you just spoke about, well, they are already operating at that rate. the difference here in the second quarter like we spoke about, yes, you have the typical outages in paper pcc. those are temporary, those are typical. you have your temporary impacts in the refractories business where the customers are doing the relines, listen, some of those have been pushed out. and at -- over time, they're going to need to be done. and so you've seen in our refractories business, those three lines being pushed out and so now they're going to start happening. that is in the forecast.
when you look at what is offsetting those and i think this is what you're speaking to, some of the businesses that haven't really come back yet, that you haven't seen the demand return, so those project oriented businesses you just heard doug speak about quite a few of the specific impacts on those businesses, building materials, environmental products, and energy services, and how they're going to transact through the course of the year, you're starting to see those revenues in those projects begin to be lagged [phonetic] and that's what's pulling differently to offset those temporary and typical shutdowns and impacts that we have.
the other thing that we have in our outlook, and -- is the impact from the chip shortage that may impact the automotive and steel markets. and so, like we said, we haven't given a significant dollar amount in terms of what that could be because at this point we haven't seen it. our customers are continuing to perform and pull. but should there be something there, that's the caveat. we've taken some of conservatism based on the fact that we do have customers who were pulling out shifts. and so i think we're giving you a very robust view of what the second quarter could look like from a topline perspective. and importantly, let's remember this, what we're talking about is from a margin perspective, driving the margin back about 14%, right, and on our way as we've talked about previously to getting back to above 15%, and which doug said you may see that coming later in the year as volumes continue to return. point there being, we're dealing with a number of inflationary factors, didn't necessarily impact us in the first quarter, our pricing more than offset the inflationary factors. those are going to continue in energy and in freight into the second quarter. but guess what? our teams have been very active and at the forefront speaking with customers, driving value through the products that we have. and you heard us all say it on this call we price on the value that we deliver, not necessarily on the commodity value. so a good point in fact here is, in the performance minerals business, you've seen us raise prices three times already this year, we're going to continue to drive at that. and so, maintaining that stature, that connection with our customers, sustain ahead of it to move that margin is also important part.
silke kueck -- jpmorgan chase -- analyst
okay, thank you for that. secondly, like usually in the first quarter, it's normally the highest quarter for working capital use. and this year, it's -- like this year in the first quarter is relatively low. and are you able to -- and what is noticeable is that your payables are down quarter-over-quarter. i mean is it the case that there is like a timing issue or are you able to just manage your working capital a little better?
matthew e. garth -- senior vice president, finance and treasury and chief financial officer
yeah, i think we've done some very good things over the past couple of years, focusing on all components of working capital. what you are seeing here in the first quarter is the fact that we've been able to improve the efficiency pretty sizably in both our accounts receivable and in inventories. so we did last year obviously work on our position, our efficiencies in terms of both of those two categories. you're seeing that translate here into the first quarter where you typically see us drawdown in some areas, but revenues are typically rising. and so the efficiency if you look at it on a days basis has improved dramatically on a year-over-year basis.
silke kueck -- jpmorgan chase -- analyst
and last year, i was wondering how much of the -- of the price increases that you have announced in general, like how much of those that you achieve? i remember that you said, we are targeting 3% for pcc, maybe 5% to 10% for our talc product, it was like a wide range rather especially products like the 3% to 10%. how much have -- you've gotten so far, and how much more you're trying to achieve for the rest of the year?
douglas t. dietrich -- chairman and chief executive officer
so silke, let me grab that one. i will tell you it's -- we've pretty much -- well. let me go back. some of our price increases in like paper, it's contractual. so we will passthrough pricing, we have different contracts in refractories that we can move pricing every six months or so. i think when you're referring to some of the percentage increases, yes, we've put up prices, we're seeing conditions and new product and value for those products that we feel we can price. and i would say that we've captured 100% of that price increase -- those initiatives. i'll also tell you that in some cases we're moving pricing already three times this year. all right. something that might only happen once a year in certain conditions, we're moving pricing in some product lines already three times in the first half. so it's different. i would say we've been very successful, we have very close relationships with our customers. we want to make sure that that pricing reflects the value delivered and we also are seeing a lot of the high demand for many of our products that we are accommodating. and so, look, i think we work closely with our customers to make sure that things are priced right, but yes, we've been -- we've done very well at making sure we capture it. and yes, that has covered all of the inflationary increases that we've seen today.
silke kueck -- jpmorgan chase -- analyst
yeah. phenomenal job. thanks very much.
douglas t. dietrich -- chairman and chief executive officer
sure. thank you.
operator
we have a follow-up question from mike harrison with seaport global securities.
douglas t. dietrich -- chairman and chief executive officer
hello, mike.
michael harrison -- seaport global securities llc -- analyst
hi, just one more in, i apologize if you discussed this in greater detail already, but are there some cost benefits from putting the energy services business into the environmental business and kind of removing that segment structure, or is that pretty de minimis?
douglas t. dietrich -- chairman and chief executive officer
no, i think there is not a lot of cost synergies associated directly with that. i think though that the efficiencies associated with being able to tie in those technologies to sell new products, and more of the efficiencies we see on the commercial side, also efficiencies with combining the knowledge base, i think will happen. so not a lot of direct cost synergies, much more on the synergies in terms of technology development, joint development, and on the commercial side.
michael harrison -- seaport global securities llc -- analyst
okay. and then in terms of the inflationary environment you're in, you guys i think did a good job telegraphing that you expected some seasonal increases in energy and in mining costs. were all of those increases pretty much in line with your expectations or did they run a little bit higher than what you were anticipating when you gave your q1 outlook?
douglas t. dietrich -- chairman and chief executive officer
pretty much in line. i think obviously the way you forecast things, it never always plays out exactly that. so i think the team has done a great job of just making sure we're keeping our eye on everything coming at us, not only just in the first quarter but we're looking at that next quarter and all the quarters out. so we've got, like i'd like to call, we've got the -- we have the headlights on and the team has done a great job. i would say, areas that have been some challenging and i think you'll hear this from other companies logistics are very tight, shipping logistics doesn't necessarily impact us. we don't export as much. we operate pretty much localized in the countries where we manufacture and sell. logistics are challenging. but we've been working -- the team has done a great job working through those items. so maybe a little bit differently than we forecast, but from a total aggregate basis, pretty much right on what we thought.
michael harrison -- seaport global securities llc -- analyst
okay. and then last question for me is on refractories. it seems like that business typically has stronger margin in q1 and then the rest of the year is more subdued. is there something structural that causes that or is it just kind of coincidence that that seems to be the trend for the last few years?
douglas t. dietrich -- chairman and chief executive officer
typically the margins are -- historically the margins have been higher in the fourth quarter and that's because that's usually where we sell quite a bit of our ferrotron laser equipment. and i think we've talked about this, i am going to pass it over to brett argirakis who runs the business, but past several years, the businesses has really changed kind of this profile and how it's done and how its margin profile has expanded. and so it's not necessarily a first quarter, fourth quarter anymore. it's a different structure. and it's not just occurred now, it's occurred over the past several years. brett, you want to highlight a little bit more about what you've been doing?
brett argirakis -- senior vice president and managing director, minteq international inc. and mti global supply chain
sure, sure. thanks for the question, mike. yeah, really, it's -- there is a couple of factors. of course, the steel production is critical. so you see the stronger utilization rates, there is higher steel prices so that's driving those rates. and then again, as matt pointed out, the steel makers are pushing those furnaces pretty hard to capture those steel prices. then there is -- the second part of it is our ongoing business focus. this has been in place for some time over the last several years, and really a key focus in product development, we really started developing more efficient formulations that provide our customers with improved performance and really reduce cost per ton of steel. the laser equipment although it slowed down because of covid, we continue to invest in that technology and that's going to come back soon because there's still a lot of customer pull. and in addition, we've done a really good job with expense control, price management, and manufacturing efficiencies. we are also backward -- we have our backward integration in turkey with our ngo and also in our wire in [indecipherable] so we've become very efficient. this team has worked very well together. and then lastly, it's really the new business growth. we announced on our last call five new accounts that are -- some are green, four of the five greenfield sites, and that includes refractory alloy wire and calcium wire. so really a pretty strong performance across the board from our team.
douglas t. dietrich -- chairman and chief executive officer
and mike, one of the things we don't talk about very often but brett just mentioned, it is our vertical integration in calcium. we are the only manufacturer of calcium metal in the western hemisphere, i don't think people know that. but in times like this with demand and logistics and challenges around the world in moving products, being able to be vertically integrated in a core product that's essential to steel manufacturer around the world, that's been demonstrated to our customers. so not only the product development that brett mentioned, our vertical integration, and stability through times like this has really resonated i think with the customer base. and so we're helping bring them more value and stability, and i think that's accruing to us as well.
michael harrison -- seaport global securities llc -- analyst
all right, sounds like a lot of positive dynamics there. thanks for the color.
douglas t. dietrich -- chairman and chief executive officer

good day, everyone, and welcome to the second quarter 2021 minerals technologies earnings call. [operator instructions]
at this time, i would like to turn the call over to erik aldag, head of investor relations for minerals technologies. please go ahead, mr. aldag.
erik aldag -- head of investors relations
thanks, lauren. good morning, everyone, and welcome to our second quarter 2021 earnings conference call. today's call will be led by chairman and ceo, doug dietrich; and chief financial officer, matt garth. following doug and matt's prepared remarks, we'll open it up to questions. i'd like to remind you that beginning on page 15 of our 2020 10-k, we list the various risk factors and conditions that may affect our future results. and i'll also point out the safe harbor disclaimer on this slide. statements related to future performance by members of our team are subject to these limitations, cautionary remarks and conditions.
now i'll turn the call over to doug. doug?
douglas t. dietrich -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks for the introduction, erik, and good morning, everyone. i do appreciate you joining our call. we've got a lot to cover today. i want to take you through the highlights of a very strong quarter and discuss our acquisition of normerica. matt will then review our financial results in more detail and our expectations for the third quarter. and after that, i'll finish the prepared remarks with some commentary on our 13th sustainability report, which we published this week. let me start with a recap of the quarter. building on the momentum generated over the past few quarters, we delivered a strong second quarter with several financial and operational highlights that i'll take you through. first and foremost, this was a record quarter for our company with earnings per share of $1.29. this milestone reflects robust demand across our markets, strong operating performance by our team and continued execution on our growth projects. for perspective, many of our product lines have now reached or exceeded pre-covid sales levels, but others still have room to improve. let me give you a feel for how the demand trends, our performance and strategic initiatives across each of our segments led to these results. in performance materials, our metalcasting business continues to perform very well with strong foundry demand globally and our broad portfolio of consumer-focused businesses and household personal care and specialty remained on their steady growth track. specifically, sales in our personal care business nearly doubled as we introduced new private label skin care formulations and expanded partnerships with major retail brands. another large contributor to the segment sales growth in the quarter was the rebound in project activity in both environmental products and building materials. within our specialty minerals segment, we delivered another quarter of sales growth across all product lines.
paper demand continues to improve in all regions, and we're benefiting from the ramp-up of our new satellites. paper mill operating rates in normerica have reached nearly 95%. and to underscore the current supply and demand situation, one of our customers in normerica recently announced plans to restart a mill to meet the increased demand. in addition, our specialty pcc, gcc and talc businesses benefited from a robust activity in consumer, automotive and residential construction markets. our refractory segment also had an impressive quarter marked by steel utilization rates, which are now above 80%. we've also secured several new contracts, which will drive growth in the second half of this year and into next for both our refractory and metallurgical wire product lines. a combination of these positive trends and business development actions in our segments yielded sales of $456 million, with growth in every segment and geography. we drove these higher sales into operating income of $64 million, up 53% compared to 2020, and margins expanded to above 14% as we expected. our team's disciplined operational execution through pricing actions, productivity improvements and strong cost control enabled mti to deliver these results. we also navigated challenges related to increased input and logistics costs that accelerated during the quarter. our global teams have done a great job maneuvering through a more dynamic supply chain environment, which includes navigating logistics challenges and energy and raw material inflation. we're well positioned to offset these costs with pricing actions that we've been effectively implementing across our portfolio, and matt will discuss this more in his comments. generating strong cash flow, further strengthening our balance sheet and maintaining flexibility with how we deploy our capital to the highest return opportunities are priorities for us.
through the first half of the year, cash from operations and free cash flow were both up 25% over last year. we've been using our cash flow to pay down debt and bolster our liquidity. and we finished the quarter with our lowest net leverage ratio in the past six years. in addition, we've continued with our returns to shareholders through our $75 million buyback program and anticipate fully completing the program under the authorized time frame. financial strength also provides us the capability to pursue acquisitions as we have demonstrated with the purchase of normerica. we advanced our growth initiatives this quarter, focused on new product development and geographic expansion. let me highlight a few specific areas. on previous calls, we mentioned several positive trials and interest with our fluoro-sorb product that addresses pfas contamination in groundwater. and i'm pleased to share that during the quarter, we were awarded our first major sale for a large-scale project at a north american department of defense location. the project has been going very well as fluoro-sorb efficacy has been demonstrated commercially. we have several other similar type projects in our sales pipeline as well as for waste municipal wastewater treatment sites, and we have the manufacturing capacity and technical capabilities to pursue them and further grow sales. on the front, we are ramping up production at our new satellites in asia, which came online at the end of 2020 and represent 200,000 tons of new capacity on an annualized basis. we have another approximately 130,000 tons of capacity coming online now through the middle of next year, including our 40,000 ton expansion for a packaging application in europe, where we will begin realizing the volume benefit in the third quarter. we are finalizing the construction of our 40,000 ton satellite in india, which will start-up late next quarter, and we have also begun construction on a new 50,000 ton satellite in china, which should be operational in the first half of 2022. and finally, we announced the acquisition of normerica this week, which i'll go through in a moment.
to sum up the quarter, it was a very productive one with many positive highlights. we navigated through challenges over the past 18-plus months and created opportunities for ourselves on all fronts, has put our company in an advantageous position to continue to drive profitable growth going forward. as i mentioned on the previous slide, the exciting news this week is our acquisition of normerica, and i wanted to spend time discussing who they are, why we pursued the transaction and how normerica fits into our global pet carebusiness. acquisitions are an important component of how we plan to grow and move mti to a higher return, more balanced portfolio, and we've discussed our pipeline of opportunities that align with our strategic initiatives. normerica was one of those opportunities as it continues to shift to a more balanced sales portfolio and aligns extremely well with our overall growth strategy in pet care. for background on normerica, the company was founded in 1992, headquartered in toronto, canada, and is a leading supplier of branded and private label pet care products in north america. normerica has a long history as a well-run company with an impressive track record of innovation, customer service and profitable growth. product portfolio consists primarily of bentonite based cat litter products, which are manufactured in facilities in canada and the united states. normerica has about 320 employees, and in 2020, generated revenue of approximately $140 million. let me give you some more details on the transaction and its rationale. the combination is highly complementary from a geographic, product portfolio, customer and operating perspective. normerica's portfolio of branded and private label bentonite based cat litter products fits well within our north america business. in addition, normerica's strategically located footprint throughout the u.s. and canada, combined with our vertically integrated mine-to-market model, gives us a unique position in the cat litter market. we are now one of the largest vertically integrated private label pet litter providers globally with a strengthened position in north america.
we see further benefits as we can provide enhanced value in terms of consistency and quality and are positioned to serve a broader customer base more efficiently. the purchase price for the transaction was $185 million on pre-synergy ebitda of approximately $20 million. we will realize synergies from the transaction by leveraging our combined operational footprint and vertically integrated model and through the deployment of our business processes. on a post-synergy basis, we expect the transaction to be about 7.5 times ebitda, similar to the sivomatic transaction and earnings accretion to begin in the fourth quarter of this year. we expect to fully integrate the business, employees, systems and processes over the next few quarters, and accretion will ramp up to 5% to 7% on a full year basis in 2022. let me step back and describe our existing pet care business. we've been profitably growing this business since the acquisition of amcol in 2014. our acquisition of sivomatic in 2018 gave us a differentiated mine-to-market private label presence in europe, normerica is an extension of that private label growth strategy. pet care sector provides stable growth rates and attractive dynamics as domesticated cat ownership continues to rise globally. we are uniquely positioned to serve this market and have invested in expanding our vertically integrated capabilities and product portfolio globally. in addition, the strength and resiliency of our pet care business was demonstrated during the past year when demand was at an all-time high during a period when our businesses serving industrial markets were impacted. on the lower left of the page, you can see how our pet care sales have grown organically and inorganically since 2017. and with the addition of normerica and sivomatic, our pet care business has grown from $78 million to $350 million, and our household and personal care business is now the largest product line at mti. this represents a significant shift in our portfolio toward noncyclical, consumer-oriented markets, positioning our company to drive growth rates above our historical averages, and we see opportunities to further balance our portfolio. in sum, normerica is a great strategic fit with our company, and this transaction provides many compelling opportunities for growth and value creation. we welcome our newest employees to mti and look forward to working with them on a seamless integration.
with that, let's turn it over to matt to go through our quarter performance in more detail. matt?
matthew e. garth -- senior vice president, finance and treasury, and chief financial officer
thanks, doug. i'll review our second quarter results, the performance of our segments as well as our outlook for the third quarter. and now let's begin with the second quarter review. sales in the second quarter were 28% higher than the prior year and 1% higher sequentially as demand remained strong across the majority of our end markets, and we started to see higher levels of activity in our project-oriented businesses. operating income, excluding special items, was $64.1 million, 53% higher than the prior year and 9% higher sequentially. operating margin improved from 13% in the first quarter to 14.1% in the second quarter. the sequential margin improvement played out largely how we expected as we benefited from the incremental margins of our project-oriented businesses, a more normalized level of corporate expenses and continued pricing actions and productivity, all of which helped to offset higher-than-expected inflationary cost pressures. as you can see in the operating income bridges on this slide, we saw higher costs in the second quarter. the higher costs were primarily driven by energy, logistics and certain raw materials such as lime and packaging. our teams have done an excellent job managing through these challenges, and we are in the process of implementing additional price adjustments in the third quarter, which will help mitigate the impact on our margins going forward. in some cases, the price increases are contractual as with the pass-through arrangements in paper pcc and in other cases, they are negotiated based on the value that our products provide. meanwhile, we continue to control overhead expenses with sg&a as a percentage of sales at 11.3% versus 11.7% in the first quarter and 13.1% in the prior year. earnings per share, excluding special items, was $1.29, a record quarter for the company and represented 52% growth above the prior year and 10% above the first quarter.
our effective tax rate for the quarter was 18.9%, excluding special items, and we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 20% going forward. and now let's review the segments in more detail, starting with performance materials. second quarter sales for performance materials were $238.4 million, 24% higher than the prior year and 3% higher sequentially. metalcasting sales grew 52% versus the prior year as foundry demand remained strong in north america and china. sales were relatively flat sequentially, and were only modestly impacted by the global semiconductor shortage, which caused a limited number of foundry customers to take downtime in the quarter. household, personal care and specialty products, our most resilient product line last year, grew 17% versus a relatively strong prior year quarter. demand for our consumer-oriented products has remained strong and growing, driven by continued new product development and expansion into new customer channels and geographies. we also saw higher volumes of our specialty drilling products, which are benefiting from a rebound in construction, infrastructure and oil drilling activity versus the prior year. environmental product sales grew 6% versus the prior year and were 53% higher sequentially, driven by improving demand for environmental lining systems, water and soil remediation and wastewater treatment. as doug mentioned, we also delivered on the first major commercialization of our fluoro-sorb technology for pfas remediation in the second quarter. building materials sales grew 17% versus the prior year and were up 12% sequentially on higher levels of project activity. in north america, we are seeing more commercial construction and infrastructure projects move forward. while in europe, projects have been slower to advance as countries are still in varying stages of reopening. operating income for the segment grew 55% from the prior year to $34.7 million and was 16% higher sequentially.
operating margin was 14.6% of sales versus 11.7% in the prior year and 12.9% in the first quarter as higher volumes and our strong operating performance drove incremental margin improvement. now looking ahead to the third quarter. we see continued strength in household and personal care and foundry demand remained strong for metalcasting, with lower volume sequentially due to seasonal foundry outages. meanwhile, the pipeline for our project-oriented businesses, environmental products and building materials continues to improve in north america, and the current outlook for the third quarter looks strong. however, we remain cautious on some of our international projects given the potential for a slower reopening outside the u.s. due to covid. i'd also like to note that we are seeing higher costs for the plastic and fabric components of our environmental and construction mining systems. while this presents some near-term margin pressure, we expect to fully offset these higher costs through the ongoing efforts of our supply chain team as well as through pricing adjustments. overall, we expect another strong quarter for this segment with organic sales and margins at similar levels to the second quarter. in addition, normerica is now part of the performance materials segment, and the acquisition will contribute two months of sequential sales growth to the segment in the third quarter. as doug stated earlier, we expect modest eps accretion to begin in the fourth quarter this year as we move through the integration period, ramping up to full run rate accretion over the next 12 months. and now let's move to specialty minerals. specialty minerals sales were $142.7 million in the second quarter, 30% higher than the prior year and 3% lower sequentially. paper pcc sales grew 31% versus the prior year on recovering paper demand and the continued ramp-up of three new satellites.
specialty pcc sales grew 24% versus the prior year and higher demand from automotive, construction and consumer end markets. overall, pcc sales were 5% lower sequentially, primarily due to temporary paper mill outages in india related to covid-19 and the typical seasonal paper mill outages we experienced in north america. process mineral sales were 31% versus the prior year and 2% sequentially on continued strength in residential construction and consumer end markets. operating income for this segment grew 31% to $20 million and represented 14% of sales. inflation impacted this segment the most, primarily driven by lime and energy cost increases. we have been managing the impact with our supply chain team, and we have been adjusting pricing throughout the first half of the year accordingly. we expect the inflationary cost environment to continue, and we will also continue with our price adjustments throughout the second half. as you'll recall, the price adjustments for paper pcc are contractual, and they follow a predetermined schedule. now moving to the third quarter, we expect higher volumes for paper pcc on higher sales in india and the ramp-up of our packaging expansion in europe. we also see continued strength in specialty pcc and processed minerals. and overall, for the segment, we expect the third quarter to be similar to the second quarter. sales should increase modestly on a sequential basis. however, we do expect margin pressure to persist due to ongoing higher costs and the timing of paper pcc increases. and now let's turn to the refractory segment. refractory segment sales were $74.5 million in the second quarter, 33% higher than the prior year and 1% higher sequentially, as steel utilization rates continue to strengthen in the second quarter. segment operating income was $11.7 million, 98% higher than the prior year and 3% lower sequentially, and operating margin was strong at 15.7% of sales.
steel utilization rates have improved to 84% in north america and 77% in europe, up from 78% and 72%, respectively, in the first quarter. steel production at these levels, we should continue to generate strong demand for our refractory products and the productivity that they provide for our customers' furnaces. as doug mentioned, we see growth ahead for this business as we signed two additional long-term contracts in the second quarter. we've now signed a total of seven new contracts worth $80 million over the next five years, which will provide $16 million of incremental annual revenue ramping up through 2022. looking ahead, strong market conditions are expected to continue in the third quarter. we should benefit from a few additional laser equipment sales in the third quarter. however, we expect the bulk of our laser equipment sales to occur toward the end of the year as our teams are able to perform more on-site installations. and overall, for this segment, we expect a similar performance sequentially. now let's take a look at our cash flow and liquidity. second quarter cash from operations was $67 million versus $64 million in the prior year, bringing year-to-date cash from operations to $118 million versus $94 million last year. this was a 25% increase. we deployed $22 million of capital during the quarter on sustaining our operations, mine development and other high return opportunities. we continue to expect capital expenditures in the range of $80 million to $85 million for the full year, split evenly between sustaining and growth capital. year-to-date, we have used free cash flow to repurchase $37 million of shares. and in total, we have repurchased $54 million under our current $75 million share repurchase program. as of the end of the second quarter, total liquidity was over $700 million, and our net leverage ratio was 1.6 times ebitda. for the acquisition of normerica, we used $85 million of cash on hand and $100 million of our revolving credit facility.
this will initially bring our net leverage ratio to approximately 2 times ebitda on a pro forma basis, and we expect to pay down the incremental borrowing over the next 12 months. our balance sheet remains in a very strong position. and this strength provides us with the flexibility we need to continue to invest in high value, high-return growth opportunities. we expect strong cash flow generation to continue in the second half of the year, and we see free cash flow in the range of $150 million for the full year. and now let me summarize our outlook for the third quarter. overall, we see similar conditions in the third quarter across our end markets to what we saw in the second quarter. our consumer-oriented businesses remain robust and paper demand should continue to improve through the third quarter. we will have the typical foundry customer maintenance outages, and our project-oriented businesses should continue their recovery. we continue to watch for potential covid related shutdowns that may impact some of these projects. inflationary cost pressures will continue in the third quarter. we are keeping pace with higher costs through pricing actions, some of which we have already implemented and other price adjustments, primarily in the paper business, which will be implemented contractually through the second half. overall, for the company, we anticipate another strong performance in the third quarter with a similar level of operating income to that of the second quarter as well as continued strong cash flow generation. i'll note here again that we also see two months of sales from the acquisition of normerica in the third quarter, along with purchase accounting adjustments and integration costs. accretion from the acquisition will begin ramping up in the fourth quarter.
with that, i hand it back over to doug to give you the highlights of our latest sustainability report. doug?
douglas t. dietrich -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks, matt. before we conclude, i'd like to take a quick moment to highlight the publication of our 13th annual sustainability report. this year's report is a significant step forward in terms of reporting and outlining the significant progress around our broad range of sustainability goals. you'll see in the report that we've already exceeded our reduction goals in four of six targets -- or six targets related to emissions, energy and water and are on pace to achieve the other 2. in addition, we provided more details regarding our safety culture, how we've evolved our product portfolio toward more sustainable solutions and initiatives around employee engagement, diversity and inclusion and community outreach. i'm very proud of the progress we've made advancing our objectives, which is a direct reflection of our employees' involvement and dedication to sustainability at mti. i encourage you to review the report, which is available on our website. to conclude, i want to extend my thanks to our 3,500 plus employees for delivering a strong quarter. and also like to welcome our normerica employees to mti.
with that, let's open it up to questions.
",":
operator
thank you. [operator instructions] and we'll take our first question from daniel moore with cjs securities.
daniel moore -- cjs securities -- analyst
thank you. doug and matt, good morning. thanks for taking my questions.
douglas t. dietrich -- chairman and chief executive officer
hi, dan.
daniel moore -- cjs securities -- analyst
i'll start with normerica. really nice to see, obviously, strategically a great fit. can you talk a little bit more in terms of detail on the synergies you expect to achieve? i assume you're a supplier there previously. so opportunity to capture margin? and are there any revenue synergies over time as well?
douglas t. dietrich -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes, we do see synergies, dan, largely around -- in my comments, i mentioned the strategic operating footprint that normerica brings to our vertically integrated positions in our mines and also some of those locations. so, we see, over time, leveraging that footprint, which is throughout united states and canada to reach a broader base of customers. we do see some integration of business processes. and yes, there will be also throughout time, some clay or supply chain synergies through our clay supply. so, kind of three fronts; longer term, as we look at this as a much -- we now have vertically integrated positions in europe, north america and asia. and even in australia for private label pet care. and as our positions are selling bulk business to branded customers, but also now through packaged product around the world. and so being able to supply with that type of stability, quality and innovation, both regional and global sets of customers, we think there's opportunity on the sales front there so, works really excited about the transaction. happy to have 320 new employees join the company, and we're excited to get started on growing this business. as a matter of fact, we've been growing our pet care business, about 18% compound over the past three years organically. that's organically. now, i think globally, we can probably keep up a pace of two times the market, which is probably -- market pet care is growing at about 4% globally. we think we can sustain double that. so, this brings a large and growing and very resilient and stable product line of the company. so that's why we're excited about, dan. so more to come, but that's where we see getting those synergies.
daniel moore -- cjs securities -- analyst
excellent. beyond normerica, i think the biggest positive surprise, at least for me, was the pickup in enviro and construction technologies. and obviously, the contract of fluoro-sorb. can you maybe discuss the momentum you're seeing there and sustainability?
douglas t. dietrich -- chairman and chief executive officer
so, we saw this coming. i think last quarter, we projected that we felt that as kind of projects opened up around the world, largely, these are international. i think they've been moving forward in north america, but internationally, covid shutdowns of construction sites and covid related delays in terms of decisions around new construction sites for what we are seeing for the past 24 months. that did start to -- we saw that in the first quarter. those decisions made, sites opening up and product moving and completing those projects. we anticipate a similar quarter in the third. i guess the only caveat is, again, covid related shutdowns outside the united states is our primary concern, largely in southeast asia right now. so right now, we look for a similar quarter going into the third, but little hesitancy there to make sure that that keeps going with covid variants.
daniel moore -- cjs securities -- analyst
got it. maybe one more beyond fluoro-sorb what are the maybe one or two products technologies you're most excited about in terms of incremental potential as we think about 22, 23, et cetera?
douglas t. dietrich -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes, that's a great question. well, first off, as you say fluoro-sorb. we're really excited about that. but there's a number. what -- why don't we do this? how about i'm going to go around and just ask each of the business unit presidents for what they think. so, me giving it to you, why don't we start with d.j., there you want to answer dan's question.
daniel moore -- cjs securities -- analyst
i'll take more color on fluoro-sorb too. i wasn't trying to overlook that.
douglas t. dietrich -- chairman and chief executive officer
i'm going to let jon do that. but how about this, d.j., give us -- let's go around. d.j., you start, what do you think in paper and performance? what are the -- what are you most excited about?
d.j. monagle, iii -- group president, specialty minerals and refractories
yes. boy, doug, on the performance minerals side, certainly, the specialty pccs that we're launching are exciting. we're getting a lot of market pull out from the sealants business on those. and now on the paper side, all this work we've been doing to try and penetrate packaging is starting to show good traction, especially on some new products we just ran a trial in brown paper with something that's off of our new yield platform, and that looks solid. and then we've got a couple of other promotions that we're pretty active on on new products for packaging. so, i would say those are the ones that are most exciting to me, doug.
douglas t. dietrich -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks, d.j., jon?
jonathan j. hastings -- group president, performance materials
dan, a couple of things. i'll come back to fluoro-sorb over in a second. let me talk about the portfolio a little bit. first of all, gets me pretty excited because we're introducing, on average about 30 products per year, and we're on track to do that again this year. you've heard about our [indecipherable] business. it's what we call edible oils, also supplies into biodiesel. so, we continue to innovate more, selling that plan out pretty well and looking for ways to expand it. personal care, one of the key drivers, doug mentioned, the significant growth in personal care. one of the drivers is the new formulations, new technologies as we're dealing with the customers and figuring out new ways to put ingredients into our products that we haven't done before. so again, it's enabling us to almost double that business. pet care, you heard about, we've got eco-friendly packaging. but we also look at the new geographic reach that we have with normerica enables us to bring our new innovative products to the southeast u.s. and california markets. so pretty exciting there. i'll just wrap up. we've got drilling products, new products that are coming out. they are tailored for various types of drilling and various types of solars that are encountered. and they're doing extremely well. so let me come back to fluoro-sorb, because i know that was part of your question and the interest as well. we've spent a lot of time developing the product. we saw a market need a couple of years ago. and we introduced our gen one a little while back.
that's what's been selling recently. we've also got a gen two that we've recently commercialized, it's a battened technology, so very unique, and it's double the efficacy and the efficiency of removal of pfas. but what gets us really excited is this project, not only the size but also the timing. and it's really an affirmation of the technology that we have and the opportunities that we see. in addition to that, we've got some really good news published by the orange county water district. and we've talked about cleanup of drinking water. we see that as another market in that fluoro-sorb, will be able to attack. and orange county is really important because they're kind of the model for a lot of the water districts around the world. and so a lot of people are watching us, and the results are showing that we've got a really, really good product that's very cost-effective and very efficient at removing pfas. so, we're excited about it. we watch what's happening in the regulatory environment. it's advancing at the national level and also at the state levels also oversees. so, there's a lot of opportunity. time will tell how big this can be. but again, pretty excited about the technology there.
douglas t. dietrich -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks, jon. brett, how about our refractories?
brett argirakis -- senior vice president and managing director
yes. thanks, doug. really, if you look at what we've done, there's the product portfolio transition to our hybrid products that really allow us similar or better durability at improved cost. i mean, this is -- this has been really, really great for us and taking it to the next step. we continue to piggyback off of -- of the original formulas to continue to improve. and then secondly, it's the automation of our application in laser equipment. i think tying these together has been really a great foundation for us driving those new agreements and to promote technology from intech.
douglas t. dietrich -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks, brett.so, dan, i don't have more than you ask for, maybe, but there's a lot going on. we -- like jon mentioned, we launched 42 products last year. we're on a similar pace to commercialize about a similar number this year, more of them around sustainable solutions for customers and even ourselves, and it's broad-based. so, we've got a lot of things going, and we're pretty excited about a number of things.
daniel moore -- cjs securities -- analyst
i'll take the detail. congrats on the momentum, and i'll follow-up with any offline. thank you
douglas t. dietrich -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks, dan.
operator
the next question comes from silke kueck with jpmorgan.
silke kueck -- jpmorgan -- analyst
good morning. how are you?
douglas t. dietrich -- chairman and chief executive officer
hi, silke. how are you?
silke kueck -- jpmorgan -- analyst
good.i'm also going to start with normerica, if that's ok. so, looks like the ebitda margin for normerica is around like 14% and what you're hoping to get to? is it maybe, like 18%, something like that, so maybe this is like $4 million or $5 million synergies you can take out. how about the ebit margin? you talked about the ebit margin pre-impose synergies. do you think there'll be like a 100 basis point gap to where mpx's ebit margin is 14%?
jonathan j. hastings -- group president, performance materials
so, i think from a synergy perspective, if you listened to the prepared remarks, you're right, what doug guided to in terms of that pre and post multiple would tell you the synergies we're projecting are in the $5 million to $7 million range. from an ebit margin, we're still early days, and we're working through the purchase accounting adjustments. what i'll tell you is, based on the existing dna in normerica, plus the step-up that we're projecting and this is just an estimate, we'll give you a better sense of what the real number is next quarter. you can think of that in the $8 million to $10 million range.
silke kueck -- jpmorgan -- analyst
thanks for that. secondly, i also have a question about fluoro-sorb. so the project, you said is used for -- it's used with the defense department. so, it's presumably related to cleaning up of contamination from like firefighting foam. can you explain exactly what your product does? and is it use solely? or is it used in combination with something else? and if you have like one cleanup side, i guess, the product used for a couple of months or for a year? and what revenues do you expect from this one project?
douglas t. dietrich -- chairman and chief executive officer
so let me start and just give you kind of scope of this one project. yes, you're right. this is -- and then i'm going to pass it over to jon to give you some more technical detail. so a bit of a history here. the company has been in water treatment for a long time. and the products we've developed around remediation of groundwater applied outside of pfas, but also in our energy services product line through the cleanup of produced water & flowback water from offshore oil. that business started with products that enable the products the company developed to enable that type of cleanup to epa standards so that we could do this offshore on the platform and insights around groundwater contamination. so, it's really bringing together past practice and process knowledge, equipment knowledge to be able to create a product that is specifically attracts the pfas molecule. and yes, this one. so we have this product. we've been testing it in different applications, both in kind of acute cleanup sites. and as you know from the news, the department of defense has been using fire foams, and this is one of those applications. but also, as municipal water companies look to make sure that they can obviously clean water for drinking purposes. there are a number of other products that are used. what i can tell you is our product is a very cost-effective product. it can be used, i believe, in conjunction with others. i'm going to let jon talk about that. but this one project. and the reason we highlighted at this time is it's probably a $1.7 million project. we've had a number of smaller projects and moving around and test cases. but to be able to demonstrate it on this scale is noteworthy, and it also opens the door to some of the things jon has mentioned, other projects like we have of this type and smaller, but also bigger in the pipeline. so more on how it works or give you some technical details. jon, why don't you add a couple of technical details on how this one project works and how we're applying it in others.
jonathan j. hastings -- group president, performance materials
sure, sure. so silke, the real advantage of fluoro-sorb is that it is absorbent that is attracted to both short-chain and long-chain molecules from pfas. pfas generation. as you know, pfas is not one type of material, it's a family of materials with a variety of different properties. but what we have found is that our technology has anchor sites, where we bind those pfas molecules to the surface of our absorbent. and it ties it up, and it doesn't let it go. so, it's really, really effective in cleaning up water, cleaning up soil. they can be put into municipal drinking water and municipal wastewater. it can treat landfill leachates, it can go into in situ, soil and groundwater remediation, we can pump it into the ground and again, it can prevent the migration of any plums that might exist in the ground. like doug said, we've tested it right now. we're working 75 different projects worldwide. the results are coming back to the efficacy is multiples higher than the most common -- commonly used activated carbon. it's also very cost-effective versus ion exchange. and so we have -- certainly, they're competing technologies and great products, but our product seems to have a lot of interest because of the efficacy that it has. so, it binds those molecules and it absorbs is to the surface, and it doesn't like go. so, it's a very effective extraction mechanism.
silke kueck -- jpmorgan -- analyst
if i can ask the last question, do you have to reclaim the absorbent since you have to dispose of those?
jonathan j. hastings -- group president, performance materials
at some point in time, you would have to dispose. so they can be incinerated or they can put and be put into a landfill. again, we're working with a lot of the landfill operators to understand their needs and requirements. but yes, you would have to dispose it. it can be also used -- i know part of your question was whether it can be used in combination with other materials? yes, it can. and so, we find that there are some applications where they may have large volume, and they use one filtration medium first and then they really get the effective absorption through the fluoro-sorb. so, a variety of different ways it can be used.
silke kueck -- jpmorgan -- analyst
thank you for the detail explanation. want to ask two more question. one on refractories. can you remind me how large your refractory business is in asia and in china? and do you think that's a business that over time -- my memory is that it's a very small. do you think that's a business over time that you -- that you'll explore or that you're interested in? or what was refractory business in general, something that's long-term, that's not going to be core?
douglas t. dietrich -- chairman and chief executive officer
so, yes, you're right. our business in china specifically is small, and that's -- didn't that wait for a long time. it's not -- it's been a challenge. the market is different in china. first off, there's a number of different refractory producers and providers, and many of them, by the way, are part of the steel producers. and so it's never been a very large business for us, we do have a number of strategic producers, there a few strategic producers, steel producers that kind of value the productivity that our product brings, but i don't think that's a focus area that we see that's going to grow for the company. however, india has been a very good market for our products, and it's been growing consistently over the past 10 to 15 years. we also see southeast asia also from that india business and being able to supply from japan, which is also a very sizable business for us. so, i think overall, asia is about 10% of the refractories business, so, it's small, but india, southeast asia and japan have continued to grow. our main markets for refractories are north america and europe. those two markets really kind of value the productivity that we bring, a basic oxygen furnace or an electric arc furnace. and as brett mentioned, the technologies that we've developed in terms of our new hybrid products, which are higher-performing at a similar price for our customer tying that with even more automated application and laser technology, improves not only performance in eaf or bof furnace, but also the safety associated with the application and being able to move people out of the way of that furnace. and so, wrapping that technology of applications, the product efficacy and the laser technology that we bring, those three things are what's really -- and largely, what's behind the $80 million of business that brett has secured for the next five years. so that's where this business has moved, but that value proposition plays a little bit more in north america and europe with producers and the kind of productivity requirements and cost requirements that we have here.
silke kueck -- jpmorgan -- analyst
thank you. and my last question is just about, like, the general performance of the businesses. it looks like your minerals business, refractory business, the performance materials, all operating at -- like you said, like pre-covid level or very similar to it. and the only area that's a little bit behind is pcc, and yes, i understand you're expanding capacity. do you think that sales and profitability levels for pcc can get back to 2019 levels in 2021? or what do you think it's more of an event for 2022?
douglas t. dietrich -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes. i think -- so there's a couple of areas that are still a bit behind. i think paper demand is going to continue to improve. i think with, bit of return to office and schools, will start to drive some of that demand higher. and i think you're starting to see that with the announcement of domtar opening -- reopening their ashdown mill, probably in the first quarter of next year. i also -- our environmental products business and in that energy services, there still room to rebound in terms of offshore. our project-oriented businesses are through the second quarter, just starting to click. so there's some other pockets in the company that have yet to rebound that i think, provide continued sales and earnings growth in the second half of the year. that said, we're also watching -- we had some shutdowns in india with paper pcc due to covid. we're still watching some of those project-oriented businesses. so, we're not through this yet outside the united states. so, silke, i think there's some room to grow. now, can paper pcc get back? i think it's probably a 2022 event at this point that we move back toward those types of margins. i think we'll see the demand growth and with the demand growth here in the united states coming back in the first quarter, plus we also have three new satellites that will be online in the first half of next year and the continued ramp-up of the ones we put in. further out, though, i will tell you that what d.j. mentioned in terms of our packaging opportunities. we are seeing traction in our new technologies like newyield into packaging, plus packaging opportunities in our pipeline. i think those, as they become more near-term actionable, they are actionable now, but as they become more real in the near term, that will drive -- that probably into next year, that will drive those margins higher as well.
silke kueck -- jpmorgan -- analyst
thank you very much.
douglas t. dietrich -- chairman and chief executive officer

our next question comes from david silver with clk.
david silver -- clk -- analyst
yes. hi. good morning. so, i wanted to start with a couple of questions about your pcc business? and you guys have done a great job in the prepared remarks kind of doing the new capacity walk. i appreciate that. but i did want to maybe just ask d.j., a couple of things. first, with the new -- with the restart, i guess, of the domtar plant. could you just characterize that maybe in size? and also, what's required from you d.j. to kind of be ready to service that restart? and in other words, is this the case where you have an existing plant that was on-site that was shut down and you just restart that? do you have to build something from scratch, in large something that's already on site? and is that the kind of thing where you anticipate being ready to go day one when the restarted mill turns on? and then the second thing would be the comment about the customer outages in india tied to covid-19. and i had not heard about that, but obviously, there's a lot of discussion globally about the variants, as well as the original virus. and i'm thinking of your capacity maybe in the emerging markets in particular, but from your perspective, how widespread would be covid -- another round or a double dip of covid-related customer outages at your asian or other satellite plants? and maybe if you could just bracket that situation, i'd appreciate it, whether that's just a one-off thing or whether it may persist in india or maybe spread to other countries where you have a lot of your satellite operations there? thank you.
douglas t. dietrich -- chairman and chief executive officer
d.j., you want to take that?
d.j. monagle, iii -- group president, specialty minerals and refractories
absolutely. so, thanks, david. first, let me try to frame up the domtar discussion. domtar, the facility that is gun or restart one of their paper machines is in ashton, arkansas. we do have a pcc satellite at the location. we have kept it running at relatively reduced rates because we had a couple of off-site customers that we serviced from that location, and we are in the process of transitioning those customers to another location. but now we've stopped that. we'll continue to service them as required. and we'll be in a position to service the ashton facility immediately. all that it will take basically is just refreshing our contractual relationships with domtar. i might also point out that domtar sold their paper business to paper excellence. paper excellence is affiliated with apt, who's been a great partner and customer for decades with us. and so we're excited that domtar is starting this up, and we look forward to hearing from apt and paper excellence, what their ultimate plans are. so, we can start it immediately. and the way to think of that, david, for that machine is probably something in the neighborhood of 30,000 tonnes per year, sort of an opportunity. so that's the other part that i think i want to expand on just a little bit on this, is that doug mentioned, the us is at 95% operating rates for these grades right now, i think that this restart of that paper machine is showing what the general market attitude is toward the viability of that volume. i think the general industry consensus is that as that machine comes on, the market will be well served and should be pretty stable, so we're excited about that. with regard to india, the biggest effect that we're seeing is that the new capacity that we've put on, last year, we put on about just under 300,000 tons, a big part of that is in china, and that's still ramping up, and that's only been mildly affected by covid.
india is where we brought on three locations. and all three of those start-ups have been slowed down by covid and just the general inability of our customers to get labor to properly produce the paper is the best way i can describe it. we do see them coming back online now, and those bills that we finished are -- as far as the satellite goes, we're ready to supply those customers as soon as their machines are ready to operate. the 130,000 tons that we've got coming on in the next 12 months or so. we've got part of it -- what doug had addressed is in packaging to be unaffected, that's europe. but 40,000 tons in india, that satellite was delayed about a quarter. so, we'll start seeing that toward the end of the third quarter, beginning of the fourth, and we had originally projected that, that would be starting up in this second quarter. so, what would the effect of yet another double dip or triple dip of pandemic and i can't tell you for sure. i would say that we saw pretty low levels this last quarter. so, i can't project it much different than saying that i'd imagine that what we saw this quarter would be what we would see going forward because it was, was pretty bad there, and they're starting to come out. i hope that helps. doug, i don't know if you wanted to add anything else?
douglas t. dietrich -- chairman and chief executive officer
it does. yes, it's hard to predict what -- well, obviously, what covid's going to do. but what i can tell you is that we still have all protocols in place at our plants, keeping our plants as safe as possible. we've done a great job. our employees have done a great job just maintaining these safe practices. and so keeping our plants ready to go they're dedicated to making sure that we're ready to go for our customers and keeping them operated. that's what we're doing. there are other things like d.j. mentioned with customers, it's hard to predict, but our workplaces and our folks are doing a great job keeping everybody safe.
david silver -- clk -- analyst
okay. and if you don't mind, i just do want to follow-up maybe on one more pcc question, and that would be with the newyield. and this is kind of a rhetorical question, but i'm kind of scratching my head and i'm wondering why the uptake on that particular new technology hasn't been a little quicker. i mean, from my perspective, i mean, it does seem to tick all the boxes these days in terms of economic benefit and from the customer side, i think they have a new marketing opportunity, right, to market a product that's made from reclaimed paper plus the ability to reduce waste, so i'm sounding like the worst piece of newyield salesman in the world here. but d.j., from your perspective, i mean, are you -- have you been at all frustrated by maybe the pace of the uptake? and maybe is it just an exceptionally long selling process to convince someone? just maybe some color on in our esg sensitive environment, why that particularly seemingly very viable product option for your customers hasn't seen more uptake.
d.j. monagle, iii -- group president, specialty minerals and refractories
so, good question, david. let me give you a sense of how i'm looking at it. i do wish it was faster. the promotional process and the selling process from getting the concept to trying to demonstrate the value is -- has been moving along pretty well. but then you get into how do you go about demonstrating it. so, the trial processes have been long. the part of the reason for that is that the customer is -- there's a couple of components to it. the first one is that we are using and converting a waste product from the customer's process, so one of the key elements that the customer needs to really be sure of is, how reliable and predictable is that production of waste. and that has been a bigger challenge for our customers than what we thought it might be. now once we pass that hurdle, then we go into a series of trials where the customers then go and look at the economical performance of the product as well as the paper performance of the product, and then they'll go test it with their customers. interestingly enough, they had most of our customers are not are choosing not to promote this as a different kind of paper, what they are choosing, the marketing that is their decision is pretty much that they want to capture the savings and reduce their environmental footprint, their environmental waste exposure. so, they're keeping that relatively quiet as they convert, and they're trying to do what i would call a minimal -- they're doing minimal broadcast. what i highlighted earlier, though, for dan's question, was that we did have a trial with a newyield, and this is where the paper group has been shifting some of their attention. in the packaging, this is pretty exciting, but it's also going to take some time.
the excitement is that it's in brown packaging, and therefore, that brown packaging creates some operational freedom for us with regards to the color properties of what of our pigment is, and -- but the challenge is that people who make brown boxes, they don't typically put anything but fiber into them. so, we've got some technical challenges. so, this -- the fact that we had this first successful trial in brown box on that platform is something i view as significant, and we believe that while the printing and writing grade qualification process has been slow, mostly because of stability and quality concerns that the customers are working through trying to keep that conversion quiet in the marketplace. we think that the brown box people would be in a position to move quicker. having said all of that, david, it still requires the deployment of our manufacturing capabilities. so, from every time we get a thumbs up to a customer will require some sort of an expansion or a new satellite. so -- so there will come a time where i announce another newyield satellite, but then you can expect that there will be some time from the announcement until that converts into sustainable long-term revenues just as we get the manufacturing site built. i hope that provides the color you're looking for.
douglas t. dietrich -- chairman and chief executive officer
does that help, david?
david silver -- clk -- analyst
yeah. no, that was very helpful. thank you very much. i'm going to get back in queue.
douglas t. dietrich -- chairman and chief executive officer
okay. thank you.

our next question comes from mike harrison with seaport research partners.
mike harrison -- seaport research partners -- analyst
hi. good afternoon. i was wondering in the metalcasting business, can you quantify the amount of impact on volumes or revenues that you saw related to the chip shortage and some foundry customer outages? and talk about whether you expect that to kind of be at a similar level as we get into the third quarter? and are there any other product lines outside of metalcasting, where maybe you saw some impacts from customer supply chain disruptions?
douglas t. dietrich -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah, mike, so we have seen a little bit of impact on metalcasting. let me -- our product that we supply foundry is agnostic as to whether it's automotive or industrial or heavy equipment, right? it's a green sand bond that the customer decides to use for any of those markets. and so, we've probably seen $1 million of sales impact from the automotive, a bit of an automotive slowdown, but it's really small. and i think it's because the foundries we serve supply a broad base of industrial markets. and so we've seen continued really strong demand. maybe it could have been $1 million higher because of automotive, but we're still at very high levels of demand and filling these plants with other markets, heavy truck, off highway, agriculture, industrial products, and that includes the same in china. so, a minimal impact so far.
mike harrison -- seaport research partners -- analyst
all right. and then within the specialty minerals business, that's where you kind of called out the margin impact in raw materials versus pricing being maybe the biggest concern. maybe just comment in a little bit more detail what your expectations are for raws and pricing as we get into the third quarter? and are there any other impacts we need to keep in mind in terms of cost versus price in the other two segments?
d.j. monagle, iii -- group president, specialty minerals and refractories
yeah. so let's start the -- at the higher level. you're right. in specialty minerals, that's where you saw the most acute impact from those inflationary factors, but across the company, i think, look, let's set it up as sales are strong. demand is strong. you heard doug talk about the fact that many of the product lines are seeing demand levels and sales levels at pre-pandemic levels. so that is very good to see. that demand allows for a constant conversation with our customers around the value of our product and what we're trying to do. where we're seeing key pieces of inflation. the energy has been the biggest factor so far this year, and that is hitting across the board but most acutely, again, in the process minerals businesses. but we've also seen raw material inflation taking place across the board, and that's really what's going to accelerate in the second half as those raw material factors. some of them energy related. so, you could say oil price was moving higher. that's going to affect some of our textiles that we buy for our mining systems and the like. others are going into packaging and pieces like that. so, you're getting more raw materials as we move into the second half of the year and then logistics has been tight and will continue to be tight across the first half and also moving into the second half. so, the teams have been working aggressively, both on a supply chain perspective and from a commercial perspective.
overall, as you saw, so far, inflation has been pretty manageable. and what we're doing in terms of working with our customers, putting through price adjustments, having a very good dialogue, transparent dialogue, that lays the groundwork for us to catch up on those inflationary factors. and really, for the full year, we're expecting to offset that through pricing. so, in a good position, seeing some acceleration in inflation in the second half of the year. for the full year, looking at about 2% inflation on our overall cogs, but in a good position overall to offset that with pricing and some of the other things you need to think about, mike, we are vertically integrated. that does help us from an overall perspective with the majority of what we use in producing our products, so that we have that in-house and managed with our own factors is putting us in a good position. the last thing i'll comment on is like we've said time and time again, we are pricing on the value of our products, which is very good to see, and that allows us to have the constant conversation on pricing adjustments as we move through the year. the caveat that we'll speak to and that i spoke about in the prepared remarks, were that pricing lag that takes place in paper pcc. so we have line pricing that goes up, we capture that on a basis that has lagged, it could be as long as six months.
mike harrison -- seaport research partners -- analyst
all right. thanks very much.
d.j. monagle, iii -- group president, specialty minerals and refractories
thanks, mike.

we'll take our next question from daniel moore with cjs securities.
daniel moore -- cjs securities -- analyst
make it short and sweet. i just want to make sure i heard correctly, matt, 5% to 7% earnings or eps accretion fiscal 22 for normerica. is that the right way to think about it?
matthew e. garth -- senior vice president, finance and treasury, and chief financial officer
that's the right way to look at it. so it's 5% to 7% eps accretion in 2022, also, what i said was about $5 million to $7 million of synergies that we're looking at. look, just a follow-up on the one thing about margins. we do see this being a strong contributor to margins as we move forward as well.
daniel moore -- cjs securities -- analyst
that is perfect. thank you.

our next question comes from rosemarie morbelli with gabelli & company.
rosemarie morbelli -- gabelli & company -- analyst
thank you. good morning, everyone.
douglas t. dietrich -- chairman and chief executive officer
hi, rosemarie. how are you?
rosemarie morbelli -- gabelli & company -- analyst
i am good. thank you. how are you? i was wondering if you could touch on the size of the pet business in north america because you bought sivomatic that was based in europe. now you are adding normerica. so, if you could give us out of the $351 million of revenues for this segment, what is north america and the rest of the world?
douglas t. dietrich -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. of the $350 million, i'd say north america is about $220 million -- $225 million rosemarie.
rosemarie morbelli -- gabelli & company -- analyst
and when -- yeah, i'm sorry.
matthew e. garth -- senior vice president, finance and treasury, and chief financial officer
no, i was going to say -- and part of that is growing, a smaller piece of that is asia, but that's probably growing the quick most quickly.
rosemarie morbelli -- gabelli & company -- analyst
no, no, no. it's all right. certainly, there is some kind of a lag between when you talking when i talk. so, if we look at the profitability, is it as profitable in the u.s.? or is it more profitable in europe since you seem to be focusing at what sivomatic was, focusing on the higher premium type of pet leader.
matthew e. garth -- senior vice president, finance and treasury, and chief financial officer
yes. profitability is similar around the world. i would say, difference is we have different cost positions in north america and europe in terms of our mines, transportation costs. but in total, they're similar, the growth rates are different. i would say north america growth rate is probably more in line with gdp plus in terms of cat ownership, it's pretty established. i think in europe with, as you mentioned, that premium product that is what sivomatic makes has been growing faster than north america. and i think our business in asia has been growing, albeit at a smaller base, at the fastest rate. now we've been entering some new channels as well. so, it's not just supplying major outlets. it's now -- we've been developing in both europe and north america online channels. so, we are now selling products through your typical online shopping sites. and i would say that in asia, the predominance of sales is through online. i think the buying, the consumer behaviors in asia, particularly in china, is probably more online. and that's also driving higher growth rate. so profitability is similar around a little bit different cost positions, but we see growth rates being in that kind of eight plus percent, if we can keep that going for the next few years. so i hope that helps give you a dimension of the sizes and the growth rates.
rosemarie morbelli -- gabelli & company -- analyst
yes, it does. thank you. and you are adding normerica. and obviously, you are going to supply them with bentonite from your online. do you -- what type of reserves do you have, and i am sure it is somewhere in the k, but if you didn't mind reminding me of what type -- how large your reserves are and whether having this additional demand is going to shrink them.
douglas t. dietrich -- chairman and chief executive officer
no. we have plenty of reserves. we do -- we have historically sold north america, a portion of their clay supply anyhow, so we've got long-lived reserves in wyoming and montana. we've got proven reserves out 20, 30 years. we've got other indicative reserves and pockets of land that we own in the wyoming area that are further out than that, so we've got good supply positions here in the united states to supply both the combined business for the foreseeable future.
rosemarie morbelli -- gabelli & company -- analyst
and so this is adding to your consumer-oriented business, which pre this acquisition was about 25% of total, i think, with a target of 50%. so where do we stand now? and what do you need to get to the 50% are you planning in divesting some pieces of operations that are non-consumer operate -- i mean oriented and therefore, that would boost the ratio almost immediately?
douglas t. dietrich -- chairman and chief executive officer
well, let me address the target first. i don't know if we've publicly stated that a target is 50%. i think we've had some questions on this call, perhaps from you that said, where can this go? it's possible that it goes there. i think really, what we're doing is looking at where we have a real capability to serve. we kind of call this mine to market. well, this is mine to shelf. and i think that we're uniquely positioned to supply this type of market and a market that is a different -- non-cyclical, different type of growth rates that involves innovation, product development. so, this meets really everything that minerals technologies is and so i think it's a great fit. i think there's opportunities to continue to expand into more consumer ended products. we are always going to have an industrial side to the company. so, whether we -- right now, this brings us to 30% approximately, rosemarie. we think there's some other opportunities and as these grow at the rates that i've been mentioning. i think with our personal care growth, with our pet care growth with our edible oil purification growth, i think it will naturally become a bigger part of the company. and i think inorganically, there's some other opportunities. whether we get to 50% specifically? i'm not going to state that. but what we're doing here is providing more balanced industrial consumer in the company and a more sustainable, higher level of growth rate than perhaps what you've seen historically. and i think this is a transaction that moves us in that direction. i think from an operating standpoint, having the mines in our -- already in the ownership, i think that provides the margin growth as well. so i think it's just a good story around providing really good shareholder value, especially in this transaction.
rosemarie morbelli -- gabelli & company -- analyst
right. i appreciate the input and congratulations.
douglas t. dietrich -- chairman and chief executive officer

operator
good day, everyone, and welcome to the third quarter 2021 minerals technologies earnings conference call. today's call is being recorded.
at this time, i'd like to turn the call over to erik aldag, head of investor relations for minerals technologies. please go ahead, mr. aldag.
erik aldag -- head, investor relations
thanks, cody. good morning everyone and welcome to our third quarter 2021 earnings conference call. today's call will be led by chairman and chief executive officer, doug dietrich; and chief financial officer, matt garth. following doug and matt's prepared remarks, we'll open it up to questions.
i'd like to remind you that beginning on page 15 of our 2020 10-k, we list the various risk factors and conditions that may affect our future results. and i'll also point out the safe harbor disclaimer on this slide. statements related to future performance by members of our team are subject to these limitations, cautionary remarks and conditions.
now, i'll turn the call over to doug. doug?
douglas t. dietrich -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks, erik. good morning, everyone. appreciate you joining today's call. i'll go through our third quarter results at a high level, including our sales performance and how we manage through a variety of challenging dynamics. i'll then take some time to describe the progress we're making with our growth initiatives and our team's solid execution on several fronts. i'll then turn it over to matt to discuss our financial results in more detail and expectations for the fourth quarter. and then we'll open the call to questions.
let me start with a recap of the quarter. first and foremost, market demand has remained robust across all of our product lines and geographies. we delivered strong results marked by another record quarter of earnings per share of $1.30. performance was achieved while managing through a challenging operating landscape with supply chain and inflationary pressures across our businesses.
sales for the quarter were $473 million or 17% higher on an organic basis and up 22%, including sales from the recent normerica acquisition. we saw sales increases in every segment and across every geography. for more perspective on our organic growth, the projects we've initiated and i've discussed with you over the past year contributed approximately 5% to our organic growth in the quarter. said another way, about 5% of our growth was delivered from new projects and technologies initiated over the past year, 12% from market growth and 5% from the acquisition of normerica.
strength of our operating capabilities is reflected in how we successfully managed through the external conditions we faced this quarter, which enabled us to generate $63 million of operating income, a 22% increase over last year. performance was achieved within the context of a myriad of external issues, including rising costs, truck, rail and shipping logistics challenges, difficulties finding talented people to support expanding production, significant energy cost increases that became more pronounced during the quarter and continued challenges presented from the covid pandemic. despite these issues, we kept our inventory and supply positions for key raw materials and commodities in good shape.
we acted quickly to solidify our pricing leadership across our product portfolio and to address the inflationary cost pressures that accelerated over the past few months. and we tightly controlled expenses and continued to drive productivity improvements. not to be forgotten, we navigated everything while also seamlessly integrating normerica into our company.
cash flow remains strong and, through the first nine months of the year, cash from operations is up 10% compared to 2020. we completed our share repurchase authorization. last week, we initiated a new one-year $75 million program. strong cash flow and solid balance sheet gives us the flexibility to continue to allocate capital to shareholders, while also investing in attractive organic and inorganic growth opportunities.
overall, we had a very strong quarter in terms of financial and operational performance. needless to say, there was a high level of activity this quarter. and our execution speaks to the capabilities of our team who did a great job operating the company safely and efficiently while remaining focused on delivering for our customers.
now let me take you through some of the year-to-date sales highlights, outline the contribution from our recent growth projects and describe the initiatives that will further advance our sales trajectory. we've discussed with you the initiatives we've executed over the last year, which have been key contributors to our growth in 2021. we've also advanced several new projects this quarter that will support further sales growth going forward. very encouraged with our continued progress on our growth strategy, which is focused on geographic expansion, new product development and acquisitions.
demand trends are favorable across our markets. but the sales growth demonstrated in our businesses has been further bolstered by our new projects aimed toward higher growth markets and also from investments we've made to strengthen our portfolio of value-added products.
let me provide some perspective on what we've realized through the third quarter from these projects and then detail our new initiatives, new technologies and recent acquisitions that will accelerate growth. i'll start with our household and personal care and specialty product line, where our broad portfolio of consumer-oriented businesses continues to perform very well, resulting in organic sales growth of 13% year-to-date and 20%, including the recent addition of normerica. this growth is a result of our leading positions in structurally growing and stable markets, but it's been enhanced through our investments in new products, capacity expansions and by extending the geographical reach of each of these businesses.
our global pet care business is an example of this with its portfolio of premium products, new online sales channels and broad global presence, which has led to above-market growth rates. we're also realizing significant sales increases in other consumer specialty applications such as edible oil purification and personal care. these are businesses where we've made targeted investments to enhance our technology portfolio and expand our manufacturing capabilities to reach a broader customer base in europe and asia.
our global metalcasting business remains on its consistent growth track with sales up 30% year-to-date, driven by strong demand from both north america and asia foundries, serving a diverse customer base in automotive, heavy truck and agriculture markets. specifically, penetration of our blended products continues to expand in asia as sales increased 30% compared to last year with 29% growth in china alone. while much of our growth is driven by our penetration in china, we continue to demonstrate our value proposition in other countries with attractive long-term growth fundamentals. in india, which is the second largest gray and ductile iron casting market globally, sales of our blended products are up 50% over 2020.
our pcc business has been delivering a strong performance this year. sales were up 17% year-to-date as uncoated freesheet paper demand continues to improve in all regions. we've also benefited from the ramp up of 200,000 tons of new capacity that we've brought online over the past year, which includes a 150,000-ton facility in china and another 50,000-ton satellite in india. production at our 40,000 ton expansion for a packaging application in europe was also just commissioned in the third quarter.
for perspective, sales realized from these latest satellites were responsible for 5% of the 17% pcc growth so far this year. our fourth quarter pcc volumes are currently projected to be above where they were in 2019, more than absorbing the volume loss from our four paper machine shutdowns that occurred since then.
moving forward, we have several other new satellite projects under construction that set this business up for continued sales growth next year. in addition to the capacity i just mentioned, another 40,000 ton satellite in india will start up this quarter and we've begun building another 50,000 ton satellite in china, which should be operational in the first half of next year. we've also just reached an agreement and expect to sign a contract over the next couple of weeks with a new customer in india for another 22,000 ton satellite. it will be our ninth satellite in india after entering the market with our pcc technology 10 years ago.
in total, with the satellites just commissioned and ramping up, combined with these three new satellites, we see the 5% growth rate from new satellites continuing through next year. pipeline of new satellite projects remains robust. we're expanding our addressable market opportunities with new products and technologies for the packaging market, which i'll describe in a moment.
i'll finish up the year-to-date growth highlights with our refractory segment. it's been a very impressive year for this segment with growth of 22%, marked by steel utilization rates noticeably improving over last year. growth also reflects this team's success in capturing new business. over the past six months, we've secured seven contracts worth $100 million over the next five years, two of which were signed during the third quarter. we've been able to secure these new contracts in the electric arc furnace market through the deployment of our new portfolio of differentiated refractory products and high performance laser measurement solutions, which reduced costs and improved furnace safety for our customers.
i've discussed how we're investing in several new technologies and i want to share with you how they're beginning to pay off. specifically, a few areas where we've broadened our product offering to enter adjacent growing markets. i'll highlight two significant areas. first, our paper pcc business has been developing new technologies, processes and products to accelerate our growth beyond high value filler for uncoated freesheet paper and into the adjacent packaging market.
we've made significant progress over the past two years deploying pcc into white top linerboard. more recently, we've been developing new products for other packaging applications, including ground calcium carbonate for white carton board and alternate mineral products for brown packaging. these are attractive and growing packaging markets and we're developing a more comprehensive product portfolio to reach this broader customer base.
currently, we're working to finalize a long-term contract with a premier white carton board customer in china that would represent a significant step for us into this adjacent market. we also recently concluded customer trials with our alternative mineral products for brown packaging here in the us. with an expanding product portfolio and a pipeline of potential customers, we believe the packaging market represents a real avenue for new long-term growth.
excuse me a second. another project in our technology pipeline that we're very encouraged with is fluoro-sorb, which addresses pfas contamination in groundwater. in last call, i shared with you details about our first major commercialization for a large scale project at a north american department of defense location. this project went well and its success has helped to advance our other opportunities. in fact, we're currently working to secure several other large projects in the drinking water and soil stabilization markets. as this sector continues to develop and regulatory bodies focus on implementing changes, we're well positioned to capture new opportunities with our patented technology.
to finish up the discussion on our growth for the future, i'll take you through how we've strengthened our business through recent acquisitions. first, we completed the normerica acquisition during the quarter and the integration is progressing well. the team has been in place working on a variety of activities with our new colleagues to integrate all facets of the business and deploy our culture of safety and operational excellence. everyone has done a tremendous job making this a seamless transition. we're still in the early stages, but the knowledge we've gained over the past three months has only further validated our thesis when we acquired normerica. we've identified significant opportunities in the north america cat litter market for our broader portfolio of private label products and we see a clear pathway to drive higher growth rates and profits in our pet care business.
in addition, yesterday we acquired the specialty pcc assets from mississippi lime company. this bolt-on transaction helps expand our manufacturing reach into the midwest united states and gives us a strategic logistics footprint at a key point along the mississippi river. the strategy is to leverage our latest technologies such as rheology modifiers for sealant applications throughout our specialty pcc plant system in the us.
let me leave you with a few takeaways. we continue to build mti into a stronger company on all fronts and take actions to balance our portfolio to generate higher more sustainable growth. sales mix has evolved over the past few years with 30% of our revenue now coming from stable and growing consumer-oriented markets. projects i described to you demonstrate how we're leveraging our newest technologies to drive growth in our current markets and enter attractive adjacent markets.
we also underscore how we continue to drive penetration of our core product lines in growing geographies. our recent acquisitions further supplement this momentum and, all taken together, we have meaningfully shifted our sales trajectory going forward. specifically for next year, we see our sales growth moving north of 10% and this sales trajectory, along with our strong operating capabilities, provides a powerful combination for significant long-term value generation.
with that, let's turn it over to matt to go through our quarter performance in more detail. matt?
matthew e. garth -- senior vice president, finance and treasury, and chief financial officer
thanks, doug. i'll review our third quarter results, the performance of our segments as well as our outlook for the fourth quarter. and now, let's review the third quarter results. sales in the third quarter were 22% higher than the prior year and 4% higher sequentially. organic growth for the company was 17% versus the prior year and the acquisition of normerica contributed the remainder of the growth in the quarter.
operating income excluding special items was $63.2 million, up 23% versus the prior year and was relatively flat versus the second quarter. operating margin was 13.4%. it's worth noting that excluding normerica, operating margin was 13.8% for the quarter. as we have stated previously, the normerica acquisition will become income-accretive beginning in the fourth quarter as integration activities progress.
the year-over-year operating income bridge on the top right of this slide shows volume and mix contributed $14.9 million, driven by our strategic growth initiatives and the broad-based volume growth we've seen across our end markets. you can also see the significant inflationary cost we experienced, $18.4 million in the third quarter alone, driven by energy, freight and raw materials such as lime and packaging.
to give you some perspective, we saw energy pricing go up by anywhere from 50% to 400% depending on the location and power source with the most dramatic increases in the uk and europe. we offset $10.7 million of these inflationary costs with continued price increases, including contractual pass-through mechanisms in paper pcc and negotiated price actions in the rest of the business.
the sequential bridge on the bottom right shows how inflation accelerated from the second quarter to the third quarter by $10 million, more than half the total year-over-year impact. however, this bridge also shows how quickly we acted to implement pricing, offsetting nearly 70% of the sequential increase. in fact, we've implemented a variety of pricing mechanisms in several of our businesses to recoup the higher costs that we had to absorb in the third quarter due to the rapid nature of the increases, particularly on energy.
the price adjustments we are making in the fourth quarter will help us to fully catch up on the cost we have absorbed by the first quarter of 2022. meanwhile, we continue to control overhead expenses with sg&a as a percent of sales at 10.6%, 150 basis points below the prior year and 70 basis points lower sequentially. earnings per share, excluding special items, was $1.30, the second consecutive record quarter for the company and represented 41% growth versus the prior year.
and now, let's review the segments in more detail starting with performance materials. third quarter sales for performance materials were $250.4 million, 23% higher than the prior year and 5% higher sequentially. the acquisition of normerica contributed 10% growth versus the prior year and organic sales contributed an additional 13%. household, personal care and specialty products sales were 30% above the prior year, driven by normerica and continued strong demand for consumer-oriented products. sales were 19% higher sequentially, primarily driven by the acquisition.
metalcasting sales were 10% higher than the prior year, driven by stronger demand globally and continued penetration of green sand bond technologies in asia. the impact of lower automotive production has been limited on our sales as foundry customer demand has remained strong across a broad set of other industrial markets. sales were 9% lower sequentially, primarily due to typical seasonal foundry maintenance outages. environmental products sales grew 32% versus the prior year on improved demand for environmental lining systems, remediation and wastewater treatment. building materials sales grew 18% versus the prior year and 3% sequentially on higher levels of project activity.
operating income for the segment was $32.6 million and operating margin was 13% of sales. margin was temporarily impacted by unfavorable product mix, the timing of pricing actions relative to cost increases as well as the incremental sales from normerica. operating margin, excluding normerica, was 13.9%. we are in the early stages of the integration process with normerica and i'm pleased to report that the back office and financial process integration is progressing well.
now looking to the fourth quarter, we see continued strong demand for household and personal care and we expect metalcasting volumes to improve sequentially as foundry demand remained strong in both north america and asia.
i'd like to remind you that we typically experience higher mining and energy costs in the colder months and this could have a temporary impact on our margins. in addition, acceleration of input costs that we saw in the third quarter is resulting in a lack of inflation versus pricing that we expect to continue in the fourth quarter. as i mentioned, we have pricing actions in place to catch up on these increases in the first quarter of 2022.
overall, we expect operating income for this segment to be slightly lower sequentially as higher operating costs will temporarily offset continued strength across our end markets. also some uncertainty with respect to power outages in china, which could also temporarily impact our volumes in the fourth quarter.
and now, let's move to specialty minerals. specialty minerals sales were $146.9 million in the third quarter, 17% higher than the prior year and 3% higher sequentially. spcc sales grew 17% versus the prior year and 3% sequentially on recovering paper pcc demand, the continued ramp up of three new satellite plants and higher spcc demand from automotive, construction and consumer end markets.
process minerals sales grew 18% versus the prior year and 2% sequentially on continued strength in residential construction and consumer end markets. process minerals sales, as i just spoke about, did grow 18% and segment operating income was $18.4 million and operating margin was 12.5% of sales. ordering was temporarily impacted by the timing of contractual and negotiated price increases relative to cost increases. this segment has seen the most acute impact from energy and raw material cost increases with inflationary cost increases of $9 million, partially offset by $5 million pricing in the third quarter alone. we have implemented price adjustments to cover these cost increases and we should be caught up in the first quarter. and as we have demonstrated, we will continue to adjust pricing as necessary to keep pace with additional cost increases.
now moving to the fourth quarter, we expect modestly higher pcc volume sequentially as the ramp up of our new satellite in india will be partially offset by the paper machine shutdown in jackson, alabama. we see continued strength in specialty pcc and processed minerals in what is typically a seasonally weaker period for our residential construction end markets. in addition, we will have a timing lag as our price adjustments catch up to the cost increases we have absorbed. we see margins rebounding to more normal levels as pricing actions take hold. and overall for the segment, we expect fourth quarter operating income to be similar to the third quarter.
and now let's turn to the review of the refractory segment. refractory segment sales were $75.9 million in the third quarter, 28% higher than the prior year and 2% higher sequentially as demand remained strong for refractory and metallurgical products. we also had modestly higher laser measurement equipment sales in the quarter. however, we continue to experience delays in being able to perform on-site installations and maintenance in this product line.
segment operating income was $13.2 million, a quarterly record and 81% higher than the prior year and 13% higher sequentially. operating margin was strong at 17.4% of sales and was also a record performance. looking to the fourth quarter, we expect another strong performance from this segment. however, we expect slightly lower sales and operating income to be down approximately $2 million.
now let's take a look at our cash flow and liquidity highlights. cash flow from operations was $163.1 million year-to-date compared to $148.4 million in the prior year, up 10%. capital expenditures were $63 million year-to-date versus $45.8 million in the prior year as we continue to invest in high return projects. the company used a portion of free cash flow to repurchase $63 million of shares year-to-date and the share repurchase authorization from the prior year was completed in october. the board of directors authorized a new $75 million one-year share repurchase program on october 20, 2021.
as of the end of the third quarter, total liquidity was over $500 million and our net leverage ratio was 2.2 times ebitda. our balance sheet is in a very strong position which provides us with the flexibility we need to continue to invest in high-value high-return growth opportunities. we expect strong cash flow generation to continue in the fourth quarter with free cash flow in the $150 million range for the full year.
now let me summarize our outlook for the fourth quarter. overall, we see robust end market demand across our segments with typical construction end market seasonality. we expect demand for our growing portfolio of consumer-oriented products to remain strong. inflationary cost pressures have persisted into the fourth quarter and we have pricing actions in place to mitigate these increases in the quarter and fully catch-up by the first quarter of 2022. while it's still early in the integration process for normerica, it's progressing well and we will begin to realize accretion from this acquisition in the fourth quarter. and overall for the company, we expect another strong performance with operating income around $60 million.
as we have demonstrated throughout the year, we have navigated uncertainty and a number of obstacles to deliver our strong financial performance and we expect to continue to execute well as we close out 2021. we have solid growth momentum across our segments. and with the growth initiatives outlined earlier in the call, we are set up well for a strong 2022.
with that, let's turn to q&a.
",":
operator
thank you. [operator instructions] our first question from silke kueck with jpmorgan.
silke kueck -- jpmorgan -- analyst
good morning. how are you?
douglas t. dietrich -- chairman and chief executive officer
good, silke. how are you?
silke kueck -- jpmorgan -- analyst
good. a couple of questions. my first question is, i was wondering if you can talk about what your offshore onshore split -- sort of offshore and domestic splitters in paper pcc at the end of the year? and how many tons you think you would sell this year in total versus next year, given the progression of the start-up? that's my first question.
matthew e. garth -- senior vice president, finance and treasury, and chief financial officer
so, your offshore/onshore volumes...
silke kueck -- jpmorgan -- analyst
i was wondering what your split is, like right, like in tonnage terms like how much you sell onshore/offshore by the end of the year and what are the total tons that you think you'll sell this year and how many tons you think you'll sell next year?
matthew e. garth -- senior vice president, finance and treasury, and chief financial officer
so, the split -- if we look on a -- in the quarter, silke, it was about 30% and when you say onshore, you're talking about north america.
silke kueck -- jpmorgan -- analyst
yeah.
matthew e. garth -- senior vice president, finance and treasury, and chief financial officer
so the rest would have been international or offshore. when you look at it on a year-to-date basis, it would be the same. as doug said, we're growing volumes and that contributed to the 5% growth that you saw in paper pcc and that's coming from mostly international. so that mix is going to grow more internationally as we move forward.
silke kueck -- jpmorgan -- analyst
okay.
matthew e. garth -- senior vice president, finance and treasury, and chief financial officer
does that answer?
silke kueck -- jpmorgan -- analyst
it does. typically like you have tons in pcc are like somewhere like the -- roughly like 3 million tons or so. and i was like wondering what you're like targeting for like next year.
matthew e. garth -- senior vice president, finance and treasury, and chief financial officer
so, as you saw, i mean, you can see the volumes here in q3 were about 700,000 tons with that ramp up that's taking place. and as we've told you before, we'll be closer to the 3 million ton mark here for the full year. and then, i don't know if you want to talk, d.j., any further about anything that's taking place into 2022, but doug outlined for you that you're going to see another 5% in paper pcc into next year.
d.j. monagle -- group president, specialty minerals and refractories
silke, it's d.j. and so just to augment that, doug had mentioned the two satellites that are just coming online. so those are all but one in europe will continue to grow. that's in the packaging sector. and then another one in india, that will continue to ramp up. china will continue to ramp up over time, and then that capacity that's coming online is another 50,000 tons in china and then, doug mentioned, we've got very strong level of confidence that we'll also be growing india further with another 20,000-some tons.
so, majority of that will be growing offshore and then we did -- we have mentioned that there is a restart that will be happening in the us at domtar, which will be changing to paper excellence over time, but that restart is in the neighborhood of 30,000 tons. so, still majority is going to be going offshore. i would tell you also that as i look at the business development pipeline that is ahead of us, i would say 70% of those opportunities are offshore opportunities. so that's the split that we're seeing.
silke kueck -- jpmorgan -- analyst
okay. that's helpful. thank you. and then, you mentioned that you've signed several contracts on the refractory side. and i was wondering whether you could also quantify that what do you think the contribution from those will be for the next year, or maybe it has to be looked at over like a longer period of time. i was just wondering whether you can quantify that in any way. and the second question on the refractories business is, i was wondering whether you are affected in any way, purchasing a dead burned magnesia, like it's a little hard to tell what the supply demand issues are and i was just like wondering how you're situated?
douglas t. dietrich -- chairman and chief executive officer
sure. let me start and then i'll hand it over to brett to give you more -- [indecipherable] just to give you more detail on the contracts. so, the contracts that we've signed, as i mentioned, are about $100 million over the next five years and they're pretty equally spaced. i think some of them will start to accrue to us early in the year. so if you can think about it, silke, this is kind of a $20 million per year over the next five year kind of space. the business is about $300 million right now. so it's a significant kind of built-in growth right there.
the contracts are in -- more toward the electric arc furnace and they've been really promoting our new technologies. and so, before i answer the mgo question, maybe brett can do it, let me pass it over and i'll give you a little bit more detail on these contracts and kind of how we've approached them with these new technologies. brett?
brett argirakis -- senior vice president and managing director, minteq international inc. and mti global supply chain
yeah, thanks. thanks, silke. the refractory business, we continue to transform this business into a safer more high-tech company. we've focused our efforts in developing the automated refractory and wire injection equipment to be safer and move people away from really high temperature heat. as doug mentioned, we did sign seven contracts this year, over $100 million over the next five years.
the new equipment that we utilize has our laser technology tied to it. so, we're able to measure the electric furnaces or steel ladles, the lining thickness, it feeds the information to our robotic scantrol equipment and then it applies our refractory products to the appropriate areas. the application -- the key to this is being able to do it remotely, keeping the operators out of harm's way away from very high temperatures.
then in addition, the r&d team has done a great job in expanding our product portfolio. so we're now able to apply product in all areas of the furnace rather than specific areas prior to the new developments. and then really lastly is the continuation of our stmo [phonetic] service group. our customers really have a lot of confidence in these guys and they're able to support their refractory programs and maintain our equipment as these programs continue to develop. from an mgo standpoint, we are in a pretty good position. we've prepared ourselves, we buy mgo from both china and turkey. so we've positioned ourselves well and really preparing ahead of schedule for the china olympics. so we're in pretty good shape there.
douglas t. dietrich -- chairman and chief executive officer
does that help, silke?
silke kueck -- jpmorgan -- analyst
yeah.
douglas t. dietrich -- chairman and chief executive officer
so, we're in good spot from our inventory positions and i take that from certainly from the refractories business in how we've diversified our supply base, made sure that those inventories are in good shape to support the customers, but i'd say that also across the company, in other businesses.
silke kueck -- jpmorgan -- analyst
lastly, i was wondering if you can talk about where like where the pricing benefits were flowing for like, i know there's like $5 million specialty minerals. but i think overall, you got like $11 million, like where does the rest of the pricing come in?
douglas t. dietrich -- chairman and chief executive officer
it's across the business. i'd say, let me give you a quick example of the dynamics that's going on this year. a typical year, our specialty minerals business, the two pieces, the paper pcc and kind of the performance process minerals piece. on the paper pcc side, scheduled price increases, right, so every six months, once a year prices move up. and those are contractual and that continues and we have those protections in those contracts. so that will be taken care of on its normal timing.
on the process minerals side, you see once a year setting the pricing up. i will tell you, this year we've changed our prices four times. we're on our fifth increase. we are using different mechanisms to make sure that we're covered. so it's been a very dynamic pricing year. and i think you're probably hearing about that a lot out there in the market. so, the majority of the inflation that we talked about was coming into this business, a lot of that in the third quarter was energy, acted very quickly to get our pricing and mechanisms in place to have all of that covered. there is about a month lag between some of that absorption and the pricing change, just because it takes some time to move some things through. and that's why fully through the fourth quarter and into the -- it will take a month into the first quarter, we have that covered.
however, we expect that pricing or costs are going to continue to change and so we'll continue to make those adjustments as necessary to make sure that we keep ourselves covered. so, i'd say, the majority of that pricing, to your question, is going into the smi business. that's not to say that we have another 50% of it or 40% of it is probably in the process minerals -- are in the performance materials segment, sorry about that.
silke kueck -- jpmorgan -- analyst
okay. that's helpful. thank you very much. i'll get back into queue.
operator
thank you. we'll take our next question from daniel moore with cjs securities. please go ahead.
daniel moore -- cjs securities -- analyst
thank you. good morning. thanks for taking my questions. doug, you got my ears burning in those prepared remarks. you said next year sales trajectory north of -- goes north of 10% and i was typing really fast. so is that across the board? and walk us through that may be by segment, product, end market, kind of where you see the biggest drivers there?
douglas t. dietrich -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes. that's a number that we're looking for mti in total. i think we'll give you more details on how that breaks down by segment, as we go forward, dan. but at a high level, what's behind that is a couple of things. and i think in the beginning of my comments i tried to break out for you the organic growth that's occurring today in this quarter, 5%. so we grew organically 17% this quarter.
but if you take away the market aspects, right, that was 12% of our growth. 5% came alone from the organic projects, right. so, 5%, new satellites, new technologies, the market positioning and the growth in those geographies, moving into these adjacencies, the growth of our consumer-oriented products, which is -- i think it grew 13%. the consumer growth was 13% year-over-year. so you have a 30% of the company growing at that kind of 11%, 12%, 13% range. you've got the new satellites in the paper pcc business growing at 5%.
so all told of the ins and outs, we grew just in the third quarter organically without market, 5%. you then take the normerica acquisition, which will be another 5% and that's as the market planes over next year. let's say it just stayed flat. we think that 10% is delivered both organically and inorganically next year. and honestly, i think we can add to that with some projects that we might pull in between now and the next six months, right.
so we've got a level of confidence that says we can deliver that next year and then further out, in my remarks, we're trying to show you the things that we're investing in, how we're positioning ourselves. even as we plane over from normerica next third quarter, the projects that we have in hand and the momentum we have in our businesses, we think we can keep that going. now, i've always said this business can grow at mid single-digits, if not higher, supplemented by acquisitions. and i think next year, you're going to see that these just come out.
daniel moore -- cjs securities -- analyst
all right. very helpful. normerica, i guess, it should turn accretive by q4. when is that accretive to operating income margins or neutral? when do we kind of see that flipping given potential synergies?
douglas t. dietrich -- chairman and chief executive officer
so i will tell you that normerica right now is not accretive. we showed you that chart in performance materials as it sits today and not accretive to those performance materials margins. that was part of where we saw value in the business being able to operate it differently, capture synergies through that business and its combination and the vertical integration with our mines and so it will take a little bit of time. i think, we said last quarter, we'll probably by the second, third quarter of next year, we feel we'll have that fully integrated. and then we feel those margins will be up there at that average if not maybe higher in total for the company.
so, it will be accretive, but it's not currently and we need to make sure we move through -- methodically move through and continue with the integration and capture those savings that we saw when we went into it. that's what i mentioned. i think it's not only our thesis when we bought it is intact, but also that will come from leveraging that position that we have in the packaged cat litter business and we see those sales opportunities out there. so, we're working on making sure we get the operation straight, safe, integrate employees, bring them into our culture. and then we think we've got a really nice platform to grow from. so we'll get there, dan, it's not going to be in the next quarter or two though.
daniel moore -- cjs securities -- analyst
yeah, that's perfect. shifting gears, obviously you've done a really much better and remarkable job in terms of pricing in a very dynamic environment. that said, if we just focus on sort of logistics, transportation, input costs, what's the cadence been over the past few months of direction of that inflation supply chain challenges and logistics challenges, is it starting to plateau or ease a bit in certain areas? what can you say about that? will we need to continue to play catch-up is the question.
matthew e. garth -- senior vice president, finance and treasury, and chief financial officer
yeah. and dan, when you take a look as we move from the second quarter to the third quarter, right, what we showed you on a quarter-over-quarter base was about $10 million and inflationary factors moving higher. the biggest component of that delta change was the change in energy. so you had that rapidity of move take place. logistics, raw materials, we've seen a steady uptrend in. and what we talked about was the fact that that was going to continue into the fourth quarter.
and so you're now looking at a fourth quarter, that for me, a cost inflation perspective looks a lot like your third quarter. that being said, the pricing component, we are narrowing on and the mechanisms that we have in place, we're catching up on, so that we have, by the first quarter, as doug said, we're moving to be net neutral against those inflationary costs.
so, you are seeing that take place, raw materials have been about two-thirds of what we're going to see this year in terms of the higher costs. energy is going to make up the largest component of the rest. so, call it, 60% raw materials, 30% energy and 10% logistics. with that logistics condition improving slightly, some of those raw material components improving slightly, but continuing, like i said, to have a fourth quarter that looks just on an inflationary cost year-over-year, a lot like your third quarter.
daniel moore -- cjs securities -- analyst
really helps, matt. metalcasting, you continue to grow despite the well-documented auto and chip shortages, supply chain shortages. looking out to next year, is that the expectation even if sar kind of stays down, do you see that opportunity to continue to grow at the levels that you described?
douglas t. dietrich -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah, we do. we see -- i'll pass to jon to give you more color. but the foundry markets that we serve are not just automotive focused and i think you're seeing that. and so i think there probably has been -- there has been some impact from auto on those foundry customers and that's been far outpaced by the growth both geographically where we're positioning ourselves and in the other markets that those foundry serve, agriculture, outside of automotive, heavy equipment. so, those have done very well. and i think we're going to continue to see that penetration rate. and especially as i tried to mention today, we're starting to see smaller markets that we have been seeding and developing like india, smaller markets for us, a very large market opportunity start to grow, and those growth rates are starting to get to the point where they're making a difference. and we think that's going to further supplement the growth.
so going into next year, jon, you want to talk a little bit about what we're seeing and what we're hearing in the marketplace around the foundry?
jonathan j. hastings -- group president, performance materials
certainly. hi, dan. couple of things to point out. first of all, some of the companies that we serve, the foundries, who supply the auto industry are relaying to us that the automakers are sending them signals that starting q1 and q2, they're going to be producing in excess of what they had produced in 2019. so very strong positive outlook starting in q1 of next year.
as doug has said, we're pretty well diversified. we're positioned extremely well across the globe. we participate in the markets that have really good strong casting growth rates, think about north america, china, india, our penetration strategy continues to work extremely well. we're working with customers who are demanding qualities that are equivalent to western technologies, especially in india and china. and as a result, they're looking for high-value blended products. and so that's one of the key initiatives and key drivers of our growth.
doug mentioned that we are positioning ourselves. we took advantage of the covid downturn and also some of the outages with chips and labor shortages that have occurred, but we're positioning ourselves with our new customers. so we're growing our share and our positions in each of these regions. we're introducing the technologies, the high-value technologies. we're supplying those new customers and we're positioning ourselves so that when the markets are fully functioning, we're going to be very well positioned for future growth and we'll see that in 2022.
daniel moore -- cjs securities -- analyst
super. lastly, real quick on the capital allocation side. the new share repurchase authorization, given it's got kind of one year on it, is the expectation that you would execute the full amount in that timeframe? and secondly, does that have any implications for the m&a pipeline or simply that your balance sheet and free cash flow give you the flexibility to kind of pursue both avenues? thanks again.
douglas t. dietrich -- chairman and chief executive officer
i think you hit it right on the head there, dan. i think, yes, we fully intend to execute within the timeline, as we did this past one. but i also think, yes, that it speaks to the flexibility, the strong cash flow generation and the expectations that's going to continue. the balance sheet and being able to both -- the options of being able to both return to shareholders and pursue bolt-on acquisitions. we also have a leverage position that if something other or larger, we think we can handle that as well. so, i think it speaks both that the flexibility that we have with our cash flow and balance sheet to be able to do both.
matthew e. garth -- senior vice president, finance and treasury, and chief financial officer
and as we look out, dan, just to add one component to that. just remember, we did have about $100 million that we took on our revolver for the acquisition of normerica, began paying that down in the fourth quarter and should have that over the next 12 months taken care of.
daniel moore -- cjs securities -- analyst
very good. appreciate the color.
douglas t. dietrich -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks, dan.
operator
thank you. we'll hear next from david silver with cl king.
david silver -- cl king -- analyst
yeah, hi. good morning.
douglas t. dietrich -- chairman and chief executive officer
good morning.
david silver -- cl king -- analyst
yes. and a lot of good questions before, that that puts me in a bind, just kidding. but i would like to ask maybe a bigger picture question about kind of your -- the energy cost environment that you're operating in. i mean, there was just some good commentary on the foundry side. but what i'm thinking with paper and steel, i mean, those are both very energy-intensive industries that you're serving. and the price of crude oil is certainly rising, but the regional price for, let's say, natural gas has escalated pretty sharply and there's been headlines about some production cutbacks here and there.
so i was just wondering if maybe we could just hone in on your pcc business and maybe you're -- the steel making side of things. i mean what is -- from your perspective -- what is the risk that may be elevated energy costs or some difficulty in availability, may be in china or elsewhere, energy availability kind of will negatively impact your operating plans over the next couple of quarters? thank you.
douglas t. dietrich -- chairman and chief executive officer
so, david, i think, over the next couple of quarters, the risks are in that inflationary environment. so -- and then i'll try to address the longer-term, i guess, question you're asking in terms of the energy intensity of these things, which i also think will be dealt with an inflationary environment, that's a different set of challenges, countries and industries will have over the long-term.
but in the short-term and how we're looking at it, we have absolutely seen a rapidly changing energy market. i think you're probably hearing that around, we're starting in the third quarter, different by geography. in north america and in the west coast, it's been a little bit more electricity-driven in terms of cost increases, some natural gas given the changes of pricing in the united states.
i'd say, in europe, much more acute in terms of natural gas pricing. matt gave you a number that said we saw in some areas in europe a 400% increase of instantaneously through the third quarter. we're having to deal with volatility like that and staying on top of it and making sure that we have our energy. it's not about necessarily in our regions, the availability of the amount. it's what -- it's the changing -- rapidly changing pricing to get quoted.
in china, a little bit different. we're starting to see curtailments. we saw some of them in the third quarter. we weren't impacted significantly. matt mentioned, that is an uncertainty going into the fourth quarter, that we could see further curtailments, but we have seen some easing of coal prices in china and electricity has been a little bit more stable. so, i think, we've put all of that into what we're giving you in our forecast in the fourth quarter. we've got our pricing mechanisms and our inventories in a position -- in good position. so, we are covered in the short-term and we have mechanisms in place that is, as those energy cost change over the next year, we'll be in a position to make sure that we were on top of that.
longer-term though, energy is going to be an issue. and i don't know if we want to get into this call in terms of our conversion from fossil fuels to more greener sources, but that will be something as a company we're dealing with that as we move to greener energy sources. we are sourcing 40% of our electricity from green sources out in our wyoming facilities and we just changed to that. so, we are taking steps as a company to convert our business from coal to natural gas to cleaner sources to electricity and that electricity we're purchasing from greener sources already today. you can see what we've been doing over the past year in our sustainability report, but hopefully that answers some of what the company is doing over the longer-term and how we're dealing with it in the short-term.
david silver -- cl king -- analyst
yeah. very helpful. i'd like to ask one more question maybe to go back to the m&a and balance sheet question. so you have concluded a couple of transactions in just the past few months, including, i think, your largest acquisition since amcol, in terms of the purchase price. and i was just wondering if you could maybe comment on a couple of aspects. i mean first regarding the m&a funnel or project pipeline. doug, how would you characterize -- following these two deals, i mean how would you characterize your project pipeline or potential target pipeline, right now, let's say, relative to a year or two ago?
and then, secondly, maybe matt, if you could just remind me, but you have shown interest in projects of various sizes, including some larger ones. is there a way for us to think how high the company might go let's say above today's, i think it's 2.1 times net debt to trailing 12-month ebitda. i mean, how high might the company be willing to go for the right acquisition and how important is maintaining your current credit ratings in the event that an unusually attractive but larger target was to present itself? thank you.
douglas t. dietrich -- chairman and chief executive officer
okay. let me start with the first one, david. in terms of the pipeline, i guess, i could answer it quickly, that it's two projects smaller than it was couple of months ago, but we have a good pipeline of projects that sit along those growth strategies that we have to support our businesses globally. and as you've seen move -- we have some opportunities to grow our consumer-oriented product lines. so though we've executed on two of those that were in our pipeline just recently, i do think that there is other opportunities that have moved in and things become more actionable. so we've maintained a similar-sized pipeline and the things that we're attracted to if they became actionable than we were earlier in the year, a year ago, so about the same.
that said, in that pipeline, there are things that are smaller and we've always said in the tens of millions of dollars of revenue type numbers and there are some that are bigger in the hundreds of millions of dollars of revenue type pipeline. how far would we go to get some of the bigger ones? i think i've always answered the question that says it really depends on that target. and it really depends on as we've looked at it over time what we'd be willing to do -- what we feel we can do with it.
and so, if we feel from a risk standpoint and an understanding and fit with the culture of the company that the technologies that we have and the markets and how comfortable we are, we see some things that fit very well with our company and there. and if we know what we can get from a synergy standpoint, we always look at things going in and on a post synergy basis. and we look at that and make sure that they are going to be accretive to the value of the company after we know what we're going to do with it. we take a lot of time to think about that. how high does that take us? well, in amcol, that took us up to about 4.4 times. i'm sorry to say this, i'm not going to say there's any limitation, but that's at the higher end of the range, right. i don't think the things that we have in our pipeline requires to go there. but if we find the right thing and we feel comfortable with it, we're willing to make sure that we pay the right amount for it.
matthew e. garth -- senior vice president, finance and treasury, and chief financial officer
yes. and david, just to -- you heard doug talk about how and it was demonstrated i think in these last two acquisitions, how we're managing the small and medium type bolt-on acquisitions, managing that with cash on hand, using the revolver, paying that down quickly based on the strong free cash flow that we have and that we will continue to generate, and that is the flexibility that we talk about and have demonstrated over the past couple of years.
so, that's the way we think about that. transformationally, doug just gave you some space there. our conversations with credit rating agencies is very robust. i think we have a very good metric result in terms of our rating. and when you read their reports, they reflect that. they also reflect that there is optionality in our portfolio and that's why they rate us like i do -- rate us like they do. so there would be some of that deal structure built into their current rating.
douglas t. dietrich -- chairman and chief executive officer
i'd just say, david, that we're disciplined with that capital. i think there's not a lot that you see, sometimes they're not public, but i'd say we will walk away from -- there is more that we've walked away from because we're just not willing to pay when we don't see the value in it. so we keep to our knitting. we make sure we look at things very robustly. and we're really disciplined about how we're going to put that capital out to acquisitions.
david silver -- cl king -- analyst
thanks very much. appreciate it.
operator
thank you. we'll take our next question from marisa hernandez with sidoti & company.
marisa hernandez -- sidoti & company -- analyst
thank you. and good morning, everybody.
douglas t. dietrich -- chairman and chief executive officer
hi, marisa.
marisa hernandez -- sidoti & company -- analyst
so, question on your commentary about implementing price increases during the fourth quarter, that would allow you to catch up with some cost inflation by the end of the year. what does that mean exactly? how do you think about it in terms of percentage margin? where would you like to be at perhaps relative to prior quarters or at the beginning of 2021?
douglas t. dietrich -- chairman and chief executive officer
i want to make sure i understand the question. in terms of the margin, we're targeting -- let me see if i can answer it and you tell me if this is addressing it the right way. so, we will absorb costs. there are many instances where we will absorb costs and then there is a timing aspect to some of our business in terms of contractually when we get to pass that through. so, there is some lag, but when costs are going up, there is a lag putting the pricing up, but then as cost retreat, there's a lag between where we take that price down. that's largely in our paper and there's some other contract businesses we have.
there is also a practical speed at which you can put prices up for your customers. and so, we will absorb costs and the communication, the changes, the announcements and we've been very quick to make those changes in the instance of our specialty minerals business where prices, especially in the third quarter and energy went up very quickly. there is maybe a month lag in terms of our ability to push that price -- change those prices and move that through. and so, therefore, i'll give you an example. november 1, so the third quarter costs were absorbed and november 1 prices changed, that will be the end of january before that tranche has been absorbed.
now, we'll continue to make those changes. so it's a dynamic type environment. but that's why we said we've got it in place to be able to capture those increases. that said, that brings our margins, as matt mentioned, in that business going back to that historical kind of average of where they've been. so, we look at that, again, with higher cost and higher pricing, you also have to recover your margins in that pricing. and so we target that as well. so, it's both on an absolute basis, marisa, and on a margin basis to make sure we're protecting that, but there's a timing aspect to that change.
matthew e. garth -- senior vice president, finance and treasury, and chief financial officer
and just one clarification there. what we said, not by the end of the year, but in the first quarter of 2022 is when we're going to see us catch up with the costs. that we've absorbed so far this year in '21.
marisa hernandez -- sidoti & company -- analyst
okay. thank you. got it. okay. so you talk also about cost inflation persisting into the fourth quarter. curious as to what the pace has been lately? have you seen any slowdown or pick-up of inflation in generally speaking and specifically in some pockets?
matthew e. garth -- senior vice president, finance and treasury, and chief financial officer
so when we came into the second quarter, what we told you was that we had inflationary factors that we're in about that $7 million range. that accelerated to about $18 million on a year-over-year basis in the third quarter. and what i said previously was that, you're looking at a fourth quarter that on a year-over-year basis is going to be in that $17 million to $18 million, looks a lot like what we had seen in the third quarter.
the buckets of inflation started out in the second and third quarter, really starting with energy, that's now moved into raw materials. logistics has been a steady march as we've gone through that inflationary period. and that is -- so you're bucket of raw materials on a full year basis has grown and that's what i said before, it was about 60% of what we're anticipating for inflationary factors for the full year.
that being said, what we also showed you was that pricing was also accelerating. and for the fourth quarter, you're going to see that gap narrow significantly again on that $17 million, $18 million, we have pricing in place that's going to bring us closer to fully capturing that. and so, when you look now into the first quarter, that's why we have a viewpoint that we can catch up on what we've absorbed so far this year.
marisa hernandez -- sidoti & company -- analyst
that's very helpful. thank you. and finally, on the sales growth for 2022, north of about 10%, does that require additional acquisitions in 2022 or not necessarily?
douglas t. dietrich -- chairman and chief executive officer
no, not necessarily. so we think that that's -- with current acquisitions from the back half of this year, plus our growth rates in the projects that we have in hand that we're executing on as they ramp up in the new technologies, that's how that number is derived.
marisa hernandez -- sidoti & company -- analyst
thank you very much.
operator
thank you. we'll now take our final question from mike harrison with seaport research partners.
mike harrison -- seaport research partners -- analyst
hi, good morning. i was wondering if you could give some details around the specialty pcc assets, what kind of revenue or ebitda contribution would you expect to see and, i guess, maybe give a little bit more detail on what made those assets attractive to minerals technologies?
douglas t. dietrich -- chairman and chief executive officer
let me start and then i'll pass through to d.j. but, look, this is a small bolt-on acquisition, it's -- we're not highlighting it, because it's significant in terms of our system, of our platform of specialty pcc production here in the united states. it helps us from a logistics standpoint and at the moment relatively underutilized assets that we're going to upgrade to put in some technology. so we're not necessarily disclosing the revenue size of it and what we paid for it, but it will -- it's a small bolt-on acquisition.
i don't know, d.j., you want to give us a little more kind of what we're going to do with it?
d.j. monagle -- group president, specialty minerals and refractories
sure. mike, so a good way of thinking about it is, as if it's a pcc plant that we've been deploying, so that's a good way of just thinking about the level of revenue contribution that it would do in the neighborhood of $10 million. what we're excited about the most is, is that capacity that it gives us and to what doug was referring to, that allows us to work with our team that's in adams, massachusetts, with this asset now in missouri. we can introduce the new products. we can seek some growth that we think we've got a unique access to versus the previous owner. and then we also feel that we can -- it gives us great flexibility to work with product mix and really better serve the market.
so, we're very excited about that opportunity. it's a nice augmentation to what we've built in adams, massachusetts and it complements our position in both the construction and transportation markets, that's probably 75% or so of where those current tons go and then a little bit of it goes into the publication grade. so there's a little bit of paper business that's in there and some business that goes into inks, but we're excited mostly about the overlap in construction and transportation.
douglas t. dietrich -- chairman and chief executive officer
so, mike, a small bolt-on, again not trying to oversell the small base of revenue today around $10 million. it's what we're going to do with it going forward, given its capacity, we're going to put in new technology, debottlenecking and then really leverage it in conjunction with our adams facility and we think from a future growth standpoint, it could be bigger than that. so more to come as we -- this is yesterday, so more to come as we integrate it. i want to welcome our new employees and we'll keep you up-to-date on how we develop it over the next year.
mike harrison -- seaport research partners -- analyst
understood. appreciate the color there. and then, i wanted to ask about the packaging opportunity. you talked about that as being kind of a key technology for your pcc business. maybe just take a step back and help us understand how pcc that goes into packaging applications is different from pcc used as a filler in uncoated freesheet and maybe help us understand i guess for a similar-sized mill, is it the same amount of pcc in terms of volume per amount of paper and what do the margins look like compared to a traditional pcc application?
douglas t. dietrich -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah, let me start and then d.j. can fill it in. so it's not all pcc, there is pcc in packaging. pcc is using white top linerboard, as we mentioned some of our current packaging applications. there is pcc used as a high-end coating and some packaging applications. but these are different mineral types, i mentioned ground calcium carbonate and other mineral types that are going to white and brown box. the reason we highlight that today, is we've been working on this for a while and we've had some really good results and some pretty far long discussions in those packaging markets that put ourselves and our technologies -- we like the base paper market, but this puts us into other markets that our technology applies to that are growing and in the geographies where we currently sit.
so, d.j., are there more technical aspect of how we view those pigments and packaging?
d.j. monagle -- group president, specialty minerals and refractories
sure. so mike, let's start with the stuff that we're doing today and then i'll walk you through that kind of a sequence chronologically of how you'll be seeing these technologies get exposed. doug mentioned this white top liner, think of that as pizza box and there is new higher-end stuff that's coming out that you'll see a fully printed amazon box for instance. the value equation for pcc there is that we provide a better coverage and a better sheet. so we're enabling this upgrade of that capability and upgrade of that product performance and the margins and things that you should see from there are typical with what you see with our current pcc plant.
doug talked about our penetration in white board basically and this carton board that we've got. so, what you will recognize that in the marketplace on high-end stuff, which is where our pcc goes, that's the high-end would be stuff that you buy a bottle of liquor in or you get a case of golf balls. well, you go lower in that, and you've got things like ice cream board and those sort of things. and what we've introduced and what we're commercializing and working on these contracts on in china is a gcc.
now, what we've done here is combined our capabilities that we have at adams and lucerne valley where we're very familiar with the mineral gcc, combine that with some new processing technology and our operational excellence and satellite model. and so, we'll be introducing satellite models in china, that's -- that is what we're doing there. and much like the pcc business, these are discrete investments that will yield an appropriate return.
then the last thing that doug had referred to is really toward the brown box. this is our first machine trial. we're very excited about it. it is not a carbonate-based technology, it's an alternate mineral and first trials were good. we will probably have a better feeling for how quickly we can commercialize that in the first half of next year. it will take -- this first trial, we're analyzing the data for it. it was successful enough that we already have a second trial lined up. we'll get the full data and economic impact understood in that first quarter of next year and we'll be able to give you some more insight on that. but really pleased with how that paper group has pursued this strategic objective.
mike harrison -- seaport research partners -- analyst
okay. and you mentioned, this is another mineral not a carbonate-based product. is it bentonite-based?
douglas t. dietrich -- chairman and chief executive officer
mike, at this time, we're not -- for competitive reasons, we're not giving some details on that. and there are actually, the one that i -- or two technologies in this space. one that deals with recycling of minerals and then one that is -- the one that was just trialed is what i was specifically referring to. so we're holding back on that for some intellectual property advantages that we feel we have.
mike harrison -- seaport research partners -- analyst
all right. fair enough. appreciate the color there. thanks.
douglas t. dietrich -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks, mike.

operator
good day everyone, and welcome to the fourth quarter 2021 minerals technologies earnings call. today's call is being recorded. at this time, i'd like to turn the call over to erik aldag, head of investor relations for minerals technologies. please go ahead, mr.
aldag.
erik aldag -- head of investor relations for minerals technologies
thank you, katie. good morning, everyone, and welcome to our fourth quarter 2021 earnings conference call. today's call will be led by chairman and chief executive officer, doug dietrich; and chief financial officer, matt garth. following doug and matt's prepared remarks, we'll open it up to questions.
i'd like to remind you that beginning on page 15 of our 2020 10-k, we list the various risk factors and conditions that may affect our future results. and i'll also point out the safe harbor disclaimer on this slide. statements related to future performance by members of our team are subject to these limitations, cautionary remarks, and conditions. now, i'll turn the call over to doug.
doug? 
doug dietrich -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks, erik. good morning, everyone, and welcome to today's call. i'll walk you through our results for the fourth quarter and the full year of 2021. i'll also give you my insights on the year, focusing on our key financial and strategic highlights, as well as the various dynamics we faced and successfully managed through.
matt will then discuss our financial results in more detail and outline our first-quarter outlook. following that, i'll finish up by describing how we see 2022 shaping up as a strong year for us, touching on our key priorities, growth initiatives, and market conditions. let me start by going through the takeaways for the fourth quarter, which concluded a very strong year for mti. market demand continued to remain robust, and we delivered sales of $477 million, 10% higher than last year, and earnings per share of $1.25, an increase of 16%.
despite the market conditions, this is, by far, the most difficult operating quarter of the year as we had to navigate through a variety of inflationary and logistics pressures, which became more pronounced late in the quarter. cash flows remained solid through the fourth quarter, capping off a strong year. operating cash flow was $69 million and free cash flow was $46 million, and we made progress to lower our debt levels by paying down $20 million of debt. let me share how the quarter played out from an operational perspective and the actions we put in place to address the rapidly changing conditions.
heading into the fourth quarter, we anticipated that inflationary costs and logistics and supply chain challenges would persist, and we have positioned ourselves to recover these costs through implemented pricing actions. while much of this transpired as expected, we experienced significant additional cost escalations, notably due to rapid energy price spike in europe. we also saw increase -- an increase in supply chain disruptions, mainly due to truck and rail availability for shipments. this was exacerbated by covid-related labor challenges, primarily in the last month of the quarter.
the combination of these dynamics led to higher plant operating costs and delayed shipments, resulting in about $5 million of reduced income in the quarter. despite these circumstances, our global team did a great job executing, adjusting operating schedules, securing freight logistics, and taking further pricing measures. our order books remain robust, and the actions we've taken should more than recover the additional cost pressures we faced, setting us up for a stronger first quarter. on the growth and business development front, we had several highlights during the quarter.
the integration of normerica is progressing well, and we executed on significant opportunities in the quarter to grow our pet care business further in 2022. we also made a small acquisition of a specialty pcc assets in the midwest u.s., which strengthens our logistics and manufacturing capabilities. in addition, we signed two new satellite contracts in asia, one for a pcc facility in india and another with a packaging customer in china. all in all, it was a productive quarter from a growth perspective, and the operating and pricing adjustments we've already made position us well for a stronger start to 2022.
before matt gets into the financial details for the quarter, i'd like to review some highlights from 2021. it was a strong year for mti, as our business recovered from the 2020 covid demand lows to deliver record results. we accomplished this through a combination of operational execution and a focused commitment on advancing our key growth initiatives, which have meaningfully shifted our sales portfolio to be more balanced and stable. to demonstrate this transition over the past few years, revenue from our consumer-oriented businesses has doubled and today, they comprise 30% of our total sales portfolio.
it is this portion of our portfolio that's positioned in higher growth noncyclical markets. first and foremost, we delivered record annual sales and earnings per share for our company. sales increased 17% over last year to $1.9 billion. operating income was up 13% to $241 million, and our earnings per share grew 26% to $5.02.
serving our customers and innovating to grow with them is what motivates our team. we continue to accomplish this while navigating through complex and rapidly changing conditions during the year. we operated in an environment with sharply rising input costs, which required frequent operational adjustments, strong supply chain management, and process improvements. our teams work closely and transparently with our customers to manage through these dynamics, and we were successful in implementing a broad array of strategic pricing actions across our portfolio to offset the $50 million in extra costs we had to absorb.
the past year required a significant amount of agility from our employees, and i'm proud how they engage to drive improvements, efficiently run our operations, and support our customers' evolving needs. generating strong cash flow, further strengthening our balance sheet, and maintaining flexibility with how we deploy our capital are priorities. our financial position gives us significant optionality to allocate capital to shareholders, while also investing in attractive growth opportunities. we demonstrated this in 2021 by deploying $86 million to fund high-return organic projects, as well as to maintain and improve the performance and safety of our facilities.
we acquired normerica and the specialty pcc assets, while also returning $82 million to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. our balance sheet remained strong, and we kept our net leverage ratio near our target level of two times ebitda. now, let me take you through how we advanced a broad range of initiatives, which sets us up nicely for continued growth in 2022. i'll start with our consumer-oriented products.
most of these businesses are in our household, personal care, and specialty product line, and they performed very well with sales growth of 21%. this growth is a result of our positions in the structurally growing and stable markets and has been bolstered by our investments in new technologies, capacity expansions, and through extending the geographical reach of these businesses. normerica acquisition is one of those investments as it further expanded our pet care business in north america. we've also realized significant sales increases in other specialty applications, such as edible oil purification and personal care, which grew by 48% and 80%, respectively, last year.
the next part of our growth strategy that we delivered on during the year was expanding our core product lines in faster-growing geographies. our metalcasting business continues to grow globally, leveraging our blended bond system value proposition with customers in large foundry markets. metalcasting sales were up 21% in asia as we expanded our customer base and further penetrated into china with sales of our pre-blended products increasing by 20%. we continue to demonstrate our value in other countries and specifically in india, where sales of our blended products were up nearly 40% in 2021.
our pcc business continues to grow geographically with a 22% sales increase in asia. we benefited from 280,000 tons of new capacity that came online over the past year. in addition, we signed two new satellite contracts in 2021, totaling around 70,000 tons, which will be commissioned by the end of this year. and we're growing in our core markets.
our refractory segment is a great example of this as we've captured significant new business in the electric arc furnace market. in 2021, we signed long-term contracts worth $100 million through the deployment of our new portfolio of differentiated refractory products and high-performance laser measurement solutions. another area where we've successfully driven new profitable growth opportunities is by tapping into attractive adjacent markets through our broadened product offering. i'll highlight a couple of areas for you.
we signed a long-term agreement in december to deploy ground calcium carbonate technology for a new coated paperboard mill in china with a premier packaging customer. and we're really excited about this one as it's mti's first gcc satellite offering specifically tailored for packaging customers and represents a fundamental step in our ability to drive new growth opportunities in the white paperboard market. in addition, we have several trials underway with other technologies in both the white and brown packaging space. i've talked to you about our broad capabilities in water remediation and the traction we've made with fluoro-sorb, our proprietary solution for remediating pfos contamination in groundwater.
2021, we completed our first major commercialization for a large-scale project, and we generated interest in several other large drinking water and soil stabilization projects. our growth this past year in wastewater remediation was 15%, and we see this trajectory continuing in 2022. new product development is an integral part of our growth strategy, and we've made significant strides to improve the speed of execution, increase the number of products commercialized and enhance the impact of our latest solutions. over the past five years, we've cut the time from development to market in half.
and during the same time frame, we've increased the sales generated from new products by more than 60%. in addition, half of our new products are geared toward a sustainability solution for either mti or our customers. and lastly, we strengthened our company through the acquisition of normerica, which met all of our m&a criteria. the addition has made us one of the largest vertically integrated private label pet litter providers globally.
and as the commercial and operational integration progresses, we see a clear pathway to drive higher growth rates and profits in our pet care business. all told, this is a really productive year for us on all fronts. i'll come back to share my perspectives on the year ahead. but to sum up, our growth achievements in the past year puts us in an advantageous position for a strong 2022.
with that, i'll turn it over to matt to take you through our financial results in more detail. matt?
matt garth -- chief financial officer
thanks, doug. i'll review our fourth-quarter results, the performance of our segments, as well as our outlook for the first quarter. we'll then turn the call back over to doug for some additional perspectives on the year ahead. now, let's review the fourth-quarter results.
sales in the fourth quarter were 10% higher than the prior year and 1% higher sequentially. organic growth for the company was 4% versus the prior year, and the acquisition of normerica contributed the remainder of the growth. operating income, excluding special items, was $54.7 million, and operating margin was 11.5%. the year-over-year operating income bridge on the top right of this slide shows that we experienced $27.4 million of inflationary cost increases versus the prior year, which we offset with $18.6 million of pricing.
in addition, supply chain challenges, including trucking and labor availability, resulted in a delay of volumes from the fourth quarter, particularly in our processed minerals and spcc product lines. the sequential bridge on the bottom right shows how inflation continued to accelerate from the third quarter to the fourth quarter. and heading into the quarter, we expected the pace of inflationary costs to moderate from the third quarter, and we expected to recapture some margin with our planned price increases. as we move through the fourth quarter, inflationary costs accelerated to nearly $10 million, including higher energy costs in europe and turkey.
we were able to mitigate the unexpected increase with additional pricing in the quarter. however, a portion of the necessary price adjustments could not be passed through contractually until january 1. in addition, logistics and labor availability challenges resulted in shipment delays, lower productivity at our facilities, and ultimately, higher per-unit production costs in the period. these challenges, including the delayed sales volume and the unexpected spike in energy costs, resulted in approximately $5 million lower operating income than we originally expected for the quarter.
we've already made additional price adjustments in january, and our pricing is expected to exceed inflationary pressures, expanding margins in the first quarter. we also expect to catch up on the operational challenges we faced in the fourth quarter. meanwhile, we continue to control overhead expenses with sg&a as a percentage of sales at 10.8%, 80 basis points below the prior year. earnings per share, excluding special items, was $1.25 and represented 16% growth versus the prior year.
earnings per share benefited from foreign exchange gains, driven by the depreciation of the turkish lira, as well as lower interest expense and a lower share base versus the prior year as we continue to pay down debt and repurchase shares in the quarter. full-year earnings per share was $5.02, a record for the company and represented 26% growth versus the prior year. now, let's review the segments in more detail, starting with performance materials. fourth-quarter sales for performance materials were $256.2 million, 17% higher than the prior year and 2% higher sequentially.
the acquisition of normerica contributed 13% growth versus the prior year, and organic sales contributed an additional 4%. household, personal care, and specialty product sales were 24% above the prior year and 4% higher sequentially, driven by normerica and continued strong demand for consumer-oriented products. despite strong end-market demand and a full order book, our global pet care sales came in lighter than we expected due to logistics challenges in north america and europe. metalcasting sales were 9% higher than the prior year and 16% higher sequentially, driven by strong demand globally, continued penetration of green sand bond technologies in asia, and the return of volumes from the third quarter seasonal foundry maintenance outages.
environmental product sales grew 13% versus the prior year on improved demand for environmental mining systems, remediation, and wastewater treatment. building materials sales grew 21% versus the prior year on higher levels of project activity. sales in both of these product lines were lower sequentially due to typical seasonality. operating income for the segment was $29.1 million and operating margin was 11.4% of sales.
margin was temporarily impacted this quarter by approximately $3 million of logistics challenges and inflationary cost increases that could not be passed through contractually until january 1 of this year, primarily in pet care and our metalcasting business in china. the normerica business has been navigating the same supply chain and inflationary cost challenges as the rest of our business, and we have deployed pricing and productivity actions to achieve accretion as planned in 2022. now looking to the first quarter, we see a significant rebound in margins for this segment, driven by pricing actions that went into effect on january 1 and continued strong demand across the product lines. and overall, we expect the operating income for this segment to be approximately 20% higher sequentially.
and now, let's move to specialty minerals. specialty minerals sales were $141.5 million in the fourth quarter, 2% higher than the prior year, and 4% lower sequentially. pcc and process mineral sales were both 2% above the prior year. this segment was the most impacted by the spike in energy in europe, as well as logistics and labor challenges we saw in the fourth quarter.
segment operating income was $14.5 million and represented 10.2% of sales. in total, operating income was impacted by $4 million in the quarter, which came from approximately $2 million of unexpected energy inflation and additional $2 million due to the sales and productivity impact resulting from logistics and labor challenges, primarily in our northeast u.s. plants. pricing adjustments were made in january to cover these inflationary costs, and low logistics challenges continued into january.
we do not foresee these challenges persisting through the quarter. now moving to the first quarter. we expect higher pcc volumes sequentially on the ramp-up of our new satellite in india and the restart of the satellite in the u.s., and we expect continued strength in specialty pcc and processed minerals. we see margins rebounding to more normal levels based on the pricing we have implemented.
we should also see improved productivity in shipment volumes, depending on to the extent to which logistics and labor constraints ease. overall, for the segment, we expect first-quarter operating income to be 20% to 25% higher than the fourth quarter. and now, let's move to the refractory segment. refractory segment sales were $79.2 million in the fourth quarter, 7% higher than the prior year, and 4% higher sequentially on new business volumes and continued strong steel market conditions in north america and europe.
segment operating income remained strong at $12.4 million, 12% higher than the prior year, and operating margin was 15.7% of sales. turning to the first quarter. we expect another strong operating performance from this segment with operating income up 20% on incremental volumes from new business. we did see a slight moderation in steel utilization rates in north america in the fourth quarter from the mid-80% range to the low 80s.
however, the demand fundamentals for this segment remains strong. now let's take a look at our cash flow and liquidity highlights. full-year cash flow from operations was $232.4 million. capital expenditures were $86 million as we invested in high-return growth and productivity projects, as well as sustaining our operations.
free cash flow was $146.4 million. the company used a portion of free cash flow to repurchase $75 million of shares, completing the prior-year share repurchase authorization and beginning the new $75 million 1-year share repurchase program that the board of directors authorized in october. as of the end of the fourth quarter, total liquidity was over $500 million, and our net leverage ratio was 2.1 times ebitda. our balance sheet remains in a very strong position, which provides us with the flexibility we need to continue to invest in high-value, high-return growth opportunities, both organically and inorganically.
looking ahead, we expect another strong year of cash flow generation with cash from operations increasing commensurately with higher income. our capital spend will be in the range of $85 million to $95 million for 2022. we have a solid pipeline of high-return organic growth opportunities, and we plan to deploy capital spend toward these opportunities, as well as sustaining and improving our operations. and overall, we expect free cash flow increasing to the $150 million to $160 million range for the full year.
so now, let me summarize our outlook for the first quarter. overall, we see continued strong demand across our end markets and our order books reflect this. in the fourth quarter, we saw unusually high spikes in energy costs and increased challenges around logistics and labor availability. our latest view for the first quarter is that the inflationary pressures and logistics challenges will continue.
however, we have pricing actions and operational adjustments in place today to more than offset the known increases and significantly expand margins in the first quarter. overall, for the company, we expect a strong performance in the first quarter, with operating income in the range of $63 million to $65 million, 15% to 20% higher than the fourth quarter, and with earnings per share around $1.25. with that, i'll turn it back over to doug to provide some additional perspective on the year ahead. doug?
doug dietrich -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks, matt. as we look ahead, this is going to be another dynamic year with many of the same inflationary and logistics pressures continuing. but with the momentum across our businesses and the growth projects underway and our strong operating performance, 2022 is shaping up to be another record year for mti. overall, i'm very excited about where we are as a company and where we're going.
we've transformed mti into a higher-growth, higher-margin, and higher-value company. we have more opportunities in front of us beyond what i've shared with you today that will further enhance this trajectory. we're well-positioned to leverage our balanced portfolio, and we have a breadth of attractive projects across our businesses that will drive our sales and earnings momentum this year. we focused on accelerating our geographic penetration in our core product lines and building our growth opportunities in adjacent markets.
in addition, we'll further strengthen our r&d pipeline with a focus on increasing the percentage of revenue from new products, as well as introducing solutions, which help us penetrate attractive markets. with our solid financial footing, we have the resources to execute on all of our growth initiatives. our strong balance sheet and cash flow generation give us the flexibility to deploy capital to shareholders, while at the same time, accelerating our growth trajectory through acquisitions, similar to what we achieved this past year. we have a targeted list of inorganic opportunities that will continue to transform our company with a focus on profitable growth.
underpinning everything we do is our culture of continuous improvement. operational excellence is embedded in our company with our employees at its center. it's our employees and their high level of engagement around problem-solving through kaizen events, utilizing standard work practices, and implementing suggestions to improve daily processes, which enables us to adapt to changing environments. it's this ingrained culture that is the foundation of mti's unique operating capabilities.
sustainability is the core value at mti. and over the past several years, we've made significant progress to embed our esg priority deeper into our company, our operating mindset, and our growth strategies. in 2022, we'll be focused on promoting our safety culture of zero injuries, achieving -- or exceeding our six environmental reduction targets, increasing our product portfolio geared toward sustainable solutions, and making mti a more diverse and inclusive place to work. we look forward to sharing more about these initiatives as we publish our 14th sustainability report in july.
to sum it all up, we have a winning formula, an engaged team, and a leading portfolio of businesses. with sales growth of 10% to 15% expected this year, combined with our distinct operational capabilities, we have all the elements in place to deliver a very strong performance in 2022. i'll leave you with the final takeaway. over the past two years, we've demonstrated two key attributes of our company.
2020 is financial resilience during very challenging conditions. in this past year, it's significant growth potential. it's our more balanced portfolio, which has enabled this performance and which will continue to deliver higher levels of profitable growth going forward. with that, i'll turn the call over to questions.

operator
thank you. [operator instructions] we'll go first to daniel moore with cjs securities.
daniel moore -- cjs securities -- analyst
thank you. good morning, doug. good morning, matt. thanks for the color as always.
i will start with a couple of housekeeping things just to get out of the way. refractories, i think you said q1 op income up 20%. is that sequentially as you gave with the other segments, or is that year over year?
matt garth -- chief financial officer
yeah. all of our guidance is typically sequentially and that is the case for each of the segments and for the full company, so refractories is sequential.
daniel moore -- cjs securities -- analyst
perfect. so, the -- just to clarify, the $5 million costs, labor, logistics, etc., do you expect to get those all back in q1 or over the course of q1? just trying to see how much of the recovery is embedded in the guide.
matt garth -- chief financial officer
yeah. so, if you take a look at that $5 million, the easy way to break it out, if you listen to the prepared remarks, about $2 million of that was inflation that we said we were going to capture with pricing going into the first quarter. and then the other $3 million was largely related to the logistics and some of the labor challenges that we saw and the impact on our operations. what we've said is we're going to be able to recover that in the first quarter.
so, that is embedded in the move from the $54.7 million to the $63 million to $65 million range.
daniel moore -- cjs securities -- analyst
perfect. ok. and then just looking at the -- sorry about that, refractories. i know you talked about this previously, with a new project that would be about $100 million incremental revenue benefit over the next five years.
when do you expect that to start to kick in in terms of timing and ramp?
doug dietrich -- chairman and chief executive officer
sure. let me kick it off, and then i'll let brett argirakis, who runs the business, give you a little bit more color, dan. some of those have already started to kick off probably more later in the first quarter, second quarter, and throughout the year. we have other projects that are planned to kick in probably third and fourth quarter.
i think it's all told brett, seven contracts, eight contracts totaling $100 million over the next six years. why don't you give a little color on that if you can?
brett argirakis -- senior vice president, managing director
yeah, sure. there's seven of the contracts we anticipate kicking in, in 2022, seven of the eight. so, we anticipate a couple of those starting sometime in the first quarter, and then they'll gradually expand through the year. these projects, of course, they're based on our key initiatives that are driving the new products, durable products, more efficient applications, and safer processes.
so, it's really driving into the new eaf market, the expansions, a lot of growth. there's about 5 million tons of new steel coming into the market, and we're happy to say we're part of that, and we're initiating all of our segments into those growth areas. so, we're pretty excited about that.
matt garth -- chief financial officer
that'll help then. so, $100 million over five years, it averages out to 20, but they will ramp up a little bit later this year. so, you might see an incremental $15 million from those contracts this year as they ramp up. but yeah, pretty excited about the new technologies that we've deployed in this market and should provide that growth through this year and beyond for refractories.
brett argirakis -- senior vice president, managing director
excellent. no, that's very helpful. more bigger-picture, just from an m&a perspective, obviously, you've been focused on -- or you've been a little bit more vocal about the growth in your consumer-oriented businesses. is that the primary area of focus for future m&a, or are you looking at a sort of a wider array of opportunities? thanks, doug.
doug dietrich -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes, it's a wider array. yeah. i think we do highlight that you picked up on in our consumer-oriented portfolio. and we think that's important because, in my last comments, we do think that this provides us a bigger portion of the company that sits in structurally growing noncyclical markets.
and that balances out some of the industrial markets that we're in, and there's some cyclicality of that, as you've noted. and so, again, i think we see opportunities to continue to expand in that consumer where we have vertical integration capabilities, number one, but also where we have technical capabilities to supply those types of consumer specialties. but i think there's also opportunities in our core markets, core minerals around the world that we're also looking at. so, i think it's balanced across all of industrial and consumer, but certainly, we are focused on continuing that balance through additions to that consumer specialty business, where we think we add a lot of value.
daniel moore -- cjs securities -- analyst
all right. very good. i'll jump back in queue with any follow-ups. thanks.
doug dietrich -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks, dan.
operator
we'll take our next question from silke kueck with jpmorgan.
silke kueck -- jpmorgan chase and company -- analyst
hi. good morning. how are you?
doug dietrich -- chairman and chief executive officer
hi, silke.
silke kueck -- jpmorgan chase and company -- analyst
i have a question on the household business. so, it looks like that the 24% growth in the quarter had the contribution of normerica. and maybe that was maybe -- that was that -- like a 28% contribution, that was like higher price of a couple of percent, maybe like 4%. so, were the volumes down about 8%? and was that all related to the pet care business? and do you think -- and i wonder now like how fast you can get that business back? is it all going to come out in the first quarter? will that spread out through next year? that's my first question.
doug dietrich -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. so, to make sure i understand, you're looking at volumes and your question is why were volumes in pet care down, your estimate, 8% of that. that's generally due to some of the logistics challenges that i was talking about. there's a couple of fewer days in the fourth quarter versus the third, so that played a few percent into it.
but largely, silke, that is -- and let me describe some of that, what some of these logistics challenges are. in the -- you touched on something that i think i want to make sure we're clear on. in the fourth quarter and largely in december, and i think you probably heard this from a number of different companies, trucking was challenging. and so, it was rail, and that was due to drivers and probably had some issues with covid and what was going on with supply of labor throughout december.
and so, yes, we had things on the dock ready to go. and if a truck doesn't show up, you got to readjust it, and you got to move some stuff around and that causes productivity issues in your plant. and then, the truck that you thought was yesterday shows up tomorrow, and you got to load it up, and then some trucks just didn't show up during the past few weeks. so, our order books, regardless of that are extremely strong.
in normerica, we faced a lot of those same logistics issues. i don't think the trucking strike in canada that happened recently helped all this whole situation. but we see that that's probably not going to continue through the first quarter. and so, a lot of that volume decline is on pet care was due to just getting that stuff off the dock and navigating those logistics challenges.
that said, those order books are full. we see that loosening up through the quarter, and we see getting all of that out through the first. and that's -- and so, we have a positive outlook on the first. and to dan's last question, we're going to capture that.
we've already got pricing and activities in place to more than capture that $5 million and move on with that growth that we see and dropping that to the bottom line in the first. so, i hope that helped with some of where that pet care volume went, but it's not a demand-related issue.
silke kueck -- jpmorgan chase and company -- analyst
ok. so, you should see all things being equal, and maybe that's a question for the performance materials business overall. given that there was acquisition benefit and positive price, like it looked like there was like no volume growth for the performance materials segment in the quarter. and should you see like really strong volume growth in the first quarter?
doug dietrich -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah, we're expecting that. again, we had some challenges across the business in terms of last few weeks of the year of shipments. and so, some of that's delayed into the first. we definitely have the order book to fulfill all of it.
so, it's not a demand-related issue right now. it is more making sure the operations and getting that packaging. and yeah, we had to move some shifts around with perspective and i know 10% of our north america plant-based workforce was quarantined at some point through december, january. but that's what my comments were that the teams did a great job navigating shift schedules, moving things around, getting the plants to continue to produce, getting things off the dock, shifting orders.
yeah, it was a challenging quarter. but like i said, it's not a demand-related issue, we've made some -- those corrections in our plants, we see the logistics loosening up. and we've put pricing in place to more than cover the inflation that we saw acutely in the quarter. so, we'll get all of that back, order books are good, and we see a much stronger first quarter coming.
this is what we think is more of a fourth quarter kind of acute issue.
silke kueck -- jpmorgan chase and company -- analyst
that's helpful. i didn't mean to criticize. i thought everybody had the same issues. i was just trying to figure out how much volumes might not have been shipped and what might come next year in order to better model it.
that was the question.
doug dietrich -- chairman and chief executive officer
i appreciate that. i just took your question as an opportunity to lay out some more clarity on what went on. that's all. so, i appreciate that.
silke kueck -- jpmorgan chase and company -- analyst
excellent. it's really helpful. thank you. are your paper businesses affected by the strike in finland? were you pleased with your paper business, or that doesn't affect you? i guess hard to gauge what exactly is happening, whether the plants are operating or not.
doug dietrich -- chairman and chief executive officer
no, we did not see any impact from that.
silke kueck -- jpmorgan chase and company -- analyst
ok. in the first quarter, some of that seemed to have happened like in the beginning of the year.
doug dietrich -- chairman and chief executive officer
that has not affected us in any meaningful way this quarter.
silke kueck -- jpmorgan chase and company -- analyst
ok. that's helpful. and lastly, i'm like sort of trying to gauge whether there are any effects from geopolitically like what's happening between russia and the ukraine. have your customers voiced any concern what might happen if they can't import pig iron? or is there any conceptualization? because the nice thing is that there's a lot of capacity that's coming on, or like there is incremental production that's expected in terms of steel production in 2020.
then there's the issue of whether all the raw material that you need can be gotten. does your customer base have a view how things might play out?
doug dietrich -- chairman and chief executive officer
let me give you the impact. certainly, that is a risk, right? so, everything we've given you is forecasting relatively similar or current geopolitical environment. so, i'm not going to predict what's going to happen with russia and ukraine. however, i can tell you what -- where we sell and what directly would impact the company, right? so, directly, our sales into russia are very small, below $5 million.
so, that -- it's not a sales issue for us. we do source some things from russia and if that were to be interrupted, we have backups. but that's also a very small portion of what we actually saw. so, i think the impact on us would be more tangentially on our customers, and what i mean by that, i guess, another direct impact could be energy.
we've seen a lot of energy price increase in europe. should there be energy disruption that's something that could impact the company in certain areas and many companies, by the way, i would imagine. and then the tangential impacts of what sanctions are put in place, if any, and how they affect markets and demand and that ruble effect. i'm not in a position right now to tell you exactly what those would be because i don't know, but as a direct impact from mti, our supply chains are secure, and our sales are very small into russia and ukraine in total.
but we do see that as it should be as a risk to the global economies and that could have an impact on the company, obviously, as with others.
silke kueck -- jpmorgan chase and company -- analyst
so, the u.s. refractory customers have not expressed the concern that they might be able to import pig or from -- to continue operating?
doug dietrich -- chairman and chief executive officer
no, no. anything that would support our refractory business in north america is either self-manufactured or sourced outside of russia. so, russia would not be or the ukraine would not be an issue for us. we do source magnesium oxide in turkey, we manufacture and mine our own and we also source from china and we've largely already secured those supplies throughout the year and move them, frankly, as a matter of fact, out of china before the olympics.
so, we had planned on a lot of things happening in china. those are secure. we do manufacture our own calcium metal. we manufacture that.
we're the only calcium metal manufacturer in north america, in the western hemisphere, frankly. and we have sourced calcium metal out of russia, but we also have other sources for that to be able to shore up that supply chain and that goes into our calcium wire that goes into the steel industry in the u.s. but right now, we've looked at those redundancies, our supply redundancies around the world, and ensuring that that's not going to be a disruptive effect on any customer here in the united states or europe, for that matter.
silke kueck -- jpmorgan chase and company -- analyst
that's helpful. and i won't believe it. i will move on. my concern was -- is that there was an issue in making this deal like was less word about you getting the magnesia.
i was worried about it being an effect on like steel products in the u.s. if you can't get pig ore?
doug dietrich -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. i think russia is about 1.3 million, yeah, imported in the united states. so, i think there's probably capacity to be able to bring that up in the united states. we see with the new capacity coming online, the 5 million tons that brett just mentioned, russia imports about 1.3% into the u.s.
i think the u.s. will be able to absorb it. and certainly, we have the capacity to be able to support that from a refractory standpoint. 
silke kueck -- jpmorgan chase and company -- analyst
that's great. thank you for making it so clear. and my last question is, how big was that that was at pcc specialty business that you bought in november? like, what did you pay for it? and like are there -- what are the sales that are coming from that business? thanks so much.
doug dietrich -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah, it's a small -- it's a small bolt-on, silke. so, i think the revenue, it's like a $10 million-type revenue business in the midwest. so, a small -- yeah, relatively small purchase price for a valuable asset like that.
silke kueck -- jpmorgan chase and company -- analyst
that's great. thank you.
doug dietrich -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks, silke.
operator
thank you. we'll take our next question from mike harrison with seaport research partners.
mike harrison -- seaport global securities -- analyst
hi. good morning.
doug dietrich -- chairman and chief executive officer
hi, mike.
mike harrison -- seaport global securities -- analyst
i wanted to go back to the household and pet care segment with a couple of questions. first of all, i guess maybe a good time to just discuss how the normerica integration has been going, i mean, aside from the logistical issues that you saw. are you seeing the integration and maybe some of the synergies that you anticipated there playing out? and maybe talk about kind of underlying trends around private label and premium cat litter as we get into 2022.
doug dietrich -- chairman and chief executive officer
sure. thanks, mike. so, the integration is going well. we captured over half of the synergies already and the others are more timing-related, timing related to vertically integrating the clay supply.
there were some contracts in place when we bought normerica from other play suppliers that we look to integrate as they expire. so, those are the remaining synergies to capture and that should be done through the second quarter of this year. so, largely from an operation standpoint, we couldn't be happier to have the new employees. we've gone through extensive safety training, operational excellence, training, working through their plants and upgrading them in terms of starting to upgrade them from a capability standpoint, just really wanting to bring them to we see the standard of education and operation in mti and that's still ongoing.
so, our back-office already integrated, all of that going really well. the challenges we had obviously is purchases and we absorbed some inflation. so, a lot of packaging inflation, logistics challenges throughout the four months that we've owned it. many of those contracts to be able to push that pricing through as matt mentioned, were done on january 1.
so, i guess the challenge and maybe not surprise was that we had to deal with some issues through the end of the year, but largely made those corrections and we're well on our way from an operation standpoint with that integration. i'll let john talk a little bit more about the market where we are from a private label standpoint and what the demand outlook looks like, jon?
jon hastings -- senior vice president, corporate development
sure. a couple of things. just to reiterate, synergy is certainly well in hand. we're working with all of our customers.
the market has been very strong, demand is there. as we've been retooling our operations, we've also been retooling some of our customer relationships. we've worked with them on pricing like we do everybody else, that's been extremely successful, and everything is in place. in addition to that, like i said, demand is extremely strong.
we've picked up new customers, we're adding share positions winning new contracts and that will push more volume through our plants as well. and we're retooling those plants, we're debottlenecking them, and we're expanding our capacity. so, from a market demand perspective, again, very, very strong and we see that in canada and also the u.s., and we're well-positioned to take advantage of it.
mike harrison -- seaport global securities -- analyst
all right. great. and then my other question on the consumer side of the business. you mentioned edible oil purification and some of the personal care business has had grown pretty nicely during 2021.
maybe just talk about -- is that an area where some of these new products and innovation are starting to contribute. maybe talk about kind of how you're growing that organically? and are you going to get to a point where you maybe need to look at an acquisition to expand capabilities?
jon hastings -- senior vice president, corporate development
yeah. mike, again, this is jon. as you know, we've had a large success with our existing business, as we've built that plant a couple of years ago, we filled it up. we've been growing with customers and new products and innovation.
that team has been very energized and looking for opportunities with customers around the world, in europe, in north america, also in asia. we continue to see that growth expanding as we continue into the year to come and also the years going forward. we have been debottlenecking our plant there as well, expanding capacity. and at the right time, we'll make investments where needed in order to continue supplying the products and the demand that our customers are asking for.
so, very successful, and we'll continue expanding as we can.
doug dietrich -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. and so, mike, we've got lot of opportunities across these consumer businesses, and i mentioned wastewater and the further development of our fluoro-sorb product. in our personal care business, which has some bentonite-based, portions of it in polymer-based portions where we have very unique capabilities, edible oil, which is a bentonite-based business. so, we're going to -- with the growth trajectory we're seeing, we'll probably make some investments in some -- in expanding capacity in the near future to make sure we keep pace of that growth.
but it is also an area where, as i mentioned, we'd look to acquire. so, some additional position. so, yes, on both fronts, we see good opportunity set to grow this further and these are higher-margin products. so, these are part of that accretive to our margin growth going forward and our margin targets.
so, a good outlook for both of these businesses.
mike harrison -- seaport global securities -- analyst
all right. sounds good. and then my last question is around pricing. if i do the math, it looks like you got about 4%, 5% year-on-year pricing overall for the company.
is that correct? where do you expect that pricing number to be as we get to q1? and maybe talk about kind of pricing contribution by segment. are there areas where you feel better about being caught up against inflation in areas where you're kind of further behind?
doug dietrich -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. you have the numbers pretty accurately, mike. i think we -- pretty simply, to break down our 10% to 15% growth last quarter, i said 5% from organic volume, 5% from normerica, and we see another 5% probably in pricing. so, between 10% in price and volume and how that plays out, that could be higher depending on how these markets go.
and we have 5% from just the year-over-year impact from normerica. so, we see -- even without that inorganic piece of normerica up in that 10% type -- 10-plus range and with that kind of volume and the operating capabilities, it's why we're really positive about 2022. yes, we're going to have the challenges. we're going to be navigating getting stuff off the docks.
we're going to be making sure we secure trucks and we supply our customers. but we've been doing that all last year, too. it's hard to predict where covid goes, but seeing this passed us through december and january, we have a better outlook. we think lot of our employees returning to work, moving through it, that's going to bode well for us.
so, we look for -- we're going to be probably above that 5% pricing in the first quarter and we're going to maintain that over our costs throughout the year. so, we're going to get back the deficit that we had from last year and exceed it and that's why we're bullish on our margins as well through the year. the place that we're probably a little bit behind, but it's not because of any actions from ours, it's more contractual. a piece of that energy increase we saw in the fourth quarter was in our paper business and that will get pass through probably second quarter this year, late second quarter.
so, that's just contractual timing. so, part of that is -- we're a little bit -- we have some delay as things go up in that paper business, but the rest of the business i think really happy, we're right on top of stuff. we've really changed our contracts to shorten them up. we've changed our ability to move quickly.
we've increased the speed of dialogue and transparency with customers. i mentioned before, we used to raise prices maybe once a year. we've done it five, six times last year. and so, that pace that agility and being able to have our contracts and dialogues in place with customers to be able to do that, that's where we are.
so, we continue to probably have to face that this year, but we're positioned to do so.
matt garth -- chief financial officer
and one additional thing to add just on the mix component that you were talking about, mike. if you take a look at the third, fourth quarter of 2021, really good performance in the performance materials business, yes, rising costs. we talked in the prepared remarks a little bit about some of the delays that impacted that business because of the contractual nature of getting those increases on january 1st, we'll get that. but as we move into first quarter, you're going to see, as doug said, that smi segment start to get some more pricing.
so, a little bit of a change as to where you're seeing the pricing coming.
mike harrison -- seaport global securities -- analyst
all right. sounds good. thanks very much.
doug dietrich -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks, mike.
operator
we'll take our next question from david silver with c.l. king.
david silver -- c.l. king and associates -- analyst
yeah. hi. good morning.
doug dietrich -- chairman and chief executive officer
good morning, david.
david silver -- c.l. king and associates -- analyst
hey, i'd like to pick up, i think, on one of mike's first question about normerica. your answer was very good in terms of discussing the qualitative progress of that acquisition and integration. but when i reviewed my notes to prepare for this call, i guess last quarter, you did set out some quantitative targets. and i was wondering if you could comment on two things.
first, whether normerica was accretive in the fourth quarter? and then secondly, for full year 2022 versus -- is it still your expectation that normerica will be 5% to 7% accretive and whether, i don't know, the middle of that range or the low end or the high end is more appropriate now from february 4th perspective? thank you.
doug dietrich -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. so, normerica was accretive in the fourth quarter, but i will tell you less than we had originally planned and that's largely due to -- we captured the synergies that we expected through the fourth quarter, but we faced some inflationary pressures that were unexpected and some shipping delays that were unexpected. that said, i mentioned those contracts as they've changed on january 1. that's been taken care of.
and all of that cost is -- should recover that lot. so, a bit of a delay there in terms of that accretion, david. but that said, where we are with those operations, with the employee base, with the order book, pricing, we see achieving that 5% to 7% -- no 5% to 7% we're going to be right on track with that 5% to 7% accretion number for 2022. so, back on track.
we just needed to get through -- absorb some of that cost that we saw in the back half of the year and get on with that -- those changes in the first part of this year.
matt garth -- chief financial officer
from a synergy perspective, which we also laid out, that $5 million to $7 million, on track and on pace with the synergies. again, doug already outlined some of the challenges from an operating income perspective that we saw in the fourth quarter. but the synergies and the integration are moving along as we thought they would.
doug dietrich -- chairman and chief executive officer
i think --
david silver -- c.l. king and associates -- analyst
yeah.
doug dietrich -- chairman and chief executive officer
go ahead, david. i'll let you finish your question.
david silver -- c.l. king and associates -- analyst
no, no. if you wanted to add on, please do. thank you.
doug dietrich -- chairman and chief executive officer
no, i was going to say -- yeah, thank you. i was going to mention though that despite that, we see the same -- the thesis that we had when we went into normerica is well intact. the accretion will come in 2022 as planned. but and i think jon mentioned this, we're seeing the reasons we bought it is because it positions us around the north america market to be able to serve a broader array of customers and with our vertically integrated position add a lot more value to those customers.
and we're seeing that play out. we're starting to see opportunities, more opportunities, new contracts, new business that i think that is that the perception of the market is that the capability we are is that kind of supplier, not just north america, but demonstrated in europe and globally, that's being noticed. and i think that thesis of being able to grow this business and grow it profitably more significantly than prior to the acquisition, i think is all intact. so, we're excited about it.
yeah, we're going to move through this inflationary period like the rest of the businesses, but the thesis of how we bought it and what it's going to deliver to the company is intact.
david silver -- c.l. king and associates -- analyst
ok. great. my next question, i was hoping to get maybe a broad like a 360 perspective on your metalcasting business. so, year over year, metalcasting revenues were up 24%.
but to me, even more interestingly, i mean, they're 10% or so above 2019. so, in other words, 10% above pre-pandemic levels. and when you look at your global business, couple of questions, but how much of that growth from your perspective is ""just cyclical,"" just the end markets recovering versus how much is maybe company-specific or company-driven with your customized blends and marketing initiatives, etc.? and maybe if you could comment on whether the recent strength is indicative. should i be able to read through that and say global auto builds are primed to pick up meaningfully, let's say, in the first half of 2022? thank you.
matt garth -- chief financial officer
yeah. let me throw and give you some perspective. so, 24% growth in metalcasting, i gave you -- china this year grew 20% -- asia grew 21%, that includes china and india. north america volume growth this year was 10% and that included sales were up higher than that through pricing, probably 14%, but that included some back half of the year slowdown due to some of the automotive.
and what we're seeing in terms of our customers who supply automotive that in north america and actually globally production deferred numbers anywhere from 17% to 25% higher than this past year. so, we had a strong year last year in north america, supplemented by a consistent -- we've had 10% compound annual growth in china in metalcasting, last year was 20%. so, a bigger year last year. we see that compound annual growth outside of the united states continuing, and we see that we're able to have a -- we're going into a stronger year in metalcasting than we left in 2021 given the auto demand.
we have a strong order book across the industrial, off-highway agricultural business. and then with automotive coming back, we think it's shaping up to be, at least as we see it today, a strong year. jon, does that characterize that accurately? is that what you are seeing there?
jon hastings -- senior vice president, corporate development
yeah, very much so. i mean, looking to segments, i mean, auto is a piece of it. it's probably 35% to 40% of our business, and we've talked about that. heavy truck, ag, municipal, they are all -- demand is extremely strong.
we see it in china. we see it in india. we see it in north america. we also see it in southeast asia.
and so, what we predict is going forward into 2022, strong demand continues. the demand you asked about the product portfolio, the penetration of our blended products continues. we see the substitution especially in asia, but also including india. that team is very innovative.
as you know, we work with each of our customers, and we try to ensure that we deliver the products that they need for their specific plans. so, very, very well positioned and the demand is there from all the segments. of course, we're working through the ups and downs associated with the demand profile based on the auto market.
doug dietrich -- chairman and chief executive officer
so, to answer your question, david, i'd say 50-50. half of the growth this year was probably due to strong demand in north america and then the other half is just a continued penetration of our products and value in asia. but we see that continuing again this year because we see a strong north america auto market and that continued growth in china, india, southeast asia.
david silver -- c.l. king and associates -- analyst
ok. i'm going to just sneak a quick one in here, but i was interested in your recent announcement about the packaging targeted pcc satellite in china. and i was wondering if you could just talk about the issues involved in accomplishing that? in other words, is the technology especially different? are you differentiated from your other competitors globally? is this something that they have not done yet? and then what other issues, i mean, can you follow the same model, satellite model with the basic or your legacy pcc business? or are there meaningful differences either in technology or capital cost or other types of issues? so how might packaging pcc opportunity differ structurally from your legacy pcc satellite business? thanks.
doug dietrich -- chairman and chief executive officer
sure. so, yeah, we are excited about this one. i'll let d.j. talk more about some of the technology and etc.
but this is structured, it's similar and it's different from pcc. it's structured with a long-term contract, similar to our pcc contract, satellite contracts. it's a similar level of capital investment, it's a little bit different because the volumes are three times a pcc plant. i mean, these are 350,000 tonnes of gcc, but it's set up more as a technology and tolling because, in this instance, the customer is providing some of the limestone that we're creating in the ground calcium carbonate and delivering on a constant basis.
i think the difference is and why we're excited about this is because we have both the pcc and the ground calcium carbonate package that we can deploy because in many cases in these packaging opportunities is both. they use both ground calcium carbonate and pcc. and so, we developed a solution to be able to deliver through this contract mechanism that we have kind of an approach that they're going to have a one-stop shop for their carbonate supply for that whole packaging product. there's room to grow for that, and we'll let d.j.
talk about what the market looks like and maybe a little bit more about our technology.
d. j. monagle -- chief operating officer
yeah. so, david, on this particular application, as we've been describing the packaging market in the past, this is on that higher-end packaging. so, it's an all-white board, and you'd be familiar with it on anything from a box that holds golf balls to pricing package. so, that's the market that we're in.
and as doug was talking about the basic business model is holding true, we get an investment, we get a good return on that investment. and what it really does for us, it allows us to bring our applications expertise into that market where we think that we got an awful lot to offer our customers. it is a satellite model. so, we can tailor the product for the specific customers' needs, plus we bring our operational excellence where we give some level of improvement over time.
in this application, let us put us way forward, it also broadens our ability to bring in pcc as well. so, several of these board manufacturers will look to upgrade their product line. so, we're starting off with gcc, but we already have other requests to bring in gcc and pcc. so, we feel that we've got an awful lot to offer there.
now in that $60 million ton market that is this white packaging board, this -- a lot of that market is well served with the current infrastructure. these opportunities in particular are pursuing the growth that is available in asia, where this satellite model applies. so, that's what we're excited about with this opportunity, and we already see several other opportunities coming forward. just expanding a little bit further on that technology, david, we still are making great progress.
i gave a snapshot when we last chatted about progress we're making in the brown boxes. again, that's a different technology and we continue to run trials there. and so, we are -- we're very excited about making progress in the brown market, as well as this top-end white market. and then that last aspect of packaging that we're doing is standard pcc on this white top market as we've grown in selma, alabama as we've grown in europe as well.
we're getting a couple of other opportunities for that as well. so, quite a bit of activity in the packaging space. hopefully, that helps.
david silver -- c.l. king and associates -- analyst
yeah, that's terrific color. thank you very much.
doug dietrich -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks, david.
operator
we'll take our next question from marisa hernandez with sidoti and company.
marisa hernandez -- sidoti and company -- analyst
hi. thank you for taking my questions. most of the questions i have -- have been asked, but i have a couple of housekeeping questions and another more general one. so, on the normerica results, can you share with us what was the contribution of normerica to revenues in the fourth quarter?
matt garth -- chief financial officer
yeah, it was $28 million.
marisa hernandez -- sidoti and company -- analyst
thank you, matt. ok. great. and then regarding the expansion of margins in the first quarter, you had previously said that you expect it to be back to margin levels on a product basis, on a dollar basis, meaning not on a percentage basis in the first quarter of '22.
is that still the expectation?
doug dietrich -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. so, what we said is that we were going to get, on a dollar basis, caught up with the inflationary costs that we have been experiencing over the past couple of quarters. and obviously, in the fourth quarter, inflation continued to rise at a rate that was higher than we expected, but we also showed you that pricing that we put into place captured about 80% of what we saw in the fourth quarter, that's going to carry through into the first quarter plus the items that we told you about in the segments where we were getting january 1st pricing taking place. so, we'll actually come net dollar ahead at the end of the first quarter for the first quarter.
and overall, we're continuing to drive margin with those price increases against that inflation. if you look through the full-year from a margin perspective, we're going to come through the first half of the year, you're going to see that year-over-year inflationary impact in the financials, first quarter, second quarter because remember in 2021, inflation wasn't really as a significant factor in the first half, really a third -- second-half component. and as we get into the second half with the pricing that we have in place, the additional actions we're taking, getting through some of the logistics and labor challenges, you're going to see that margin continue to expand significantly into the second half toward our target levels.
marisa hernandez -- sidoti and company -- analyst
ok. so, obviously, with all the inflation that we are having, it's a lot more difficult to get to prior margin levels on a shared basis. what is the expectation regarding that? can we get to pre-pandemic, call it, 14-plus percent operating margins in the foreseeable future?
doug dietrich -- chairman and chief executive officer
so, let me try and grab it this way. we have pricing actions in place given the inflation we've experienced and expect to experience this year that will get us back to those levels or close to those levels. we also believe that our product line growth will be accretive to those margins so that by the end of this year, we could hit our target level.
marisa hernandez -- sidoti and company -- analyst
now, what is that target level?
doug dietrich -- chairman and chief executive officer
we expect -- that's around that 14.5%, 15% range. so, as we sit today, we've got stuff -- we've got a projection that sees our growth in our higher-margin businesses and pricing in place. now let's say we're going to have to keep that spread. we're going to have to -- and what matt was saying is pricing in place will catch us up with what was delayed in cost price through the first half and that margin expansion will occur toward the second half.
now, that's laid out on paper. we got to stay ahead of that inflation. we expect we're going to see more inflation. we're going to have to be nimble.
we're going to have to get it off the docks, we're going to have to do a whole bunch of stuff like we did last year to deliver that. but we see we have actions in place, and we do see that through dialogue, we're able to keep that kind of pricing pace to be able to hit those kind of targets. now, we're going into very -- into a very volatile still year, and it could even be more volatile in the beginning of this year than last. and so, we're just going to have to stay on top of it.
but the mechanisms in the company and the foresight we have and some of the costs we've already locked in, we've already locked in many of these things through the year where we were shorter last year, set us up to be able to keep that spread on price cost to get ourselves back to those market.
marisa hernandez -- sidoti and company -- analyst
well, thank you so much for the color. i appreciate it.
doug dietrich -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. hopefully, that helps.
marisa hernandez -- sidoti and company -- analyst

operator
good day, everyone, and welcome to the first quarter 2022 minerals technologies earnings call. today's call is being recorded. at this time, i'd like to turn the conference over to erik aldag, head of investor relations for minerals technologies. please go ahead, mr.
aldag.
erik aldag -- head of investor relations for minerals technologies
thanks, jennifer. good morning, everyone, and welcome to our first quarter 2022 earnings conference call. today's call will be led by chairman and chief executive officer, doug dietrich; and chief financial officer, matt garth. following doug and matt's prepared remarks, we'll open it up to questions.
i'd like to remind you that beginning on page 15 of our 2021 10-k, we list the various risk factors and conditions that may affect our future results. and i'll also point out the safe harbor disclaimer on this slide. statements related to future performance by members of our team are subject to these limitations, cautionary remarks, and conditions. now i'll turn the call over to doug.
doug? 
doug dietrich -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks, erik. good morning, everyone. welcome to today's call. i'll start by walking you through our results for the first quarter and provide an overview of market dynamics, as well as some strategic highlights.
i'll also provide some context to put our first quarter results into perspective and explain what's driving our strong performance. matt will then review our financial results in more detail, and we'll also share our second quarter outlook. first quarter was a record financial performance for mti, and these results reflect the team's successful execution on a number of fronts. sales of $519 million were up 15% versus the prior year and up 19% on a constant-currency basis.
from a market perspective, demand remains robust across our segments, our consumer-oriented products, which make up approximately 30% of our sales, continue to benefit from favorable secular market trends. we've seen steady growth across pet care, personal care, edible oil purification, food and pharma applications. we also continue to see strong demand from our industrial product lines with robust sales to the foundry steel and construction customers. our results this quarter are also a function of our strategic growth initiatives, driven by multiyear advancements in new product development and geographic penetration, as well as additional growth from acquisitions.
and i'll take you through this in more detail in a few moments. operating income of $68 million was 15% higher than last year and a record for our first quarter. and earnings per share of $1.36 was a record for any quarter. performance is also driven by the agility of our team, delivering solid execution across operations, pricing actions, and cost control.
the historic pace of inflationary cost increases continued in the first quarter, including significant spikes in energy costs across the world and europe, in particular. despite the continued rapid inflation, our pricing actions more than offset the higher costs on a dollar basis in the first quarter. we're the price leader in most of our end markets, and our ability to pass through pricing is based on the significant value our products provide our customers every day. in addition, our supply chain team has been incredibly proactive in managing and mitigating our cost increases through this inflationary period.
we expect margins to expand further over the coming quarters as additional pricing actions, as well as contractual pricing mechanisms, take effect in the second and third quarters. as always, we remain disciplined around cost control and operational efficiency. our operational excellence culture drives countless incremental improvements every day from employee suggestions and structured problem-solving events. these improvements increase our productivity, reduce our operational costs, remove wasteful activities in general at a period when these efficiencies are critical to meet these levels of demand.
all in all, it was a very strong quarter, and this performance is a result of the actions we've taken to position the company for this type of profitable growth. our strategy is to grow the company through new product development, growing in underpenetrated regions, and also through acquisitions of mineral-based companies with technological differentiation. these three elements of our strategy have been aimed at repositioning our portfolio of businesses to generate higher and more sustainable growth rates. specifically, this repositioning has involved the expansion of our consumer-oriented business portfolio to create more balance with the industrial side of the company.
our household and personal care product line, which includes many of these consumer-oriented businesses, grew 30% in the first quarter versus the prior year. and over the last five years, this product line has grown at a 14% compound annual growth rate. this has been driven by both organic and inorganic investments, including the acquisitions of sivomatic in 2018 and normerica in 2021, and sustained market-driven growth across these product lines. this consumer-oriented set of businesses have structurally higher and more stable growth fundamentals.
and combined with our leading industrial positions, create a more stable top-line growth profile for the company. new product development is truly accelerating across the portfolio, and it's becoming a much more significant lever of growth. let me give you some examples of how innovation is driving new product sales and also enabling expansion into new and growing markets. for the past five years, we've commercialized new products twice as fast as we used to.
in the first quarter alone, sales from new products increased 25% on an annualized basis over last year. and many of these new products are advancing sustainability initiatives in partnership with our customers. in pet care, we're advancing eco-friendly packaging and increased recyclability. we've commercialized multiple online-only products to support our e-commerce growth strategy and are also developing new product offerings in asia, where pet care sales grew 36% in the first quarter versus last year.
sales of our bleaching earth products are up 32% in the first quarter. these products enable customers to achieve higher purity edible oils, and we're expanding our reach by demonstrating the significant advantage our product has in the high-growth biodiesel filtration applications sales of our personal care products grew 15% over last year as our health and beauty solutions business has expanded capability in the manufacturing of retinal delivery technologies and the private label packaging of skin care formulations. we also continue to see high growth rates and new opportunities for our clay-based rheology modifiers for cosmetic applications. we're also seeing increased interest in our fluoro-sorb solution for pfas remediation, including the use of fluoro-sorb as a highly effective media in the treatment of industrial and drinking water.
we continue to develop and expand this product line with the introduction of our patented fluoro-sorbflex, which targets short-chain pfas compounds in a unique and innovative way. our product development efforts are also contributing to growth in our industrial product lines. let me give you some examples. our latest specialty drilling products are performing well in a number of horizontal directional drilling applications to the installation of underground utility and broadband fiber-optic cables.
our new geothermal ground products are well-positioned to take advantage of the trend toward net-zero emission buildings. the use of geothermal heating systems is a growing area as building designers look to partially or fully replace fossil fuel heating systems. in this application, our product not only assists in the drilling process, but also enables more efficient heat conduction from the earth to the recirculating fluid in the heat loop. in building materials, our ventegra product, our new ventegra product is a dual-purpose waterproofing and vapor barrier offering.
this product offers our customers a one-step dual-purpose cost-effective application in the below-grade waterproofing market. our growth is also supported by the expansion of our core product lines and growing in underpenetrated regions. global green sand bond sales have grown at a 5% compound annual growth rate over the past five years. our high-performance pre-blended formulations and technical service capabilities help foundry customers improve their efficiency while reducing defects, costs, and emissions.
for years, we work collaboratively with our customers to bring them innovative formulations to improve their foundry systems. this type of collaboration is also supporting the penetration of our engineered solutions in the asia foundry market, where sales have been growing at a 10% annual rate for the last five years. as we speak about it often, our pcc business has been growing in the underpenetrated asia region for the last several years. we secured three new satellites there in the last year, including our first deployment of gcc technology for use in coated white board packaging.
lastly, our refractories segment is realizing strong growth driven by our complementary portfolio of innovative products, unparalleled steel mill services, and high-tech laser measurement equipment. it's this combination that's enabled us to grow with our customers in the newest steel installations in the u.s. our growth has also been supported through acquisitions. and today, i'd like to announce that we closed on another acquisition of a small bolt-on pet care company called concept pet.
this acquisition comes with a complementary operational footprint to support the expansion of our european pet care business, as well as additional mineral reserves. the bolt-on of this company will add approximately $20 million in incremental sales on an annualized basis through their customer positions in western and central europe. we welcome our newest employees from concept pet to mti, and we look forward to working with them to grow our european pet care business. m&a is an important part of our strategy, and we've completed four acquisitions over the past four years, totaling nearly $300 million in sales, all while prudently maintaining a strong balance sheet and solid liquidity position.
let me summarize my comments for today. we're executing on all facets of our strategy to build a higher growth, higher profit, higher return company. mti has a winning combination of unique mineral reserves, world-class operating capabilities, leading technology platforms, and applications expertise, all of which results in leading positions across our end markets. supported by our team of 4,000 dedicated and engaged employees around the world, we see a strong future for the company.
what it all means for us in 2022 is that we're on track to deliver another record year. with that, i'll hand it over to matt to discuss the financial results and our outlook for the second quarter. matt?
matt garth -- chief financial officer
thanks, doug. i'll review our first quarter results, the performance of our segments, as well as our outlook for the second quarter. following my remarks, i'll turn the call over for questions. now let's review first quarter results.
first quarter sales were $519 million, reflecting strong sales growth, both year over year and sequentially. year-over-year sales bridge on the left of the slide shows that sales grew by 15% compared to the prior year and by 19% when excluding the impact of foreign exchange. sales were higher by double digits across all segments, with organic growth contributing 4%, the america acquisition delivering 6%, and selling price actions yielding 9%. operating income, excluding special items, was $67.8 million in the first quarter and the year-over-year operating income bridge on the lower left of the slide shows that operating income grew by 15% compared to the prior year.
as we expected, our selling price actions surpassed the impact from inflation in the first quarter despite increasing energy costs, particularly in europe. in total, we delivered $41.5 million of selling price increases compared with $39.1 million of inflationary costs. in addition, continued strength in our refractories segment, further demand recovery in several of our project-oriented businesses, and lower corporate costs helped to offset the slow start to the quarter, stemming from covid and weather impacts in the united states. the operating margin in the first quarter was 13.1% of sales, which is an increase of 10 basis points compared to the prior year despite the dilutive effect related to inflation pass-through.
now moving to the right side of the slide. the sequential sales bridge shows that sales increased by 9% compared to the fourth quarter and were 10% higher on a constant-currency basis. sequential operating income bridge shows that inflation continued to accelerate into the first quarter. however, pricing actions delivered nearly $26 million to more than offset inflationary costs.
note that these results include roughly $2 million and additional inflationary costs that will be passed through contractually beginning at the end of the second quarter. operating margin improved by 160 basis points compared to the fourth quarter, which was driven by actions on selling price to more than offset inflation and continue to expand margins. and finally, we continue to control overhead expenses with sg&a as a percentage of sales at 10.4%, 130 basis points below the prior year. now let's review the segments in more detail, beginning with performance materials.
first quarter sales for performance materials were $272 million, an 18% increase over the prior year and 6% higher sequentially. sales in household, personal care, and specialty products were 30% higher than the prior year and 13% higher sequentially, driven by continued strong demand for consumer-oriented products and the normerica acquisition. our global pet care business overcame many of the logistics challenges it faced in the fourth quarter to deliver 10% sequential sales growth. meanwhile, our edible oil purification and personal care businesses continued their robust growth trend.
metalcasting sales were 2% lower year over year and 5% lower sequentially due to lower china sales related to the chinese new year and winter olympics and the timing of large shipments in north america. note that the latest china covid situation began in earnest in the second quarter, and we are seeing a slow recovery in sales in the region. environmental products grew 38% year over year, driven by increased project activity, while building materials sales were 2% lower versus last year, largely due to wet weather conditions in north america that affected building starts. operating income for the segment was $34.7 million and operating margin was 12.8% of sales.
operating margin improved sequentially as additional pricing actions overcame the impact of inflation. now looking ahead to the second quarter. we expect continued strong demand for our consumer-oriented products, and we will be moving into a seasonally higher period for our project-oriented businesses. metalcasting sales in north america will improve based on strong demand and china sales will continue to be slow during the current covid situation.
in addition, we expect that the benefit from our selling price actions will continue to more than offset inflation. and as a result, we see operating margin improvement and a sequential increase in operating income of approximately 10% to 15%. and now let's move to specialty minerals. specialty minerals sales were $163 million in the first quarter, 10% higher than the prior year and 15% higher sequentially.
first quarter global pcc and processed minerals sales grew by 10% and 11% year over year, respectively. operating income for the segment improved sequentially to $18.4 million as we implemented significant pricing adjustments in the first quarter. as you'll recall, this has been the segment most significantly impacted by energy inflation, particularly in europe. and in this quarter, smi absorbed $2 million of additional energy costs that will be contractually passed through beginning at the end of the second quarter.
as we look ahead to the second quarter, we expect a modest seasonal increase in sales, selling price actions that offset inflation, and an improvement in margins that together will increase operating income by approximately 10% to 15%. now let's turn to refractories. first quarter sales for refractories were $84 million and were 14% higher than the prior year, driven by favorable mix from new customer wins and selling price adjustments implemented to cover inflationary cost increases. refractories segment delivered another strong operating performance as selling price actions and operational efficiencies more than offset inflationary impacts.
first quarter operating income for the segment was $16.5 million, an increase of 38% compared to the prior year, and operating margin was 19.7% of sales. as we look to the second quarter, we are seeing some energy and raw material inflation. however, we expect a similar level of operating income sequentially. now let's turn to our cash flow and liquidity highlights.
first quarter cash from operations was significantly lower than the prior year due to an increase in working capital related to inflationary pricing and accounts receivable and a temporary strategic inventory build ahead of the winter olympics. despite the $72 million increase in overall working capital, our efficiency is measured by days working capital improved by three days year over year. note that as the strategic inventory positions release, we expect cash flow to strengthen and another year of strong free cash flow around $150 million. first quarter capital expenditures were $19 million, and we repurchased $16.7 million of shares in the first quarter, bringing the program to date total to $28.5 million.
at the end of the first quarter, total liquidity was approximately $480 million, and our net leverage ratio was 2.2 times ebitda. we the continue to maintain a strong balance sheet, providing ourselves with the flexibility to continue to invest in high-value, high-return growth opportunities, both organically and through m&a. now let me summarize our outlook for the second quarter. overall, we see continued strong demand across our end markets and another quarter of strong sales growth.
we anticipate that the inflationary environment will persist, and our teams are working closely with suppliers and customers on pricing actions to drive margin expansion. in addition, we expect to see productivity improve sequentially as volumes increase, and we will continue to take a disciplined approach to controlling expenses. in summary, the second quarter is typically our strongest quarter of the year, and we expect another record quarterly performance with operating income increasing by 8% to 10% sequentially, which represents around 15% growth versus last year. second quarter earnings per share are anticipated to be around $1.45.
while there are some uncertainties in the macroeconomic environment, our outlook for the remainder of the year reflects generally stable market conditions, sales growth from acquisitions, and further margin expansion that together will generate full year earnings per share around the range of $5.60 to $5.70. with that, we'll now take your questions.

operator
thank you. [operator instructions] and our first question today comes from daniel moore with cjs securities.
daniel moore -- cjs securities -- analyst
thank you. good morning. matt, doug. maybe start with concept pet's intrigue there.
maybe talk about where the reserves are. i know it's small, but what kind of synergies and our growth potential you expect? and more importantly, are there similar sized -- are there multiple or other similar sized tuck-in opportunities out there?
doug dietrich -- chairman and chief executive officer
sure. thanks, dan. yeah, we're really excited about concept pet. it's a small bolt-on to continue the growth of our european pet care business, which is the brand of sivomatic.
it's complementary in terms of it's western europe, but also brings in some customers in the central european zone. so the reserves are in slovakia with operations there as well. and so it gives us kind of logistically and positionally throughout europe -- geographically through europe, a nice footprint. those reserves help support that business, but they can also be used for other purposes as well.
so there's not going to be a lot of cost synergies here given its size. it's really going to be more around being able to serve european pet care customers better, more fully, and also grow with them more completely. so we're really excited about it. we welcome the 50 new employees to mti.
daniel moore -- cjs securities -- analyst
got it. really helpful. matt, you gave some good detail, particularly within the segments around pricing actions as it relates to this quarter and the guide. when we think about the q2 guide, how much catch up in terms of pricing do we still have to go that could drive margins further still into q3 and beyond? or will we be closer to caught up by the end of q2? thanks.
matt garth -- chief financial officer
yeah. the way i stack it up, dan, is a tally beginning in sort of the june time frame last year when inflation really started to pick up. if you track it from that point, we've absorbed about $94 million, $95 million in inflationary costs, and you've seen that on our bridges that we've reported to you over the past couple of quarters. offsetting that has been now about $77 million in pricing.
so there is still some catch-up, but you're seeing the gap improve. caveat being there, we're still seeing some inflation, particularly in energy, and that is moving quite spiky in europe. and so you're seeing that, like we told you about in smi, about $2 million we absorbed this quarter that will pass through contractually in -- beginning late in the second quarter or early third quarter. and so we'll continue to have that dynamic, but we certainly believe you saw us claw back about $2 million to $3 million of that inflationary gap.
we'll expand on that in the second quarter. and as we've given you an outlook for the full year, that's going to mean further margin progression and capturing that gap and then improving on it as we move into the back half of the year. believe you saw us claw back about $2 million to $3 million of that inflationary gap. we'll expand on that in the second quarter.
and as we've given you an outlook for the full year, that's going to mean further margin progression and capturing that gap and then improving on it as we move into the back half of the year.
daniel moore -- cjs securities -- analyst
really helpful. and then china, you have a pretty solid outlook for q2 despite that. what type of impact do we expect on metalcasting? or maybe i shouldn't say milcasting, it's overall in china based on where we sit today in q2?
doug dietrich -- chairman and chief executive officer
right now -- so dan, it's doug. right now, yeah, china was a drag through the first quarter in metalcasting volumes. we see those rebounding through the second quarter. i think as we sit in april, it's still -- it's moving along sideways.
it hasn't ramped up yet. but we see our outlook at least through june and into july as being much more positive. the demand there from both automotive and nonautomotive production still remains strong. we do have some backlogs.
we've been working to get those backlogs through our plants, given some of the transportation restrictions. and so we're moving through it, but it has been a little bit slow, but our outlook for the region through the second quarter and further out is pretty positive.
daniel moore -- cjs securities -- analyst
perfect. thank you. i've got one or two others, but i'll follow up and jump back in queue. thank you.
doug dietrich -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah, i didn't answer your bolt-on question, dan. so if you want to do that later, i can answer it now. in terms of pet care --
daniel moore -- cjs securities -- analyst
yeah, curious about the opportunity set, that would be great.
doug dietrich -- chairman and chief executive officer
sure, sure. so i didn't answer that earlier. yes, there are other opportunities, i would say, though, in the pet care business, through sivomatic, normerica, and now concept pet, we've put together a really nice portfolio of positions, mine resources, manufacturing locations, next to population densities to be able to really effectively serve those pet litter customers. so right now, our goal is, obviously, continue through the integration of normerica, making sure we finalize that now concept that in europe and then really utilize this base to grow that business.
further out, i think, there are in other geographies, some other positions that may make sense. but i think right now, we've really built a nice global base of operations and mine assets to really grow this business. so we're excited about it. we put it together.
when we started this business, when we bought amcal, the business was about $70 million. the business is now about $385 million in revenue. so that gives you a size, and it's growing at about kind of 8% to 10% per year. so that gives you an idea of what we think this is capable of and bolting on concept pet is going to be a real help to continue that growth.
daniel moore -- cjs securities -- analyst
perfect. thank you.
operator
and our next question comes from mike harrison with seaport research partners.
mike harrison -- seaport research partners -- analyst
hi. good morning. congratulations on a nice start to the year.
doug dietrich -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks, mike.
mike harrison -- seaport research partners -- analyst
i had a couple of questions here on the refractories business. first of all, you mentioned some additional raw material costs. are you having any problems with cost or availability of magnesium oxide? and can you also comment on whether the russia-ukraine war maybe leading to some weakness in russian steel and creating some opportunities for your refractories business where you participate outside of russia?
doug dietrich -- chairman and chief executive officer
so, yeah, let me start with that, and then i'll pass it to brett argirakis, who's leading that business. no, we're not seeing any issues around supply and the supply chain. i will say that part of the matt's comments around our strategic inventory build was making sure that we secured and put on docs from -- part of that was china and getting some reserves in our raw materials out of the country ahead of time. so we utilized some really good opportunities to purchase and some timing to build those inventories, and that's part of that inventory build that will release throughout the year.
so no, we really did a good job around the supply chain issues. and as far as russia-ukraine, this was the business that had some business in russia and ukraine is about $5 million. so it was negatively impacted actually as we ceased those sales into the region, probably around $1 million in the first quarter. so it was actually a detractor from the results.
but really, i think, the results that you're seeing right now are just a solid execution, really smart cost control, good procurement, and what we're talking about the delivery of these technologies in a package form. these newer formulations wrapped around laser measurement and application technologies that are leading to positions and just delivering higher value to the customers. so anyway, sorry, brett, if i took a little away from you, but too exciting to hold back. so why don't you give us some more color, particularly in the u.s.
around what you're delivering in terms of new sales from this?
brett argirakis -- senior vice president, managing director
yeah. thanks, doug. mike, just to add a little bit more color. so as far as russia, as doug pointed out, our overall sales maybe $5 million between russia and ukraine.
so it's not a big part of our business. but where we may see some indirect support would be the ukrainian steel production. some of that is moving to turkey, where we have a very good business. so we may see some -- from added steel production, some more demand on our refractory products.
so we're hopeful that, that helps us out. overall, when you look at russian steel, they produce about 75 million tons of steel, the united states is about 85%. so they do have a very good market. but as i said, we're not very deeply penetrated in that market, mainly refractory and some laser.
but going back to what doug said, our business really has been focused on our growth, new business initiatives. and our outlook looks pretty strong. the business is healthy. we have eight new contracts, we're starting up in 2022, and they'll all utilize either refractory wire and laser technology or a combination.
so we're really excited about that. the laser business, the ferrotron laser business is doing very well now. we have a strong order book. and as covid loosened up, we're able to commission those lasers, and also the new refractory formulations continue to show very positive results, and that also is starting to grow and allow us to penetrate the markets globally.
and lastly, really, we've signed over -- now we're up to about $120 million of new sales over the next five years. and that puts us in a really good position to continue to grow and keep our margins strong. i hope that answers your question.
mike harrison -- seaport research partners -- analyst
yeah, no. i appreciate all the additional color there. maybe shifting over to the household pet care and specialty business. the revenue number, i think, was a record there in that low $140 million range.
i know that there's some seasonality to that business. but with the pricing efforts, you had in place with the growth initiatives and, obviously, we need to bake in the content pet acquisition as well. is this kind of a good revenue run rate for the rest of the year going forward? or should we think that q1 maybe mark some inventory restocking after you had some of the issues in q4 with supply chain?
doug dietrich -- chairman and chief executive officer
no, i think it's -- i don't think there's anything significant in the first quarter. interestingly, you're right. the lower seasons in some of our businesses are the colder months and the lower seasons in the pet care business are in the warmer months as cats are more outdoors. but i don't think that's material.
i think what you're seeing with the concept pet acquisition is you're going to see this continued run rate of growth. as i mentioned in my comments, this segment has grown 14% compound over the past five years. and so we see that continuing. the pet care business alone has grown, i think, around 8% compound in that segment.
so i think it's a good run rate for you, mike. i think with these new positions and some of the new products and with some of our e-commerce strategy taking off, especially that growth in asia is starting to become forming. i think this is a good sustainable growth rate frame.
mike harrison -- seaport research partners -- analyst
all right. and then i wanted to make sure to hit a couple of questions here on the project-driven businesses. can you give us a little more color on the strength that you're seeing in environmental products? and how sustainable that could be into the rest of the year? and then in building materials, you noted some delays related to supply chain issues, and we're hearing this about raw material availability. have those issues run their course? or do you still see that some customers are going to be struggling to get the materials they need as we get into the busier building season?
doug dietrich -- chairman and chief executive officer
i don't think we've seen any real supply chain disruptions. the business has been doing well from the manufacturing and the operations side. i want to let -- jon hastings, why don't you give us a little color on environmental building?
jon hastings -- senior vice president, corporate development
sure. mike, hi, good morning. a couple of things. you keyed into it.
our pipeline has strengthened significantly. as you know, the markets have opened up. projects are progressing through funding. we're seeing this in most of our sectors.
we see it in the municipal landfills, coal ash pond projects that are supporting the coal-fired power plants. we're seeing waterproofing projects, infrastructure projects, all expanding. so the outlook has grown considerably stronger as we moved from '21 into '22. give you a couple of highlights by region, for example, in north america, we did see the demand pick up in q1 just as we expected, and now we're fully booked through q2 and beyond.
we even saw within building materials, we had a little bit of a blip in the pacific northwest with the teamsters strike that affected some project starts. but our order book has continued to be strong, and we're working through that, and that seems to have been resolved. in europe, our second biggest market, bidding activity continues very strong. southern europe.
they're executing awards and construction of large-scale projects at a much higher clip than what they've done in the past two, three years. so we suspect that some of this is also some pent-up demand, but it also is just an expansion of both building materials and also environmental products. internally, what we're focused on is strategically introducing our innovative new technologies. we're focused on sales of our high-value, high-margin specialty products.
and as you would expect from us, we continue to ensure efficient and cost-effective operations to effectively serve all of our markets. so yes, there are some -- there's a little bit of volatility on logistics and raw materials periodically, but we're really well-positioned to continue to offset that with pricing and instituting the best practices, business practice that we put in place, our order bulk remains full, and we're executing on all cylinders. so i hope that helps, mike.
mike harrison -- seaport research partners -- analyst
very helpful. thanks. last question for me is on the guidance. it kind of looks as if you're expecting the second half to be maybe just slightly better than the first half.
i think a lot of us have been watching the price cost dynamics and assuming that what would be a headwind in the first half should actually turn into some additional margin tailwind in the second half. so i guess maybe just help us understand if you're trying to be conservative with that $560 million to $570 million or if there are some other, i guess, components of margin headwind that we need to keep in mind?
matt garth -- chief financial officer
i think a few things to note, mike. recall that's the first time we've given annual guidance in quite a bit of time. and as we've given you now second quarter and the full year, you are seeing the benefit of a few things like we detailed, improvement in our end markets like it was just detailed by jon. you heard that from brett, and we've talked about it, demonstrating some of that.
being able to price, doug talked to you about the pricing construct that we have, we've been able to change our contracts, we'd be able to work with our customers. we price on the value that we contribute. so that speaks to the margin potential that we have in pricing beyond just recovering inflationary factors. and so yes, you'll continue to see that as we move through the year.
if you remember last quarter, doug talked about a flight path in our margin as we move through the year. and that's what we are looking at. and that flight path moves toward that 14% level as you move into the later months in the year. and that's coming from continued volume growth based on stable market conditions, expanding those margins, getting pricing into place that value -- that we believe appropriately values our products, our technologies, and our partnership with our customers and pulling that all together to deliver what we think is a strong year.
and in that $560 million to $570 million range, around that range, that gives you a sense of some confidence as you look into the second half of the year, around those factors being able to control what we can in the face of some uncertain market conditions that are going to be, obviously, making some headlines, whether that's an economic factor or specific markets that you may see providing some level of contract that we need to manage through, but overall, looking at a very good year in total and progression through the year.
doug dietrich -- chairman and chief executive officer
sorry, michael -- also you may have mentioned it, but we still have some room to go on the integration of these acquisitions. so in the back half of the year, we're not done with the integration, and there's still some systems integration going with our normerica acquisition and still some margin expansion there and also concept pet. so yes, there are some things in the back half of the year that we think [audio gap] markets and the delivery of revenue from acquisitions that are going to strengthen things for us. so -- but i think, as matt said, being able to go out that far-right now is projecting the confidence that we have in this business and being able to deliver it.
mike harrison -- seaport research partners -- analyst
sounds good. thank you.
operator
[operator instructions] and we'll hear next from silke kueck with j.p. morgan.
silke kueck -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
good morning. in your earnings guidance for the second quarter and for the full year, what pricing is embedded in that outlook? so your prices were 9% higher in the first quarter. like what do you think -- year over year, what do you think it might be in the second quarter? and what do you -- what's baking to your guidance for the full year?
matt garth -- chief financial officer
yeah. i think if you remember, the way that we detailed our full year outlook last quarter was that we were going to experience about 15% top-line growth. that was going to be 5% through organic, 5% through the normerica acquisition and 5% through pricing. again, what you saw this quarter was about 4% organic, and that's volume and mix despite what we've alluded to was a challenging january and february.
so a very good organic growth component. that 5% looks good as we move through the year. normerica, contributing about 5% to 6%. acquisitions, as doug said, that will trickle through the rest of the year with concept pet.
so still seeing about that 5% top-line growth. pricing, to your point, came in stronger than what we had anticipated. and there's a few factors surrounding that. one, you're continuing to see inflation, and we are continuing to drive pricing as inflation moves.
so that speaks to our value proposition with our customers, the partnership we have, and being able to recover that pricing and then furthermore, recovering our margin, which was embedded in that 5% as we came into the year. so as you're looking out at, silke, you'll continue to see a higher level of pricing as we go through the year just based on the higher level of inflationary factors that we had. but again, that 15% that we guided to feels good.
silke kueck -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
ok. so you think pricing should be something more like double digits going forward for the second quarter and fourth year?
doug dietrich -- chairman and chief executive officer
right. yeah, i think, we're in that -- not saying that 15% is we're still holding to that 5%, 5%, and 5%, right? so 5% organic volume growth, 5% from acquisitions, at least through the fourth quarter. we will lap that acquisition number as normerica kind of annualizes. and we think that given what we currently see with the inflation forward, we still have some pricing to pass through contractually that's going to come through in july, august through the third quarter.
and those are largely in our paper pcc contracts and some in refractory. so i think you're going to see through the third quarter at least, that 9% in the first quarter, you're probably going to see another 5% in the second and probably that 5% into the third in pricing. now it depends on where inflation goes. so we will keep that spread, and we will continue to expand margins to -- like matt said, to that 14% plus kind of run rate in the fourth quarter.
if inflation continues to go at this pace, we're going to continue to do this. i think when that plans over that pricing may come off a bit. but for now, we think at least through the third quarter, you're going to see that kind of 5% average number over prior year.
silke kueck -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
ok. and the -- in terms of your electricity and your energy costs, like it seems in paper you have contractual pass-through. do you have that -- given like the unusual spikes in europe, do you have that ability of pass-through in all of your businesses or you only have that in paper?
doug dietrich -- chairman and chief executive officer
in paper, it's contractual, it's actually literally written into that. and we do get -- we receive our utilities, in many cases, from our customers. so in paper, where our satellite facilities sit on site of a paper mill, we received those utilities. they pass on a pricing increase and then we'll pass that through contractually with a delay with other factors.
there's other -- other raw material input costs and other factors that go into a pricing formula, which has a delay to it. in most of our contracts in north america, that's pretty tight. i mean we've moved those to sometimes instantaneous one month, three months. but in europe, those -- there are some contracts that still -- legacy contracts that are out there six, nine months.
when you see times like this, in past times, we've seen inflationary costs of a couple of 100 thousand dollars, which will carry for six months and then pass through contractually. as matt mentioned, we saw $2 million worth of energy cost increases alone in these businesses, primarily in paper in europe, given what's going that we're going to carry. we'll carry through the first, we'll carry it through the second and then we'll pass it on the third. so the good thing about our contracts is they protect us.
the challenging piece of our contracts is there's a delay to them, and it's exacerbated in some of these really high inflationary periods. however, the products -- our products are priced -- outside of paper, our products are priced on value. we're able to make sure that we get the value that they provide. and so yes, we are working with our customers very transparently around some of these increases, not just energy.
and they understand it. they are, in many cases, in the same position with their customers. so it's always a challenging conversation, but it's not one that's not understood because of the value of our products we provide to our customers. hopefully, that helps.
a little long-winded.
silke kueck -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
ok. thank you for that. and if i can ask like one or two more. regarding the normerica acquisition, my memory is that it was a $140 million business when you acquired it, something like $35 million in sales per quarter.
and maybe there's like some seasonality, but did the normerica business in volume terms grow this quarter or it contracted? i thought the acquisition benefit was unusually low.
doug dietrich -- chairman and chief executive officer
no, they're about at that pace. they're at that pace, silke. so they have not contracted. we're running at that rate.
we -- i was just looking to jon, we have some new business opportunities that are taking hold that we're putting in place. so i think what you will see is some growth in revenue in the normerican business. again, it's going to be in that pet care business. and so i probably won't call out exactly how much is normerica or legacy business or europe.
but i think all of that in the new business and the acquisitions are going to contribute to that continued kind of 8% to 10% growth rate in that business. so -- but for the quarter, i think, they were relatively flat with the fourth.
jon hastings -- senior vice president, corporate development
yeah. and just to add on from a transaction perspective, the integration continues on pace. as doug said, we have some systems integration that are going to take -- that is going to take place later in the year. so we'll continue to put effort there.
but overall, normerica remains very much on track.
silke kueck -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
ok. and i guess there's a question i wanted to ask about your exposure to the asian markets and some of the co-related shutdowns in china. where does that touch you most, in which businesses? and what do you sort of like -- what do you expect for the second quarter?
doug dietrich -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. i think it's most impacting our foundry business, our metalcasting business. jon, why don't you tell us where we are with customers and our facilities there?
jon hastings -- senior vice president, corporate development
yeah. so, like doug said, it mainly affects our metalcasting business, greensand bonds. and what we've seen just in the past couple of weeks and months is that there has been an increase in -- a difficulty in the ability to actually ship out of our plants. however, that's been resolved through a lot of hard work working with the government, working with trucking, etc.
and so we built up a little bit of backlog with our customers. we have now been supplying. we've worked off that backlog. and going forward, again, it's volatile.
we're going to continue watching this. but so far, there haven't been any real significant disruptions, and we'll continue to generate the volumes for our customers that are needed. so again, no real significant impact so far.
matt garth -- chief financial officer
right. and in the guidance we gave you as you go through it, you'll see what we basically said is that china covid situation is going to continue. sales are pretty slow in china metalcasting and that looks like it's going to continue into the second quarter predicated on what's going on with the code condition there. so guidance has embedded that viewpoint.
and so we'll work from there. but as jon outlined, very good performance from the team, working with customers and moving forward.
doug dietrich -- chairman and chief executive officer
exactly. so i just want to jump in here. we have 500 employees in china. and we have two offices, one in shanghai and one in beijing.
and those -- those teams are at home, and they're continuing to work. they're doing a fantastic job. so a quick call out to them for all they're doing, maintaining that business. and as jon said, they're working really closely with customers, and those volumes are getting shipped.
we're keeping them running. so anyway, i want to put that out [inaudible]
silke kueck -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
that's helpful. and i have a very last question on -- just on cash flows. i was wondering what your capex target is for the year. and what's your share repurchase target for the year?
matt garth -- chief financial officer
thank you, silke. so cash flow, as i said, free cash flow, we're expecting to generate about $150 million. so another strong year of free cash flow. i think we talked through the dynamic of how working capital was going to release as we move through the year, particularly those strategic inventory positions.
capex embedded in that assumption is about $80 million to $90 million. if you remember, last year, we did about $85 million coming into this year. we said we'd have a similar experience, really good opportunities for investment inside the company. we're going to take care of those and also sustaining capex continuing to be in that $40 million range.
as you look at our use of cash, yes, you're right, we are currently operating under a $75 million repurchase authorization. we anticipate that we'll complete that by october. so purchases will continue there. the other opportunities for our free cash flow, we've talked to you about our balanced approach using some of that cash, we just acquired concept pet with cash on hand.
we will continue to also look at opportunities to pay down debt, and you'll see that as we move through the year with free cash flow as it's generated. so really using that cash flow on all 3 pegs of the stool, delivering to shareholders, finding opportunities to deploy it to growth, and then also maintaining a very strong balance sheet.
silke kueck -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
ok. thanks very much.
doug dietrich -- chairman and chief executive officer

and our next question comes from david silver with c.l. king.
david silver -- c.l. king and associates -- analyst
yeah. hi. good morning. i think the first question -- the first topic i'd like to ask you about is the pcc business.
and i'll just apologize this is going to be one of my famous kitchen sink question styles. but i would like to focus maybe on the sequential growth in that area, both the paper and the specialty side. it was pretty striking compared to a typical 4q to 1q. and i'm just wondering if you could maybe break down that well into double digits growth that was there sequentially.
and in particular, were there a few start-ups? i think baiyun on my list is scheduled for first half of this year. there may have been a restart in the u.s. but what are the elements that led to that very strong sequential performance in your pcc business this quarter? and will that carry through the second quarter or sometimes i believe there's a seasonal dip there? so just the trend, the last quarter, next quarter kind of trend in that business would be helpful. thank you.
doug dietrich -- chairman and chief executive officer
sure. i think in general, david, it was really due to some seasonality, but also i think in the fourth quarter, i think, you're referring to about a 14% sequential growth rate in that business. so we did see some stronger performance. we are moving from a period in december, which was really challenging from both covid logistics around the world, and that december was a really tough one through into january.
but then i think as you see, as you get into the march time frame, a lot of different things start to kick in some construction, automotive builds have been higher, the paper -- some paper mills that have taken some outages and were down due to covid, have come back. and so i think what you're seeing in that sequential growth is a lot of just kind of factors that were in late in the fourth quarter that march is a totally different scenario in terms of where we are in the market. but i do think if you take that march and you look through the second quarter, that's the kind of pace that we're on going into this next one. so i think we saw some strong growth due to some things that in december.
but i think if you take the march performance and you take that up the second quarter, that's the construction, the automotive, the paper, the seasonal activity you're going to see, and i think you're going to continue to see some growth into the second. so that's at least the dynamic that's happening. d.j., do you want to give more specifics about what's behind it?
d.j. monagle -- chief operating officer
yeah. a couple of things, david. on the specialty side, we're really taking advantage of those expansions that we had put into place and the pull from the -- from both the automotive and the construction industry remains very strong, and the outlook is very strong. we've also been very effective in -- with pricing in that area.
so -- and we see that continuing, and that's part of what's built into matt's guidance. on the paper side, you're seeing north america remained extremely strong in terms of its run rate in the industry. and we've got some upside in china and india as covid settles down. and then as both matt and doug have talked about earlier, you're going to see the contractual price increases kick in toward that second half of the year.
and then finally, just to remind you on some of the expansions that you mentioned, you highlighted baiyun, that's correct. that will be coming in toward the end of that second quarter. then we have the india contract with spb that starts kicking in probably late in the third, sometime in the fourth and then the other gcc opportunity that we add will be in 2023. so the trajectory is good.
just based on the current builds. and i would give you just a little further insight, i'd say the pipeline is robust as well.
david silver -- c.l. king and associates -- analyst
and just to follow up briefly, d.j., but if i just take the simple revenue numbers for the first quarter, $121 million total for your paper pcc plus the specialty, so you're over $120 million. and if i go back in my records, i mean, it's been -- i think, 2015, 2016 was the last time we had that kind of revenue rate, and of course, some not inflation adjusting there. but maybe if you just had a moment, i mean, just reflect on kind of how you see the business situated now early 2022 and with the diversification into packaging grades relative to how the business looked five years ago. i'm thinking that there's just a lot more end market diversification and new applications relative to the last time the business was generating this type of revenue.
d.j. monagle -- chief operating officer
so thank you. so a couple of things. if we concentrate on that paper business, the team is doing a really good job of shifting that portfolio both to advanced products in the printing and writing grades that allow for more consumption per ton of paper that's made, but also into that packaging, and i'll refer to that pipeline, david. if i looked at that pipeline five years ago, maybe i would have had a packaging opportunity in there, probably not.
now if i look at a dozen active engagements with customers, probably 30% of those are packaging, some of them pcc, some of them like the gcc opportunity that we looked to earlier, and then some of them also non-pcc-related technologies. so those last two statements i made are two different platforms that help us position in that market. then the other one on the specialty pcc side, there's a couple of items of significance. the first one is these advanced products that we're making on rheology control, they continue to get good traction in strong markets.
we did make the small acquisition, but an important acquisition for us in north america with our assets in missouri. and then we've also been penetrating further in food and pharma applications of specialty pcc. so both -- from a pcc standpoint, both portfolios are well-positioned for the future. 
doug dietrich -- chairman and chief executive officer
and david, the only thing i'd add is, i guess, it's a good -- i appreciate you bringing the look back. it's a different business. it's not quite there yet. we've transformed it from 99% base copy paper into one that -- and we mentioned it, across the portfolio of companies, one that is a much more higher tech products, they're positioned in markets that are structurally growing and in geographies that are growing.
so i think it follows along the thesis of what we've been doing over the past years to create more stability and position the business into higher growth products and regions. and i think both in specialty and in paper pcc, that's what you're seeing. and as d.j. mentioned, throughout this year and into next, there's still -- there's some secured contracts that don't show up in the top line yet.
that will. so i think you'll see that continue.
david silver -- c.l. king and associates -- analyst
yes, no, thank you for that. i mean i considered the development of that business, just a very good microcosm, doug, of how you talk about a mineral base, but with a differentiation or a technological edge to it. so that's why i kind of brought it up. ok.
doug, i appreciate you mentioning the new product development earlier in your comments. i was wondering if you could just give us a quick update on fluoro-sorb in particular. and then you did mention rheology modifiers. i haven't heard you talk about that in a while.
i may have missed it. but i mean, to me, that's very, very high ground area within performance materials. just wondering, for you calling it out today, was there -- has there been some movement or some development in your business in that area that you consider noteworthy? thank you.
doug dietrich -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks, david. let me give you just some -- i guess, frame up the innovation kind of pipeline in the company. i mentioned a number of comments and number of stats. i think if you looked at the total value of the portfolio, upwards of $800 million worth of ideas through different stages in that portfolio.
and so if you think of like we've got a much bigger funnel of thinking, but that funnel is focused on some very specific areas, right? and i'll give you a couple of those threads. one of them is we've always been in rheology modification. i mean just about everything we do in specialty pcc and in some of our clay-based products are rheology modifiers. what is that? what it does is it imparts kind of -- i'm going to get out of my element here, even in engineering.
it imparts an ability for a formulation to flow or a physical property of flow. i'll give you an example in construction, automotive sealants, being able to have a robot put out a line of sealant and then have it set and not sag. so it has to come out really quickly, but it can't go anywhere from that, and you can't have a tail of a string once the gun is pulled away. so -- but what makes it do that is our specialty pcc.
and so being able to engineer the particle and engineer how it goes into that process, it helps that flow under that pressure, which is what rheology is. and so -- but we had that capability across the company, and we apply it with our different minerals. and some of these are in cosmetic applications, and we use clays to do the same things. and so it's been a part of the technology of the company for a long time.
we're finding opportunities in markets to be able to apply it more broadly. jon was just mentioning right now, it's in drilling. our drilling muds are basically rheology modification, being able to lubricate the drill as it goes through and then set up to hold the whole in place. so i think it's nothing new.
it's a base technology we have in the company. we're just being able to apply it with our growth in these other markets and many of them consumer more broadly. and so it's really nothing, it's a base technology. but sustainability is another thread in that innovation pipeline.
sixty percent of the products in our innovation pipeline are either something that helps us make a product more sustainable or helps our customers with a sustainability issue they face. and that's grown from almost 40% just a year ago, so one -- five years ago. sixty percent of the portfolio of $800 million of products is something to do with a sustainability initiative, right? we're generating about $270 million of revenue from new products on an annualized basis this year over products that we've commercialized the last five years, that's up from $210 million last year. so if you think of it, crank -- we're turning the crank a lot faster.
it's a lot more focused, and we have a lot more kind of focused projects that are in that funnel that are coming out to deliver these types of results. and we think that's going to continue to accelerate. as far as pfas, jon, do you want to give us an update on --
jon hastings -- senior vice president, corporate development
sure. sure. glad to. you mentioned fluoro-sorb and pfas.
again, we're getting a lot of attention from potential customers and strong performance is being [inaudible] in all of our pilot applications. we've got 90 successful demonstrations. just to give you a couple of concrete things, since last year's canadian dod in-situ project, we've got fluoro-sorb that's been impregnated into our reactive mats, and they've been installed at the u.s. dod side.
we've got mobile filtration systems that have been placed at two other sites. we've got one in north american landfill. that's in the in-situ space. in the drinking water space, we're pleased that in the next month or two, so in q2, we're going into two new municipal drinking water systems.
and as you know, other utilities and regulators are watching that really closely. the performance that we see with fluoro-sorb is substantially better than other competitive technologies. so we're pretty excited about having those drinking water systems, commercial, and installations coming up in the next couple of months. so looking at the road map going forward, as you know, epa continues to set the stage.
and we're poised to take advantage of the demand once it manifests itself in the marketplace. so a lot of excitement, a lot of trials, some commercial applications, and certainly poised to satisfy the demand once it comes from the regulatory environment.
david silver -- c.l. king and associates -- analyst
that's great. thank you very much. i really appreciate all the color.
jon hastings -- senior vice president, corporate development
thanks, david.
operator
and our next question comes from daniel moore with cjs securities.
daniel moore -- cjs securities -- analyst
thank you again. maybe one more. i'll ask you as quick as i can. but you're seeing, obviously, faster top-line growth now faster bottom-line growth leverage based on your implied '22 guide is comfortably below two times, and you're going to generate a lot of cash in the back half of the year.
so, i guess stock's still trading where it is in the 10, 11 times forward eps range. are there things you're considering to try and shine a brighter light on the consumer business, which is now a third of your business and less cyclical, be it resegmentation, another analyst day? just anything. you give great color. i'm just wondering if there's anything higher level.
that's number one. and number two, maybe why not buy back stock even more aggressively just given where the leverage is and all those metrics i just cited? thank you again for the thoughts.
doug dietrich -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah, let me take the last one first. no, i appreciate that the cash flow generation where the balance sheet is would support higher levels of share repurchase. i think where we are and we're kind of been is the $75 million is 50% of kind of that free cash flow, that average free cash flow number. that can certainly go higher.
but at the moment, we think that's a comfortable place for a balanced use of that cash to make sure that we also see opportunities on the acquisition front. so, we'll continue to make sure our debt stays and our balance sheet stays in that two times position. so, you might see some debt repayment this year. but we want to -- we see those opportunities out there through acquisitions, and we like to balance the use of that cash to make sure we have opportunities to do that.
as they wane, we can update share repurchase. and as they get closer, we might back off that share repurchase, we see that use of that cash for that strategic acquisition. so, we like where that is. we think it's a good balance, but we recognize that our balance sheet and cash flow could go higher if acquisitions plan.
on the other side of things, i think that's a great question, dan. i think we're doing -- we spend a lot of time, as much time as we can with investors and talking about this strategy. hopefully, the comments today you found were a little bit more clarifying in terms of where we've been and where we're directed. i do think that coming out -- going out with an analyst day is something that we want to do.
we're trying to actually -- it's interesting you said that because we've been talking about the timing of that and exactly when we can do it. we're thinking about possibly this fall. so more to come on that. but yeah, i think that would be very helpful to you and the rest on this call, but also to our investors to really see where this is going and what we see further out than just 2022.
so, stay tuned. i think it's a great idea. it's something we're going to do. we're going to try to plan that and more than likely, we'll do it.
so, try to get that out and have a real robust day around where we're headed.
daniel moore -- cjs securities -- analyst
