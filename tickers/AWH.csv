valerie, thank you. you may begin.
valerie palmieri -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, operator. good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. this afternoon, we will review our fourth quarter and full-year 2020 accomplishments, our financial performance, as well as an update on our q1 developments in terms of an acceleration of a product launch, a strategic agreement and payer coverage. in addition, i will be introducing two of our newest members of our executive team.
dr. elena ratner, global chief medical advisor of clinical and translational medicine; and kaile zagger, our chief operating officer. in addition to our executive team additions, we also recently appointed two new board members as well, dr. sandra brooks, md; and nicole sandford.
dr. brooks is the senior vice president and chief medical officer of tomas jefferson university hospitals, and is regarding her field as a thought leader in healthequity. ms. stanford a cpa is currently the executive vice president and global board services leader at the eli group.
and prior to this role, she was a national managing partner for deloitte's regulatory and operational risk practice. both appointees bring tremendous expertise to our board to help us take our company to the next level. i would also like to note that the majority of our board is now comprised of female directors at 71%, which we feel is important as a women's health company. i would now like to update you on 5 recent developments in the first quarter before i move into the 2020 review.
today, we are announcing the acceleration of the target launch date of ovasight to the fourth quarter of 2021. this technology was originally planned to launch in the first half of 2022. but based on the unmet market need, especially during the pandemic, we have made some additional investments and advancements in our algorithm, so we were able to launch ahead of schedule. this test, which was previously named ovanext will allow physicians to monitor a pelvic mass in patients who are not planned for surgery.
this is specifically designed for a population with a low prevalence of disease and has a total available market, which is three times that of ova1plus or 1.2 million patients per year. second, i am very happy to announce we've entered into a significant strategic research collaboration agreement for the development and commercialization of an ovarian cancer detection test for high-risk women. the collaboration is with dana-farber cancer institute, brigham women's hospital and the medical university of lodz. they have collectively published a novel microrna panel, which we intend to use in combination with our current technology.
we believe the high specificity demonstrated by this technology coupled with our strong sensitivity, has the potential to be the base technology for diagnostics, which will function as an early stage high-risk screening test. dr. northrup will cover more details in her section. number three, we announced coverage by new york state medicaid, one of the largest medicaid populations in the u.s., covering 29% of the population in the state.
this is a significant add to serve the underserved population in new york, and this brings our total covered lives to 179 million or 54% of the u.s. population as of april 1, 2021. number four, last month, we completed a public offering for $45 million, which was oversubscribed, and this significantly strengthened our financial position. and finally, in march, we presented at the congressional briefing titled advancing health outcomes for women and minorities.
we delivered a call to action for ova1 as the standard of care for ovarian cancer risk assessment for caucasian and non-caucasian women and the need to fund large race and ethnicity based trials. i am now moving on to a recap of our 2020 performance. last year was unlike anything we could have ever imagined, but i am so from our employees and how we effectively weathered the pandemic storm. we delivered solid test volume growth; improved price; added to our covered lives; and lastly, made significant key additions to our board, medical and executive teams.
we also continue to advance our product pipeline and strengthen our financial position as well during 2020. highlights of 2020 included seven major ones: number one, adding to our payer network with the addition of the cigna contract agreement. this is our first national payer, and we received very favorable rates. this in-network agreement added an additional 16 million lives to our contracted plans and includes ova1, in addition to our ovarian and cancer genetic testing panels, known as aspira genetics.
number two, we added to our medicaid coverage with 13 new state plans. major states added last year were georgia, new jersey and south carolina. with the addition of new york, our total credential medicaid population now stands at 60 million lives, which is 78% of the u.s. medicaid population.
having this coverage in place is so critical to managing the underserved population as we believe ova1 is the only technology available today that has adequate sensitivity for ovarian cancer detection and specifically black women. number three, through our digital and media campaign, we continue to increase the awareness of our technology and its superior performance relative to ca125, involves early detection of ovarian cancer and the detection of ovarian cancer risk in the black population. our campaign had a total of 133 media placements with a total of 139 million total media impressions. number four, we entered into a specimen collaboration agreement with abbvie.
abbvie agreed to provide us serum specimens, data and clinical metrics from the trial. these samples will support the development of endo check. in the first quarter of 2021, we also submitted an application to the fda for a breakthrough device designation and expect to have a dialogue with the fda in the second quarter of 2021. number five, as a patient-centric organization, we formed our own internal patient advisory board, led by chief spokeswoman, dr.
diane. this board includes ovarian cancer patients and survivors whose mission is to lead how we serve and educate patients. number six, we also successfully rebranded the company from vermillion to aspira women's health. the successor rebranding centered on our commitment to focus on women's health.
in addition, we rebranded two products, ovanext to ovasight and aspira genetics technology transfer to aspira synergy as well. and finally, we executed this year during an extraordinary and unprecedented times. before i turn the call over to kaile, who will cover aspira's commercial momentum in detail, i want to summarize the impact of our investment in commercialization and the progress we had. our fourth quarter volume grew sequentially over third quarter by 7%.
our ova1 revenue was up 15% due to volume growth, as well as an 8% price expansion on a per unit basis. bob will cover that in detail. in summary, we continue to work toward our overall strategic goal, which was to emerge stronger from the pandemic, and we believe we have accomplished this with our stronger team, our stronger financial position and our stronger pipeline. we are well positioned to invest, to grow and to drive adoption and most importantly, save lives.
it is now my pleasure to turn the call over to kaile zagger, a seasoned healthcare transformation executive whose experience spans across multiple healthcare industry disciplines. she brings extraordinary talent and abilities in building white business verticals, disrupting standard of care with net new technologies and elevating senior leadership teams to optimize performance. in a short period of time, kaile has launched a commercial strategy that is preparing us to significantly scale our commercial operations for standard of care adoption. we are thrilled to welcome her to the executive ranks of aspira women's health.
i'd like to introduce kaile. 
kaile zagger -- chief operating officer
thank you, valerie. i'm unequivocally excited to be a part of this leadership team. and this company, which represents a very important and personal mission to me, early detection of gynecological disease, beginning with ovarian cancer. undoubtedly, we have a robust pipeline of products that are positioned to disrupt the standard of care in the healthcare community, and will subsequently and exponentially save the lives of women by intercepting these diseases prior to late-stage diagnosis.
at the commencement of my tenure, deep analysis was performed with the intention of understanding the patient life cycle of our products and overall value they bring to the patient. in order to maximize and optimize our commercial position, we have enhanced our strategic plan in the following ways. number one, the repositioning and investment in core sales to capture 100% coverage of north america and strategically focused significant practitioners that can and will impact the standard of care conversion. we are markedly focused on our racial disparities within the core sales team.
and with our increase in medicaid coverage, we are diligently focused on accelerating access to care for these patients. we will be increasing our sales team investment by 38% in q2 to prepare for continued growth as well as the q4 ovasight launch. number two, we have launched the health systems team that will integrate our technology into pathways across various ologies that intersect ovarian cancer patients and integrate into the complex workflow environment of these systems. with over 80% of physicians scheduled to be owned by health systems by 2023, we are confident that this strategy is critical and timely for our organization.
number three, we have set in motion and integrated team comprised of highly experienced clinicians with informatics expertise. this team will work in a matrix to drive informatics integrations within the health system and create seamless workflows for adoption of our products. number four, we are creating a world-class customer experience for all customers, both small and large. we are expanding the size of this organization with the intention of providing optimal communication, white glove service and create an impeccable health systems, providers and patients alike.
we believe it will be a strong differentiator and contributor to the top line growth. number five, we have redeployed a synergy sales force to drive rapid adoption and penetration of our cutting-edge technology transfer platform. this is our decentralized platform, which is focused on healthcare systems, physician labs and clinics. synergy will also expand access for all aspira commercialized products and future pipeline innovations will be blended into the synergy platform.
all commercial verticals are horizontally connected with sharp focus on penetration, ease of use of our products and reacceleration of our growth across the continuum of care. we are now poised for growth to allow standard of care adoption of both ova1plus and genetics as a solution offering. and finally, the glue to our strategy is commercial activation of the market and awareness to the greater population. they are critical cornerstones and will be the fuel for growth behind the sales organization.
we have built our marketing organization in the past 90 days, and have amplified the focus around driving strong call to action campaigns across multiple channels. at the center of this strategy, we have placed the patient advisory board, led by dr. diane powis, our chief spokeswoman. this board is working to bring the patient experience and journey to life, while simultaneously magnify the horrific nature of ovarian cancer, across the health continuum and with key constituents such as the fda and the insurance community.
now i would like to pivot q4 performance and offer an insight into how the teams are performing in q1. as valerie mentioned, we delivered 7% sequential volume growth in the fourth quarter in the context of continued covid-19 restrictions. these restrictions continued in the first quarter and our sales territories. in february, we also experienced some patients and delivery disruptions due to inclement weather.
we are seeing a pickup in volume in march as the transformation strategies are gaining traction and the impact of the pandemic received. we believe q1 will track very similar to q4 in terms of volume due to these compounding factors and expect momentum to begin to build at a strong pace. in terms of ordering physicians for the quarter, 2,605 physicians ordered ova1plus, with 82% of the providers being repeat providers, consistent with our prior run rate. this clearly illustrates the impact that technology has on patient care, stickiness of the technology and the overall retention and growth opportunity we have with our expanded portfolio.
the number of ordering physicians increased 6% from the third quarter and flat year over year, signaling we are back to pre-covid levels in q4. i would now like to hand the call over to dr. northrop to provide an update on our innovation pipeline.
lesley northrop -- chief scientific officer
thank you, kaile. good afternoon, everyone. i would like to provide a brief update on our upcoming products and enhancements. as previously discussed with over 10 years of expertise in ovarian cancer risk assessment, we are creating a portfolio, which is comprised of products that impact a women's entire life cycle, starting with young adults with endocheck; to our hereditary risk for cancer genetix; including high-risk diagnostic screening, ovainherit; to benign mass monitoring, ovasight.
and lastly, our ovarian cancer risk assessment prior to surgery, ova1plus. we are continuing to increase our investment in r&d, and one of our key investments is our efforts on closing the disparity gap in women's healthcare, specific to the diagnostic accuracy of ovarian cancer detection. we have five active sites enrolled in our disparity clinical study the most recent addition was wayne state university in detroit, michigan as our first national cancer institute site. our time line for completing the study is still on track for the end of this year.
the goal is to put the manuscript by the first half of 2022. in parallel, we are continuing to recruit additional ethnic populations such as hispanic, black, asian into our oversight clinical studies as well as our international ova1 and overa study sites in the philippines and israel. both of these study sites are ending soon, and we are actively working on the data for multiple publication efforts. it is imperative.
we continue to capture an enriched population of women so that all of our current products and future products are pan ethnic focused. our second key investment is on our third-generation ovarian cancer risk assessment test, which is now branded as ovasight. we are pleased to announce today that we are accelerating the launch date to the fourth quarter of this year, with full national availability in 2022. this was driven by our belief in the clinical need to offer a risk assessment test for all women who present with a suspected pelvic mass.
during the pandemic, it became clear that assessment of masses not requiring surgery is a critical need. this test allows physicians to clearly classify masses as low or high-risk for malignancy to help guide clinical management. we submitted an abstract to the american society for clinical oncology for their early june conference of this year, and we'll be publishing both the analytical and clinical validation findings in q3 of 2021. we have received well over 500 prospectively collected specimens from our clinical studies that will provide real-world evidence data on the performance of the test.
this is an exciting time for the innovation team, as this will be our third product launched under my leadership as cso. first, being the genetix platform, and second being the aspire synergy genetix. i will now review our aid and diagnosis of endometriosis tests, known as endocheck. we believe there is market demand for a nonsurgical blood-based test to confirm the cause of the chronic pelvic pain of endometriosis early and help guide clinical management.
currently, endometriosis is treated based on symptoms and is diagnosed by surgical visualization and/or biopsy. though check will address the patient population of women who are experiencing chronic pelvic pain and want to afford to surgery by providing reassurance that their symptoms are indicative of endometriosis. the goal of this test is to allow for early diagnosis to direct appropriate clinical management that potentially reduces the portion of this disease. the early validation of an intended use population from the elagolix trial was submitted as part of the breakthrough device designation in january, and we are in dialogue with the fda.
in addition, we receive access to another valuable specimen bank from a consortium of six academic centers entitled endo marker study. this study was funded by nichd in support of the reproductive medicine network on endometriosis research. these specimens will support additional validation efforts of endocheck. additionally, we are in an early proof-of-concept of our ovainherit test, a diagnostic test specific to high-risk population of women, predisposed to ovarian cancer, either due to family history, personal history or genetic inheritance.
as mentioned earlier by valerie, we are evaluating de farber cancer institute, brigham and women's hospital and the medical university of lodz, microrna technology with diagnostic specificity in conjunction with our ovasight proteomic panel, which has high sensitivity as a potential diagnostic measurement of ovarian cancer. currently, clinicians can order ca125 with suboptimal sensitivity and specificity in conjunction with ultrasound to access risk in this patient population. we feel the combination of proteins and transcriptomics will outperform the current standard of care and better early detection of ovarian cancer. we are very excited about the innovation product pipeline.
with these products, we are circling the ovarian cancer disease state in a 360-degree view, ensuring that we understand the patient's hereditary risk for gynecologic cancers with our genetix product to help prevent disease. evaluating the acute risk for cancer and women with masses planned for surgery with ova1plus. and those where a monitoring strategy may be more appropriate with ovasight. and moving toward a diagnostic test for women at high-risk with ovainherit.
but our greater goal as a company is to improve women's overall health. to do so, we must add other gynecologic disease states like endometriosis that effect up to one in 10 women worldwide. this is the core goal of endocheck as an aid in diagnosis of endometriosis. we believe endocheck will provide a life-changing disease modification by enabling early diagnosis and treatment for women starting as early as young adults.
i would like to now turn the call back to valerie. valerie?
valerie palmieri -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, lesley. before we have bob provide an update on our financials, i would like to introduce dr. elena ratner. dr.
ratner recently joined our team as global chief medical advisor of clinical and translational medicine. she is currently the clinical division chief of gynecologic oncology at yale university school of medicine. she also serves as a director of the ovarian cancer early detection program that is part of the discovery to cure, yale medicines initiative focused on combating women's reproductive cancers. this initiative resonates greatly with aspire's mission and vision.
dr. ratner?
elena ratner -- global chief medical adviser and clinical and translational medicine
thank you, valerie. i'm delighted to join the call this afternoon. aspira's mission is to provide women with truly personalized ovarian cancer risk assessment and to enable early ovarian a detection for women of all ages, ethnicities and races, which is the core of my research and clinical practice. as the strive for improving survival of ovarian cancer patients and changing the narrative of this disease.
today, survival of ovarian cancer patient remains dismal and unacceptable. this is due in great part due to the challenges of early cancer actions as well as considerable ratio health equities in management of the disease. women of color, especially african-american women continue to have significantly lower five-year survival rates than caucasian women. there are many factors which drive this.
but having access to the best risk assessment technology in order to improve early stage cancer detection is critical. for generations, great amount of funds is being invested, and a great deal of research is being done in the field of surgery and chemotherapy in the disease. and yet, great majority of ovarian cancer patients will die from this cancer. this is due in great part to the delay in early stage diagnosis, making it clear and urgent that the bases come for better ovarian cancer early detection test, bedded technology, the supplement of all ages at messages and races for our best chance of changing the future of disease.
our end goal is to implement our technology as part of the care pathway at the institutional level, so that our care providers and every patient has equal access to the best personalized risk assessment solutions. i would like to turn the call back over to bob for a review of our financial results. bob?
bob beechey -- chief financial officer
thank you, dr. ratner. good afternoon, everyone. i'm delighted to be here, and i welcome our new team members.
as discussed, we've had continued volume growth in the fourth quarter. and now i'd like to make some high-level comments on the financials. product revenue was $1.4 million for the three months ended december 31, 2020, compared to $1.2 million for the third quarter. the 17% sequent increase is primarily due to an increase in of 1 test volume compared to the prior quarter and a sequential price improvement per ova1plus tests performed to $364 compared to $338 in the third quarter.
the number of ova1plus tests performed increased 7% to 3,849 ova1plus tests during the three months ended december 31, 2020, compared to 3,596 ova1plus tests performed for the third quarter. the volume increase was primarily due to our commercialization investment and further increase in patient doctor visits as patients have adjusted to the covid environment. gross profit margin on ova1plus was 50% in the fourth quarter, as compared to 45% in the third quarter, driven by improved volume and improved price realization. research and development expenses for the three-month ended december 31, 2020, were $735,000, a 24% increase from the third-quarter level of $594,000.
this increase was primarily due to product development costs related to ovasight as well as investments in bioinformatics and aspira synergy. sales and marketing expenses for the three months ended december 31, 2020, were $2.8 million compared to $2.2 million in the third quarter, a 32% increase. this increase was primarily due to increased expenditures on marketing to improve awareness, as well as slightly higher travel and entertainment as covid-19 pandemic restrictions slightly eased and investments in the commercial team. general and administrative expenses for the three-month period ended december 31, 2020, were $2.7 million compared to $2 million in the third quarter, a $0.39 increase.
this increase was primarily due to an increase in legal expenditures, as well as board of director fees as we settled the fourth-quarter installment of board restricted stock units in cash to defray tax liabilities, which arose in connection with rsu grants earlier in the year. our total cash utilization in the fourth quarter was $4.2 million compared to $3.1 million in the prior quarter. the fourth quarter included $428,000 related to the onetime cash settlement of restricted stock units. the remaining sequential increase in cash utilization was due to the increased investment in marketing and awareness as well as the investment in commercial and r&d.
we ended the year with approximately $16.6 million in cash. on february 8, 2021, the company completed a secondary stock offering, resulting in net proceeds of approximately $48.4 million, after giving effect to underwriting discounts but before expenses. we believe the strength of our balance sheet enables us to properly fund both the commercial and innovation opportunities facing the company. i'll now turn it back to valerie.
valerie palmieri -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, bob. before we open the call for q&a, let me restate our focus on building the company for sustainable growth for the near-term and the long term. in a year dominated by the pandemic, we delivered record enterprise value, growth, financial stability as well as we strengthen our team and our board. i am proud of what we have achieved and optimistic for a strong 2021.
we firmly believe that our strategy is the right one and that our technology and pipeline will be vital to lowering the overall healthcare burden and reducing significant inefficiencies in this care pathway. it's all about getting the right patient to the right doctor and finding the cancer at its earliest stage in all women. this mission is the core of our company. ovarian cancer accounts for more deaths than any other cancer of the female reproductive system and is the only gender-specific cancer with greater than a 50% mortality rate.
our work in products are at the forefront of changing the standards of care and the detection of ovarian malignancies. we believe we are helping close the gap in detection and, more importantly, survival for women. in the near term, we believe ova1plus, coupled with our disparity differentiation and genetic testing will become the standard of care and pelvic mass risk assessment for ovarian cancer. for the longer term, we are moving ahead with our planned launches of ovasight, endocheck; and lastly, ovainherit.
we also believe in this new covid error that racial and ethnic disparities and the importance of diagnostic information might actually be further elevated to reduce the aspira care and ensure that all women of every socioeconomic background, we see the best care possible. we are now happy to open the call for q&a and answer any of your questions. operator?

[operator instructions] our first question comes from the line of brian weinstein with william blair. you may proceed with your questions.
andrew brackmann -- william blair & company -- analyst
hi. good afternoon. this is andrew on today. maybe to start on the partnership announced today.
valerie, could you maybe just talk about sort of your level of confidence in bringing a product like this market you this technology? and i guess related to that, is there anything that you might be able to share with us around the development work that's been done so far to date? and when we should be thinking about any additional development normalization updates from here?
valerie palmieri -- president and chief executive officer
hi andrew, good afternoon. thank you for joining. your line was going in and out a little bit. so i don't know if it's your line or our line.
i'm hoping it was our line. so a couple of things. there's been two papers published. this is a partnership that we started a couple of years ago in terms of evaluating their technology.
and as you hear from the earnings script that is focused on microrna panel. so it's a collection of a panel, harvard, as well as dana-farber and brigham and the university of spent a number of years really studying the high-risk population. so this is technology looking at a specific panel for those high-risk patients. and as i said, they published two papers with significant ppv.
we haven't saved the ppv in public domain, but we can sell you the papers. and it's very significant ppv and very high specificity. the study that was initially done is about 454 patients. and of that study, about 34% of it was early stage.
andrew brackmann -- william blair & company -- analyst
great. and then maybe just following up here and recognizing it's still pretty early in that development work. could you just maybe provide some context around sort of levels of test performance that you think are needed for a commercially viable product? i guess really sort of what levels of sensitivity and specificity at that early stage should we be thinking about for broader uptick here?
valerie palmieri -- president and chief executive officer
so i would say that two things is that the colorectal screening guidelines just came out, right? and honestly, i thought that the performance metrics are on the lower side. we are aiming something in that 95%, 95% range. ideally, we'd like to get our specificity up to that 99%, but i want to say 95%, 95% is kind of what we are aiming for.
andrew brackmann -- william blair & company -- analyst
perfect. and then, bob, just one for you. i didn't forget about you here. one, with the number of initiatives ongoing, how should we be thinking about the opex and cash burn for 2021 and pacing of that throughout the year?
bob beechey -- chief financial officer
thanks for taking the question. i think that kaile referenced the fact that we're expanding on. i think q2 is the area where we're going to have a little bit of cost investment that's not offset by the revenue. that's not going to be dramatic, if you will.
i think when we phase those new hires out. but it's really this hospital group that we view as the driver to drive standard of care. and i think the ads phased over q1 in that team will be in the high single digits. and we're also looking at some it investment as well as the spending on the r&d.
so i think in those terms that we'll be phasing over time. and as the hospital group starts to turn revenue in the third quarter, a lot of those investments will start to pay for themselves. so i think it's really a relatively short-term bubble and fairly modest. i mean our objective this recent raise, we did.
we want to be very measured in terms of having that bridge us to positive. that was our stated intention when we did the deal, and we'll stay with that.
andrew brackmann -- william blair & company -- analyst
great. thanks.
bob beechey -- chief financial officer
thank you andrew.
operator
[operator instructions] our next question comes from the line of kyle mikson with canter fitzgerald. you may proceed with your questions.
kyle mikson -- cantor fitzgerald -- analyst
congrats on great update. so i want to start on the oversight acceleration. so i guess will the training the sales force be any different for ovasight versus ova1plus? and i guess, genetix, could just talk about that. and then i really would love it if you could help me understand how to think about the market size here.
so i could get it monitoring that. so that would be a few times a year, i think two to four as we've said in the past. but in terms of pricing, like asp, how much lower than the typical, like 330 could that could that be ultimately? and i'll leave it there.
valerie palmieri -- president and chief executive officer
no problem. so kyle, i'm going to start, and then i'll let kaile fill in as well. so in terms of training of the sales force, it's the same call point. so number one, same call point, and we've been selling a product in terms of a risk assessment where a woman to understand which doctor to do the surgery.
what doctors are really looking for is they really want to test for those patients that actually do not go to surgery. and we saw that during the conservative management through covid. and we actually are seeing that with a paper that we recently published in october, where we had a large percentage of our low-risk patients who did not move forward surgery. keep in mind, pre-menopausal women had the largest number of pelvic masses, and a lot of those on are fertile.
so surgery is something that is of top of mind. so that's number one. number two, in terms of asp. the asp initially that we will be rolling out be more of a stacked code version initially, but we will be going for an ama code just like we did with ova.
so it will be crosswalk to a similar ova. i do think that there will be some pricing discounts on this because it's going to be a test that we envision will be two to four times per year. keep in mind, the product that we are initially rolling out will be an initial product that is not for serial monitoring. i just want to make that clear.
so we had three cohorts on the oversight trial. the first cohort is a assessment of the risk of malignancy for benign masses. those, the patients are not planned for surgery. so it's a onetime use.
if the doctor elects to use it more than once they can do so. but our next revision of this will be a serial monitoring use of the product. so going back to the tam, i would say that the tam that we have is 1.2 million to 1.5 million women in terms of the use of the product that we'll be rolling out initially, that will be, again, subjective to the doctor. and then we'll be rolling out the two to four times per patient per year.
so just kaile wants to comment on the training that she's going to be putting in place for this new product.
kaile zagger -- chief operating officer
hi. thank you so much. yes, we have a robust go-to-market in place right now over the next six months, we'll be constructing not only the marketing strategy. but the field training strategy, and we will be actively getting the field team involved in this as of june.
so we have a three-month lead time of getting everyone integrated, getting up to speed on the products, understanding the new market segmentations that we are approaching and how to do this, so that we can rapidly penetrate and drive toward standard of care adoption as quickly as possible.
valerie palmieri -- president and chief executive officer
does that answer your question, kyle?
kyle mikson -- cantor fitzgerald -- analyst
yes, valerie. and kaile, thanks a lot for answering that. that was great. and just thinking about the on sales force a little bit further, actually.
so i guess currently, could you just kind of talk about like where you stand? and then when you increase 30%, i think i heard in the second quarter, that would be like 27, 28 reps. where will those take the typical six months to train? and then where will they be prioritized come early on because either you're rolling out the new product and synergy, there's a lot of different things to kind of think about if you're are --
valerie palmieri -- president and chief executive officer
[inaudible] so what we have is we have a team that's calling on the same call point. so number one, it's the gyn. we have the hospital team because there's a lot of women that actually come in at the gi level, the urology, orthopedic and then these women have their initial ultrasound and then go to a gyn. so we want to do a horizontal care pathway in the hospital.
i'll let kaile actually go into that. so in terms of the sales team, we see us evolving from, let's say, a team of and this is hospital and core, a team of, say, 20 in the core and in the 10 in the hospital. and over time, it's not initially going to be all this year, but over time, i see that team going to closer to 60. so we're going to methodically add in the markets that we have not been served where we haven't served right now.
we are going to double down in states like new york, where now we've got this medicaid contract, and we are going to be really having a very efficient relay team between the community swell that we've built for the last year. and also now that we have a bowl of physicians in the community, those physicians now are advocates at the hospital level, we're turning on the hospital system. so bringing on kaile, dr. ratner, who has the section chief at yale, these two individuals have the discipline and the know-how to convert healthcare institutions.
so that is really the core, and we feel that we've got to run a parallel path a well synchronized team, but a parallel path to actually get the hospitals in place in addition to additional market share and adoption at the community-based level. so let kaile also comment on the hospital strategy to give you more details.
kaile zagger -- chief operating officer
thank you, valerie. so i can add some specifics around the strategy and the tactical structure. so it essentially is a five pillar approach to creating standard of care. we have the core team of valerie first spoke about.
that is the approach to the gyn offices. and then there is the net new health systems team that will be working to integrate and rapidly adopt into the hospital system disrupting the standard of care there, which is currently 125. the third pillar of that is our integration leader team. so this is a team comprised of clinicians, background in the clinicians and expertise in informatics.
so they understand how to dive into workflow, how to assess process and how to integrate into the informatic overlays such as emrs. fourth pillar is the synergy sales force. so that will be our decentralized platform, which will be applicable into certain healthcare environments as well as super groups. and the fifth pillar of this is the marketing commercial activation pillar, all working together in a matrix environment to disrupt the standard of care.
the targeted approach that we've deployed is a three-pronged approach, and it's heavily data-driven around icd-10 codes, ca125 and covered live contracts that we have. so we've really structured north america to approach the places that were strongest first and the territories eventually will be comprised of one core sales rep, one hospital sales rep and integration lead and then coupled with the synergy counterpart that covers a few territories, all working in a collective matrix.
valerie palmieri -- president and chief executive officer
so hope that in terms of the overall plan.
kyle mikson -- cantor fitzgerald -- analyst
yes, that was fantastic. and i wanted to touch on the dana-farber brigham and blood partnership as well. so i know the research collaboration makes sense. but could you possibly talk about the economics at all? i mean, just thinking about like the role that those groups will play in the regulatory process, the ulta commercialization.
i think about the cash over the next couple of years. and then any color there would be great. and then can you just confirm if the new product, that kind of results of that partnership, if that is going be part of ovainherit? because it sounded like the mirna technology from that plus the ovasight panel will be ultimately open are? thank you.
valerie palmieri -- president and chief executive officer
yes. kyle, i would say you're pretty is do. so let me start, and i'll let dr. northrup fill in.
so this is a research collaboration with experts in, i want to say, high-risk early ovarian cancer detection. so they have spent a number of years honing this panel. they've published two papers as i said, an end of about 454 patients, 34% early stage. our goal is to take this microrna and couple it with our protein component to actually have a combined algorithm.
and so we are now going to be starting additional, i call proof-of-concept of the combination. and then we will, at that point, but we've already negotiated in terms of just the economics. getting back to your question. so we will be the commercialization engine we will be paying them a royalty similar to likely page and we will have exclusivity to the product.
and also, that will be a product that combines our technology and their technology. so this is a way of us instead of us developing on our own and spending, i want to say, years, plus the specimens are so rare. we are jump-starting our ovainherit with taking on their technology and then folding in with our technology. i'll let dr.
northrop also comment on this as well.
lesley northrop -- chief scientific officer
thank you, valerie. i think one of the exciting things that's so unique about coupling the transcriptome with the proteomics is that we can use the same sample type. so we can use the same term sample from the patient and be able to identify both the unique microrna expression profile that's indicative of the ovarian cancer as well as the protein profile. and in combination by doing this, this is where we're going to get that diagnostic accuracy of the disease and really be able to capture the early stage, so that we're getting the patients before and they have a higher survival rate.
the other beauty of it is that since it's from the same sample type, we can combine these two targets on the same technology platform. and so this way, we're not using two separate technology platforms, so we can create a high throughput technology process in our laboratory. and then at the last unique point about this is being able to combine this on the same technology, we can optimize the technology so that we can use smaller blood sample volume, so we can use what's called like micro sampling. so eventually, what we could do is actually launch this test in a dtc like model so that we could actually access patient sampling directly to their home versus having to go to the clinic, and utilize clinic consent opportunity for the patient.
so this way, it really harnesses on the disease and really is able for us to broaden the patient population so that we can test all women at risk for ovarian cancer.
kyle mikson -- cantor fitzgerald -- analyst
got it. that was great. just if i may, just one last question for me. with all these updates and initiatives, i just was wondering if the emphasis on payer coverage are expanding the covered lives, i guess, from 179 will be a priority in the near-term or if you're ok with that kind of $180 million live number?
valerie palmieri -- president and chief executive officer
so kyle, i would say that we're actually looking to put more resources on it, not only for ova, but these products that are coming to market in a, what i call a fast fashion. so the work that needs to go into ovasight reimbursement strategy, ovainherit, as well as endocheck, that begins now. so yes, we are, first and foremost, designing our trials or reimbursement in mind. if we don't change practice, we don't get paid.
and that is the spinal cord of our study protocols. so absolutely super critical, absolutely super critical even with our ova products. there are studies that we're initiating on clinical utility and looking at 12- and 24-month outcomes. plus we have studies that have long outcome data that are coming out of the philippines and israel.
so those studies will be published within this year, we believe.
kyle mikson -- cantor fitzgerald -- analyst
sounds promising. thanks for taking time and congrats again.
valerie palmieri -- president and chief executive officer

good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the aspira women's health first-quarter 2021 conference call. my name is rob and i'll be your coordinator for the call today. [operator instructions] leading the call today are valerie palmieri, president and chief executive officer; bob beechey, chief financial officer; and kaile zagger, chief operating officer; dr. lesley northrop, chief scientific officer; and dr.
elena ratner, global chief medical advisor, clinical and translational medicine. after the prepared remarks, we will open the call for q&a. before we begin, i would like to remind everyone that statements made during this call, including the q&a session relating to aspira's expected future performance, future business prospects or future events or plans are forward-looking statements as defined under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995. although the company believes that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are based upon reasonable assumptions, actual outcomes and results are subject to risks and uncertainties and could differ materially from those anticipated due to the impact of many factors beyond the control of aspira.
the company assumes no obligation to update or supplement any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law. participants are directed to the cautionary notes set forth in today's press release as well as the risk factors set forth in aspira's annual report with the sec for a description of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements. at this time, i would like to turn the call over to valerie palmieri, president and chief executive officer. valerie?
valerie palmieri -- president and chief executive officer
good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining us today. this afternoon, we will review our first-quarter accomplishments, financial performance as well as provide an update on q2 developments, including our first aspira synergy executed agreement with a very large women's health network, an endocheck update, a strategic study agreement with the largest healthcare provider in new york, our confirmed acceleration of our oversight product launch for q4 2021, and lastly, a new addition to our executive team. our end in mind is to transform women's health, starting with ovarian cancer. our initial goal is to eradicate late-stage detection of ovarian cancer and ensure that all of our solutions will meet the needs of all women of all ages, race, ethnicities and stage of disease.
our core patient goal is to develop a lifelong relationship with each patient from puberty to cure, ensuring each woman has access to the best-in-class diagnostics. we at aspira aspire women to take control of their gynecologic health and empower providers to deliver optimal care. i would now like to update you on six recent developments in the second quarter. first, aspira women's health is announcing today that is executing an aspira synergy agreement with one of the largest women's health networks, whereby the ova1plus testing will be performed in their laboratory with data interpretation by aspira.
the health network employs 300-plus physicians and is responsible for 500,000 patient visits per year. we are extremely pleased with this development and milestone. this is a fundamental building block to changing the standard of care. number two, i will provide an update on endocheck.
we are in very productive communications with the fda regarding our breakthrough request. the fda has acknowledged that there are many compelling reasons why this type of device is needed for both the treating physicians and for patients. the fda indicated that they are very interested in continuing to work with aspira on endocheck, and aspira will be continuing our discussions with the agency on the breakthrough device designation. number three, we are very pleased to announce we initiated a prospective clinical study for benign risk monitoring and high-risk early ovarian cancer detection with northwell health.
this is a study with the science arm of northwell health, which is the feinstein institute for medical research. northwell is the largest private healthcare provider in new york state. today, northwell treats over two million patients annually and employs over 16,000 credential physicians. number four, we are reaffirming the acceleration of a target launch date of oversight to the fourth quarter of 2021.
this test will initially allow physicians to assess benign pelvic masses with much better performing technology versus ca125. and our next revision, we will allow a mass to be monitored over time. this new test will leverage its high negative predictive value to assist and rule out as well as high positive predictive value to assist in risk of malignancy. the first review of this product's data will occur at the american society of clinical oncology, better known as asco, at their 2021 meeting, which will be held virtually on june 4.
number 5, we are building a strong patient provider and payer awareness foundation. awareness, education and advocacy is a key to changing the standard of care. we are establishing a foundation with clinical social media influencers, participating in congressional briefings and establishing a social media strategy with patients and clinicians. kaile and dr.
ratner will discuss further in their sections. and lastly, we are extremely pleased to announce we have added a diagnostics industry leader to the team to round out the breadth of experience needed to achieve our short- and long-term objectives. greg richard joined the company as head of corporate strategy, reimbursement and managed care. in this role, greg will be responsible for our overall corporate strategy, enhancing our blueprint for reimbursement for the company's current products as well as the new products and services in our robust pipeline.
he will lead our overall managed care and managed market strategy as we expand into integrated healthcare systems and leverage the company's recent successes and gaining coverage for ova1 with new york state medicaid and other important payers. in addition, he will also be responsible for managing the internal revenue cycle management team and will support the company's strategic business development initiatives. greg has served in several senior executive leadership positions at interpace diagnostics, quest diagnostics and lab corp. before i turn the call over to kaile to provide a commercial update, as previewed on our fourth-quarter call, our test volumes were sequentially flat in the first quarter versus fourth-quarter 2020.
this was due to the continued covid restrictions and weather disruptions. i am pleased to report we are gaining traction in march, april and may, and we see increased patient access, patients returning to the doctors, coupled with our increased commercial investment. this is promising as 24% of our territories still have less than 50% access to offices due to covid. and with covid reducing in the u.s., we are hopeful that things will continue to improve.
if covid continues to stay in check, we are confident our commercial momentum will continue as we continue to invest in our commercial organization, drive adoption and prepare for a larger sales footprint for oversight commercialization in q4 2021. in summary, we continue to work toward our overall strategic goal, which was to emerge from the pandemic stronger. and we believe we have accomplished this with our stronger team, our stronger financial position and our stronger pipeline. we are well positioned to invest, to grow and to drive adoption and most importantly, save lives.
i would now like to turn the call over to kyle zagger, our chief operating officer. kaile? 
kaile zagger -- chief operating officer
thank you, valerie. we have studied the complexities of how ovarian cancer presents through the patient journey and have mirrored our go-to-market strategy to capture that journey and intersect the patient prior to late-stage diagnosis. one year ago, we had two-pronged approach with the direct sales channel and a decentralized platform channel. we are proud to announce that we added to the direct sales channel, a new healthcare system sales team.
they include a dedicated dual sales and integration team as the health system team that will integrate our technology into the clinical pathways across various ologies that intersect ovarian cancer patients and integrate into the complex workflow environments of these systems. with over 80% of physicians anticipated to be owned or affiliated by health systems by 2023 and our large target launch of oversight, which we expect will be actively deployed in the health system. we are confident that these strategies are critical and timely for our organization. we are actively constructing our team of healthcare industry experts who have a strong history of disrupting current standards of care, and we are on track to nearly double the size of the commercial and operations organizations by the end of q4 2021.
our integration team comprised of highly experienced healthcare executive with informatics expertise. this team is working to drive integration within the health system and create seamless workflows for adoption of our products. we are working with a number of institutions and believe this approach will enable the aspira suite of products to gain adoption and become the standard of care. regarding our decentralized platform channel called our synergy sales force, we are happy to announce aspira women's health is announcing today that is an executed and aspira synergy agreement with one of the largest women's health network, whereby the ova1plus testing will be performed in their laboratory with data interpretation by aspira.
the health network employs 300-plus physicians and is responsible for 500,000 patient visits per year. we are extremely pleased with this development and milestone. this is a fundamental building block to change the standard of care. we expect synergy to also expand access for all aspira commercialized products, and we will expect that the future pipeline innovations will be blended into the synergy platform.
we are now poised for growth to allow standard of care adoption of both ova1plus and genetix as a solution offering. finally, the glue to our strategy is commercial activation of the market and awareness of the greater population. we believe in increasing awareness as a critical factor to driving adoption. we have expanded our digital marketing presence and have acutely invested in commercial activation over the last two quarters.
in addition, we were present at acog and sgo held virtually in 2021, and we'll be presenting our oversight abstract at asco in june. the number of ova1plus tests performed increased 3% to 3775 ova1plus tests during the three months ended march 31, 2021, compared to 3654 ova1plus tests for the same period in 2020, which was slightly down on a sequential basis. covid-19 restrictions have continued in the second quarter, we are gaining traction quarter to date. april volumes were a record month for the company.
also, we just received new york state medicaid coverage as of april 1, 2021, so we are just starting to gain traction in this market. in terms of ordering physicians for the first quarter, 2595 physicians ordered ova1plus. the number of ordering physicians was essentially flat from the fourth-quarter levels. as we continue to focus on larger health systems to generate adoption and lay the groundwork for new product introduction, i would like to note that we are receiving orders from 65% of healthcare institutions listed in the top 20 of u.s.
news and world report best hospital honor roll. this supports the foundational use of ova1plus and demonstrates the potential to drive standard of care adoption as we expand our health system commercial team. i would now like to hand the call over to dr. elena ratner to provide an update on our momentum to becoming the standard care and driving the awareness of our technology and its impacts on early stage risk detection of ovarian cancer, particularly in racial and ethnic diverse populations.
elena ratner -- global chief medical adviser
thank you, kaile. as a physician, education, awareness and adoption is key to changing the standard of care. we have had several milestones in this quarter. the first was a congressional briefing.
in the first quarter of 2021, we presented at a congressional briefing, advancing health outcomes for women and minorities. we delivered a call to action for ova1 as the standard of care for ovarian cancer risk assessment for caucasian and non-caucasian women and the need for funding large race and ethnicity-based trials. we will be focusing on a continued basis for this type of policy change as we believe the time is now to gain the momentum with congress. more on this to come.
the second milestone, i'm pleased to report is a very successful zoom dinner presentation that we've done in collaboration with dr. sandra brooks who serves on aspira's board of directors. we conducted an ova1plus education session, which was attended by over 130 non-aspira participants. the audience was mainly ob/gyn providers from across the country.
we believe that 130 participants was indicative of a very strong turnout for this type of event. the title of the presentation was utilization of ova1plus to optimize ovarian cancer risk assessment, including defining the need for personalized approach to pelvic mass diagnosis. these topics discussed were the need for early detection of ovarian cancer, other options of assessing risk, review for how genetic testing from hereditary risk is impactful and the value of ova1plus for optimizing ovarian cancer risk assessments. we also had a focused discussion on racial and ethic differences in the performance of ova1plus and ca125.
we will be continuing this method of education and communication to a larger degree as well. the third milestone is the addition of a new team member to our medical team to support our awareness movement. dr. shieva ghofrany, a practicing ob/gyn and ovarian cancer survivor, has joined the team and will serve as head of global clinical implementation.
dr. ghofrany is a key social media influencer and will assist in driving ovarian cancer and aspira women's health awareness overall. regarding clinical studies under my leadership, we're continuing to recruit more academic sites to support both the critical validity and utility of our tests. we have also launched our physician-initiated research program for healthcare systems.
this program provides nominal funding's for projects that help fuel clinical implementation and adoption of ovarian cancer risk assessment tool and allows us to continue to expand our data repository. i'm incredibly excited about the direction our clinical studies have taken, and we are continuously building our study programs to strengthen the data around our products. and lastly, i would like to report a major update on our philippines study. we are excited to announce we have closed our philippines study and reached 379 enrolled patients.
we will be continuing to serially monitor the patients up to five years to support our oversight longitudinal study. we're actively working on analyzing the data, and we look forward to publishing this data soon. i would now like to hand over the call to dr. northrop to provide an update on our innovation pipeline.
lesley northrop -- chief scientific officer
thank you, dr. ratner. i would like to provide an update on our upcoming products and enhancements. let me reiterate my optimism for endocheck.
as valerie mentioned, we are having a productive dialogue with the fda. while we cannot disclose our sensitivity and specificity of the test performance while fda discussions are ongoing, we are pleased with our data relative to the current standard of care, laparoscopic surgical assessment. we are working on updating our submission to the fda based on their guidance to meet breakthrough designation showing endometriosis is an irreversible debilitating disease. we have received extensive feedback from the clinical community.
there is an unmet need for a nonsurgical blood-based test to confirm the cause of chronic public pain as endometriosis early and help better guide clinical management. endometriosis is predominantly treated based on symptoms alone and immediate prescription of oral contraceptives where surgical diagnosis is becoming rarer, thereby increasing women's anxiety by delaying a confirmation that their chronic pain is in fact endometriosis. endocheck will address the patient population of women who are experiencing systemic, moderate to severe pelvic paid and provide confirmation that their symptoms are indicative of endometriosis. the goal of this test is the same for all tests that we are developing an aspira women's health on pelvic disease detection is to allow for early diagnosis and direct appropriate medical management that potentially reduces the progression of this disease.
i would like to now provide updates on oversight. we continue to be on track for our accelerated launch of oversight. the analytical and initial clinical validation of oversight performance metrics will be presented in an asco poster presentation on june 4, 2021. the accepted abstract presents data demonstrating the initial clinical and analytical validation of aspira's oversight blood-based biomarker test for ovarian malignancy risk assessment in all women within adnexal mass.
samples collected from real-world evidence studies with a low prevalence of cancer, less than 5%, were used to validate the algorithm. this third-generation technology, which is a laboratory developed test, will provide clinicians with a high negative predictive value to provide confidence in planning a suspected benign mass monitoring plan as well as a greater positive predictive value to increase confidence in risk of malignancy and next steps on clinical management. this product is expected to be available in q4 of 2021. the in addition, peer-reviewed publications on both the analytical and clinical validation findings are scheduled for q3 of 2021.
to further support longitudinal studies for the use of ovasight as a serial monitoring test for high-risk women predisposed for hereditary ovarian cancer, we recently entered a long-term research collaboration with the feinstein institute for medical research, the science arm of northwell health. this collaboration is critical in targeting a rich population of women with known genetic variances associated with ovarian cancer and allows validity data for the development of ovainherit. at the same time, this collaboration supports a smaller physician-initiated experiment on the use of our current ova1plus as ability to screen malignancy risk in women undergoing prophylactic surgery who are also positive for a pathogenic variant and genes associated with a greater than general population risk in developing ovarian cancer. this partnership is now our third academic institution to participate in our clinical studies in addition to einstein in philadelphia and wayne state university and national cancer institute center.
our clinical studies are gaining traction now that we are coming out of the pandemic as one of our sites, arizona obgyn associates was able to recruit greater than 100 patients in less than three months. by bringing on larger academic institutions and clinical practices, we can collect a comprehensive cohort of women across all races and ethnicities to recruit for our clinical studies and continuously optimize our product development pipeline. we continue to develop data metrics with these larger academic institutions through our clinical studies as well already established technologies validated for the detection of ovarian cancer. combining our high sensitivity performance as reported with ovasight and high specificity with harvard dana-farber cancer institute's microrna technology provides a multi-omics approach that can help eradicate late-stage ovarian cancer.
multi-omics technology will allow us the opportunity to develop the diagnostic and eventually screening technology that we desperately need to increase a woman's survival rate when faced with an earlier diagnosis ovarian cancer. in addition, in march of 2021, the results of an ova1plus study were presented as a poster at the society of gynecologic oncology 2021 annual meeting on women's cancer, sgo meeting. the objective of the study was to determine whether using overa to perform reflux testing on tough results with a high ova1 score can improve specificity in detection of malignancy in women within adnexal masses; a testing process we've referred to as ova1plus test. these results indicate that the ova1plus test did improve specificity in detection of ovarian cancers.
with all the products in the pipeline, you will begin to see we are building a lifetime relationship with the patient. this is our ova360 approach and providing a circular loop of products to better women's health. we are developing products that can start as early as menses, endocheck and into prenatal planning genetics carrier testing, allow early detection risk of hereditary cancer, genetic hereditary cancer testing, into later life risk of sporadic ovarian cancer detection with ova1plus and our new product ovasight and look to the future in developing residual risk assessments when negative following the coupling of ova1plus with genetic testing as well as reoccurrence monitoring and eventually therapeutic clinical diagnostic testing. our scientific team is actively developing these concepts based off our clinical studies to ensure we are always optimizing our current products and validating future products that help manage women's health and wellness.
i will now turn it over to bob for an update on our financials. bob?
bob beechey -- chief financial officer
thank you, dr. northrop. product revenue was $1,416,000 for the three months ended march 31, 2021, compared to $1,185,000 for the same period in 2020, an increase of 19%. the number of ova1plus tests performed increased 3% during the three months ended march 31, 2021, and compared to 3,654 ova1plus tests for the same period in 2020.
the test volume was also down slightly on a sequential basis as we experienced disruptions from the february storms. the revenue per ova1plus tests performed increased to approximately $375 compared to $325 for the same period in 2020, an increase of 16% and a 3% increase compared to the fourth quarter of 2020 price of $364. this increase was primarily driven by an increase in payments by contracted payers. gross margin on ova1 products was 54% in the first quarter compared to 50% in the fourth quarter and 44% in the first quarter of 2020.
our participation in aspira genetix testing, clearly in the early innings, is driven by our conviction that the use of genetix testing is a critical factor in the early risk assessment of ovarian cancer. consequently, a significant portion of our effort is in obtaining research samples, which we do not include in reported exceptions or as revenue. our revenue for genetix in the first quarter was $80,000, representing volume of 175 units with an average unit price of $456. this represents a significant position -- percentage growth on a year on year and sequential basis, but off a very low base.
significantly, we generated 195 research samples in the first quarter. total operating expenses comprised of r&d, sales and marketing and administrative costs were $6,488,000 in the first quarter compared to $6,305,000 in the fourth quarter. the increase was driven by increases in r&d expenditures and investments in personnel in the sales and marketing area slightly offset by lower administrative expenses. e ended the first quarter with $59.4 million in cash.
cash used in operations in the first quarter of 2021 was $5.2 million. cash utilization in the fourth quarter of 2020 was $4.2 million. the increase was driven primarily by the timing of 2020 bonus payouts as well as new hires and consultants, marketing and promotional activities as well as r&d spending focused on endocheck. our february secondary offering closed on february 8, 2021, at a price of $7.50 a share and resulted in net proceeds to the company of $47.7 million after deducting underwriting discounts and offering expenses.
i'll now turn it back -- the call back over to valerie.
valerie palmieri -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, bob. before we open up the call for q&a, let me restate our optimism for building the company for sustainable growth for the near-term and the long-term. in parallel, we are executing quickly on our larger mission to serve the 20 million women in the u.s., starting with ovarian cancer risk assessment, pelvic mass monitoring and eventually tackling the largest disease; endometriosis. keep in mind, our hereditary ovarian cancer monitoring test, ovainherit is incremental to this market, and this product will be for women with and without a mass.
ovarian cancer accounts for more deaths than any other cancer of the female reproductive system and is the only gender specific cancer with greater than a 50% mortality rate. our work and products are at the forefront of changing the standards of care and detection of ovarian malignancies. we believe we are helping close the gap in detection and, more importantly, survival for women. in the near term, we believe ova1plus, coupled with our racial and ethnicities differentiation and genetics will become the standard of care for personalized pelvic mass risk assessment for ovarian cancer.
for the longer term, we are also moving forward on our planned launch of our ovasight product for benign mass management, endocheck for endometriosis, and lastly, ovainherit for high-risk genetic predisposition monitoring. our end in mind is the incorporation of proteins, genes and other modalities to detect gynecologic disease, which cannot be detected via traditional biopsy. in time, our goal is to become the liquid biopsy standard for these diseases, inclusive of all ages, stages, and most of all ethnicities. with our enhanced team, strengthened financial position and a robust portfolio, we could not be more confident across the business.
it is now time that all women of every race and ethnicity receive the best possible care, and we are proud and excited to make that happen. we are now happy to open up the call for q&a and answer any of your questions. operator?

[operator instructions] our first question comes from the line of brian weinstein with william blair. please proceed with your question.
unknown speaker
hi. good afternoon. this is andrew on for brian. thanks for taking the question.
valerie palmieri -- president and chief executive officer
hi, andrew.
unknown speaker
valerie, maybe you can start sort of where -- hi, good afternon. maybe start sort of where you ended your script, sort of around sort of all the pieces that you have in place here right now. you've got sort of the building momentum in the core business. you've got the team sort of now set in place and some nice new hires there.
you've got the capital now with the raise and sort of you've got the pipeline behind all of this sort of encompassing all of it. so as we think about all those building blocks here, should we be thinking that sort of 2022 and exiting 2021 is sort of when all this starts coming together in terms of revenue growth or is it more sort of back half of 2022?
valerie palmieri -- president and chief executive officer
no. so andrew, thanks for the question. and i'll answer in a couple of different parts. we started this new vertical in the hospital systems in terms of hiring the leader in q4 of 2020.
and we have put the team in place. really, our q1, i want to say, flat growth was driven by covid. so we now have a team in place in the hospitals. we are wrapping up the team in q2, and we will see, i believe, momentum in the back half of the year.
keep in mind, prior to covid, we had 20 people in the field. we now are going to take that closer to 40 people in the field by the beginning of 2022. and this will line up with our ovasight launch. the ovasight launch in q4 we really want the entire team lost and loaded and ready to go for ovasight.
unknown speaker
perfect. that's helpful. ok, maybe to pivot here to the aspira's synergy agreement announced today. can you just give us a little bit more detail around that? is this something that's going to have sort of predefined volume and revenue associated or how should we be thinking about contribution here? and then second from that, it sounds like that this is going to be a part of the core strategy.
so how should we be thinking about the funnel of additional agreements beyond this?
valerie palmieri -- president and chief executive officer
ok. so in terms of -- let me enter that in a couple of different pieces. so in terms of the core strategy, this is something we've been working on, honestly, for about two years, and covid caused a gap in the strategy as these large super groups were distracted, right? their p&l's were upside down. now that they're right-siding themselves, they still have gaps.
so synergy actually brings revenue to the table for them immediately. and this is a customer that we have been discussing -- having discussions with them, as i said, for a few years now, and now we're ready to go. so what is that going to mean in terms of volume? well, since they are looking at their p&l being upside down, they're incentivized right to bring revenue in those businesses prospectively. so i do believe that there's a huge wind in our sails for them to convert from ca125 to ova.
keep in mind this business that we did not have in terms of -- we had, i would say, spotty customers that were spending within the practice. but in terms of converting to all 300-plus physicians, they were primarily using ca125. so i do think it's going to -- when the conversion happens, there is a couple of, what i call pre-conversion checks and balances that happen, but we will start seeing volume from this particular partner as early as q3. and then i see it as it's probably going to take us a couple of months to get it up to full tilt.
but because there's an opportunity to really -- that we've got to get the old customers converted. but they are part of that conversion process, right, in terms of the care pathway, in terms of the notification process, the communication process within this healthcare network. so this is something that we firmly believe in. we firmly believe on empowering the doctors locally at point of care.
and our win in this is the access to the identified data as well as the margins on this because it becomes a software subscription service.
unknown speaker
great. a lot of wins associated with that. and then sort of last one for me, really on the pipeline here. first, just a housekeeping one on endocheck.
anything that you can really tell us around sort of the time line on when we'll get final decision on the fast track there? and then as it relates to ovasight and the serial monitoring product, can you maybe just be a little bit more specific on how you're viewing a successful trial readout for that? and what are some of the key metrics that we should be focused on in order to bring a product like that to market? thanks for the question.
valerie palmieri -- president and chief executive officer
no problem. so let me answer that in two parts as well. so with endocheck, i would say is that with the breakthrough device, the reason it's breakthrough is because there is no predicate, right? so these are discussions with the fda, where it's really a back and forth on what is this device? how does it make a difference? how does it make a difference in terms of a debilitating disease? so i would say that our initial discussions have gone well, and it's a working process, but we're very -- as lesley pointed out and i pointed out, we're very optimistic. they've acknowledged the compelling reasons why there's a need.
i think there's some education on endometriosis. people don't initially think of it as debilitating. but when you show them the compelling data, it really makes people pause. so right now, we're in a mode of them really giving us feedback.
and i would say that in terms of timeline, my sense is we will have feedback within -- i don't want to say it's going to be this year because i can't put a time line on the fda, but i think this year, we will have feedback from them. and hopefully, it's for the next earnings release. and then part 2 of your question on ovasight. so ovasight, there's two trials.
we have our onetime use trial, which that's the product that's launching q4 2021, and then we have the monitoring trial. so the onetime use trial will be -- we will have that analysis completed, and that will be launched in q4 of 2021. if a doctor elects to use this for multiple uses, we have not studied longitudinally this technology. that actual test, the rev two of this test will be completed by q2 of 2022 and then we will be launching the monitoring aspects of this in the back half of 2022.
so i hope that gives you enough color to answer your questions.
unknown speaker
that's great. thanks for taking.
valerie palmieri -- president and chief executive officer
my pleasure.
operator
thank you. our next question is coming from the line of kyle mikson with canter fitzgerald. please proceed with your question.
kyle mikson -- cantor fitzgerald -- analyst
thanks. hi, guys. thanks for taking the question. congrats on the nice quarter.
valerie palmieri -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, kyle.
kyle mikson -- cantor fitzgerald -- analyst
so i wanted to start with the commercial expansion. sure. so last quarter, you talked about 38% increase in the sales force i guess or like the investment. i believe it's going to start in the second quarter.
so is that still the plan? and then if you could also just tell me like how large the sales force is right now? and how many of those reps are kind of focused on just the health system part of that strategy that you kind of implemented more recently? and then how large do you want the rep count to get to toward the end of the year as you exit 2021? thanks.
valerie palmieri -- president and chief executive officer
so kyle i'm going to start and then i'm going to get the ball to kaile. so as you know, we started with 20 reps, and we kind of held tight through covid. now that we see things truly opening up, although 24% of our business still has less than 50% access, we do see weekly increases in volume. i can't go into details on q2.
but all i can tell you is that we're seeing this weekly records breaking, and it's a function of really three pillars. one is access in terms of we are getting access. number two, patients are going to doctors. and then number three, we have this new hospital vertical.
so we'll go into the details in terms of where we started and where we're going to be by the end of the year, but we're pretty confident in terms of the momentum we're seeing in q2 and where we're going to be starting q3. so i'll toss the ball to kaile.
kaile zagger -- chief operating officer
hi, kyle, nice to speak with you. so i can give you some actuals on the actual statistics of folks that we have. so inside the core sales organization, which is strictly focused on the physician practices right now. we have 16 sales representatives across north america, and we are moving to 28.
in the health systems organization, which is comprised of our healthcare executives with an informatics expertise. we currently have three, by the end of next week we will have five, and we are rapidly moving to 14 with the candidates in the funnel to be able to move to that number. for our synergy specialty sales force, we currently have two individuals, and we are moving to five. we have most of those candidates also identified.
and then we have our integration team, which sits right next to the hospital vertical. and we currently have one head of state in place and we are moving to five folks to include a few hl7 engineers, a system engineer and a technical consultant to assist the health system team in properly integrating.
kyle mikson -- cantor fitzgerald -- analyst
all right. wow, that was great detail. thank you, kaile and valerie. thanks so much.
kaile zagger -- chief operating officer
thank you.
kyle mikson -- cantor fitzgerald -- analyst
and just switching gears to the -- thanks. switching gears to the study and the partnerships announced recently. i just wanted to confirm the dana-farber bringing women's partnership and the northwell study, are just -- are they related directly or is just -- are they like kind of complementary? i'm just trying to understand if you're trying to have a few shots on goal here or if all of these partnerships are just kind of working toward the same goal the ovainherit? thanks.
valerie palmieri -- president and chief executive officer
yes. so kyle, really good question, very intuitive. and i'll start and i'll let dr. lesley northrop also give you some additional context.
so ovainherit is a combination of proteins, which is the basis of that is the ovasight protein panel, seven proteins, plus age. and we are adding to it with the harvard team, a microrna panel that we are -- our goal is to get to a 95%, 95% sensitivity and specificity. so with us getting access to additional specimens, harvard also has a bank of genetically predisposed patients. we actually want to start a prospective study with an enriched population, as you can imagine, in long island, due to the ashkenazi jewish population, it's a very enriched population.
so this is a prospective study, basically looking at the ovainherit product, the ovainherit product could include our proteins. it can include the harvard samples. it also might include, in the future, exosome's and other analyte's as we're doing further research with baylor as well. lesley, i'd also like to give you the floor if there's any other color you'd like to give to kyle.
lesley northrop -- chief scientific officer
yes. thank you valerie and it's nice to speak with you, kyle. so we're really trying to ensure that we have these really comprehensive clinical studies going on across the country to valerie's point to make sure that we're recruiting patients across multiple cohorts that meets our diagnostic test development for ovarian cancer. and the beauty of the relationship with northwell is to what valerie alluded to is that we can really target this enriched population to -- which is our ovainherit population, right, high-risk women who are germline carriers and then validate the test that we developed with harvard on these prospectively collected samples.
but at the same time, we're also collecting additional biological targets to be able to develop future products, where we're also looking at cell tumor dna detection as well as other drivers of ovarian cancer because we really want to -- for the future, we really want to start looking at, as i mentioned, potentially reoccurrence monitoring as well as companion diagnostics and therapeutic test development. and so in order to do that, we really need to get these large clinical studies and a large set of samples to be able to clinically validate our tests after we analytically validate them in the lab.
kyle mikson -- cantor fitzgerald -- analyst
ok. thanks, dr. northrop and valerie. that was perfect.
and i actually want to stick on the subject, about the pipeline a little bit. so this ovainherit test is going to use a multi-omics approach, it sounds like. so are you still -- i know it's early still, obviously, but would you still use the cobas system to run those -- to run that test? and then also, i'd love it if you could kind of dive a bit deeper into the residual risk assessment because, obviously, there's a lot of mrd test out there or kind of coming to market? and are you thinking about it kind of the same way? and it could be interesting in ovarian cancer, right? so just -- just high-level thoughts would be awesome to hear. thank you.
valerie palmieri -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, kyle. so i'll start and let lesley also fill in. and also dr. elena ratner is on the line too.
she may also like to comment. so from a cobas perspective, yes. so we're starting with the key with us is that we're using fda-cleared kits and the combination of looking at the drivers of the disease and pulling all those proteins together on the protein side, of course, the microrna technology is not fda cleared, it's on a -- it will be an ldt platform. so -- but we are going to continue to use the cobas right now.
but keep in mind, the analysts that we use, we could actually put on an abbott system, a siemens system. so we're not wed to roche, and we've intentionally done that. we really are ambidextrous. so the opportunity is, let's just say, way down the road is how can we put this on a platform that this goes global and it really -- than we make a uniform platform.
but right now, we're staying ambidextrous with the cobas. i'll let lesley comment on some other technology as well.
lesley northrop -- chief scientific officer
yes. thank you, valerie. so since we already have the system up and validated on our proteins, as valerie alluded to as well that these are fda validated assays. we can easily implement this technology really quickly.
but we are looking to bring in a more simplified higher throughput system where you can actually run the proteins and the microrna on the same system and use the same sample. so what this allows us to do is we can really put in low throughput amounts of blood and be able to quantify both proteins and microrna on the exact same platform at a very low cog. and this would give us a more high throughput operation. so that's also something that we're developing on the backend as well as to make sure that we can scale appropriately using this more high throughput system.
and then as far as the residual risk question. this is actually a really fascinating area that we're focused on as a scientific and clinical team. and that i think one of the areas that you'd be familiar with is myriad has their myrisk based test for breast cancer. and so we're looking to utilize polygenic risk scores assessment and the same approach for ovarian cancer.
and now that kaile and our sales team is out there selling coupled ova1plus with our genetix, our germline testing, we're going to have an enriched cohort of samples from our commercial testing. we actually have three sites that are actually doing what's called a clinical implementation study, where we can get the data from these patients. and then what we can do is if you were present with the mass and your ova1plus was a low-risk and you also were negative for a germline variant, we could then run a reflex. we could then run a reflex test on the patient.
i'm really -- on the patients and see what the residual risk would be if it's anything greater than the general population for these enriched snips that are known to be associated from a polygenic risk score assessment for ovarian cancer.
kyle mikson -- cantor fitzgerald -- analyst
wow. ok, that was really exciting. thanks a lot for all the detail. so i guess i'll leave it there for my questions but thanks so much for taking them.
and have a good night.
valerie palmieri -- president and chief executive officer
you too, kyle. thank you.
operator
our next question is from the line of sandy draper with truist securities. please proceed with your question.
sandy draper -- truist securities -- analyst
thank you very much. a lot of the science and product questions have been have been asked. so i'm not sure if these are more for bob or maybe valerie if you want to chime in, so mine are going to be a little bit more financial oriented right now. first, can you just remind me with the health network, you mentioned it's a more of a recurring service type of model.
is that a fixed amount where you're just going to get paid? does it scale up with volumes? just trying to get some sense of how to think about the revenue impact to that? and then is it seasonal? is it like testing? just trying to think about it or is it truly a recurring license model where they just pay x amount of dollars a month.
bob beechey -- chief financial officer
no, sandy, this is bob and thank you for the question. it is volume-driven. it is a per click business model. so there would be no more seasonality.
i think the only issue we're looking at is how quickly we can ramp up as there's implementation things to be put in place. so the way to think about it, though, is that it's basically a per click license fee. we do have cost to deliver, but it's not really variable in the sense of the client will source their own, in coordination with us, in terms of appropriately making sure it's qa in terms of lots and things of that nature, working with the supplier, but they'll source their own reagents as well as the blood tests. so there won't be logistical costs when they do it in their facility.
there will be a transition period in terms of send outs. we have to work out reimbursement and coordinate with them as well, but they will be billing the tests, and we will get a license fee per click.
sandy draper -- truist securities -- analyst
great. and so is it -- i would assume then that, that should come at a notably higher-margin to you than what -- certainly, what you're seeing right now just on standard test volume?
bob beechey -- chief financial officer
that's clear. yes.
sandy draper -- truist securities -- analyst
yes. ok. great. second question on margins.
you talked about bob i think you said 54% gross margins on the ova product. 50% last quarter, 44%. should we think about that well, one, just the volumes were flattish, are actually down slightly, but your margins went up. so maybe some color on what drove that, but should we think about cadence? and then is the difference between that 54% this quarter and the 40% reported gross margin, is that really on the genetix or is that something else that's going in the cost of goods?
bob beechey -- chief financial officer
that is definitely the genetix, which is the blended number. we like to keep an eye on the specific matter in terms of ova margins. i think the way you should think about margins as well is clearly, we are not at scale. i mean, we've got plenty of capacity and our marginal cost in terms of labor is relatively small.
our cobas could handled multiples of the current volume we're doing right now. so our variable cost clearly depends on our blood draw arrangement, and there's some degree of variability on that, but reagent efficiency gets better. so we anticipate our margins as our volumes ramp second half of the year and into next year going up considerably. clearly, the year-on-year margin uplift was very much volume-driven.
and then, well, we had flat margins. there's probably just some noise in there relative to last year. as we transitioned, i think we try and be as true as we can in terms of segregating costs for genetics and the ova portfolio, but it was really just more efficiency. it was a relatively smooth quarter.
so there is no one-off item that gave rise to it in the prior quarter.
sandy draper -- truist securities -- analyst
got it. ok. that's helpful. and then my final question, can you just remind me on ovasight, which i know the target launch end of this year, fourth quarter of this year, where exactly are in terms of reimbursement and how we should be thinking about reimbursement and just getting paid for the volume and what you think the longer-term reimbursement levels are going to be for that product? thanks.
bob beechey -- chief financial officer
valerie, do you want to handle that one?
valerie palmieri -- president and chief executive officer
i will. i will. thank you for the question, sandy. so let me kind of walk through it.
so ovasight will be a seven-test analyte based algorithm. so there are seven tests, there's seven components of it. keep in mind, if you look at the backbone of ova1 and overa, overa was actually created from a crosswalk of ova1. ova1 was created from a crosswalk to the opko 4 score test, which is for prostate cancer.
so this test will be crosswalked back to overa with the seven proteins. where that -- what's the timing on that? so that's getting an ama code, which is now called the pla code and going through the process. we will probably be launching with an unspecified code which again, through this, i call, making the test available prior to the monitoring test being available. and -- but then we're working through with the ama to get to the pla code.
but it takes us launching the test, getting the clinical utility, getting the publications in place, but the plan would be a crosswalk back to overa. and you will see, of course, pricing appreciate over time.
operator
thank you. at this time, i'll turn the floor back to valerie palmieri for closing remarks.
valerie palmieri -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, rob. in closing, as we see progress in covid vaccination rates and believe the restrictions will subside, we are focusing on doing the right things to drive sustainability and growth. with our commercial footprint, our strengthened balance sheet, a guideline endorsed and differentiated test, plus a differentiated portfolio of tests within the same call point, and now 54% of the lives covered in the u.s., we believe we are in a position to support continued growth and profitability. our end goal is to serve a large global pelvic mass population and overall women's health market with a platform coupled with proprietary science and data tools, which will drive better health and well-being to each and every patient we serve.
thank you for joining us today, and we appreciate your support and interest in aspira women's health.

operator
good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to aspira women's health second quarter 2021 conference call. my name is shamali, and i will be your coordinator for the call today. [operator instructions] as a reminder, this conference call is being recorded today. leading the call today are valerie palmieri, president, and chief executive officer; bob beechey, chief financial officer; and kaile zagger, chief operating officer; and dr.
lesley northrop, chief scientific officer; and dr. elena ratner, global chief medical advisor, clinical and translational medicine. after the prepared remarks, we will open the call for q&a. before we begin, i would like to remind everyone that statements made during this call, including the q&a session relating to aspira's expected future performance, future business prospects or future events or plans are forward-looking statements as defined under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995.
although the company believes that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are based upon reasonable assumptions, actual outcomes and results are subject to risks and uncertainties and could differ materially from those anticipated due to the impact of many factors beyond the control of aspira. the company assumes no obligation to update or supplement any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law. participants are directed to the cautionary notes set forth in today's press release as well as the risk factors set forth in aspira's annual report filed with the sec for a description of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements. at this time, i'd like to turn the call over to valerie palmieri, president, and chief executive officer.
valerie?
valerie palmieri -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, operator. good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. this afternoon, we will review our second quarter accomplishments, financial performance, as well as provide an update on our overall strategic developments. our end in mind is to truly transform women's health, starting with ovarian cancer.
our goal is to eradicate late-stage detection of ovarian cancer and ensure all our solutions will meet the needs of women for all ages, races, ethnicities and stages of disease. we seek to develop a lifelong relationship with each patient from puberty to cure, ensuring each woman has access to the best-in-class diagnostics. let me begin with a review of our core business. we are pleased to announce the growth of our revenue and volume despite covid-19 restrictions.
we reported second quarter ova1 only revenue of $1.72 million, an increase of 136% over prior year and 21% sequentially. our ova1 product volume was 4,553 tests, which is up 85% compared to the same period last year and up 21% sequentially as well. this impressive outcome was driven primarily by growth of our customer base, where strong commercial execution was bolstered by increased access to our physician customers as well as a reflection of the initiation of our sales force expansion in q2. regarding our decentralized platform aspira synergy, we are making progress, and the interest level is very high as we have several deals in the pipeline, more to come on this front.
i will now provide an update on a number of strategic developments regarding our pipeline, payer and evidence development, government affairs, and the additions to our senior leadership team. before i move on to the pipeline, we have a significant paper that was just published this week, and we'd like to discuss upfront. the paper titled salvaging detection of early stage ovarian cancer malignancies when ca125 is not informative has been published in a special ovarian cancer edition of diagnostics. it is a 2,300 patient retrospective study to evaluate the performance of ova1 in a cohort of patients with low-risk serum ca125 values.
this study demonstrates the ability of ova1 to identify early stage disease, while ca125 reflected 0% sensitivity due to the low-risk cutoff. this paper further validates and supports the superior early stage detection of ovarian cancer with ova1 versus the current standard of care in a large population. dr. ratner will be discussing this in detail later in the call.
now starting with our pipeline, i will review our endocheck breakthrough device program application. we continue to have a positive dialogue with the fda regarding our planned endocheck product. in addition, we are very pleased to announce that we have signed a specimen collaboration agreement with our second pharmaceutical company, abbvie. abbvie is pursuing new treatments for endometriosis pain.
we believe the specimen collaboration will advance our overall endometriosis research. having two pharma companies contribute specimens, demonstrates the critical need for a diagnostic. this collaboration between abbvie and aspira represents a mutual dedication to create solutions to help the six million to seven million women suffering with endometriosis by radically improving the time to diagnosis as today, it may take seven to nine years for a diagnosis. endocheck will allow patients to be treated appropriately and effectively without the need for an unnecessary surgery.
we are in very productive communications with the fda regarding our breakthrough device program application. importantly, the fda has acknowledged that there are many compelling reasons why this type of device is needed for both the treating physicians and for patients. the fda has indicated they are very interested in continuing to work with aspira on endocheck, and aspira will be continuing our discussions with the agency on breakthrough device designation. i am now moving on to our second pipeline update regarding our ovainherit product and collaboration with dana-farber cancer institute, harvard.
we are making very positive progress on our product collaboration with dana-farber cancer insitute, which we disclosed in the first quarter. we expect to have data at the end of third quarter. dr. northrop will discuss this further in her section.
regarding our payer and evidence development, we have three major updates. no. 1, first is the coverage of ova1 in the aim specialty health laboratory medicine clinical guidelines. ova1 is now considered medically necessary according to the aim specialty health clinical appropriateness guidelines.
notably, they have not included a competitive product called roma in their guidelines and consider investigational and experimental. aim is a member of the anthem blue cross blue shield family of companies, which promotes optimal care through the use of evidence-based clinical guidelines and real-time decision support for both providers and their patients. aim is a wholly owned subsidiary of anthem, serving more than 50 million members across 50 states, including dc and u.s. territories.
this represents an opportunity for an incremental $50 million increase to our total covered lives. we have commenced a targeted program to obtain contractual coverage with all of the aim member plans. moving on to no. 2.
we also recently obtained coverage determinations from highmark, delaware as well as fidelis, new york, with contracts pending for both. in addition, we continue to gain traction with medicaid and are now being paid by california medicaid. our payer adoption strategy is making significant progress, and we believe inclusion in the aim and evicore guidelines gives us further validation and credibility in our discussions with all health plans. moving on to no.
3. on the evidence development front, we released our first analytical and initial clinical validation performance for ovasight at asco 2021. ovasight is a third-generation ova technology and is a laboratory-developed, blood-based pelvic mass risk assessment test for ovarian cancer in a low prevalence population. it was developed to increase specificity while maintaining high sensitivity with early stage and allow for conservative management of women with a suspected benign mass who are not recommended for surgery.
a total of 596 patients were tested from real-world patients to validate the ovasight diagnostic algorithm. validation data demonstrated 91% sensitivity, 89% specificity, and a negative predictive value of 99.6%, and a low prevalence population of 3.8%. in addition, clinical sensitivity for all stages of disease and more importantly, early stage sensitivity was significantly better than ca125 as well. i am now moving on to the government affairs front.
we are continuing to gain momentum post our congressional briefing. the company is actively engaged with congress in several advocacy organizations, including healthy women, the national ovarian cancer coalition and the ovarian cancer research alliance and an effort to increase awareness about ova1, ovarian cancer and encourage legislation that provides financial support for additional trials. this also includes starting the discussions on the trial requirements for adding the company's ovarian cancer technology into guidelines, such as the u.s. preventative services task force, which would support the company's objective to launch a product that is more broadly applicable as a screening tool.
the company will also be presenting to a congressional committee in september focused on women's healthcare access issues. in addition, the company is also working on the medicare innovation technology initiative to ensure coverage and reimbursement immediately following breakthrough approval for any of its products. and lastly, we have made significant addition to our leadership team. laura mcpadden joined the company as head of people and culture.
people are the core of our innovation and growth engine. laura joins us with over 25 years experience, leading human resources and talent engines and providing strategic guidance for employee relations, performance management, talent acquisition, and organizational design. before i turn the call over to kaile to provide a commercial update, we are reaffirming the investment in sales and marketing and our investment in our pipeline. our target launch date of ovasight is on track for a fourth quarter of 2021 launch.
this test initially will allow physicians to assess benign pelvic masses, not recommended for surgery with much better performing technology versus ca125. while our next revision of this technology will allow a mass to be monitored over time. this new test will leverage its high negative predictive value to assist in rule out, as well as its high ppv to assess risk of malignancy. in summary, we continue to work toward our overall strategic goal, which was to emerge from the pandemic stronger, and we believe we will continue to accomplish this, irrespective of any resurgence in the covid pandemic.
we have had a faster than expected recovery with a limited sales force coming into q2 as well. our team is now stronger on all fronts with a solid financial position, plus improved price appreciation year-over-year, and our development pipeline has matured with our third-generation product expected to launch in q4 2021. we are well positioned to invest, to grow and to drive adoption, and most importantly, save lives. i would now like to turn the call over to kaile zager, our chief operating officer.
kaile? 
kaile zagger -- chief operating officer
thank you, valerie. as valerie mentioned, we are pleased with our revenue and volume progress in the second quarter. i will now provide an update on our overall commercial progress. we are continuing to execute on our overall commercial strategy with meaningful additions of talent based on the complexities of the patient's journey through the health ecosystem, coupled with the convoluted presentation of ovarian cancer.
we have expanded and are deploying across our three direct sales channels. in support of these three verticals, we have invested additionally in critical support functions that will allow for rapid acceleration and adoption of our products into the clinical care pathway. those supporting functions are commercial activation, enterprise integration solutions, and business analytics. we have aligned our strategies with the consolidation of the health systems and providers and the transition to the digital health in preparation for our much-anticipated launch of ovasight.
we are now also very focused on the establishment and development of our marketing and customer experience organization. we are thrilled to welcome an acclaimed marketing executive, jennifer van aken to the organization to build and lead our marketing organization. jennifer comes to us with deep cpg, healthcare, and private equity marketing experience, and in under just two months, have made significant strategic progress, commercial achievements, and key talent acquisitions within the organization. starting with our core vertical.
it had strong performance in q2 with our three key metrics outperforming historic performance of the company. the team delivered unprecedented record volume and total customers. the total number of ordering physicians in the second quarter was 2,951, an increase of 65% over prior year and 14% sequentially. our new customers were up 69% compared to the same period last year and up 7% sequentially.
q2 was the strongest quarter the company had seen across all drivers, accessions, revenue, and ordering physicians. regarding our health systems team, which we originated in march of this year, we have scaled it to six sales representatives as of july, and they are establishing a deep funnel of health systems that we are actively working with to transition the standard of care and by directionally integrate our solutions into the electronic system, which should allow for the ease of ordering and standard of care adoption across the network. we expect to be able to announce wins in this area in the third quarter. and lastly, our specialty force focused on our decentralized platform aspira synergy, has executed a second agreement since product launch in q1.
this agreement will be announced shortly. in addition, we are in final stages of approval with the third agreement which is one of the largest health networks in the united states. we believe that arrangements like this will form the fundamental building blocks to truly change the standard of care. finally, the fundamental key to our strategy is the commercial activation activities that are fueling our sales force support functions, namely marketing, business analytics, commercial activation, and the insourcing of enterprise implementation and solutions team.
i will now review high-level achievement of each of these teams. first, our marketing function has implemented a myriad of new commercial strategies, including the launch of multiple programs that reached over 300 new physicians in seven weeks, double the span of our digital and social media reach, and developed cutting-edge campaigns that penetrate the medicaid and medicare market adoption, resulting in four large new ordering physicians with practices focused on medicaid. we believe increasing awareness around ovarian cancer, signs, and symptoms and the fact we have strong differentiators for early detection, specific ethnicities and insurance coverage are all critical factors in driving adoption at the provider and patient awareness level. visits to our website have more than doubled from a year ago and followers on aspira's major social media platforms have increased year-to-date by double digits.
in addition, we were present at acog and sgo held virtually in 2021, and we presented our ovaight abstract at asco in june, which will be further discussed by dr. northrop later in the call. our enterprise implementation and solutions team have rapidly expanded and is comprised of highly talented system engineers and industry experts in the digital informatics space. this team is working closely with our core synergy and health system verticals to build bidirectional integration interfaces to ensure we are well positioned to displace the standard of care and move the market toward a better solution for early detection of ovarian cancer.
in summary, we have invested in our growth strategy by constructing deployment models, formulating very strong go-to-market positioning, and are now well positioned to capitalize on acceleration and adoption. we have increased the size of our growth organization by 75% since january of this year and continue to scale in preparation for the ovasight launch in q4. specifically regarding sales, we started the year with 15 sales representatives in our core verticals, and we now have 35 sales representatives across three sales verticals. within these verticals, the majority of the representatives to name 20 of them were hired in the last three months.
we truly believe we are positioned to accelerate adoption across the healthcare continuum while driving growth and delivering a stellar customer experience. we have an innovative portfolio of products that solve for an unmet need for a large population of women. and we are now prepared to mobilize and change the standard of care. i would now like to hand the call over to dr.
elena ratner to provide an update on our momentum to becoming the standard of care and driving awareness of our technology and its impact on early stage risk detection of ovarian cancer specifically.
elena ratner -- global chief medical advisor
thank you, kailie. as a position, education, awareness, and adoption are key to changing the standard of care. we have had several milestones in this quarter. we continue our utmost commitment to provide awareness and education.
we have hosted multiple successful, highly attended dinner educational series and are currently launching gyn and gyn oncology advisory board directed at better management of total masses and improvement of ovarian cancer early detection. regarding clinical studies under my leadership, we are continuing to recruit more academic sites to support both the clinical validity and utility of our tests. we have also launched our physician-initiated research program for healthcare systems. this program provides nominal funding for projects that help fuel clinical implementation and adoption of ovarian cancer risk assessment tool and allows us to continue to expand our data repository.
i'm incredibly excited about the direction our clinical studies have taken, and we are continuously building our study program to strengthen the data around our products. and lastly, i would like to report a major update on a significant paper, which was accepted and published as of august 10th. it is an evaluation of the performance of ova1 in a cohort of patients with normal serum c125 values that was accepted to the special ovarian cancer addition of diagnostics. under a revised title, salvaging detection of early stage ovarian malignancies when c125 is not informative.
in this publication, we analyzed 2,300 patient data from previous collections with a prevalence of 4.5%, where c125 levels were in the normal range, depending on the age of the patient, which is less than 67 units per milliliter for pre-menopausal women and less than 35 units per milliliter for post-menopausal women. of most importance, we demonstrated that in those women's ova1 detected over 50% of variant malignancies in pre-menopausal women that c125 would have missed. ova1 also correctly identified 63% of early stage cancers missed by c125. as a stand-alone test, c125 misses more than 50% of ovarian malignancies that can be detected by ova1 in both early stage cancers and pre-menopausal women, which have a much better long-term survival if detected early.
speaking of the clinician, who constantly loses women ovarian cancer that is diagnosed at advanced stage, finding and treating the cancers early will change the paradigm of this disease. i would now like to hand over the call to dr. northrop to provide an update on our innovation pipeline.
lesley northrop -- chief scientific officer
thank you, dr. ratner. i would like to provide an update on our overall innovation pipeline. we continue to build out and support our current products with publications focused on clinical validity and utility of our current product, ova1 plus.
more specifically, we have two recently accepted publications, one which dr. ratner just discussed and the second which is an update on our ova1 plus technology. the paper was accepted to the international journal of biological markers titled: "" a two-step multivariate index assay improves the accuracy of ovarian cancer risk assessment for women with adnexal mass. it is expected to be published at a future date.
this paper highlights an orthogonal laboratory reflex called ova1 plus that benefits patients who are not readily stratified as lower high-risk using ova1 alone and classify as intermediate. the overa is employed in these cases and allows for a higher specificity. this study was validated in over 1,000 prospectively collected retrospectively analyzed serum sample data set in a prevalence of 22% and further verified using an independent data set of 207 with a prevalence of 40%. 35% of the samples were defined as intermediate risk by ova1 test and reflex to overa, which eliminate 58% of the false positive and improved the overall specificity to 72%.
overa reflex testing of samples, which have an ova1 intermediate risk score decreases the false positive rate, thereby reducing the number of unnecessary surgical referrals without notable reduction in clinical sensitivity. we expect that we will have more publications to announce in the coming quarters. i would now like to provide an update on our upcoming products and enhancements. first, let me reiterate my optimism for endocheck.
as valerie mentioned, we are having a productive dialogue with the fda. while we cannot disclose our sensitivity and specificity of the test performance, while fda discussions are ongoing, we are pleased with our data relative to the current standard of care, laparoscopic surgical assessment. we are working on updating our submission to the fda based on their guidance, meet breakthrough designation doing endometriosis is in an irreversible debilitating disease. we are also excited to boost our specimen bank of endometriosis cases as diagnosed by laparoscopic surgical assessment, with the collaboration agreement we just announced with abbvie as it will assist in our future refinement of the endocheck product.
i would now like to provide updates on ovasight. we continue to be on track for our accelerated launch of ovasight this fall. the analytical and initial clinical validation of ovasight performance metrics was presented in an asco poster presentation on june 4th this year. the accepted abstract presents data demonstrating the initial clinical and analytical validity of aspira's ovasight, blood-based biomarker test for ovarian malignancy risk assessment in all women with an adnexal mass.
samples collected from real-world evidence studies with a low prevalence of cancer, 3.8%, were used to validate the algorithm. this third-generation technology, which is a laboratory developed test, will provide clinicians with a high negative predictive value to provide confidence in planning a suspected benign mass monitoring plan as well as a greater positive predictive value to increase confidence in risk of malignancy and next steps in clinical management. the product is expected to be available in q4 of 2021. in addition, a peer-reviewed publication on both the analytical and clinical validation findings are scheduled for q4 of 2021.
i would like to now give an update on ovainherit. we are working on building a robust recruiting program in high-risk populations, such as family history personal history, and/or germline carriers of highly prevalent hereditary breast and ovarian cancer genes as well as diverse populations across racial ethnicities to increase our study cohort to support the ovainherit test design. our proof-of-concept study with dana farber cancer institute in harvard is progressing nicely, and we expect to have preliminary data at the end of q3 2021. the goal is to combine our high sensitivity performance as reported with ovasight with a high specificity by detecting micro rna and serum to provide a multi-omics approach that can help eradicate late-stage ovarian cancer detection.
multi-omic technology will allow us the opportunity to develop the diagnostics and eventually screening technology that we desperately need to increase a woman's survival rate when faced with an earlier diagnosis of ovarian cancer. now moving on to clinical studies. one of our primary efforts in innovation in these past two quarters is to enhance our clinical studies and enrollment despite covid-19 restrictions. we are continuing to recruit larger academic institutions in clinical practices to allow us to collect from a comprehensive cohort of women across all races and ethnicities and continue to enhance our product development pipeline.
we continue to develop data metrics for these large academic institutions through our clinical studies as well as already established technologies validated for the detection of ovarian cancer. in summary, with our product pipeline, you will begin to see we're building a lifetime relationship with the patient. this is our ova360 approach in providing a circular loop of products to better women's health. we are developing products that can start as early as menses with endocheck allow early detection risk of hereditary cancer with genetic hereditary cancer testing, monitoring of high-risk women with ovainherit and until later in life, in a population of a background risk of 1.3% for ovarian cancer with no heritable detection, ova1 plus and ovasight.
and we look into the future in developing residual risk assessments as well as reoccurrence monitoring and eventually therapeutic clinical diagnostic testing. innovation is the core of our strategy. our goal is to invest and accelerate our evidence development and pipeline and surround it with strong ip as we maximize shareholder value. i will now turn it over to bob for an update on our financials.
bob beechey -- chief financial officer
thank you, dr. northrop. we reported second quarter ova1 revenue of $1.72 million, an increase of 136% over prior year and 21% sequentially. the 136% product revenue increase is primarily due to the lower number of tests performed in 2020 due to covid-19, as well as an increase in ova1 average revenue per test in 2021 compared to the prior year.
the revenue per ova1 plus tests performed increased to approximately $377 compared to $375 for the first quarter. the year-on-year price increase was 28% compared to the prior year second quarter of $295. this increase was primarily driven by an increase in payments by contracted payers and improved collections. while we have made progress with payers in the second quarter, we take a conservative approach to revenue recognition and do not recognize the revenue until we establish a track record of payments received.
gross profit margin of ova1 plus was 52% in the second quarter compared to 54% in the first quarter of 2021. the decrease was primarily driven by nonrecurring costs associated with the switch in our kit assembly vendor, which will result in a lower cost per unit in the future. gross profit margin on ova1 plus increased from 37% to 52% compared to the second quarter of 2020 as we leverage our fixed costs with the increased volume. research and development expenses for the three months ended june 30, 2021, were $1.47 million, an increase of $599,000 or 69% compared to the first quarter of 2021.
this increase was primarily due to clinical utility and product development costs related to ovasight, our third-generation product, as well as investments in bioinformatics, aspira synergy, and consulting expenses associated with endocheck regulatory clearance. the second quarter spend represents an increase of approximately $1 million compared to the second quarter 2020 spend as we've made investments in personnel, focused primarily on ovasight and endocheck. sales and marketing expenses were $4 million for the three months ended june 30, 2021, an increase of approximately $900,000 or 29% compared to the first quarter of 2021. the increase was primarily due to increased personnel and consulting costs as we execute upon the commercial strategy previously discussed.
the prior year sales and marketing expense of $1.7 million was depressed due to lower travel and entertainment and commissions and did not reflect the current investments we are making in market awareness and the sales team additions. general and administrative expenses were $3.3 million for the three months ended june 30, 2021, an increase of approximately $793,000 or 32% compared to the first quarter of 2021. the increase was primarily due to an increase in headcount and personnel expenses as well as stock compensation expenses. we incurred $1.9 million in general administrative expenses in the prior year quarter.
we ended the second quarter with approximately $53 million in cash. cash used in operations in the second quarter of 2021 were $6.4 million compared to the first quarter of 2021 of $5.2 million. the increase was driven by investments in the sales team, marketing and promotional activities as well as research and development spending focused on endocheck. i will now turn the call back over to valerie.
valerie palmieri -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, bob. before we open up the call for q&a, let me restate our optimism for building the company for sustainable growth for the near term and the long term. in parallel, we are executing on our larger mission to serve the 20 million women in the u.s., starting with ovarian cancer risk assessment, pelvic mass monitoring and eventually tackling the largest disease endometriosis. keep in mind our hereditary ovarian cancer monitoring test, ovainherit, will be incremental to this market, and this product will be for women with and without a mass.
ovarian cancer accounts for more deaths than any other cancer of the female reproductive system and is the only gender-specific cancer with greater than a 50% mortality rate. our work in products are at the forefront of changing the standards of care and detection of ovarian malignancies. we believe we are helping close the gap in detection and, more importantly, survival for women. in the near term, we believe ova1 plus with our diversity differentiation and genetics will become the standard of care in pelvic mass risk assessment for ovarian cancer, and we are now moving forward with the launch of our third-generation ovasight technology for benign mass management in q4 2021.
for the longer term, we are moving forward with our planned launch of endocheck for endometriosis; and lastly, ovainherit for high-risk genetic predisposition monitoring. our end in mind is the incorporation of proteins, genes, and other modalities to detect gynecologic disease, which cannot be detected via traditional biopsy. in time, our goal is to become the liquid biopsy standard for these diseases, inclusive of all ages, stages, and most of all, all ethnicities. with our enhanced team, strengthened financial position, and our robust portfolio, we could not be more confident across the business.
it is now time that all women of every race and ethnicity receive the best care possible, and we are proud and excited to help make that happen. we are now happy to open up the call for q&a and answer any of your questions. operator?
",":
operator
[operator instructions] and our first question is from brian weinstein with william blair. please proceed with your question.
brian weinstein -- william blair & company-- analyst
you guys certainly have a lot going on. and so trying to come up with a couple of questions that are targeted. but on ovasight, obviously, the q4 launch is great. can you talk a little bit about how you're preparing the organization for that? i think i heard something about a digital health program there.
can you talk about what that is? and then also as it relates to ovasight, how should we be thinking about price point here? i think you had made some comments about that previously, but just wanted to confirm the price point there and your plan for payer outreach on that product?
valerie palmieri -- president and chief executive officer
sure. thank you for the question. so i'll start, and then i'm going to let kaile chime in. so with ovasight, because the market size for ovasight is three times that of ova, so we are launching ovasight in all of our verticals in terms of the gyns as well as the hospital market in the future, it will also be a synergy product as well.
so our go-to-market with this -- and we're also -- i want to say, with this covid environment, we have gone with a parallel path, both with accessing the physicians, which is actually going fairly well, and also, what i want to say is a virtual approach as well. so it's a twofold approach. but i -- but we're really pleased about the progress. we have brought in some, i want to say, outside consultants from a creative standpoint to really help us launch this from a continuing medical education to ensure the reps have the right information in their tool belt to also, i want to say, doctor to doctor because this is really, we believe, the answer the doctors have been looking for in terms of how they have been wanting to use ova.
but i'm going to have kaile go into details in terms of the physical launch and how we are readying the sales team.
kaile zagger -- chief operating officer
so i'll go into a little bit of the commercial design of what we've constructed in preparation for the ova site launch. we have -- as we mentioned, we've increased our commercial organization, the sales book specifically by 75% since january. and this is really to address the fact that ovasight is going to tackle the entire continuum of the patient with pelvic masses. so one in five women will have a pelvic mass in their lifetime.
and we now have a solution to address the beginning of those pelvic masses when they might be benign and not scheduled for surgery, all the way to the most complex. as valerie mentioned, the total addressable market goes up significantly when we're looking at all of those pelvic masses. and in order to make sure that we have the proper footprint commercially, we have -- we're really focused on putting salespeople where it matches the icd10 diagnosis. so we've studied exactly where those high-volume of pelvic masses exist.
we have been very focused on placing sales reps in those specific geographies. and then to couple on top of that, we are hard at work on a digital strategy to ensure proper education of not only the providers, but the patients on pelvic mass awareness in those respective areas. so we've got very targeted campaigns and approaches, whether it's through web or social or web search and google to ensure that we've got proper education that we're effectively priming the market before launch. i hope that answers your question, but i'm happy to take any further.
brian weinstein -- william blair & company-- analyst
no. that's great. and then just on the payer outreach side there for ovasight. how will -- how will you guys be working with payers here to generate adoption?
kaile zagger -- chief operating officer
sure. so ova1 is really grease to skids with payers, brian. so as we just received the aim guidelines, it opens up the door for ova watch or ovasight in a big way. so we're starting with a pma code.
we are -- we basically have applied for a pma code, and then we will also be applying for medicare coverage and going down that road in parallel with the launch. in addition, we already have started our prospective study for clinical utility. so we've got the, i want to say, the irb in process as well as we really want to do things in parallel fast so that we can get reimbursement as quickly as possible. so i think ova is really grease to skids.
we're already priming the pump and getting the, i would say, renegotiations on the contracts where we have contracts, the inclusion of ovasight into those contracts. and as we brought on board, greg richard from a managed markets perspective, we are adding resources because between the aim and now ovasight, we really have quite a bit of work on the managed care side.
brian weinstein -- william blair & company-- analyst
great. and then on the synergy side, i'm just curious kind of what constitutes a large account? i mean, how do you guys bifurcate that market to figure out what's an appropriate synergy accountant? can you remind us on the economics for you guys there versus having these tests run in your own lab? and then i guess that's it on the synergy stuff, and then i'll have one more after that.
valerie palmieri -- president and chief executive officer
sure. so let me start. in terms of the size of the account in terms of customer segmentation, what we really are looking at is 100-plus physicians being a very large health network. and these health networks is not just gyn focused.
there's some health networks that are actually primary care and gyn. so we are looking at 100-plus physician health networks. we've closed one, which we are actively implementing right now. and we have -- we're very close on several others.
we were hoping actually for them to hit this call, but we're close on several others, but it's really 100 plus. i will also point out on the genetics side, there is also interest at a laboratory level. so there's laboratories that are sending out their hboc testing to, let's just say, a common hboc provider, and they have the ability now to run it in-house. and then the second part of your question was the economics.
so the economics are, for us, is really depending on ova or genetics. it is going to be at very high margins. so the total price, of course, is lower than us doing the ova ourselves. but in terms of margins, it has high contribution.
and i think more importantly, its going to be the fact that these, especially on the ca125 side as well as the genetic side, it is a revenue opportunity for the customers, and it gives us access to the identified data. that's absolutely critical that we are getting data access is important for our algorithm development at the genetics level as well as at the protein level, and this will truly be a software as a service model.
brian weinstein -- william blair & company-- analyst
great. and then last one for me is endocheck. so can you just talk about the importance of the additional set of samples that you're getting? are they different in any way than the samples that you were getting from your first partner in terms of makeup of the individual that is -- where the samples are coming from? or is it just getting even more samples? and what is the kind of importance of getting these additional samples? were you not getting enough kind of with your first partner? or is there something broader here in terms of a potential longer-term relationship that you're trying to signal?
valerie palmieri -- president and chief executive officer
yes. no, it's a really good question. so these samples are from a second partner, abbvie. abbvie is trying to build a drug to compete, of course, with [indiscernible] with better safety profile.
and these samples are actually a different specimen type. they are plasma versus serum. and this does allow us to expand things from an analyte perspective as well as it is a more of a global population. so we're very -- we're really, really pleased about it.
and i would say also, in terms of abbvie being a public company, you will see that actually they have actually canceled their trial in the u.s. because they were not able to recruit patients into their trial because the patients with endo are not having surgery. so they truly need a diagnostic to complement that. so there is a high level of dialogue with this company and having two separate banks from two separate companies has truly been game-changing for us and really helps just bolster our overall endometriosis research.
brian weinstein -- william blair & company-- analyst
ok. thanks for the answers.
operator
[operator instructions] our next question is from charles duncan from cantor. please proceed with your question.
charles duncan -- cantor fitzgerald -- analyst
ok. thanks valerie and team. congratuations on a good quarter of progress. thanks for taking my questions.
i had a couple of questions. first, on the commercial side for ova1. i guess you have very good test volumes, seems like nice sequential growth. when you think about how the tone of business is going into the third quarter, how do you feel about that growth, sequential growth? and then into the second half of the year, particularly with the delta variant, i think you mentioned increased access for physician access.
and i guess i'm wondering how you feel the dynamics of the covid pandemic could impact growth going forward?
valerie palmieri -- president and chief executive officer
sure. well, thank you charles for the question. so let me start, and i'm going to have kaile actually jump in. so we came out of q2 in the 4,500 range and really pleased.
and by the way, majority of our sales team members did not join until the back half of that. so we were really pleased with the q2 performance coming in q1 with 15 and taking up to 35. so going into q3, each one of these reps really is going to have their first quarter of performance. so we have a larger footprint, no.
1. no. 2, our patients that are not being screened. so there's a sense of urgency.
they have a mass whether it's benign, they're still very worried, right? so they need to go to the doctor. so we are seeing, i would say, in q3, we're seeing somewhat of a dip in a sense, but i don't think it's anywhere in terms of, just say, companies that are doing screening products. and we saw this during covid. so the nice part is that during this process, we sort of are looking back at phase 1 of covid and saying, ok, what were the lessons learned? and one of the lessons that we had learned was that our technology actually was helping doctors bring patients to the or when they're high risk and helping doctors manage patients that were low risk to actually say to them, look, we're going to do surgery, but we're going to wait 30, 60, 90 days.
so that same playbook is moving forward. but i would also say another piece of this is just the virtual element of this. we really have just everyone keeps on track of the news, although i saw some good data in the u.k. where delta has surged and then actually decreased.
but i would say that we are preparing a plan a and a plan b. we're prepared with our larger footprint to not only get the access, but also we have a very well-integrated virtual program that i'll have kaile go into in detail. kaile?
charles duncan -- cantor fitzgerald -- analyst
ok. great. thank you.
kaile zagger -- chief operating officer
thank you valerie. so to reemphasize valerie's point, 20 of the 35 sales representatives that have joined the company joined in q2. so most of them are out of training, and we expect somewhat of a lag effect through training, but that productivity will start to demonstrate itself toward the end of q3. so right now, i am not concerned about the july and august numbers.
we absolutely are preparing and expecting september to be a strong month. but to valerie's point, we are thinking very strong about the delta variant and what we need to do with lessons learned from the first phase of covid, and we are hard at work at redefining the commercial go-to-market with a bifurcated approach that incorporates innovative virtual approaches to ensure we continue to increase our penetration with new physicians and awareness with women. so to do that, we're deploying four new channels, and we expect to do this -- we've done some of this already, but we expect to continue and formalize in the next few weeks. one, we've rigorously focused on a digital marketing strategy.
a segmented approach around lots of different markets and has heavily invested in ensuring that we are educating through every digital channel that we can, and we've seen incredible uptick in this to the tune of double the amount of volume to the websites and close to those numbers on our social media. no. 2, we have put together a virtual commercial toolkit, our marketing team is hard at work constructing this. this is a toolkit that has six pillars that will allow our force to continue with their strategic plans virtually and effectively if necessary.
no. 3, we've invested very strongly in our physician-to-physician platform. so before we've had a modest number of physicians on staff, we've rapidly increased that number. and instead of relying just on our commercial organization to be out in the field and creating new physician relationships, we are now bifurcating that approach with physicians that are speaking directly to physicians on our behalf and creating a call to action around ovarian cancer and early detection.
and we've seen a lot of success in those peer-to-peer discussions. no. 4, we are actively involved -- as an executive leadership level within the company, looking at strategic partnerships with other organizations -- and this is an atypical approach in that. we're not looking at typical business-to-business relationships that with further research and development, etc.
we are looking at creating strong alignment with organizations that have the type of physicians that we want to access on their board of directors involved in their cause and a large base of patients that either care about the disease with ovarian cancer and want to help make an impact. and we have had very successful conversations in the past six weeks, and we're expecting to formalize some very important strategic partnerships that will work as a very strong adjunct to the commercial organization as we anticipate moving modestly to virtual. i hope that gives you enough granularity.
charles duncan -- cantor fitzgerald -- analyst
yes, definitely provides a lot of good information. i guess just a follow-up. it sounds like fully increased size sales force full productivity in the -- and call it, the fourth quarter and then beyond, do you focus on new prescribers or new users more so than within a prescriber's practice? or how would you define success going forward? because i think kaile mentioned 14% increase sequentially in terms of prescribers. and i guess, what would you like to see that?
kaile zagger -- chief operating officer
so it's actually a great question, very timely for what we're looking at right now. so new physicians have always been a very strong metric within the organization, and we continue to be very, very focused on that. however, and simultaneously, we are also very, very focused on customer retention. and we have seen this be something that we want to work on going forward.
and i'm very happy to tell you that in the second quarter, we've seen some incredible numbers with retention come up and stickiness within customers be created. but this is just the beginning of what i think you can expect to see from us. we're very focused on building a customer experience division and translating our -- what now is the customer service division into more of an experience and doing some work to retain and increase our footprint within the physician practices that we have worked so hard to get on board and looking at expansion plans, land and expand plans inside of those practices. but the big focus that we have right now is on ensuring we understand where retention problems might exist, how to rapidly fix those, address them, bring them back into the fold, and continue to move down this road with them.
so i expect to see the new position percentage continue to increase, but that continues to be our big focus. but simultaneously, you will see our inside sales force and our customer experience team, work to increase our customer retention, create a wonderful customer experience and create stickiness within our important customers.
valerie palmieri -- president and chief executive officer
yes. just to piggyback on that, charles, it's also within a customer, we want to get -- so if a practice has 10 physicians, we want to land all 10 and keep all 10. so i want to make sure you understand that piece, too. so it's usually the friendly or the first physician that starts, but then it's going through that whole practice.
extremely important to -- as we close these large practices that are 100-plus physicians. so it's getting that 80-20 from those practices, and that's a different cell process, as you know, but it's that continuity and that maintenance is also very important. and as kaile pointed out, with the inside sales force, and once that we have some service reps in certain territories, but it's really, i want to say, a multi front approach as we build the products within that customer and also the retention within that customer.
charles duncan -- cantor fitzgerald -- analyst
you feel like you're at sufficient capacity now? or would you anticipate in the next, call it, 12 to 18 months some additional hires in the sales force?
valerie palmieri -- president and chief executive officer
well, i think with endocheck, that market is 20 times over. that's going to take us to a whole another hemisphere. so right now, we're at about 35. we'll probably go up to about 40, whole tight through ovasight.
this is really prep for ovasight. so we can really get that market being adopted. but with endocheck, there will be growth in the sales force as well as, i would say, strategic partnerships as well in parallel because of the size of the market.
charles duncan -- cantor fitzgerald -- analyst
can i ask you one last question since you brought up endocheck and i know you're not going to be able to be all that disclosive given discussions with the agency, but you mentioned sensitivity and specificity and pleased that you will exceed that of endoscopy, surgical assessment. but i guess, beyond just talking about certain numbers, i'm wondering how you would see a clinically meaningful improvement. it seems like your endocheck is much more convenient or fast all than endoscopy. so do you need a big change in terms of sensitivity or specificity to be clinically valuable or even a small change would be compelling? and then i know this one is really difficult.
but with regard to timing of those fda discussions, can you provide any color?
valerie palmieri -- president and chief executive officer
sure. so let me just walk you through. it's not a complicated answer, but this is on multi fronts endocheck will make a difference. i'm just going to walk through pain, delay in treatment in the major -- just the care pathway, to start with pain, what endocheck will provide is immediate disease detection, right? so a patient may try ocps or nsags, motrin, etc., but it will basically supply immediate detection because of the high sensitivity and specificity, and that will allow medical therapy immediately.
and we believe, potentially avoid surgical intervention, but it avoids this trial and era of medical management. the second is, right now, endometriosis takes seven to nine years based on the latest data. and so what we will do is eliminate that delay in diagnosis, really hault the disease progression if the therapy is put in place and improve the quality of life by reducing time to treatment. the other piece is exploratory surgical intervention.
we can avoid surgery that's unnecessary, right? only perform at if it's clinically warranted. and i would say the last piece is really when the gnrh antagonist is actually therapeutically administered, this will prevent the delay, of course, in treatment. prevent the delay in major disease progression. and again, i think, in summary, some major improvement in quality of life because right now, the current process is not in the best interest of the patient, and that is very important to the fda.
i will also say with the fda, we're going up against mostly, i'd say, oncology changes, so oncology diagnostics and oncology breakthrough. what we are doing here is really novel in that we are taking about nine disease, and really, i would say, there's an education process, but putting it right out in the open. and it's not only us presenting to the fda. it was experts on all different facets.
but having them truly understand that it is a irreversibly debilitating disease so i would say the conversations, charles, have gone very well. the fact that we are in dialogue and it's breakthrough because they're giving you advice as you're building your, i want to say, your protocol and recognizing that this is uncharted territory and there's no predicate device. so they're really working with you. so the fact that they see there is a problem, the fact that they see that we've gotten a lot of great feedback, i do believe that there is a partnership here.
so things are going well.

at this time, i would like to turn the call over to valerie palmieri, president and chief executive officer. valerie?
valerie palmieri -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, operator. good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. this morning, we will review our third quarter 2021 accomplishments, financial performance, as well as provide an update on our core strategic developments. our end in mind is to truly transform women's health, starting with ovarian cancer.
our goal is to eradicate late-stage detection of ovarian cancer and ensure our solutions will meet the needs of women for all ages, races, ethnicities and stages of disease. we seek to develop a lifelong relationship with each patient from puberty to cure, ensuring each woman has access to the best-in-class diagnostics. this morning, i'd like to make comments on our core operations, provide an update on our pipeline, as well as an update on managed care progress and our government affairs initiative. first, i would like to address a recent departure from our board, dr.
sandra brooks. dr. brooks has resigned due to family reasons, which limits her time and availability. we wish dr.
brooks well as she deals with the family's situation. and thank her for the many insights and support she has provided our team. i am now going to begin with a review of our core business. we are reporting third quarter ova1 plus revenue of $1.6 million, an increase of 33% over the same period in 2020, and 6% decline sequentially from the second quarter of 2021.
this is a result of significant covid-related access restriction in july and august 2021 in key markets. our ova1 plus product volume was 4,281 tests, which represented in 90 -- an increase of 19% compared to the same period in 2020 and a 6% decrease sequentially compared to the second quarter of 2021. we believe our 2021 q3 product volume was significantly impacted by restricted access and customer office closures in the summer timeframe, and specifically in high-volume areas such as michigan, florida, new york and kentucky. in these areas, our team had an 18% reduction in volume and a 19% reduction in physician events as a result of covid.
in terms of covid access, we categorize each sales territory relative to access restrictions with a green, yellow and red designation. this represents over 90% access for green, between 55% to 75% access for yellow and under 50% access for red respectively. at the end of the third quarter, the green territories represented only 13% access, yellow was 66% access and red was 20% access overall. the total number of ordering physicians in the third quarter of 2021 was 2,914 an increase of 20% compared to the same period in the prior year, and essentially flat sequentially from q2 2021.
the total number of new physicians in the third quarter of 2021 was 444, an increase of 13% over the same period in the prior year and up slightly sequentially from q2 2021 or 1.6%. both total and new customers in q3 2021 were impacted due to decreased access due to covid. volumes are starting to pick up and are trending higher in september and october, with a volume on a units-per-day basis of 63.2 in july, 66 in august, 71.6% in september and 81.1 in october. we believe this recent growth is a combination of our commercial investment as well as increased patient visits.
for october, we also had a record number of new physicians of 214. as we have previously shared one of our strategic objectives is to increase awareness of our brand and product to drive adoption. our marketing function has implemented a series of new strategic digital initiatives, including paid search social and display media. some of the key statistics, we are tracking are as follows.
paid search has driven over 35,000 clicks to the website since the launch in may. this is a click-through rate of 2.67%, which is above average. social media engagement on media platforms such as facebook, instagram and linkedin have increased triple digits year to date and our followership has increased double digits on a year-to-date basis. our display media helped drive awareness and created a halo effect that made our paid search more effective.
as a result of these initiatives website traffic is up triple digits on a year-to-date basis, with a 239% increase in new users. in addition organic search is up 761% on a year-to-date basis. these stats indicate that our initiatives are growing our awareness. in addition, we are focusing on select geographies and have seen progress as a result of a multiple-front approach in some beta markets in q3.
this includes marketing support with commercial activation, kols, strategic partnerships, digital media and paid media. more to come on this front. i'm now moving on to review our decentralized software algorithm platform known as aspira synergy. we are making progress and now implementation phase for two of the largest gynecologic networks in the us.
we recently announced we have entered into additional technology transfer agreements which now include a total of four technology transfer agreements since the launch of aspira synergy. two of the agreements are with two of the nation's largest and leading independent women's healthcare groups incorporating more than 750 providers and more than 950,000 patients annually. the other two agreements which are in the implementation phase, are with two independent laboratories providing service across five states. dr.
northrop will share further comments shortly. i will now move on to provide an update on our core strategic developments regarding our pipeline, payer and evidence development as well as government affairs. first, i will start with our pipeline of products. our pipeline is built for aiding gynecologic health providers with personalized solutions during the entire patient lifecycle, starting with benign disease such as endometriosis, to ovarian cancer diagnostics, to suspected benign mass management and any which women who are planning for pelvic mass surgery.
i am now going to start with our endometriosis update as well as our endocheck breakthrough device program application. as we previously reported, we have two pharmaceutical company specimen contributions, which demonstrates the critical need for a diagnostic test. the collaboration between each of obseva s.a. and abbvie incorporated with aspira represents a mutual dedication to create solutions to help the 67 million women in the us suffering with endometriosis by radically improving the time to diagnosis as today it may take seven to nine years for a diagnosis.
we believe endocheck will allow patients to have their endometriosis detected earlier and potentially to be treated more effectively and perhaps without the need for unnecessary surgery. in late october, the fda centre for devices and radiological health issued an updated guidance for the content or pre market submission for software contained and medical devices specific to artificial intelligence, machine learning based software as a medical device action plan which will provide a much needed framework for such aspira future devices. we are currently working to ensure our endocheck development process is aligned to the proposed framework. we are still in communications with the fda regarding a breakthrough device program application.
importantly, the fda has acknowledged that there are many compelling reasons why this type of device is needed for both the treating physicians and for patients. as discussed previously, the fda indicated they're very interested in continuing to work with aspira and endocheck and we will be continuing our discussions with the agency on the breakthrough device designation. we believe endocheck will allow patients to have their endometriosis detected earlier, enable their physicians to further personalize their treatment plans and potentially enable more effective treatments without the need for unnecessary surgery. we expect to make a determination on our optimal regulatory path forward by the end of this year.
i am now moving on to our second technology i'd like to update you on which is our proof-of-concept study, which we've been working diligently with the teams at dana-farber, brigham and women's, and the university of lodz. the evaluation has met the acceptance criteria; and based on the outcome data, the aspira innovation team, along with the collaborators from the institutions, have begun the implementation of phase 2. i am now moving on to ovasight. we have determined that we will be branding the test as ovawatch, which we believe is more descriptive of the utility of the test.
the test was developed through a rigorous scientific and clinical-based process based on data from new york state ldt and from our fda regulatory processes in over 3,000 patients. as you know, we have estimated this product would launch in q4, 2021. as part of the process, we need to do additional scientific and market review. we are just wrapping up an analytical validation manuscript and we'll be submitting it to a peer-reviewed journal.
in fact, our goal is to have more than one peer-reviewed publication with robust data prior to launch. as this careful work progresses, we will adjust our scheduling accordingly. to that end, we are also continuing our perspective zero monitoring clinical study and ultimately plan to publish data demonstrating the clinical validity of ovawatch as a serial monitoring test by the end of 2020 to early 2023. we believe this product has the opportunity to have three times the total market opportunity as ova1 not including the serial monitoring option.
i am now moving on to an update regarding our payor and evidence development. and we have a number of updates. during this past year, we have been working on a large 12 month to 24 month outcome study of ova1 clinical utility. this study is specifically aggregating and analyzing data from the multiple sites that are participating in the study.
the data from the study sites will represent a broad section of the country in a diverse population of women. the company expects to submit a manuscript to a peer-reviewed journal with the results in q1 2022 and publish in q2 to q3 of 2022. the purpose of this study has demonstrated the impact ova1 testing has on patient outcomes compared to the broader ca125 single marker assay using 12 months to 24 month follow up data. it will measure the impact ova1 has on patient care, including both clinical and cost measures, which will be included in the published results.  this manuscript will be supplementing our current peer-reviewed publications including the ova1 impact on the quality adjusted life care paper and our budget impact model paper for payers.
i am now moving on to our clinical benefits guidelines, as we discussed on our last earnings call. ova1 technology is now considered medically necessary according to aim specially health's clinical appropriateness guidelines. notably, they have not included a competitive product called roma and their guidelines. and consider it still to be investigational and experimental.
aim is a member of the anthem bluecross blueshield family of companies which promotes optimal care through the use of evidence based clinical guidelines and real time decision support for both providers and their patients. we have commenced a targeted program to obtain contractual coverage with all of the aim member plans. we have now increased our covered lives during the third quarter to a total of 194 million. this is an 8% increase from our prior reported base of 179 million covered lives.
in addition, we are making strong progress on the medicaid front as aspire has now credentialed in the top five states by medicaid populations, which are ranked in the order of medicaid beneficiaries. they include california, new york, texas, florida and pennsylvania, bringing the total credential national medicaid population for ova1 to nearly 61 million, which represents approximately 77% of the total us medicaid population. and it addition as an adjunct to the recently announced coverage of ova1 by the state of new york for its medicaid population, two of the largest managed medicaid plans in the state of new york have adopted a favorable policy for ova1 and are now under contract to provide access to ova to an additional 4 million covered lives throughout the state. specifically, we have entered into an agreement with health first, new york's largest not for profit health insurer offering medicaid plans, medicare advantage plans, qualified health plans in individual and small group plans.
health first serves 1.7 million members in new york city, long island, west chester, sullivan, orange and rockland counties. health first is a pioneer of the value-based healthcare model where hospitals and physicians are paid based on patient outcomes. we have also entered into an agreement with fidelis care, which is one of the largest managed medicaid plans in new york, with 2.3 million covered lives across the state. further aspira women's health is now contracted with highmark of delaware for the medicare advantage membership.
this will ensure that women in this plan will have access to the ova1 technology. overall, our market access strategy is making significant progress with our reaching 194 million covered lives, representing 59% of the lives in the u.s. and we believe inclusion in the aim and evercore guidelines, along with the increased access to both medicaid and medicare advantage plans, provides us with further validation and credibility in our discussions with all payers. we expect this momentum to continue as we prepare to submit the latest evidence on ova1 clinical utility with 12 to 24 month outcomes.
i am now moving on to our government affairs front. we are continuing to gain momentum following our congressional briefings in march and september of 2021. the company is actively engaged with members of congress and several advocacy organizations including healthywomen, the national ovarian cancer coalition, the ovarian cancer research alliance, and the black women's health imperative, in an effort to increase awareness about ova1 and ovarian cancer and encourage legislation that provides financial support for additional clinical trials, as well as our focus on diversity in trials. this also includes discussions on trial requirements for adding the company's ovarian cancer technology into guidelines, such as the u.s.
preventive services task force, which would support the company's objective to launch a product that is broadly applicable as a high risk screening tool in time. we are also engaged with multiple state legislators about medicaid in their states, as well as national coverage determination for medicare for ova as part of the expanding access. in addition, the company is also working on the medicare innovative technology initiative to obtain coverage and reimbursement immediately following any fda breakthrough approval for any of its products. in summary, we continue to work on our overall strategic goal, which was to emerge from the pandemic stronger, our team is now much stronger on all fronts with a solid financial position.
we believe we are well positioned to invest, to grow and to drive adoption, and most importantly save lives. i would now like to hand the call over to dr. lesley northrop to provide an update on our momentum to becoming the standard of care and driving the awareness of our technology. dr.
northrop? 
lesley northrop -- chief scientific officer
thank you, valerie. in support of our multi-omic approach to developing diagnostic tests in women's health, we have entered into a partnership with genoox, one of the world's largest community-driven genomic data platform, to develop solutions to advance women's health and rapid results, diagnosis and insight. genoox's global platform brings together all publicly available genomic information, allowing for the complete analysis of the data and better patient care. we plan to leverage this knowledge base to expand our proprietary algorithm development across multiple product lines.
further to valerie's comments on our high-risk early detection program, i would like to update you on is the proof-of-concept study. we have been working diligently with the teams at dana-farber, brigham and women's and university of lodz. this study included specimens from our enriched biobank. one-third were malignant across all stages, as well as benign and healthy controls.
we were able to quantify the microrna expression levels and confirm that the microrna biomarkers demonstrated the same performance in our independent sample set as previously published in the elife publication in 2017. the evaluation met the acceptance criteria and based on the outcome data, the aspira innovation team, along with the collaborators from the institutions have begun implementation of phase 2. with this initial stage day pack, the team is proceeding to evaluate the combined potential impact of our protein biomarker algorithms, coupled with this new microrna technology in the development of this assay on a new platform, which we believe will set the foundation for a non-invasive diagnostic in ovarian cancer. we plan to further validate the same technology as a high-risk of ovarian cancer application and genetically predisposed women which is currently in a clinical study for ovainherit.
we anticipate that we will have preliminary data in early 2022 to support the verification of a multiomics approach in detecting ovarian cancer. please keep in mind this is a long-term phase product. and we are delighted to be working with world class institutions in the development of this assay, which we believe will have a significant impact on women's health in ovarian cancer. we continue our utmost commitment to increasing provider awareness and education to our medical affairs team, this team has hosted multiple successful highly attended educational series and are currently launching gynecologic and gynecologic oncology advisory boards, directed at better management of pelvic masses and improvement ovarian cancer early detection.
regarding clinical studies, we are continuing to recruit more academic sites to support both the clinical validity and utility of our tests. we have also launched our physician initiated research program for healthcare systems i'm incredibly excited about the direction of our clinical studies. and we continue to build our study program to strengthen the data around our products. we have recently completed a study combining data from our philippine and u.s.
clinical studies of diverse race and ethnicity. preliminary data supports that use of single-biomarkers such as, ca-125, and he4 has varying average values across different ethnic groups, resulting in increased false positive and false negatives of ovarian cancer malignancies. these biomarkers were validated and caucasian population as were their standard cut off, which do not translate to non- caucasian women. the abstract is in the process of submission to achieves.
i would now like to hand over the call to bob, to provide our financial update. bob?
rob beechey -- chief financial officer
thank you, dr. northrop. first quarter 2021 ova1 revenue was $1.6 million, an increase of 33% over prior year and a 6% decline sequentially. the 33% product revenue increase is primarily due to lower number of tests performed in 2020 due to covid-19 as well as an increase in ova1 average revenue per test in the third quarter of 2021, compared to the prior year.
the revenue per ova1 plus test performed remains flat at $377 for the first quarter 2021, compared to the second quarter of 2021. the year-on-year price increase was 11% compared to the prior year, third quarter of $338, included in the overall average price per unit is 12% volume associated with medicaid at a unit price of $94, which we expect to increase overtime, as we increase credentialing and coverage. the average unit price excluding medicaid was $410 during the third quarter. excluding patient direct out-of-pocket and medicaid, we realized an average unit price of $486.
gross profit margin on ova1plus was 57% in the third quarter of 2021 compared to 44.9% in the prior year and 52% in the second quarter of 2021. the year-on-year increase was driven by volume improvement, while the second quarter gross profit included one-time costs related to a switch in kit centers that did not recur in the third quarter. research and development expenses for the three months ended september 30, 2021 were $1.5 million, an increase of $47,000 or 3% compared to the second quarter 2021. our r&d investment increased 155% year over year or $595,000.
this spending was focused primarily on product development costs related to ovawatch as well as investments in bioinformatics, investments in aspira synergy and consulting expenses associated with endocheck regulatory clearance. sales and marketing expenses were approximately $5.1 million for the three months ended september 30, 2021, increased by $1.1 million or 27%, compared to the second quarter in 2021. this increase was primarily due to increase personnel and consulting costs as we execute upon our commercial strategy. the prior year sales and marketing expense of $2.2 million was depressed due to lower travel and entertainment and commissions and did not reflect the current investments we were making in market awareness and the sales team additions.
general and administrative expenses were $3.8 million for the three months ended september 30, 2021, an increase of $560,000 or 17% compared to the second quarter in 2021. this increase was primarily due to an increase in headcount, personnel expenses, as well as stock compensation expenses. we incurred $2 million in general administrative expenses in the prior year quarter. included in the third quarter 2021 general administrative expenses is $645,000 of non-cash stock compensation expenses as compared to $343,000 in the prior year, driven primarily by the market value of our stock grants.
we ended the third quarter of 2021 with approximately $44.9 million in cash. cash used in operations in third quarter of 2021 was $7.9 million, which included a number of one time investments. included in the third quarter were investments in recruiting services of $550,000. consulting services, including approximately $243,000 associated with endocheck fda assistance; $264,000 for data that is being leveraged for managed care and commercial targeting; $128,000 for one time legal fees; $69,000 of it fees associated with the build out of the synergy platform; and $40,000 associated with season support a congressional briefing in government affairs activities.
i will now turn it back over to valerie.
valerie palmieri -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, bob. before we open up the call for q&a, let me restate our optimism for building the company for sustainable growth for the near-term and the long-term. in parallel, we are executing on our larger mission to serve the 20 million women in the us, starting with ovarian cancer risk assessment, pelvic mass monitoring, and eventually tackling the largest disease, endometriosis. keep in mind, our high-risk ovarian cancer application for genetically predisposed women ovainherit, which is currently in development would be incremental to this market, because it would be for women with and without a mass.
ovarian cancer accounts for more deaths than any other cancer of the female reproductive system and is the only gender-specific cancer with greater than a 50% mortality rate. our work and products are at the forefront of changing the standards of care and detection of ovarian cancer malignancies. we believe we are helping close the gap in detection and more importantly survival for women. in the near-term, we believe ova1plus with our diversity differentiation and genetics will become the standard of care in personalized pelvic mass risk assessment for ovarian cancer.
for the longer-term, we are moving forward with endocheck for endometriosis; and lastly ovainherit for high-risk genetic predisposition monitoring. our end in mind is the incorporation of proteins genes and other modalities to detect gynecologic disease, which cannot be detected via a traditional biopsy. in time our goal is to become the liquid biopsy standard for these diseases inclusive of all ages stages and most of all ethnicities. with our enhanced team financial position and robust portfolio in development we could not be more confident across the business.
it is now time that all women of every race and ethnicity receive the best possible care and we are proud and excited to make that happen. we are now happy to open up the call for q&a and answer any of your questions. operator?

[operator instructions] our first question is from brian weinstein with william blair. please proceed with your question.
brian weinstein -- william blair -- analyst
hey, good morning guys. thanks for taking my question.
valerie palmieri -- president and chief executive officer
good morning. brian.
brian weinstein -- william blair -- analyst
so i thought we'd start very near-term and then branch out through some a couple of questions here. so i really appreciate the commentary on green, yellow and red and some of the volume trends there. just wanted to get some idea on how you're thinking about the back half of the quarter. we've heard repeatedly from companies throughout the earnings season that there's a little bit of concern relative to potential increased vacation time and office closures regardless of a resurgence of covid if that happens or not.
so just trying to gauge whether or not you expect those positive trends to continue through the year. i know you're not giving formal guidance here, but as we try and tweak our model a little bit for q4 and then into early 2022 just trying to get a gauge on how you're thinking about the trajectory of the recovery.
valerie palmieri -- president and chief executive officer
yes. i think it's a really good question because in early summer we saw acceleration of covid, but we also saw acceleration in markets that didn't have covid. we saw acceleration of lack of physician events, right? so in terms of the holiday season coming up, i guess, it's hard to tell, but i have to say we're very pleased with october and you see it all over the news that people are finally able to get together for thanksgiving or christmas. so will there be more celebration and more time off from a physician office? it could be.
we did see it in the summer. and as i said in markets that were not as subjected with covid, we saw lower physician events. and what i mean by that is just lunches and face-to-face time. it's still happening but it definitely was lower in key markets.
so i do  right now it's all systems go but seeing what happened in the summertime, i would not doubt if clinicians are also going to be enjoying time with their families because of this long-haul with covid.
brian weinstein -- william blair -- analyst
ok. we've had some conversations you and i about obviously, all of the great things that you guys have done to build a very strong infrastructure. and as we sit here now with i think it's just under 200 million covered lives medicaid coverage that's fairly significant, a sales force that's more than doubled data that's built up here. i'm just curious about what else do you guys think you need to hit that inflection that you and i have talked about previously in cases at this point? it feels to me like the stage is really set.
so is it fair to say that 2022 is a year where we should see barring any kind of covid headwinds that return really a nice inflection in how we're thinking or how you guys are seeing volumes starting to roll through?
valerie palmieri -- president and chief executive officer
yes. i would say that really comes down to four levers. number one, is access, right in terms of covid increases but i think we're learning to live with covid. the second is our sales rep efficiency.
right now we have 11% of our sales force that has less than three months. we have 47% are in that four to six months. and we like to have two quarters of sales reps to have two quarters behind them till they get to full tilt. so sales rep efficiency is number two.
number three, we have price. number four is we have implemented what i call regional market plans where we're focusing on the commercial activation, kols, strategic partnerships and digital and paid media. so i see all four levers moving in unison. and i do think that with the sales team getting to be more mature and we're hiring a great team i do think that the upside in 2022, we will continue to build momentum and really make a stand from not only adoption but as you pointed out from a payer standpoint and i'm talking both commercial and government payers.
so no we're very excited about a very positive 2022.
brian weinstein -- william blair -- analyst
got it. and then the last one for me. the data talking about superiority of ova1 versus ca125 continues to build. and i think at some point that you guys were talking about formally submitting to acog and trying to get some sort of superiority designation, specifically in the guidelines.
and i might have missed this if you addressed this during the prepared remarks, but where does that stand? and how important would that be if something like that were to play out?
valerie palmieri -- president and chief executive officer
so a couple of things. yes, that is our ultimate goal is to get superiority over ca125, because right now we're equal in a sense. and it's a multi-front approach from -- i want to say the diversity data, which really initiated out of the philippines. we have a very exciting acog abstract that has been submitted.
so yeah, i think part of it's diversity. i think part of it is -- i want to say that it's government affairs. i think there's a time of congress now paying attention, not that they weren't paying attention to women's health, but i think there's some renewed interest in women's health. and i do think that taking this data on diversity to acog is one of the most important things.
in fact we have made this diversity program one of the number one initiatives of our company and having taking that to acog as well as using thought leaders behind that as well. so, that is the ultimate plan is to take it to acog and get the guidelines stating that ova1 is a product that can actually measure ovarian cancer risk in the top races and ethnicities and we're starting with the black population and also the filipino study that we'll be releasing shortly.
brian weinstein -- william blair -- analyst
ok. great. thanks guys. i appreciate it.
valerie palmieri -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, brian.
operator
thank you. there are no further questions at this time. i would like to turn the floor back over to valerie palmieri for any closing comments.
valerie palmieri -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, operator. in closing, we believe that our accomplishments during q3, set us up nicely for the remainder of 2021 and beyond. we are focusing on doing the right things to drive sustainability and profitability and growth. with our increased commercial footprint, a guideline-endorsed and differentiated test a portfolio of tests within the same call point and now over 59% of lives under coverage in the us, we believe we are in position to support continued growth and profitability.

good morning, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to aspira women's health inc.'s full year 2021 and fourth quarter 2021 conference call. my name is kyle and i will be your coordinator for the call today. [operator instructions] as a reminder, this conference call is being recorded today. leading the call today are valerie palmieri, executive chair of the board; nicole sandford, president and chief executive officer; and bob beechey, chief financial officer.
after the prepared remarks, we will open the call for q&a. before we begin, i would like to remind everyone that forward-looking statements defined under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995, will be made during this call, including statements relating to aspira's expected future performance, future business prospects, future events or plans. although the company believes that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are based upon reasonable assumptions, actual outcomes and results are subject to risks and uncertainties and could differ materially from those anticipated due to the impact of many factors beyond the control of aspira. the company assumes no obligation to update or supplement any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law.
participants are directed to the cautionary note set forth in today's press release as well as the risk factors set forth in aspira's most recent form 10-k and our second quarter 2021 form 10-q filed with the sec for a description of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements. at this time, i'd like to turn the call over to valerie palmieri, executive chair of the board. valerie?
valerie palmieri -- executive chair of the board
thank you, operator. good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. as previously announced, i have been elevated to the role of executive chair of the board, i look forward to leading the company at a higher level and i'll be working side by side with our new president and chief executive officer, nicole sandford, who is joining me today to speak with each of you. as executive chair of the board, i intend to focus on specific strategic imperatives and enterprise value drivers, including the launch of critical new products, further development of aspira's thought leadership, including key strategic commercial, scientific and advocacy partnerships as well as our clinical and scientific leadership via our kol advisory boards.
as president and ceo, nicole will lead the business, execute strategic and operational plans and scale and transform operational and functional areas to support our planned growth. we have forged a strong and positive relationship working with one another over the past year, and it has only gotten stronger since we took our new, on our new responsibilities. we look forward to partnering with one another to drive strategic milestones while delivering growth, revenue and profitability to all of you, our shareholders. in addition to the executive level changes, we have recently announced the appointment of celeste fralick.
ph.d. to our board of directors. dr. fralick recently retired as chief data scientist at mcafee, where she was responsible for developing enterprise and consumer product analytics and data ecosystems for cardiomyopathy and neurostimulation.
dr. fralick is an accomplished executive who brings over four decades of data strategy experience to the board. she brings a broad background in technology and specifically healthcare in several markets with customer and industry-facing experience. she has been recognized globally for cross industry-leading analytics, ideation, strategic leadership and results-oriented competencies.
in addition, dr. fralick was named to forbes inaugural 2018 list of america's top 50 women in technology. i would now like to update you on some recent strategic developments, which we are very pleased with, before i move on to the 2021 review. as discussed in our march 2021 call, we entered into a strategic research collaboration agreement for the development and commercialization of a microrna high-risk ovarian cancer early detection test with harvard dana-farber cancer institute, brigham and women's hospital and the medical university of lodz.
they have published on a novel microrna panel, which we intend to use in combination with current technology. after completion of multiple experiments interrogating diverse sample sets and data sets, we have consistently found the technology to be complementary improving the accuracy compared to the microrna and protein biomarkers alone. based on this outcome data, we have met the success criteria together. this month, aspira has exercised the option for an exclusive worldwide license of its cutting-edge microrna technology and will continue development of a novel combined assay utilizing a new platform as well.
we believe the high specificity demonstrated by this technology, coupled with our strong sensitivity of our technology has the potential to be the base technology for a diagnostic, which will function as a test for women with a high genetic risk of ovarian cancer, the end goal for truly developing a personalized risk solution for patients who are genetically predisposed to ovarian cancer. the brand name for this study is ovainherit. there will be more to come as we move forward with publishing our early data. nicole will also discuss additional new pipeline updates in her remarks.
i am now moving on to our recap. we believe aspira women's health has effectively weathered the storm of the pandemic and is rapidly gaining momentum. we have delivered solid test volume recovery, improved price year-over-year considerably, added to our covered lives and lastly, made significant additions to our board and executive team. we continue to advance our product pipeline and strengthen our financial position in 2021.
we accomplished five major milestones. number one, our ova1 and platform adoption. in terms of full year 2021 metrics, volume grew 28% year over year. for q4 2021, we performed 4,750 ova1plus tests, which represented an increase of 23% compared to the same period in 2020 and an 11% increase sequentially compared to the third quarter of 2021.
looking forward, we experienced headwinds in january due to the surge in the covid-19 variant, which resulted in a slower-than-expected start to the first quarter of 2022. however, ova1plus volumes recovered quickly and are trending higher in february and march. our units per day increased from about 65 in the first few weeks of january to about 91 in the first week of march, which is a new average record per day. october was our prior record of 81 tests per day.
we believe this recent growth is a result of our ongoing commercial investments and increased patient visits as well as improved covid access. in addition to unit adoption, we also successfully entered into four synergy contracts, of which two are with two of the largest independent women's healthcare groups in the u.s. with access to approximately 750 providers and 950,000 patients annually. the last contract we announced in january 2022 is a five-year contract with axia women's health.
the goal of these relationships is to allow our clients to offer our best-in-class clinical diagnostic testing services directly to their patients via our universal platform. we believe this will provide a significant growth as we gain the ability to touch more providers through the larger provider bases that are associated with larger aspira's synergy customers. our platform strategy is key to mass adoption, coupled with our direct-to-provider strategy. the number of base ordering physicians increased to approximately 3,216 for the fourth quarter of 2021, representing a year-over-year increase of 23% and a sequential increase of 10% for the quarter.
the total number of new physicians in the fourth quarter of 2021 was 584, an increase of 25% over the same period in the prior year. and we noted significant new customer increase of 32% sequentially versus the third quarter of 2021. i am now moving on to our second major milestone, which is payer and price improvement. full year for 2021 in comparison to full year 2020 grew by 45%, while total price per unit, including medicaid, improved 13%, without medicaid, the price improved to $414, which is a 15% improvement year over year.
we also reached 194 million covered lives, representing 59% of the lives in the u.s. we believe inclusion in the aim and evercore guidelines provides us with further validation and credibility in our discussions with all payers. we expect this momentum to continue as we prepare to submit the latest evidence on ova1 clinical utility with 12 to 24-month outcomes. we plan to share more on this in 2022.
on the medicaid front, we added a total of 6.9 million lives with the addition of new york state, new hampshire and washington, d.c. having this coverage in place is critical to managing the underserved population as we believe ova1 is the only technology available today that has adequate sensitivity for early stage ovarian cancer risk detection, specifically in black women. with new york state, this brings our total credentialed medicaid population to 61 million medicaid lives, which is over 80% of the u.s. medicaid population.
i'm now moving on to our third milestone, which is government support and momentum following our two congressional briefings in 2021. we actively engage with members of congress and several noteworthy advocacy organizations, including healthy women, the national ovarian cancer coalition, the ovarian cancer research alliance and the black women's health imperative in an effort to increase awareness about ova1 and ovarian cancer. our goal was to encourage legislation to provide financial support for additional clinical trials as we focus on diversity in trials. we also started the discussions on the trial requirements for adding the company's ovarian cancer technology into guidelines, such as the u.s.
preventive services task force, which will support the company's objective to launch a product that is broadly applicable for women with a high genetic risk for ovarian cancer. in addition we're laying the ground work for a bill for national coverage determination for medicare for ova1 as part of expanding access. our work with these representatives, our congressional briefings and other advocacy work including with members of the appropriations committee has supported the nih's recent funding increase of 25% for ovarian cancer research and the department of defense's congressionally directed medical research programs increase in funding for ovarian cancer of 29%. we are very pleased with these recent results and the speed with which the government took action.
further, in response to president biden's recent outreach to industry for suggestions on how we can better identify cancer early as part of the cancer moonshot 2.0 initiative, the companies had correspondence with the biden administration to support the inclusion of early detection technologies for ovarian cancer among its key priorities. i am now moving on to the fourth milestone, which is our publication progress. we completed a paper, which has been published in the special edition of diagnostics entitled salvaging detection of early stage ovarian cancer malignancies, when ca125 is not informative. in a retrospective study of 2,305 patients, ova1 detected over 50% of the ovarian malignancies in premenopausal women that ca125 would have missed.
ova1 also correctly identified 63% of the early stage cancers missed by ca125. this paper further validates and supports the superior early stage detection of ovarian cancer versus ca125, the most common test used today in a large population. in addition, we have several other key manuscripts in submission more to come on this front. our last milestone is our strategic partnerships and study collaborations, which finished the year with three major ones in addition to the harvard dana-farber cancer institute.
the first one centers around endocheck products. we executed an agreement with opdivo assay whereby they provided us a sizable specimen and data bank from their therapeutic trials. we now have trial specimens from two of the three pharmaceutical companies, and these specimens will support our development of our endocheck product. our second is our platform partnership with genoox.
this partnership will enhance our data and biobank platform. genoox and aspira seek to tackle the most difficult diseases in women's health, and this platform should allow us to reduce the development time for potentially groundbreaking data solutions. and third is our key partnership with northwell health. this study will enroll over 600 prospective women with adnexal masses.
the study will also enroll 2,000 women at high-risk ovarian cancer, either due to personal or family risk of cancer or carriers of a germline variant associated with hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome. northwell is the largest healthcare provider in new york state and treats over 2 million patients annually and employs over 16,000 credential physicians. as you can see, our overall goal was to emerge from the three phases of pandemic operationally stronger, and we believe we did just that. we believe we are well positioned to grow, scale, drive adoption and most importantly, save lives.
i am now pleased to introduce our new president and ceo, nicole sandford. nicole? 
nicole sandford -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, valerie. before i start, i'd like to say that it has been an honor to assume the role of chief executive officer and to continue working closely with you to achieve our mission. as i've transitioned from board member to leader, my respect for the team of talented professionals that you have assembled has only grown. your leadership has certainly set the stage for an outstanding future for the company.
i'm now going to spend a few minutes providing an update on our strategic priorities and the path forward for 2022. our theme this year is focused execution. we've made a number of critical investments and now is the time to capitalize on those efforts. i intend to do that through focused execution in three areas: growth, innovation and operational excellence.
starting with growth. you've already heard from valerie about the increases in new physicians and volume from our existing physicians in 2021 despite several distinct covid surges that challenged our field sales team throughout the year. we're learning to live with covid and intend to improve our response and recovery to flatten the volume curve should additional variance cause disruption in 2022. i intend to work with the team to mine our learnings and ensure that we continue to see improvements in our sales related metrics regardless of covid disruptions.
staying with growth for a minute, you'll recall that we brought on michael newton as our head of, our new head of commercial. and i'm happy to report that he's already making a big impact. drawing on his over 20 years of diagnostic healthcare sales experience, mike will help to execute a commercial strategic refresh and reorganization in february of 2022 to enhance our national sales force and drive the accelerated adoption of ova1plus as the standard of care for early risk detection of ovarian cancer in women who have been identified for surgery. this strategic refresh is aimed at positioning us to take full advantage of our commercial scale-up over the past 18 months focusing on the most promising territories and rationalizing sales reporting structures.
early indications are that it was the right approach to achieve our growth plans for ova1plus and has set us up for the successful launch of ovawatch, which we expect to occur in the second half of the year 2022 and it is already working. daily volumes in q1 2022 have surpassed daily highs from 2021, as valerie mentioned in her remarks. let's shift gears to innovation. as you know, we've invested in building a pipeline of products that provides women's healthcare providers with a broad set of solutions for patients with a range of gynecological diseases.
as a reminder, many of the products in our pipeline are expected to be launched as ldts or lab developed tests, and it may be helpful to provide some additional background context on ldts before going into specific products. ldts are a class of in vitro diagnostic device that is designed, manufactured and used within a single laboratory. currently, the majority of novel technology and genetic tests are ldts. estimates for the number of ldts in the u.s.
range from 60,000 to 100,000 plus with between 15,000 and 20,000 of those falling under moderate or high risk for fda classification. in comparison, there are less than 500 fda-cleared moderate to high risk test on the market. ldts are often used to test for conditions or diseases that are either rapidly changing or that are the subject of quickly advancing scientific research. so the ldt approach might be the best approach in an evolving technology situation, and it allows for ongoing improvement in machine learning algorithms.
with that as background, i will provide an update on ovawatch, our next-generation ovarian cancer test. an ovarian cancer risk assessment test for women who present with an adnexal mass, ovawatch will be launched as an ldt in two stages. phase i is a single-use point in time test and phase ii will allow for serial monitoring. we will focus on advancing to the commercial phase of the ovawatch launch plan including driving provider adoption during the second half of 2022.
we believe the single-use product has the potential to triple the addressable market over ova1plus our current ovarian cancer test. the launch of the serial monitoring test remains targeted for 2023 upon publication of data from the ongoing prospective serial monitoring clinical study. now, let's move on to endocheck, our noninvasive aid in the detection of endometriosis. as we previously reported, we have received two pharmaceutical companies investment contributions, which we believe demonstrate the critical need for a diagnostic test.
the collaboration between each of opdivo assay and abbvie inc. with aspira represents a mutual dedication to create solutions to help the 6 million to 7 million women in the u.s. suffering from endometriosis by radically improving the time to diagnosis, as today, it may take 7 to 10 years for a diagnosis. we believe endocheck, our in-development diagnostic test for endometriosis will enable earlier detection, more effective treatment and perhaps avoid unnecessary surgery.
we previously announced the dual-track approach for the launch of endocheck as either an ldt or as an fda-designated breakthrough device and we continue to pursue both paths at this time. accelerating endocheck is a top priority for the company in 2022. in summary, our pipeline is advancing and is a priority for me and the entire company which will be aided significantly by the expansion of our relationship with the harvard dana-farber cancer institute. with respect to operational excellence, the entire company is focused on building the infrastructure we need to sustain our growth through 2022 and into the future.
we are also very focused on the stewardship of our resources on behalf of our shareholders, including the appropriate allocation of cash to those activities that are most likely to drive our immediate and longer-term growth and, as importantly, shorten the distance to positive cash flow. we are a fast-growing company that is developing complex women's health products. and as you might expect, there are opportunities to enhance the efficiency of our operations. it is important to note, however, that we are facing the same tight labor conditions as the rest of the industry.
we are working hard to retain our top talent and avoid costly turnover but we expect that to be a challenge for most of the coming year. before i hand off to bob to provide a financial update, i want to take a moment to acknowledge kaile zagger, our chief operating officer, who has decided to leave the company to pursue another opportunity. we are grateful to kaile for her dedication to aspira and wish her the best in her future endeavors. and now over to you, bob.
bob beechey -- chief financial officer
thank you, nicole. fourth quarter 2021 ova1plus revenue was $1.8 million, an increase of 29% over prior year and a 12% increase sequentially. this 29% ova1 revenue increase is primarily due to an increase in the number of tests performed in 2021 as well as an increase in the ova1 average revenue per test in the fourth quarter of 2021 compared to the prior year. prior to covid, in 2019, the third quarter versus fourth quarter growth was 7% quarter over quarter.
despite covid headwinds, we grew 12% sequentially and achieved a quarterly record number of tests performed in the fourth quarter of 2021. on a full year basis, 2021 ova1 revenue was $6.6 million, an increase of 45% over prior year. this 45% increase is driven by both the lower number of tests performed in 2020 due to the covid-19 and an increase in the ova1 average revenue per test. the revenue per ova1plus test performed was $382 for the fourth quarter of 2021 compared to $377 during the third quarter of 2021.
this year-on-year price increase was 5% compared to the prior-year fourth quarter of $364. our full year revenue per ova1 test perform was $378, a 13% increase compared to the full year 2020 price of $334. our full year revenue per ova1 test in u.s. medicaid perform was $414, a 15% increase compared to the full year 2020 price, excluding medicaid.
gross profit margin on ova1plus was 56% in the fourth quarter of 2021 compared to 50% in the prior year and 57% in the third quarter of 2021. the year-on-year price increase was driven by volume improvements, while the third quarter gross profit included slightly less kits and postage rate. research and development expenses for the three months ended december 31, 2021, were $1.5 million, a decrease of $100,000 or 4% compared to the third quarter of 2021. our r&d investment increased $700,000 or 98% year over year.
this spending was primarily focused on product development costs related to ovawatch, investments in aspire synergy and consulting expenses associated with endocheck regulatory clearance. sales and marketing expenses were $4.9 million for the three months ended december 31, 2021, and a decrease of $200,000 or 4% compared to the third quarter. this decrease was primarily due to less recruiting and promotional support costs as we execute upon our commercial strategy. the prior-year sales and marketing expense of $2.8 million was depressed as it did not reflect the current investments we are making in market awareness and the sales team additions.
general and administrative expenses were $3.6 million for the three months ended december 31, 2021, a decrease of $200,000 or 5% compared to the third quarter of 2021. we incurred $2.7 million in general and administrative expenses in the prior-year quarter. the year-over-year variance is attributable to headcount and personnel expenses. we ended the fourth quarter of 2021 with approximately $37.4 million in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash.
cash used in operations in the fourth quarter of 2021 was $7.6 million, which was a decrease from the third quarter, which was $7.9 million. this decrease sequentially was primarily due to reduced consulting costs as well as recruiting costs from our sales team investments. our short-term focus is to continue execution on a key catalysts. key catalysts include acceleration of ova1 adoption and price, accelerated adoption of our aspire synergy platform and successful launch of new products.
the organizational changes nicole referred to will result in onetime severance separation and settlement payments as well as legal costs of approximately $1.3 million in the first quarter of 2022. i would now like to hand the call back to valerie to wrap up.
valerie palmieri -- executive chair of the board
thank you, bob. before we open up the call for q&a, let me restate our optimism for building the company for sustainable growth for the near term and long term. 2022 will mark the first year with our second-generation technology being offered in a full access environment. it will be the first year with our first aspira synergy customer ramping up adoption as well.
ovarian cancer accounts for more deaths than any other cancer of the female reproductive system and is the only gender-specific cancer with greater than a 50% mortality rate. our work in products are at the forefront of changing the standards of care and the detection of ovarian malignancies. we believe we are helping close the gap in detection and, most importantly, survival for women. in the near term, we believe ova1plus, with our diversity differentiation will become the standard of care and personalized pelvic mass risk assessment for ovarian cancer.
our long-term goal is to become the personalized liquid biopsy standard, inclusive of all ages, stages and race and ethnicities. we are now happy to open up the call for q&a and answer any of your questions. operator?
",":
operator
[operator instructions] our first question is from brian weinstein with william blair. please proceed with your question.
unknown speaker
hi. good morning. thank you. this is dustin on for brian.
bob, maybe this one is for you. i know you called out the severance cost for the personnel rationalization. we're just trying to get a better detail on some more specifics around the sales force rationalization. what are the expected cost savings from this? and maybe more importantly, what are your expected benefits from this and how is that factored into your outlook for 2022?
bob beechey -- chief financial officer
i think it was largely realignment and reinvestment. so while there will be some savings, it was largely a change relative to skill sets and coverage. there were also some management changes associated with that. so i think the other factor relative to looking at spend in 2022 is that we are anticipating launch costs associated with ovawatch this year.
so in terms of absolute numbers, we're not seeing -- we're not planning a significant decline relative to overall sales and marketing expenses during the year. so it's really about effectiveness and productivity. so i think it's consistent with our intentions to drive productivity up during the year. and then also the other factor in terms of spend is a significant expectation around the ovawatch launch this year.
unknown speaker
got it. great. thank you. and i know as of last quarter, i think you ended with around 40 reps.
i just wanted to confirm that number is still right around there and maybe what your intentions are for that number for the rest of 2022?
valerie palmieri -- executive chair of the board
hi, dustin. this is valerie. last year, we ended about 26 reps and our goal is to be in that 30 to 35 zone.
unknown speaker
got it. sorry about that. 
valerie palmieri -- executive chair of the board
no problem.
unknown speaker
great. thank you. and then regarding the licensing deal on the rna technology, we just want to get a better understanding of how that option was exercised? was it a cash payment? was it stock? does it entail future royalties? and then maybe some further detail on the time lines when you expect that tech to be developed for that new assay.
nicole sandford -- president and chief executive officer
so in terms of the -- hi. it's nicole. thanks for the question. in terms of the cost, it was a relatively nominal cash payment, and we are actually still working on the terms of the agreement going forward.
is that right, bob?
bob beechey -- chief financial officer
yeah. no, we have a royalty arrangement with them that we previously disclosed that that's in the same zip code as our -- it's low single digits percentages. so i think that's consistent with our margin profile currently with the additional technology. what we will do, and it's largely reflected in our current run rate, but the exercise of the option basically commits us to support the codevelopment of what will be an ldt likely.
so i think it's really not a big onetime spend. it's really a confirmation that we're moving forward with the next phase of development. and we're very pleased with the economics of the royalty arrangement. 
unknown speaker
got it. understood. thank you. and then in terms of trends, i know you talked about the first quarter hitting some records.
that's great. it looks like the recovery is going well. but maybe just trying to get some of your assumptions for the rest of the year in terms of access and asps, if there's any outlook that you have maybe for next month and beyond then that would be appreciated?
bob beechey -- chief financial officer
well, we referenced the fact we're working clinical utility on ova, and i think that the big factor we think that will ultimately -- so relative to price and asp, think in terms of incremental growth in the short term, absent a significant publication. one of the factors that we anticipate helping to drive adoption in general is our synergy platform expanded use case. so i think when you look at the outlook, while we haven't given guidance, we're all optimistic given the recent trends we're seeing in customer conversion as well as volume that access is opening up. so as nicole mentioned, we're all over if we have a resurgence that we don't -- we want to minimize any impact to that.
but we're moving full steam ahead. valerie mentioned we're at 30. we anticipate leading up to the launch, which we anticipate being this year of the ovawatch that will build on synergy and incrementally increase the sales force from 30 to -- in the mid-30s, 35 is really the number we've said publicly. so i think the optimism -- we're back in our office now and our sales force is jazzed up with the momentum that michael is bringing to the table as well.
so we're very bullish that our strategy of building out availability with synergy with the two super groups and then launching the ovawatch is going to provide us very strong momentum going into the second half of the year.
unknown speaker
got it. thank you. and then a last one on cash burn. it's been focused for a lot of investors.
i think this earnings season in regards to other companies in the diagnostic space. bob, incorporating your comments about operating expenses with the restructuring and all the moving pieces there. how should we think about what that means for cash burn this year?
bob beechey -- chief financial officer
well, i think i signaled that q1 has the one-off cost. so that's really onetime. and then i think we're thinking about a marginal reduction and then compression of cash burn as we launch and further grow adoption as the synergy platform starts to kick in with volume as our sales force productivity. recall, we've said in the past, while we did make some changes relative to the sales force, we've got a lot of salespeople that are getting better tenured.
so i think we're going to start to get to a full access, fully trained, fully up to speed stride. so i think -- and then our big optimism is related to dropping in ovawatch during the year, which was a much wider indication that we think is going to fuel adoption because the toolkit relative to ovawatch becomes a lot more clinically useful. the ova1plus is much more acute in terms of life or death and the implication for patient care, but the ability to use ovawatch to really determine if surgery is necessary is very -- our voice of customer on clinicians leads us to believe that there's just a gap in the toolkit that we think ovawatch is going to significantly impact. so those are the factors that will provide the uplift for utilization on the revenue side and think in terms of cash burn being most influenced by that and less so by the restructuring.
so i think we're on the current trajectory. we built out and essentially think about the q1 or it's more than a tweak, but it's really an optimization move as opposed to a cutback.
unknown speaker
got it. great. thanks for taking our questions.
operator
our next question is from ross osborn with cantor fitzgerald. please proceed with your question.
ross osborn -- cantor fitzgerald -- analyst
hi. good morning, everyone and congrats on the progress. so starting off, can you discuss ovawatch? would you be able to provide some more color around the commercialization plan for single-use? how should we think about the ramp exiting this year and early next?
valerie palmieri -- executive chair of the board
yeah. so as we mentioned, we submitted our paper last year and we actually have some really positive signals that we may be seeing publication of that soon, so stay tuned. and the ramp-up will be in the second half on that commercialization plan. we have a lot of work to do, but we have a really solid plan in place.
so we should be fully in the market in the second half of the year, and we expect to see -- i think in our remarks, we talked about there being a significant exponential driver to our volume as a result of ovawatch. but of course, that's not all going to happen this year. it will really start ramping up in the second half, and we'll see broader adoption next year. and then as we bring on the serial monitoring, it will grow from there.
ross osborn -- cantor fitzgerald -- analyst
ok, great. and then are you able to discuss pricing at this point or at least how it compares to the company's asp?
bob beechey -- chief financial officer
there's a couple of factors there. we are optimistic that there'll be the ability to cross walk the medicare pricing from the ova1, it's similar technology with a different algorithm. and i think that baseline medicare reimbursement, while we don't have final approval, we're in discussion, and we're optimistic that we'll essentially equate to the medicare pricing, then we have to go through the grind of working through -- working with all the individual insurers. so that won't happen overnight.
but we think that the technology is similar such that it's a broader indication. so we'll have a different pla, cpt code for ovawatch. but our intention is to migrate it to similar to ova1 pricing but there will be a little bit of a lag.
ross osborn -- cantor fitzgerald -- analyst
ok. got it. thank you for the color. and then on endo, i think i may have missed it, but is the company still targeting a launch in the first half of next year?
bob beechey -- chief financial officer
we've said 2023 and we're not trying to be cute on the timing. but there's still some -- a lot of work to be done. so we've certainly committed to 2023, and we're not backing off of that.
ross osborn -- cantor fitzgerald -- analyst
ok. great. and then moving on to gross margin. can you just provide a little bit more clarity on some of the headwinds and tailwinds seen during the fourth quarter? and how we should think about that for calendar '22 looks like genetix may have looked at margin during the quarter?
bob beechey -- chief financial officer
no. genetix, i think it's really volume-driven primarily. we had some -- we're sorting out the scaling and we were doing a lot of resupply of kits, and that's what gave rise to q3. that's the dynamic, there is kit build and resupply and the timing of that.
so i think -- when we scale over the year, we view margin to have upside largely based on volume ramp. we will have, as i mentioned earlier, more -- i think in terms of incremental price increase over the course of the year, which goes straight to margin and then the volume -- the scaling of the fixed costs relative to volume and we're not anticipating any one-offs, but the kit as we scale and build out kits and go to new customers, that's where it gets slightly lumpy. but as the numbers grow, i think the significance of that will smooth out.
ross osborn -- cantor fitzgerald -- analyst
ok. got it. and then lastly for me, i guess congrats on the higher selling price in the quarter. have you seen the willingness for payers to meet the increase? can you provide any color on the pipeline in terms of coverage?
bob beechey -- chief financial officer
well, we've gotten very positive indications, primarily with medicare on payer coverage for ovawatch. it's obviously premature relative to anything with endocheck to approach them. as i mentioned -- the step functionality that we're trying to drive, we previously discussed a clinical utility study, which has been somewhat hampered from a time line perspective relative to covid. we try not to use that as an excuse, but that's why it's been somewhat delayed.
that's been the issue with some of the larger nationals. but the other factor in the strategy in particular, relative to the large super groups as we think that they're very helpful in influencing payers as their customer base gets adoption because i think the voice of those providers actually counts a lot more than we as a device manufacturer and vendor. so i think that's the other element is as we get adoption and, in particular, get some major provider partners, we think that's going to help with reimbursement. but the new news relative to our dialogue needs to be the clinical utility, which we expect to be able to publish something this year.
but then obviously, there's a lag relative to the cycle of the payers in terms of getting their agreement and when they implement. so we're not -- we don't have our plans anything other than the incremental -- hitting the singles, picking up payers over the course of the year, we've been doing that over time, but we don't operationally plan on a big step function.
valerie palmieri -- executive chair of the board
let me say something on that, too. this is valerie. also the other piece is just having full access. this is our first year with having full access on the cigna in a sense of assuming omicron variant is shutting things down.
but we got the cigna contract, the cigna pricing and a lot of the pricing we got during covid. so the hope is that a new sales force, additional feet on the street, additional tenured feet on the street, we should be seeing more of those contract prices come through, as bob said, but the clinical utility is the big step function.
ross osborn -- cantor fitzgerald -- analyst
ok, great. thanks for the additional color.
operator
our next question is from kumar raja with brookline. please proceed with your question.
unknown speaker
france hudendu for kumar from brookline. appreciate the business update. thank you. for the ongoing endocheck trial, could you please talk about the type of samples that are being shared by the two companies? and just to get an idea of how you are thinking about the test, confirmation of endometriosis, is it still require tissue biopsy and histology? or do you expect that the other test may potentially replace it all together?
valerie palmieri -- executive chair of the board
good morning, kumar. it's valerie palmieri. thank you for the question. let me answer in two parts.
so in terms of specimens, we have a specimen collaboration with abbvie and a specimen collaboration with opdivo, two of the three pharma companies. these specimens are retrospective specimens. and we also have our own retrospective specimens as well, as well as additional study specimens where we've been working with collaborators. so in aggregation, we have a large retrospective specimen bank, which is the heart of the validation of the endocheck product.
we also -- in parallel, we are running -- we are initiating a prospective trial as well. so we have retrospective specimens and we are initiating a prospective trial as well. and the end goal in terms of comparing it to laparoscopic biopsy. laparoscopic biopsy is invasive.
this will be a noninvasive aid in detection and our goal is to have strong enough sensitivity and specificity, whereby a doctor and the patient would have indication of the endometriosis detection, and at that point, could initiate either medical management or could initiate surgery if that is specific treatment. so the goal is that this is for women, the initial product out of the gates will be women that are moderate to severe pain, and this will be a noninvasive endometriosis aid and detection product.
unknown speaker
got you. thank you. and also with regards to the breakthrough designation decision for endocheck, i was just curious if you've seen any further guidance from the fda? and is there any timelines that you could share with us? and also, could you talk a little bit about what kind of benefits this designation offer, especially in terms of regulatory issues or the commercial launch? thank you.
valerie palmieri -- executive chair of the board
ok. so in terms of that question, there's a couple of parts there. so the breakthrough designation is a brand new program. i'm not sure how familiar you are with it.
the benefits of it are that when you have a product that is truly breakthrough and you meet three criteria, which is number one, are you solving for a disease that's irreversibly debilitating; number two, is there a predicate device; and number three, is there an improved patient well-being. and we believe in our discussions with the fda, we have supported those three, but we are still continuing discussions with them. in addition, we are running a parallel process via ldt. as nicole alluded to in her section, the majority of novel diagnostics are ldts.
and we are running a parallel process, and that is something that we have informed as well the fda. your last question in terms of uptake on the product and also the sensitivity and specificity, again, we're looking to be the noninvasive solution versus laparoscopic biopsy.
unknown speaker
sounds great. thank you. thank you for taking the questions.
valerie palmieri -- executive chair of the board
you're welcome.
operator
we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. and i will now turn the call over to management for closing remarks.
valerie palmieri -- executive chair of the board
in closing, we believe that our accomplishments during 2021 set us up for a strong 2022 and beyond. with myself leading the board and nicole leading the growth and scaling of the business, we are focused on doing the right things to drive profitability and growth. our end goal is to serve the women's health market with a platform coupled with proprietary science and data tools, which will drive better health and well-being to each and every patient we serve. thank you for joining us today, and we appreciate your support and interest in aspira women's health.

operator
good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to aspira women's health, inc.'s second quarter 2022 conference call. my name is vikram, and i will be your coordinator for the call today. [operator instructions] as a reminder, this call is being recorded today. leading the call today are nicole sandford, president and chief executive officer, bob beechey, chief financial officer, and dr.
ryan phan, chief scientific officer and chief operating officer. after the prepared remarks, we will open the call for q&a. before we begin, i'd like to remind everyone that forward-looking statements, as defined under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995, will be made during this call, including statements relating to aspira's expected future performance, future business prospects, and future events or plans. although the company believes that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are based upon reasonable assumptions, actual outcomes and results are subject to risks and uncertainties and could differ materially from those anticipated due to the impact of many factors beyond the control of aspira.
the company assumes no obligation to update or supplement any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law. participants are directed to cautionary note set forth in today's press release, as well as the risk factors set forth in aspira's most recent form 10-k filed with the sec for a description of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements. at this time, i'd like to turn the call over to the call to nicole sandford, president and chief executive officer. please go ahead, ma'am.
nicole sandford -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, operator, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. we are very pleased to provide an update on our progress in the second quarter. joining me on the call today are bob beechey, our chief financial officer, and dr. ryan phan fan, our chief scientific and chief operating officer.
i will begin with an overview of our second quarter performance and an update on a number of important strategic developments. dr. phan will follow with an update on our product pipeline before handing the call to bob, who will provide a financial update. after our prepared remarks, we will then open the lines for a question-and-answer session.
last quarter, i shared my priorities for 2022. i told you then that my focus and the focus of the entire company would be on execution across three dimensions: growth, innovation, and operational excellence. while we still have much to do, i am happy to report encouraging progress in all three areas in the second quarter of 2022. let's begin with an update on our cash utilization as it sets an important context for the rest of the conversation.
when i joined the company, i made it a priority to align our spending and resources to the most important business needs. i ask my executive leadership team to exercise fiscal conservatism, but to do so without jeopardizing our strategic vision. we have made significant progress since then. in the second quarter of 2022, we utilized $6.4 million in cash, roughly 40% less than we utilized in the first quarter of 2022, and 16% less than the fourth quarter of 2021.
this was a major achievement that required the attention of every aspira team member, and i'm extremely proud of our progress. we achieved this reduction in utilization without sacrificing our growth or innovation goals, as you'll hear shortly. we continue to hire individuals to fill key roles, especially in the commercial and r&d organizations, and invest in the infrastructure required to increase our volume and deliver on our aspira synergy contracts. we plan to operate the business this way going forward.
i'll ask that you keep that reduced cash utilization number in mind as ryan, bob, and i detail our second quarter achievements. first, let's talk about growth. in q2, we broke through the $2 million revenue threshold for the first time in a single quarter with a volume of 5,411 tests performed. this represents an 11% increase in revenue over the first quarter of 2022 and an 18% increase over the same period in 2021.
our testing volume increased to 83 tests performed per day in q2 compared to 75 tests performed per day in q1. we achieved this growth while continuing to execute our previously disclosed commercial transformation, which i'm happy to report is largely complete. as of today, 67% of our sales professionals have been with the company for more than three months and 58% have been with us for more than six months. in the second quarter of 2022, approximately 593 physicians ordered an ova product for the first time, which is essentially flat with new ordering physicians in the first quarter.
we aim to increase the number of physicians ordering for the first time and do more to drive repeat orders from existing physicians. the latter will be a focus area for the rest of the year. bob will provide additional information about revenue and aup later in the call. while i'm happy to see the uptick in volume, i'm far from satisfied with overall revenue growth.
this quarter, i've spent time in the field with our reps and physicians, and i will continue to do so in the third quarter, to better understand challenges to adoption and overall growth. elsewhere on the growth front, aspira and bioreference established a national collaboration to co-market and distribute ova1plus. bioreference is one of the largest full-service specialty laboratories in the united states with a leading position in women's health, oncology, and urology, and 40 years of expertise in clinical diagnostics. we are targeting a launch of the arrangement no later than the fourth quarter of this year.
it is our expectation that the relationship will drive incremental volume in 2023 and beyond. both aspira and bioreference are deeply committed to enhancing health outcomes for women, and i've found the cultures to be very complementary. i believe this is the beginning of a mutually beneficial long-term relationship, and i'm working hard to ensure a strong start. separately, aspira women's health has established a stand-alone agreement with scarlet health, an innovative mobile phlebotomy solution, providing collections for aspira's patients from the comfort of their home.
as an update to the aspira synergy platform rollout, we are encouraged by adoption from our first physician super group, which i am now able to identify as women's care. we were able to design and implement a commercially reproducible solution in playbook for future aspira synergy opportunities while implementing an arrangement that has helped both women's care and aspira achieve their shared mission to expand patient access. now turning to innovation. it is my pleasure to welcome dr.
ryan phan to our call for the first time. dr. phan, can i ask you to briefly introduce yourself and then provide an update related to our product portfolio, including today's announcement of an expansion to our relationship with harvard's dana-farber cancer institute and a number of other academic institutions to include endometriosis in addition to our ongoing collaboration related to ovarian cancer. 
ryan phan -- chief scientific and operating officer
thank you, nicole. i'm honored to join aspira as chief scientific and operating officer after many rewarding years in leadership and academy institution, healthcare system, and more recently at caredx, where i was the senior vice president of lab service and medical director. as a member of caredx leadership executive team, i led the commercial testing operation, clinical development pipeline, manufacturing, supply chain, regulatory affairs and compliance, and automation and engineering divisions. in addition, i served as a licensed medical director of the company's clear cap laboratory and played a key role in the growth and expansion of the company's testing revenues and portfolio.
prior to joining caredx, i was managing director and head of regional molecular genetic pathology and cytogenetics at kaiser permanente in northern california. before that, i was effective member of the university of california los angeles and the los angeles va medical center. i received my bachelor's decrease from us uc berkeley and my phd from colombia university in new york. i completed my post-doctoral training harvard medical school, where i worked the cancer research entity panel and american society of hematology scholar.
i look forward to working with everyone at aspira to strengthen our innovation efforts, accelerate the expansion of our product portfolio, and scale our commercial testing service as we move forward. now let me turn to our product portfolio by reiterating our intention to launch ovawatch, our next generation ovarian cancer assessment by the end of the year. with its superior negative predictive value, ovawatch is noninvasive tests that provide additional data points for clinician initial assessment in women with an actual mass. this lab developed test will support physicians in making informed clinical decisions in the management of women with actual masses.
ovawatch represents a significant expansion of our potential patient population when compared with our existing fda-cleared ova1plus test, which are only approved for use in women with masses that have been referred for surgery. we estimate the total addressable market for ovawatch to be three or more times the resale market for ova1plus. as we previously disclosed, our paper entitled, analytical validation of a deep neural network algorithm for the detection of ovarian cancer were accepted for publication by jco clinical cancer informatics. while our ability to collect samples for the study were significantly impacted by covid surge over the past two years.
today, i can report that we recently completed enrollment of our multisite prospective study based on real-world data in support of our plan to launch ovawatch. we are in the final stage of analysis and are preparing a manuscript for peer review of application. we are satisfied that the data provided in the analytical and clinical valuation study will be sufficient to write decision and payer adoption. ovawatch and ova1plus will be marketed together as part of our newly reimaged ovarian cancer portfolio, we have branded as ova suite.
physician will be encouraged to consider an ova suite test for all women with an actual masses to provide a more informed clinical decision in the assessment and management of their patient risk for ovarian cancer. in this regard, a single test requisition form of ova suite will allow clinicians to determine which test is appropriate for their patient. we are on track to launch the product in the fourth quarter of this year and expect to see meaningful volume from ovawatch during the early months of 2023. we can also report on our ongoing efforts to support research related to the impact of rate on the detection of ovarian cancer.
sponsored by aspira's clinical research efforts in the philippines, a manuscript entitled, clinical performance of a multi-vari index assay in detecting early stage ovarian cancer in filipino women has been accepted for publication in the international journal of environment and health in its special issue on ovarian cancer preventive and treatment. the study was designed to validate the effectiveness of a multi-vari index assay of ova1plus in the assessment of ovarian cancer risk in filipino women.. as soon as the report is published, we will say it on our website. you will hear more about our suite of ovarian cancer offerings, including a presentation regarding the clinical application of ova1plus and overwatch on august 24 at 12 p.m.
eastern time when nicole and i host the webinar with dr. charles dunton, aspira's chief medical officer, dr. nicole williams of the gynecology institue of chicago, and dr. gerard reilly of axia women's health.
an invitation to the event were distributed by lifesci advisors. registration details can be found on the investor relations page of our website. moving on to our endometriosis product offerings, we are excited to announce that we have entered into a sponsored research agreement with harvard's dana-farber cancer institute, brigham & women's hospital, and medical university of lodz for the generation of a  multi-omic, non-invasive diagnostic aid to identify endometriosis based on circulating micrornas and proteins. we will collaborate with this prestigious group of well renowned institutions to identify candidate markers and build a series of diagnostic models for women being evaluated for possible endometriosis.
we intend for the collaboration to be completed, we anticipate the total cost of the partnership to be approximately $1.2 million. the resolve the technology to drive medical and clinical management women with our pelvic presenting a symptom of endometriosis and to limit surgical evaluation for those cases where noninvasive tests provide difficult or in-home surgical excision of endometriosis is clinically indicated. this research collaboration agreement will build on our extensive r&d efforts, and we have spent our assets to appropriate samples as well as scientific resources required to accelerate the commercialization of our endocheck diagnotic test. we believe this agreement help to ensure a launch of an endometriosis diagnostic test in 2023, which continue to be our goal.
we plan to host a second webinar to provide additional insight on our endometriosis test, and we'll announce the timing of that webinar. i now turn the bob beechey for a discussion about our financial performance. bob?
bob beechey -- chief financial officer
thank you, ryan. second quarter 2022 ova1plus revenue was $2 million, an increase of 17% year over year and a 10% increase sequentially. the revenue and volume numbers represent a record quarter for the company. the revenue per ova1plus test performed was $373 for the second quarter of 2022 compared to $378 during the second quarter of 2021 and $380 for the first quarter of 2022.
the year-on-year price and sequential 1% decrease in revenue per ova1plus test performed was driven by the mix of payer type would decrease patient pay collection for the second quarter of 2022, as well as our strategic initiative to serve the medicaid population, which currently has a lower price when compared to our average and representing a higher percentage of our revenue. our price for medicaid was $90 in the second quarter of 2022 and represented approximately 12% of volume. gross profit margin on ova1plus was 48.6% in the second quarter of 2022 compared to 52% for the same period in 2021 and 53.2% in the first quarter of 2022. the decreases were driven primarily by software license costs and maintenance costs.
research and development expenses for the three months ended june 30, 2022, were $1.4 million, roughly flat when compared to the prior year second quarter of $1.47 million and the first quarter 2022 spend of $1.35 million. the spending was focused primarily on product development costs related to ovawatch and endocheck. sales and marketing expenses were $3.6 million for the three months ended june 30, 2022, a decrease of $917,000 compared to the second quarter of 2021 and $439,000 compared to the first quarter of 2022. the decrease was driven by decreases in personnel costs associated with our first quarter reorganization, as well as reduced consulting costs.
general and administrative expenses were $4.2 million for the three months ended june 30, 2022. we incurred $3.3 million in general and administrative expenses in the prior year quarter and $4.4 million in the first quarter of 2022. the year-over-year variance is attributable to headcount and personnel expenses, while the sequential decrease is driven by reduced consulting costs. we ended the second quarter of 2022 with approximately $20.7 million in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash.
cash used in the second quarter of 2022 was $6.4 million. as nicole mentioned, we are focusing our investments on development of products with a near-term impact, namely ovawatch and endocheck, and enhancing our sales and marketing in preparation for the bioreference collaboration and the launch of ovawatch. this focus on execution has resulted in reductions in spend on more speculative long-term research and a reduction in awareness marketing which we concluded was not yielding adequate returns. in addition, we have rationalized our cost structure across all functions while maintaining appropriate quality, and we are pleased with the resulting cash utilization in the second quarter.
we expect to sustain our reduced cash utilization levels in the coming quarters. we expect to utilize in the range of 14 million to 15.5 million total during the second half of the year. this outlook includes cash that we expect to use to maintain our current staffing levels and the required investments to launch to ovawatch, kick off our partnership with bioreference, and continue discovery and development of endocheck. the cash utilization expectation does not contemplate any revenue contributions in the fourth quarter from the ovawatch launch or from the bioreference partnership initiation.
note, we do expect an increase in cash utilization in the third quarter compared to the second quarter of 2022 as we expect to fund endometriosis development of approximately $1.2 million. we expect the fourth quarter will then revert to levels in the range of the second quarter. we're examining all options for extending our cash runway, and we'll announce specific plans as appropriate. with that, i will now turn the call back over to nicole.
nicole?
nicole sandford -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, bob. and as a final update, let me introduce and welcome two new board members, dr. robert auerbach and ruby sharma. dr.
auerbach is the retired president of coopersurgical. he brings extensive clinical and executive experience in the medical industry, including experience as a director and as an executive officer. ms. sharma, the managing partner at rmb strategic advisors, brings decades of senior leadership, accounting and audit committee experience.
each brings different but equally critical skills and expertise to the board. bob's medical background and track record of success as an executive in the women's health sector, along with ruby's strategic mindset and extensive financial, business, and governance acumen, will be highly valuable to aspira as we accelerate our strategic execution in today's challenging environment. overall, we are pleased by our accomplishments this quarter and our strategic focus on growth, innovation and operational excellence. things you can expect from us in the coming months include: launch of our bioreference relationship in the second half of this year, launch of ovawatch in the fourth quarter of this year, launch of an endometriosis diagnostic test in the second half of 2023, and continued focus on cash utilization and sources of liquidity, with the expectation for cash usage to be between $14 million and $15.5 million for the balance of the year.
in closing, our executive team remains committed to our strategic vision, and we are focusing all of our efforts on execution for the remainder of 2022 and beyond. we've made tremendous progress, and more is yet to come. with that, i would like to now open the call for questions. operator?

operator
thank you very much. [operator instructions] we have a first question from the line of brian weinstein with william blair. please go ahead.
griffin soriano -- william blair and company -- analyst
good morning. this is griffin on for brian. thanks for the questions. maybe just to start on the sponsored research agreement for the endometriosis test.
just to clarify, is this product separate from endocheck, or more of an extension of the existing r&d work that you guys have already done? and then i think endo, the ldt launch was expected in '23. so i just want to better understand how this research agreement work compares to the endo product.
nicole sandford -- president and chief executive officer
sure. great. well, thanks for the question. i'll start, and then ryan, you can add your thoughts as appropriate.
so the sponsored research agreement is best characterized as an extension of our r&d efforts overall. so as i think we've talked about in prior calls, we have been looking for opportunities to accelerate and sort of ensure a launch of an endometriosis ldt in 2023. and this arrangement will give us access to resources and, importantly, specimens and expertise to complete both protein and microrna development work. so the exact ldt to be launched, we will obviously give more information about that when the time is appropriate.
but i think the way to think about it is the latter in your question, as an extension of our team and access to additional resources. ryan, anything to add to that?
ryan phan -- chief scientific and operating officer
no, i think you covered it, nicole. thank you for the question.
griffin soriano -- william blair and company -- analyst
ok. and then on the bioreference lab comarketing distribution agreement, i know it might be limited in what you can say, but can you give us a sense of maybe how many reps on their side will be carrying the ova1 product? and with your focus being more on depth in the second half year in driving adoption, utilization against existing docks, is that -- are they going to be helpful here? will that also be these reps focused? and then any details on the economics of this agreement, the revenue share potential margin impact would be helpful.
nicole sandford -- president and chief executive officer
yes. so it's challenging to give anything that's going to satisfy you in terms of details. so i apologize in advance for that. but i will say, we're extremely satisfied with the commitment that bioreference has made to us in terms of their promotion of this relationship and our products with their sales team, and i really can't comment on the -- it wouldn't be appropriate for me to comment on the size of their sales team.
all i can say is they've been incredibly supportive, and we found the cultural fit between what we're each trying to achieve with this relationship has been extremely positive. so we feel really confident that they're going to do what they can to drive adoption within their -- both within their sales force, but then obviously, importantly, within their customer base. and the economics are consistent with our current ova1plus sales, although i would ask bob to just confirm that there's nothing else you'd want to say on that.
bob beechey -- chief financial officer
i would just comment that our expectation is that it's attractive to both sides, and we expect our margin profile to be consistent.
griffin soriano -- william blair and company -- analyst
ok. i appreciate that. and then just last one here on the capital situation, the burn was down nicely year-over-year. and bob i appreciate the color on sort of second half expectations.
maybe can you just talk a little broadly about how you're thinking about the cash burn in 2023 and ultimately addressing what will likely be a financing need?
bob beechey -- chief financial officer
well, we haven't given guidance for q3 -- i mean, for 2023. obviously, the major catalysts are the brl relationship and the ovawatch launch. so we would expect top line, sequentially, year on year, to be meaningfully higher, and we don't anticipate any significant cost increases. we believe the r&d that we just spoke about relative to the partnership is what's necessary to get over the finish line on endo in terms of our development.
we're not at the point where we've assessed the marketing needs, and that's on the comp. so the only cost step function that might be appropriate as the front end on marketing relating to endo, but look for top line growth with consistent cost discipline, and we think the majority of the r&d is covered by this research. the majority of r&d development discovery is going to be covered by this harvard dana-farber relationship that we're going to fund in the current year?
griffin soriano -- william blair and company -- analyst
ok. thank you for the questions.
nicole sandford -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
we have next question from the line of ross osborn with cantor fitzgerald. please go ahead.
ross osborn -- cantor fitzgerald -- analyst
hi. thanks for taking the question. starting off, could you walk through the 2q cadence and then how july shaped up maybe relative to june?
nicole sandford -- president and chief executive officer
hey there. thanks for the question. i'm sorry. could you just clarify what are you looking for on the first part?
ross osborn -- cantor fitzgerald -- analyst
how the volume progressed over the quarter, accelerating volumes month over month, and then how july and then even now how august volumes have turned?
nicole sandford -- president and chief executive officer
sure, sure. well, too soon to say much about august. in terms of volume for the second quarter, it was pretty consistent month to month, and we continue to see marginal growth in april, for sure. and frankly, july is never a great month, but we've actually seen strong volume in july so far.
so pretty even growth over the three months.
ross osborn -- cantor fitzgerald -- analyst
ok. got it. and then on the scarlet relationship, could you just walk through how that testing process works?
nicole sandford -- president and chief executive officer
yes. so again, i don't want to get too over my skis by describing somebody else's product, but how it essentially would work is as a mobile phlebotomy. so a patient can choose, instead of going to a draw station, to have a scarlet mobile phlebotomy visit and have a draw at their house. so it will help with people, or anywhere else for that matter work, whatever.
so it gives additional gives additional optionality for having blood drawn for tests like this. and also, what's really exciting is that the coverage is also inclusive of rural folks as well. so rural areas as well. so really nice national coverage, and we think will be helpful to get our tests to be more available to all women, which, as you know, is a big part of our mission.
ross osborn -- cantor fitzgerald -- analyst
ok. great. and then i guess, lastly, so it looks like the ovawatch timeline has narrowed down in the second half of this year to the fourth quarter. how should we think about the fourth quarter rollout of ovawatch?
nicole sandford -- president and chief executive officer
yes. so our plan is to spend the time between now and the launch, which we expect to be pretty early in the fourth quarter, to secure additional progress relative to reimbursement. we're submitting our clinical dossier in novitas in the next two weeks and then lots of work to do on reimbursement there. we're feeling very positive about the progress that we expect to make between now and the launch there.
so i think i would look at it as an early fourth quarter event. we've said that we are not counting on revenue this year for either ovawatch or the bioreference co-marketing arrangement. there could be some uplift there, but frankly, we just -- we didn't think it was appropriate to rely on that.
ross osborn -- cantor fitzgerald -- analyst
ok. got it. thanks for taking my questions.
nicole sandford -- president and chief executive officer
sure. thanks for the question.
operator
thank you. ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. and i'd like to turn the call back over to nicole sandford for closing remarks. over to you, ma'am.

nicole sandford -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, operator, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. we are very pleased to provide an update on our progress in the second quarter. joining me on the call today are bob beechey, our chief financial officer, and dr. ryan phan fan, our chief scientific and chief operating officer.
i will begin with an overview of our second quarter performance and an update on a number of important strategic developments. dr. phan will follow with an update on our product pipeline before handing the call to bob, who will provide a financial update. after our prepared remarks, we will then open the lines for a question-and-answer session.
last quarter, i shared my priorities for 2022. i told you then that my focus and the focus of the entire company would be on execution across three dimensions: growth, innovation, and operational excellence. while we still have much to do, i am happy to report encouraging progress in all three areas in the second quarter of 2022. let's begin with an update on our cash utilization as it sets an important context for the rest of the conversation.
when i joined the company, i made it a priority to align our spending and resources to the most important business needs. i ask my executive leadership team to exercise fiscal conservatism, but to do so without jeopardizing our strategic vision. we have made significant progress since then. in the second quarter of 2022, we utilized $6.4 million in cash, roughly 40% less than we utilized in the first quarter of 2022, and 16% less than the fourth quarter of 2021.
this was a major achievement that required the attention of every aspira team member, and i'm extremely proud of our progress. we achieved this reduction in utilization without sacrificing our growth or innovation goals, as you'll hear shortly. we continue to hire individuals to fill key roles, especially in the commercial and r&d organizations, and invest in the infrastructure required to increase our volume and deliver on our aspira synergy contracts. we plan to operate the business this way going forward.
i'll ask that you keep that reduced cash utilization number in mind as ryan, bob, and i detail our second quarter achievements. first, let's talk about growth. in q2, we broke through the $2 million revenue threshold for the first time in a single quarter with a volume of 5,411 tests performed. this represents an 11% increase in revenue over the first quarter of 2022 and an 18% increase over the same period in 2021.
our testing volume increased to 83 tests performed per day in q2 compared to 75 tests performed per day in q1. we achieved this growth while continuing to execute our previously disclosed commercial transformation, which i'm happy to report is largely complete. as of today, 67% of our sales professionals have been with the company for more than three months and 58% have been with us for more than six months. in the second quarter of 2022, approximately 593 physicians ordered an ova product for the first time, which is essentially flat with new ordering physicians in the first quarter.
we aim to increase the number of physicians ordering for the first time and do more to drive repeat orders from existing physicians. the latter will be a focus area for the rest of the year. bob will provide additional information about revenue and aup later in the call. while i'm happy to see the uptick in volume, i'm far from satisfied with overall revenue growth.
this quarter, i've spent time in the field with our reps and physicians, and i will continue to do so in the third quarter, to better understand challenges to adoption and overall growth. elsewhere on the growth front, aspira and bioreference established a national collaboration to co-market and distribute ova1plus. bioreference is one of the largest full-service specialty laboratories in the united states with a leading position in women's health, oncology, and urology, and 40 years of expertise in clinical diagnostics. we are targeting a launch of the arrangement no later than the fourth quarter of this year.
it is our expectation that the relationship will drive incremental volume in 2023 and beyond. both aspira and bioreference are deeply committed to enhancing health outcomes for women, and i've found the cultures to be very complementary. i believe this is the beginning of a mutually beneficial long-term relationship, and i'm working hard to ensure a strong start. separately, aspira women's health has established a stand-alone agreement with scarlet health, an innovative mobile phlebotomy solution, providing collections for aspira's patients from the comfort of their home.
as an update to the aspira synergy platform rollout, we are encouraged by adoption from our first physician super group, which i am now able to identify as women's care. we were able to design and implement a commercially reproducible solution in playbook for future aspira synergy opportunities while implementing an arrangement that has helped both women's care and aspira achieve their shared mission to expand patient access. now turning to innovation. it is my pleasure to welcome dr.
ryan phan to our call for the first time. dr. phan, can i ask you to briefly introduce yourself and then provide an update related to our product portfolio, including today's announcement of an expansion to our relationship with harvard's dana-farber cancer institute and a number of other academic institutions to include endometriosis in addition to our ongoing collaboration related to ovarian cancer. 
ryan phan -- chief scientific and operating officer
thank you, nicole. i'm honored to join aspira as chief scientific and operating officer after many rewarding years in leadership and academy institution, healthcare system, and more recently at caredx, where i was the senior vice president of lab service and medical director. as a member of caredx leadership executive team, i led the commercial testing operation, clinical development pipeline, manufacturing, supply chain, regulatory affairs and compliance, and automation and engineering divisions. in addition, i served as a licensed medical director of the company's clear cap laboratory and played a key role in the growth and expansion of the company's testing revenues and portfolio.
prior to joining caredx, i was managing director and head of regional molecular genetic pathology and cytogenetics at kaiser permanente in northern california. before that, i was effective member of the university of california los angeles and the los angeles va medical center. i received my bachelor's decrease from us uc berkeley and my phd from colombia university in new york. i completed my post-doctoral training harvard medical school, where i worked the cancer research entity panel and american society of hematology scholar.
i look forward to working with everyone at aspira to strengthen our innovation efforts, accelerate the expansion of our product portfolio, and scale our commercial testing service as we move forward. now let me turn to our product portfolio by reiterating our intention to launch ovawatch, our next generation ovarian cancer assessment by the end of the year. with its superior negative predictive value, ovawatch is noninvasive tests that provide additional data points for clinician initial assessment in women with an actual mass. this lab developed test will support physicians in making informed clinical decisions in the management of women with actual masses.
ovawatch represents a significant expansion of our potential patient population when compared with our existing fda-cleared ova1plus test, which are only approved for use in women with masses that have been referred for surgery. we estimate the total addressable market for ovawatch to be three or more times the resale market for ova1plus. as we previously disclosed, our paper entitled, analytical validation of a deep neural network algorithm for the detection of ovarian cancer were accepted for publication by jco clinical cancer informatics. while our ability to collect samples for the study were significantly impacted by covid surge over the past two years.
today, i can report that we recently completed enrollment of our multisite prospective study based on real-world data in support of our plan to launch ovawatch. we are in the final stage of analysis and are preparing a manuscript for peer review of application. we are satisfied that the data provided in the analytical and clinical valuation study will be sufficient to write decision and payer adoption. ovawatch and ova1plus will be marketed together as part of our newly reimaged ovarian cancer portfolio, we have branded as ova suite.
physician will be encouraged to consider an ova suite test for all women with an actual masses to provide a more informed clinical decision in the assessment and management of their patient risk for ovarian cancer. in this regard, a single test requisition form of ova suite will allow clinicians to determine which test is appropriate for their patient. we are on track to launch the product in the fourth quarter of this year and expect to see meaningful volume from ovawatch during the early months of 2023. we can also report on our ongoing efforts to support research related to the impact of rate on the detection of ovarian cancer.
sponsored by aspira's clinical research efforts in the philippines, a manuscript entitled, clinical performance of a multi-vari index assay in detecting early stage ovarian cancer in filipino women has been accepted for publication in the international journal of environment and health in its special issue on ovarian cancer preventive and treatment. the study was designed to validate the effectiveness of a multi-vari index assay of ova1plus in the assessment of ovarian cancer risk in filipino women.. as soon as the report is published, we will say it on our website. you will hear more about our suite of ovarian cancer offerings, including a presentation regarding the clinical application of ova1plus and overwatch on august 24 at 12 p.m.
eastern time when nicole and i host the webinar with dr. charles dunton, aspira's chief medical officer, dr. nicole williams of the gynecology institue of chicago, and dr. gerard reilly of axia women's health.
an invitation to the event were distributed by lifesci advisors. registration details can be found on the investor relations page of our website. moving on to our endometriosis product offerings, we are excited to announce that we have entered into a sponsored research agreement with harvard's dana-farber cancer institute, brigham & women's hospital, and medical university of lodz for the generation of a  multi-omic, non-invasive diagnostic aid to identify endometriosis based on circulating micrornas and proteins. we will collaborate with this prestigious group of well renowned institutions to identify candidate markers and build a series of diagnostic models for women being evaluated for possible endometriosis.
we intend for the collaboration to be completed, we anticipate the total cost of the partnership to be approximately $1.2 million. the resolve the technology to drive medical and clinical management women with our pelvic presenting a symptom of endometriosis and to limit surgical evaluation for those cases where noninvasive tests provide difficult or in-home surgical excision of endometriosis is clinically indicated. this research collaboration agreement will build on our extensive r&d efforts, and we have spent our assets to appropriate samples as well as scientific resources required to accelerate the commercialization of our endocheck diagnotic test. we believe this agreement help to ensure a launch of an endometriosis diagnostic test in 2023, which continue to be our goal.
we plan to host a second webinar to provide additional insight on our endometriosis test, and we'll announce the timing of that webinar. i now turn the bob beechey for a discussion about our financial performance. bob?
bob beechey -- chief financial officer
thank you, ryan. second quarter 2022 ova1plus revenue was $2 million, an increase of 17% year over year and a 10% increase sequentially. the revenue and volume numbers represent a record quarter for the company. the revenue per ova1plus test performed was $373 for the second quarter of 2022 compared to $378 during the second quarter of 2021 and $380 for the first quarter of 2022.
the year-on-year price and sequential 1% decrease in revenue per ova1plus test performed was driven by the mix of payer type would decrease patient pay collection for the second quarter of 2022, as well as our strategic initiative to serve the medicaid population, which currently has a lower price when compared to our average and representing a higher percentage of our revenue. our price for medicaid was $90 in the second quarter of 2022 and represented approximately 12% of volume. gross profit margin on ova1plus was 48.6% in the second quarter of 2022 compared to 52% for the same period in 2021 and 53.2% in the first quarter of 2022. the decreases were driven primarily by software license costs and maintenance costs.
research and development expenses for the three months ended june 30, 2022, were $1.4 million, roughly flat when compared to the prior year second quarter of $1.47 million and the first quarter 2022 spend of $1.35 million. the spending was focused primarily on product development costs related to ovawatch and endocheck. sales and marketing expenses were $3.6 million for the three months ended june 30, 2022, a decrease of $917,000 compared to the second quarter of 2021 and $439,000 compared to the first quarter of 2022. the decrease was driven by decreases in personnel costs associated with our first quarter reorganization, as well as reduced consulting costs.
general and administrative expenses were $4.2 million for the three months ended june 30, 2022. we incurred $3.3 million in general and administrative expenses in the prior year quarter and $4.4 million in the first quarter of 2022. the year-over-year variance is attributable to headcount and personnel expenses, while the sequential decrease is driven by reduced consulting costs. we ended the second quarter of 2022 with approximately $20.7 million in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash.
cash used in the second quarter of 2022 was $6.4 million. as nicole mentioned, we are focusing our investments on development of products with a near-term impact, namely ovawatch and endocheck, and enhancing our sales and marketing in preparation for the bioreference collaboration and the launch of ovawatch. this focus on execution has resulted in reductions in spend on more speculative long-term research and a reduction in awareness marketing which we concluded was not yielding adequate returns. in addition, we have rationalized our cost structure across all functions while maintaining appropriate quality, and we are pleased with the resulting cash utilization in the second quarter.
we expect to sustain our reduced cash utilization levels in the coming quarters. we expect to utilize in the range of 14 million to 15.5 million total during the second half of the year. this outlook includes cash that we expect to use to maintain our current staffing levels and the required investments to launch to ovawatch, kick off our partnership with bioreference, and continue discovery and development of endocheck. the cash utilization expectation does not contemplate any revenue contributions in the fourth quarter from the ovawatch launch or from the bioreference partnership initiation.
note, we do expect an increase in cash utilization in the third quarter compared to the second quarter of 2022 as we expect to fund endometriosis development of approximately $1.2 million. we expect the fourth quarter will then revert to levels in the range of the second quarter. we're examining all options for extending our cash runway, and we'll announce specific plans as appropriate. with that, i will now turn the call back over to nicole.
nicole?
nicole sandford -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, bob. and as a final update, let me introduce and welcome two new board members, dr. robert auerbach and ruby sharma. dr.
auerbach is the retired president of coopersurgical. he brings extensive clinical and executive experience in the medical industry, including experience as a director and as an executive officer. ms. sharma, the managing partner at rmb strategic advisors, brings decades of senior leadership, accounting and audit committee experience.
each brings different but equally critical skills and expertise to the board. bob's medical background and track record of success as an executive in the women's health sector, along with ruby's strategic mindset and extensive financial, business, and governance acumen, will be highly valuable to aspira as we accelerate our strategic execution in today's challenging environment. overall, we are pleased by our accomplishments this quarter and our strategic focus on growth, innovation and operational excellence. things you can expect from us in the coming months include: launch of our bioreference relationship in the second half of this year, launch of ovawatch in the fourth quarter of this year, launch of an endometriosis diagnostic test in the second half of 2023, and continued focus on cash utilization and sources of liquidity, with the expectation for cash usage to be between $14 million and $15.5 million for the balance of the year.
in closing, our executive team remains committed to our strategic vision, and we are focusing all of our efforts on execution for the remainder of 2022 and beyond. we've made tremendous progress, and more is yet to come. with that, i would like to now open the call for questions. operator?

operator
thank you very much. [operator instructions] we have a first question from the line of brian weinstein with william blair. please go ahead.
griffin soriano -- william blair and company -- analyst
good morning. this is griffin on for brian. thanks for the questions. maybe just to start on the sponsored research agreement for the endometriosis test.
just to clarify, is this product separate from endocheck, or more of an extension of the existing r&d work that you guys have already done? and then i think endo, the ldt launch was expected in '23. so i just want to better understand how this research agreement work compares to the endo product.
nicole sandford -- president and chief executive officer
sure. great. well, thanks for the question. i'll start, and then ryan, you can add your thoughts as appropriate.
so the sponsored research agreement is best characterized as an extension of our r&d efforts overall. so as i think we've talked about in prior calls, we have been looking for opportunities to accelerate and sort of ensure a launch of an endometriosis ldt in 2023. and this arrangement will give us access to resources and, importantly, specimens and expertise to complete both protein and microrna development work. so the exact ldt to be launched, we will obviously give more information about that when the time is appropriate.
but i think the way to think about it is the latter in your question, as an extension of our team and access to additional resources. ryan, anything to add to that?
ryan phan -- chief scientific and operating officer
no, i think you covered it, nicole. thank you for the question.
griffin soriano -- william blair and company -- analyst
ok. and then on the bioreference lab comarketing distribution agreement, i know it might be limited in what you can say, but can you give us a sense of maybe how many reps on their side will be carrying the ova1 product? and with your focus being more on depth in the second half year in driving adoption, utilization against existing docks, is that -- are they going to be helpful here? will that also be these reps focused? and then any details on the economics of this agreement, the revenue share potential margin impact would be helpful.
nicole sandford -- president and chief executive officer
yes. so it's challenging to give anything that's going to satisfy you in terms of details. so i apologize in advance for that. but i will say, we're extremely satisfied with the commitment that bioreference has made to us in terms of their promotion of this relationship and our products with their sales team, and i really can't comment on the -- it wouldn't be appropriate for me to comment on the size of their sales team.
all i can say is they've been incredibly supportive, and we found the cultural fit between what we're each trying to achieve with this relationship has been extremely positive. so we feel really confident that they're going to do what they can to drive adoption within their -- both within their sales force, but then obviously, importantly, within their customer base. and the economics are consistent with our current ova1plus sales, although i would ask bob to just confirm that there's nothing else you'd want to say on that.
bob beechey -- chief financial officer
i would just comment that our expectation is that it's attractive to both sides, and we expect our margin profile to be consistent.
griffin soriano -- william blair and company -- analyst
ok. i appreciate that. and then just last one here on the capital situation, the burn was down nicely year-over-year. and bob i appreciate the color on sort of second half expectations.
maybe can you just talk a little broadly about how you're thinking about the cash burn in 2023 and ultimately addressing what will likely be a financing need?
bob beechey -- chief financial officer
well, we haven't given guidance for q3 -- i mean, for 2023. obviously, the major catalysts are the brl relationship and the ovawatch launch. so we would expect top line, sequentially, year on year, to be meaningfully higher, and we don't anticipate any significant cost increases. we believe the r&d that we just spoke about relative to the partnership is what's necessary to get over the finish line on endo in terms of our development.
we're not at the point where we've assessed the marketing needs, and that's on the comp. so the only cost step function that might be appropriate as the front end on marketing relating to endo, but look for top line growth with consistent cost discipline, and we think the majority of the r&d is covered by this research. the majority of r&d development discovery is going to be covered by this harvard dana-farber relationship that we're going to fund in the current year?
griffin soriano -- william blair and company -- analyst
ok. thank you for the questions.
nicole sandford -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
we have next question from the line of ross osborn with cantor fitzgerald. please go ahead.
ross osborn -- cantor fitzgerald -- analyst
hi. thanks for taking the question. starting off, could you walk through the 2q cadence and then how july shaped up maybe relative to june?
nicole sandford -- president and chief executive officer
hey there. thanks for the question. i'm sorry. could you just clarify what are you looking for on the first part?
ross osborn -- cantor fitzgerald -- analyst
how the volume progressed over the quarter, accelerating volumes month over month, and then how july and then even now how august volumes have turned?
nicole sandford -- president and chief executive officer
sure, sure. well, too soon to say much about august. in terms of volume for the second quarter, it was pretty consistent month to month, and we continue to see marginal growth in april, for sure. and frankly, july is never a great month, but we've actually seen strong volume in july so far.
so pretty even growth over the three months.
ross osborn -- cantor fitzgerald -- analyst
ok. got it. and then on the scarlet relationship, could you just walk through how that testing process works?
nicole sandford -- president and chief executive officer
yes. so again, i don't want to get too over my skis by describing somebody else's product, but how it essentially would work is as a mobile phlebotomy. so a patient can choose, instead of going to a draw station, to have a scarlet mobile phlebotomy visit and have a draw at their house. so it will help with people, or anywhere else for that matter work, whatever.
so it gives additional gives additional optionality for having blood drawn for tests like this. and also, what's really exciting is that the coverage is also inclusive of rural folks as well. so rural areas as well. so really nice national coverage, and we think will be helpful to get our tests to be more available to all women, which, as you know, is a big part of our mission.
ross osborn -- cantor fitzgerald -- analyst
ok. great. and then i guess, lastly, so it looks like the ovawatch timeline has narrowed down in the second half of this year to the fourth quarter. how should we think about the fourth quarter rollout of ovawatch?
nicole sandford -- president and chief executive officer
yes. so our plan is to spend the time between now and the launch, which we expect to be pretty early in the fourth quarter, to secure additional progress relative to reimbursement. we're submitting our clinical dossier in novitas in the next two weeks and then lots of work to do on reimbursement there. we're feeling very positive about the progress that we expect to make between now and the launch there.
so i think i would look at it as an early fourth quarter event. we've said that we are not counting on revenue this year for either ovawatch or the bioreference co-marketing arrangement. there could be some uplift there, but frankly, we just -- we didn't think it was appropriate to rely on that.
ross osborn -- cantor fitzgerald -- analyst
ok. got it. thanks for taking my questions.
nicole sandford -- president and chief executive officer
sure. thanks for the question.
operator
thank you. ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. and i'd like to turn the call back over to nicole sandford for closing remarks. over to you, ma'am.
nicole sandford -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, everyone, for joining us today. we look forward to seeing all of you on our kol event on august 24.
