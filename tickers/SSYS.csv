thank you. at this time we will be conducting the question-and-answer session. [operator instructions] our first question is coming from the line of shannon cross with cross research. please proceed with your question.
shannon cross -- cross research -- analyst
thank you very much. i was curious if you can give us a bit more color into what you're hearing from your customers that makes you comfortable about second half recovery? and specifically i'm curious, you've got three new platforms launching this year without a lot of trade shows or who knows how this is going to work. how confident are you that there will be a pickup that supports that? and then i have a follow-up. thank you.
yoav zeif -- chief executive officer
hey, shannon. thank you for the questions. if you ask, we feel confident because there was kind of a bottleneck over the last year. we are engaging with our customers, we are there with them, we have constant interaction with them. once the recovery is there, and we start seeing the light at the end of the tunnel with like a whole set of projects that they would like to run. of course, it's coming also with the impact of their end markets, but we are optimistic on this one based on what we received from them and better the list [phonetic] of projects that they have. the way we look at it now, we are looking at a linear growth quarter-over-quarter.
shannon cross -- cross research -- analyst
through the year linear?
yoav zeif -- chief executive officer
yeah.
shannon cross -- cross research -- analyst
okay. and is there any particular segment or geography where you're seeing the most opportunity for improvement?
yoav zeif -- chief executive officer
we see improvement across the board. of course, healthcare is much stronger and we see already the recovery, and in some cases even higher than initial pre-pandemic sales. and we see improvement going forward in our strongest segments, which are aerospace, automotive, education.
shannon cross -- cross research -- analyst
and geographically? and then that finishes my questions.
yoav zeif -- chief executive officer
i would say that, overall we see recovery on all fronts, across different territories. but as we already mentioned last year, asia, then europe and then the u.s. more or less this is the sequence.
shannon cross -- cross research -- analyst
okay. thank you very much.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from ananda baruah with loop capital markets. please proceed with your question.
ananda baruah -- loop capital markets -- analyst
hi. good morning, guys. appreciate you guys taking the question, and congrats on the solid results and good start to the year. yoav, just a follow-up to shannon's question, could you provide any additional context on what the growth trajectory as we move into the second half of the year could look like? i know it's a long ways away. but any context that would help us frame how you guys are thinking about it would be helpful. and then i have a follow-up.
yoav zeif -- chief executive officer
we already mentioned it, i'm happy to repeat. the way we look at it, q1 relatively flat, q2 mid-teen and then h2, where we are planning to launch the new platform. at h2, we see sequential growth, quite solid sequential growth.
ananda baruah -- loop capital markets -- analyst
quite solid sequential, ok. and then as we think about this remarks in the press release, just around sort of growth accelerating in '22 and beyond. and you gave the metric about sort of longer-term manufacturing growth north of 20%. could you give us any other context around how -- when you say accelerating '22 and beyond, how you'd like us to come to understand that? accelerating, does that mean for manufacturing greater than the 20%? and then what about the rest of the business? just any context there would be really helpful given the language in the press release?
yoav zeif -- chief executive officer
so, we are doing our best to focus our search as a company, but also be sure that we are aligned with the market. and this is why we came with this new metrics, which is our share of sales to manufacturing. and we are currently over 25% and that will be the main growth generator going forward. so we see it this year -- growing this year, growing in the low-double digit and then about 20% a year. and you add to it the whole market that is growing, also we have the strongest in the market, in prototyping, and that creates really very clear strong growth engine for the future that will catalyst our growth where manufacturing is leading the way.
and the manufacturing, as you know, it's the dlp, the new origin portfolio, which is best-in-class in terms of quality of parts and suitability for manufacturing and design 3d platform as they sell a platform. so those are the growth engine. we bid on our infrastructure to pave the way of the industry into manufacturing.
ananda baruah -- loop capital markets -- analyst
okay. thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from jim ricchiuti with needham & company. please proceed with your question.
jim ricchiuti -- needham & company -- analyst
hi, thank you, and thanks for that metric on manufacturing in terms of the contribution last year. what would that have looked like in 2019, the percentage of your revenue that you were deriving from manufacturing?
yoav zeif -- chief executive officer
so, this metric we are following and we build a methodology to follow it going forward. so, we are not sharing anything backward looking, but only forward looking. but we think it's a very important metric for the entire industry as a whole as well.
jim ricchiuti -- needham & company -- analyst
great. okay, thank you. just with respect to the acquisition on the sla side. how would you -- maybe contrast the neo product that they have with your own v650, it sounds like, is your existing sla printer, is that mainly for prototyping? is there a bigger opportunity with this acquisition to perhaps get into some more and use manufacturing applications?
yoav zeif -- chief executive officer
we are just complementing our offering. we have a strategy, we are following our strategy, our strategy to be the first choice, polymer manufacturing for everyone across the whole product lifecycle. and since this is our strategy, the sla and rps, which is an amazing line of product, i mean, suitable for our strategy in polymer. we -- its complete our offering, and it has both large prototyping application, but a lot of also end use parts, tooling, manufacturing, like aligners, like investment casting and also significant applications in healthcare. like healthcare, like medical modeling for example, for large part and single material. so it's a full completion of our product line, and we have a clear roadmap which application, which machine, where we are going.
jim ricchiuti -- needham & company -- analyst
thank you.
operator
thank you. the next question is coming from noelle dilts with stifel. please proceed with your question.
noelle dilts -- stifel -- analyst
thanks and congratulations on a good quarter in a tough environment. my first question, i was hoping you could just expand on how you're thinking about m&a moving forward? and just touch on the pipeline of opportunities and where you see some opportunity to further complement your current offering? thanks.
yoav zeif -- chief executive officer
we have a strategy and part of the strategy is inorganic growth. we have very clear criteria, what we are looking for and how to invest and in what to invest, and we are keep evaluating potential investments that will maximum the value -- maximize the value both for the company and for our shareholders. we are very attractive to start-ups with disruptive technologies, because we are bringing the platform and we are bringing the go-to-market. and we have the unique ability to show their time-to-market. and this is an asset that you rarely find in our industry, because we have all those amazing network globally with experts across the globe. and when we are approaching start-up, it's not only about the money, it's not only about the cash, it's a lot about the prospect that we are bringing with us. and we also build a whole operating model that will allow us and allowing us right now to integrate those service.
noelle dilts -- stifel -- analyst
thank you. and then secondly, i understand the higher jump in operating expenses as we look at 2021 and things normalize. could you speak to how you're thinking about some of that leverage moving in '22 and beyond that you referenced as there sort of a goal or a model that you're looking to target in terms of leverage on operating expenses as you move forward? thanks.
lilach payorski -- chief financial officer
good morning, noelle. it's definitely a good question. we're complementary to what you have mentioned, that we have a strong infrastructure from corporate perspective as well as go-to-market perspective that can be easily absorb new technologies and new businesses, and we definitely planning to leverage these and leverage in the second ventures of scale as we move forward. in 2021, you'll not necessarily can see that yet, because our growth revenue level is not in the level that we still expect due to covid. but as we go beyond '21 and '22 or '23, while production -- application revenue will grow, we'll be able to leverage on that. we are not providing any specific metrics, but we do expect to see much more profitability going forward.
noelle dilts -- stifel -- analyst
okay. thanks very much.
operator
thank you. the next question comes from greg palm with craig-hallum capital group. please proceed with your question.
greg palm -- craig-hallum capital group -- analyst
yeah. great, thanks. i guess, just starting the guidance commentary, it's very helpful. but specifically for q2, it implies just slight revenue growth over q1, normally you see a much bigger jump sequentially from q1 to q2. and i guess, i would think, this year, based on your commentary, it might be disproportionately high, just sort of given where we are in the recovery. so i don't know maybe it's just timing related, your thoughts about the second half being stronger, but can you just help us understand why you're not expecting better growth sequentially in q2?
lilach payorski -- chief financial officer
good morning, greg. the numbers do represent a relatively a low sequential compared to q1. and we -- but we are definitely encouraged with the sequential growth that we saw in q4, and the strong rebound of hardware that we're going to see in q1. and what we expect also in the second quarter is continue to see this growth, remind you that covid is still here. it's not that we actually fallback with all our end market, the industry that are much more effective is the auto and the commercial aerospace. so, we cautiously optimistic regarding the future and that's why we believe that to be cautiously optimistic now will provide mid-teen for next year -- for next -- for the second quarter as compared to last year. but as the economic recover, we will come back and provide a better projection.
greg palm -- craig-hallum capital group -- analyst
yup. okay, understood. and maybe just a little bit more commentary on origin would be helpful. i'm just kind of curious what the feedback has been from kind of the customer base from sort of the resellers? and if we look ahead, i mean, if you are successful in generating the $200 million of annual business, what's the cadence of that contribution look like maybe starting next year, up until '25, which i think is the timeline you provided so far?
yoav zeif -- chief executive officer
great question. thank you. the first thing that happen after we announced about the origin acquisition, i opened my email box and i received two emails from two important customers, complementing us for the acquisition and asking for a call. i know, it's an anecdote, but this is reflection of what's going out there. we are going to manufacturing, origin is already being perceived as a leading next-generation dlp platform, focusing on manufacturing, they have installed base, they have machines out there, supporting manufacturing with an ecosystem of material. and the moment they joined forces with stratasys and our infrastructure, our customers and also new logos, what we call, are perceived as a big opportunity to advance manufacturing. so this is the overall perspective. in terms of revenues, we are going to launch the platform at the second half of the year and we are very optimistic.
greg palm -- craig-hallum capital group -- analyst
okay, all right. i'll hop back in queue. thanks.
operator
thank you. our next question is coming from wamsi mohan with bank of america merrill lynch. please proceed with your question.
wamsi mohan -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
hi, yes. thank you. you're saying that the industry is entering an inflection point, typically in tech markets inflection is driven by some change in technology whether it is speed or quality or availability of materials. what actually is changing and what your customers are doing, that's giving you this confidence in surge in manufacturing? i mean, you noted origin's portfolio is very good with dlp, but dlp is being around for a long time to have an installed base. so what is that that you think? is this more about distribution of technology from your perspective? or do you think that there is something more fundamental, especially if this is an industry call on how there is such a large inflection in growth rates for manufacturing applications? and i have a follow-on.
yoav zeif -- chief executive officer
i would say that it's a combination. we are in an inflection point because of few very important factors. one, the technology today is not similar to the technology five years ago. also in dlp, dlp is a great example. when you get into the details of the technology, the speed, the accuracy and mainly the material, it's a different volume. this is a great example, but it's relevant for the entire industry. so the technology is ready to start stepping into manufacturing, it's a big change.
the second one is the realism of so many manufacturer out there. post-pandemic we need to create versatility, we need localization, we need to make sure that we have flexibility and first response and ability really to face weather crisis, pandemic, the ability to localize things, not to have inventory, so this promise is currently brought to life. so this is the second change. and we are engaging with it, and it's very, very tangible in every discussion that i have with the customers.
and thirdly, there is this issue of shifting into new products, new offerings. for example, electric vehicles, you'll need weight. the -- reducing weight is critical for the range of the battery, for everything there. and the manufacturers are looking for new ways of producing parts. and you can produce part with additive manufacturing, geometries, mechanical properties, etc., that were not possible in the past. for example, moving from metals to carbon fiber and composites, for the sake of weight.
so if you take those three, and there are many others, but if you take those three, stronger, much better technology with strong realism that supply chain can be broken, and we need to react, plus the tech changes all over the world that required new path, new geometries, new way of thinking about the physical aspects of products, that's create together an inflection point.
wamsi mohan -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
okay. thanks, yoav. i appreciate the color there. if i may follow-up. there are some of your competitors out there that claim that manufacturing is really much more centered around metals versus what you just spoke about the shift to carbon fiber, say. in your best guess on sort of what the addressable market splits are for manufacturing, how much would you say is manufacturing that would be subsumed by the metals additive manufacturing versus polymer? and thanks for giving the split of the 25% of revenue for a manufacturing. how is that split between product materials and services? thank you.
yoav zeif -- chief executive officer
look, we are not analyst here on this one, and we're focusing on polymer, and i can be very short. of course, i can quote many analysts and many different studies that address your question, but you can read it better than me. in general, today when you look at hardware for sure. and also going forward, we are talking about 70% -- around 70% polymer and 30% metal. this is in terms of revenue hardware, for example. going forward, polymer is expected to grow a bit faster than metal, which was not the case in the last five years, because many people experienced metal. but there is one clear trend, metal parts are being replaced with polymer parts and not vice versa.
wamsi mohan -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from troy jensen with lake street capital. please proceed with your question.
troy jensen -- lake street capital -- analyst
hey, congrats on the great results. i just want to follow-up on jim's question from earlier regarding the v650 part -- excuse me, the rps acquisition, the element and how it relates to v650? i think that strategy v650 was an open platform of materials. i'm just curious if rps and lm [phonetic] are going to be closed proprietary, and how much of the materials that they generate are -- that they use are internally manufacturing versus partnered?
yoav zeif -- chief executive officer
hey, troy, good to hear from you. and yes, very simple answer, it's going to be an open platform, but we are going to develop new materials, unique materials, in partnership with third parties, actually with the largest material companies in the world. we are working on it and it's going to be an open material system, what we called hybrid material model.
troy jensen -- lake street capital -- analyst
okay, understood. and then just a follow-up. i know you're launching three new platforms here, xaar, lm and rps. can you just talk about organic product development? and historically you've shown an aluminum product and you get others kind of in development. but can we expect to see some internally developed products from stratasys also?
yoav zeif -- chief executive officer
yes, for sure. we keep investing in our business. we are building pipelines -- sorry, you wanted to ask something?
troy jensen -- lake street capital -- analyst
i was going to say new tech, new platforms or just enhancements of existing platforms?
yoav zeif -- chief executive officer
both. for example, in polyjet, we just launched the j55, but this is a platform, so you will see shortly extension to this product line for different segments. we guess -- this is an amazing machine in terms of reliability, in term of quality of printing, in terms of meantime between failure, it's really unique, best-in-class with features and value to the customers that no one had. and we are keep investing in this platform, you'll see extension, bigger, smaller, different segment etc.
fdm, we are going for manufacturing. this is the core strength of stratasys. this is our core position in manufacturing, is in fdm. and we are leveraging this position because we understand the need, we understand the [indecipherable], we understand the regulation, we understand the reliability, the service. and we are building the ultimate manufacturing machine in fdm for end use parts. and we are investing in it, and you will see it in the future.
troy jensen -- lake street capital -- analyst
good luck this year.
operator
thank you. our next question is coming from brian drab with william blair. please proceed with your question.
brian drab -- william blair -- analyst
hi, thank you for taking my questions. i may have missed this, because i was forced to join late today. but did you define exactly what we're talking about when we say manufacturing revenue and does that include fixtures, tooling and other things used within a manufacturing environment, as well as end use parts? and if you are talking about end use parts, could you give any specific examples of types of parts we're talking about?
yoav zeif -- chief executive officer
the answer is, yes. it's including everything which can be under the umbrella of end use parts. tooling is something people are using. so, the -- everything like parts for robots, dental, align everything that is being used and it's not a prototype, from our perspective, is manufacturing. so, you can take any example for aero, cabin parts or other parts for aero, automotive, electric vehicle parts, tooling for robots, carbon fiber for any heavy-duty tools or jigs and fixtures, medical modeling that we are doing with our polyjet. we have the most unique capabilities of multi-material, multi-color to simulate real organs without a doubt, digital anatomic printing. this is also end use parts. so our definition is end use parts.
brian drab -- william blair -- analyst
got it. yes. that's helpful. and then i just want to clarify, i didn't fully understand the answer or didn't follow. but specifically for origin, will that be maintained as an open materials or hybrid materials model as well as rp?
yoav zeif -- chief executive officer
yes. hybrid model like we announced in december. it's going to be a hybrid material model, combining our material, partners material and also the ability to use the machines for research and development of new materials.
brian drab -- william blair -- analyst
okay. thank you very much.
operator
thank you. we have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. so i'd like to turn the floor back over to yoav for any additional closing comments.
yoav zeif -- chief executive officer
thank you for joining us. stay safe and healthy. looking forward to updating you again next quarter. thank you.

now, i would like to turn the call over to our ceo, yoav zeif. yoav?
yoav zeif -- chief executive officer
thank you, yonah. good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. it is an exciting time to be a leader in the 3d printing industry. both our industry and our company are expected to enter a meaningful sustained trajectory of unprecedented growth in the years ahead. additive manufacturing is experiencing increased demand from multiple sectors of the global economy, driven by secular change from industrial technology, automotive, healthcare and many other markets. industry analysts project a forward five years cagr in excess of 20%, with continued strong growth well into the end of the decade.
turning to our results for the fourth quarter, we again delivered sequential quarterly improvement in both revenue, up over 11%, and operating cash flow, which was $23.7 million, our highest level since the first quarter of 2018. these are positive indications that we are in the early phases of a recovery from the impact of the covid-19 pandemic. as we look ahead, we expect to be able to build on this momentum. at stratasys, we are well positioned to grow. we have a strong balance sheet with no debt, that is set to support future growth. we believe that prudently investing capital, back into the business will result in meaningful accelerated revenue, earnings and cash flow in the years ahead.
in august, we shared our new strategy to lead the polymer 3d printing market by delivering the most innovative next-generation technologies that address the fastest-growing manufacturing application, all while leveraging the strongest go-to-market infrastructure in our industry. we are confident this is the right approach to position us to drive sustained revenue and profitability growth. manufacturing is by far the largest addressable market. we know firsthand from our existing business that manufacturing applications typically have higher utilization rate than prototyping application. manufacturing drive increased recurring revenue from consumables, which results in a higher value opportunity for stratasys.
we have several key advantages that will help us successfully deliver on our strategy and enhance shareholders value. these include: the broadest offering with the most advanced innovative, best-in-class technologies for every step in the customers product lifecycle, from concept through manufacturing; unmatched market access through a network of over 200 channel partners, the largest and most experienced in the industry; deep application engineering expertise that helps drive innovation; a resilient business model designed to scale; and a growing software partner ecosystem to bring the important added value to our customer base.
turning to 2020, i want to recognize the hard work and dedication of the entire stratasys team, as we have worked through the covid-19 pandemic. our resilient team continues to meet each challenge head-on to create opportunities that has become catalyst for change. as we navigate through the challenging economic environment, we are emerging as an even stronger company.
i assumed the role of chief executive officer one year ago. and since that time, we have achieved several important accomplishments, including the implementation of our new strategy around polymers which is the biggest profit opportunity in 3d printing in our view. specifically, we aligned our business around delivering the most comprehensive solution for manufacturing applications.
the acquisition of origin, the best-in-class photopolymer solution for production-oriented applications that we believe will be a key growth driver as we pivot to manufacturing solution and enhance our target markets. as we have previously communicated, while we plan to deliver the first sales through our channel later this year, origin is going to be a more meaningful revenue growth driver starting in 2022 and is expected to generate up to $200 million in new annual business by 2025. we are excited about the opportunities that this platform can deliver to the market and the positive impact it should bring to our business.
the enhancing of the company's operating model to be application centric, which creates focus and allow us to better leverage synergies. cost rationalization, that resulted in $30 million of the annual run rate savings, enabling us to reinvest in higher profit areas of the business. and finally, the reconstitution of the management team and board of directors to strengthen our leadership and oversight. the opportunity to increase the share of manufacturing within our overall revenues from the production of end use part is significant. this is a multi-trillion dollar market and we believe 3d printing penetration is in the low-single-digit today.
we are just getting started. based on our estimate in 2020, we generated more than 25% of our revenue from manufacturing solutions. we believe that the share of of our revenue for manufacturing will expand in the coming years, as we begin offering our new manufacturing focused products later this year that includes photopolymerization and powder bed fusion. we also expect to add updated version of our high-end fdm system in healthcare and dental application solutions. we expect this to drive low-double-digit growth in manufacturing revenue this year and over 20% annually in the medium to long term. we look forward to updating you annually on this metric.
looking at some of the milestones of the fourth quarter, in addition to acquiring origin in december 2020, we also advanced the development of a powder bed fusion platform through our joint venture with xaar, which we continue to expect to launch in 2021. we expect this system to provide us entry into an extended set of manufacturing applications beyond what is available with our current system. and we look forward to providing more details soon.
we have also made great strides creating a software ecosystem that will help scale additive manufacturing and integrate with our customers' industry 4.0 initiatives. for example, [indecipherable] is helping both fdm and origin customers design parts for advanced manufacturing quickly, in ways not possible through traditional manufacturing. our integration with keyshot is now helping accelerate adoption of full-color multi-material polyjet 3d printing. and our grabcad sdk enables our fdm system to fully participate in the smart, integrated factory floor.
two weeks ago, we acquired rps, a u.k.-based company with a top-quality stereolithography product line that complement our current portfolio. this technology is used for multiple applications, including tooling, jigs and fixtures, investment casting, dental aligners, medical modeling and design engineering. we aim to be the first choice for polymer additive manufacturing, offering a full suite of solution that can support the entire product lifecycle from concept to production. with the rps system in our portfolio, we are able to take advantage of new opportunities to offer more solution to our customers. we expect our acquisition of rps to be slightly accretive to revenue and earnings by year-end.
we also recently announced the addition of carbon fiber to the materials available on our award-winning f123 printer series. this offering deliver the strength and lightweight advantages of carbon fiber for tooling and other applications, and can be an excellent replacement for heavier and more expensive metal parts, now in the more accessible f123 platform.
in turn, customers are continuing to express the confidence in stratasys. for example, in automotive, as we announced in november, volkswagen is driving innovation within new vehicle design, thanks to our j850 printers. in consumer electronics, google is seeing similar benefits for its jacquard wearable platform. in aerospace, boeing recently qualified our pekk-based antero 800na thermoplastic, so that high temperature fdm materials can now be used on flights parts. it is the first material from stratasys qualified by boeing for use in applications with elevated chemical resistance or fatigue requirements. these ongoing investments and partnerships help reinforce stratasys as a leader in the industry and position us to grow for many years to come.
to sum up, as we begin 2021, the pandemic continues to pressure the industry and our business. however, we expect pent-up demand to begin emerging in the back half of the year. as we shared through 2020, the closing of our customers' offices and factories slowed the utilization of our systems, directly impacting the rate of consumable usage and services. but based on the past two quarters of growth, especially in consumables, we are cautiously optimistic that this recovery will continue as we move through 2021.
i will now turn the call over to lila, who'll share the financial results of the quarter. lila?
lilach payorski -- chief financial officer
thank you, yoav, and good morning, everyone. we are pleased to have delivered sequential recovery in the back half of 2020, with growth in revenue, gross margin improvement and strong cash generation, along with inventory reduction. these are good signs that we are experiencing an economic recovery in the wake of the covid-19 pandemic. and we look forward to the future as the macro economy we build in the coming years.
for the fourth quarter, total revenue was $142.4 million and 11.3% sequential increase from the third quarter based on an initial rebound in both systems and consumables across all regions. this compares to $160.2 million for the same period last year, a decline of 11.1%, primarily due to the impact of the pandemic. on a constant currency basis, total revenue declined 12.6% versus the fourth quarter of 2019.
product revenue in the fourth quarter was $99.2 million, a decrease of 9% compared to the same period last year, or 10.7% on a constant currency basis. within product revenue, system revenue decreased 8.3% compared to the same period last year and decreased 9.8% on a constant currency basis. consumables revenue decreased by 9.6% compared to the same period last year and decreased 11.6% on a constant currency basis.
services revenues were $43.2 million, a decrease of 15.6% compared to the same period last year. on a constant currency basis, service revenues declined 16.6%. within services revenue, customer support revenue decreased by 3.7% compared to the same period last year and decreased 5.6% on a constant currency basis.
gaap gross margin was 46.4% for the quarter compared to 49.1% for the same period last year. non-gaap gross margin was 49.5% for the quarter compared to 52.4% for the same period last year. gaap gross margin improved sequentially from q3 by 750 basis points. non-gaap gross margin improved by 270 basis points, primarily due to higher amount of systems and consumables in the sales mix.
gaap operating expenses were $68.5 million an improvement of $13.4 million or 16.3% compared to the same period last year. non-gaap operating expenses were $62.2 million, an improvement of $11.6 million or 15.7% compared to the same period last year. non-gaap operating expense was 43.7% for the quarter compared to 46.1% for the same period last year. the improvement in operating expenses was due primarily to the proactive resizing measures we took in the second quarter of 2020. we also continued the cost mitigation efforts related to the pandemic through the balance of 2020, with the entire company working in effective four-day work week.
from earnings perspective, gaap operating loss for the quarter was $2.5 million compared to a loss of $3.3 million for the same period last year. non-gaap operating income for the quarter was $8.3 million compared to $10.2 million for the same period last year. gaap net income for the quarter was $11 million, or $0.20 per diluted share, compared to net loss of $2.8 million, or $0.05 per diluted share for the same period last year. non-gaap net income for the quarter was $7 million, or $0.13 per diluted share, compared to $10 million, or $0.18 per diluted share in the same period last year.
we generated $23.7 million of cash from operation during the fourth quarter, the highest amount since the first quarter of 2018, as compared to using $3.4 million of cash in the same quarter last year. this was driven by strong collection and reduction in spending and inventory levels. we ended the quarter with $299.1 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term deposits compared to $308.2 million at the end of the third quarter of 2020. we achieved this despite the cash portion of approximately $30 million related to the origin acquisition. we believe we are well positioned to effectively navigate the pandemic, and to capitalize on value-enhancing market opportunity, given our strong balance sheet with no debt, while focusing on cost controls and cash generation.
given the business dynamic and the uncertainty surrounding the timing and the extent of an anticipated recovery from the pandemic, we are providing the following information regarding our outlook. we are encouraged that our current quarter is tracking relatively similar to the first quarter of 2020, with notable positive growth in system sales, unlike the negative impact of the pandemic on system sales that we saw in the first quarter of 2020. maintaining relatively flat sales even without meaningful participation from key sectors like automotive and commercial aerospace drives our confidence in potential upside as we move through the year. in those two industries, capital spending is not yet returned to pre-covid level. and utilization rate of our consumables in general across the entire business are still lagging due to covid.
looking ahead, assuming current consumption trends continue and the impact of the pandemic persist, we expect our second quarter to track growth in the mid-teens compared to the second quarter last year. we expect to provide updated revenue guidance later in the year as we get more clarity around evolving economic conditions.
turning to operating expenses, we made a strategic decision to invest for both the near-term and the future by bringing back our team to a full-time schedule starting january 1. incurring costs ahead of revenue growth expected to be generate from both the recovery of our current business and the launch of our new technologies. with our employees back full time, the associated expense of operating the business to support our growth ramp have also returned. these plus the impact of our acquisition along with resource allocation decisions made to help offset some of these incremental costs which support the future growth engines, will result in $25 million to $30 million in incrementally higher operating costs as compared to 2020, but still below our 2019 costs. we believe that this strategic investment will yield material growth as the new technologies proliferate in the market, which will lead to significant operating leverage.
in closing, 2021 will be a year of investment for growth. the combination of these organic investments, along with our recent strategic acquisition, and specifically the focus on manufacturing, positions stratasys to deliver substantial revenue and profitability growth in the future. we also expect that most of this future growth will come from manufacturing application.
with that, let me turn the call back over to yoav for closing remark. yoav?
yoav zeif -- chief executive officer
thank you, lila. i will conclude today's call by noting that we believe the additive manufacturing industry is poised for a period of exceptional growth, and we expect stratasys to lead the way in polymer 3d printing. our internal reorganization, coupled with organic efforts and strategic acquisition like origin, position us to further broaden our leadership and to outperform over the long term.
with that, let's open it up for questions. operator?

[operator remarks] our first question today is coming from shannon cross from cross research. your line is now live.
shannon cross -- cross research -- analyst
thank you very much. i just wanted to ask, i guess i'll ask both questions. the first is with regard to product sales, or system sales, can you just provide a little more feedback to us on exactly who are buying, what's coming in, how much of this was pent-up demand versus new demand, because of some of the products you've launched? and then with regard to consumables sales, given the mix of systems that you're selling, can you give us an idea of how long it will take to see some of the follow-on consumables sales, and your confidence level and maybe usage rates on the products? thank you.
lilach payorski -- chief financial officer
good morning, shannon, and some flavor on our system sales, i will start with that. we definitely saw hardware strength growth across all our platforms and region in the quarter. so there is no single product or customer that drove the favorable results. we really see it across all of our -- growth all our business, definitely this growth demonstrate signs of end-markets recovery compared to 2020 where system sales were lowest in the first quarter. this was due to the impact of covid-19 starting in the back half of the quarter, where our sales are typically the strongest. so that's why, basically you see a very strong, and this quarter demonstrates a recovery that we are happy to see here.
important to know, the system growth will be early driver for growth in the year. with the introduction of the new product, consumables will follow. i would like to remind you that our new product will introduce more at the second part of the year and will make a more impact in q4 as opposed to the first part of the year. but as i mentioned, very encouraged with the recovery sign that we saw already now and sure that consumable will follow. another thing important to note that system sales began to improve by the end of q2 last year. so while we expect system growth to continue throughout 2021, the comparable percentages rate will naturally come down over the course of the year, but we do expect to see an notable growth during the year.
now, i will address the consumables. the consumables, we're encouraged to see continuous recovery as we saw also in q4, as also we saw in q3. it's still below 2020 level. as a reminder, in q1 2020, consumable and services will attract relatively business as usual, since covid hit, started to hit most of the end of the quarter. so substantially, we had almost a full quarter as a comparison unlike q1 '21, where covid still impacts during the full quarter. as we are looking ahead for the year, we expect consumables to grow sequentially based on the trajectory of the macroeconomic with the expectation that consumptions will come back to pre-covid level probably at the beginning of 2020.
yoav zeif -- chief executive officer
2022.
lilach payorski -- chief financial officer
2022, sorry.
yoav zeif -- chief executive officer
maybe just to add, hi shannon, maybe just to add, overall definitely -- hey shannon, definitely there is a pent-up demand, very good to be in such a place, because it's across all regions and platforms. of course, there are some differences between the different sectors, so commercial aerospace and government are slower to raise, mainly because of the commercial aerospace situation and the new administration in the u.s., but we see the recovery coming in the next quarter on the government side, and of course, healthcare and dental like we discussed before, are early to recover and what is new in q1 was that education really joined the healthcare and dental in terms of fast recovery.
shannon cross -- cross research -- analyst
great. thank you.
operator
thank you. your next question today is coming from troy jensen from lake street capital. your line is now live.
troy jensen -- lake street capital -- analyst
hi, thanks for taking my question. first one here for yoav, if you look at results yoav, q1 was relatively in line with consensus, q2 guide seems to be in line with consensus. if you continue that in the second half, you're going to have about 8% growth this year, but some of that's acquired right from our rps and origin, some of that's going to come from the zare partnership. if you look at your marketing slides that you used, you talk about an industry that's growing 20% to 25%. so just curious, what's the real outlook here for fdm and polyjet, and why aren't you guys growing faster than the industry if the core products are sustaining kind of that industry share and then you're adding new technologies into your portfolio?
yoav zeif -- chief executive officer
hi troy, thank you for the question. as you know, we are not guiding the year, the overall year, because of the uncertainty of the covid and we give just very specific direction where we can commit and where we see, where we have good visibility. so i can just repeat it. in general, what we are saying is a sequential growth, a quarter-over-quarter, we see the pent-up demand. as we mentioned, we know exactly where we will be in terms of the opex like lilach mentioned, but overall, when you look at on our npi status and we are delivering. we were with the j55. we launched the j5 dental with very good traction in the market. we launched the carbon fiber. we are delivering. we have a structured plan, and we are delivering on it.
we launched new products both on fdm and polyjet, put it together with the pent-up demand, we see a good market interest in those new products, which are really at the top of the line and next-generation both in material jetting and in material extrusion. we are leading the industry in terms of the technology, there is no doubt, and we hear it from our customers. so just take both into your analysis, the fact that we have those new products both on polyjet and on fdm to the fact that we have 3 new technologies that we're introducing at the second half of the year, and i guess you can do the math by yourself.
troy jensen -- lake street capital -- analyst
okay. and just a follow-up for you, yoav, would you agree that fortus really hasn't had competition specifically in ultem, and do you fear that this competition coming now given that the patents for the heated build chamber have expired?
yoav zeif -- chief executive officer
i had a call, just to share a call with customer, i cannot reveal their name, but like the top 5 aerospace players in the world. and they told me, and i'm quoting, so i have prepared myself for this call, they said, ""you have the best machine out there in fdm, just help us to make it a manufacturing machine"" and that's what we are doing in terms of software, in terms of material, you mentioned the ultem, it's clear that we have the best heated chamber in the market and also in terms of software material, but not less important certification, regulation, allowable, all this, full package that we are the only one who has it. so even if someone is coming with ultem is still many years behind us in terms of certified into aerospace and automotive. we are keep walking. i know our people keep pushing, on new path to answer, on new ip, on better heater chambers, on better processors, on regulation and airbus expansion is the perfect proof for it.
troy jensen -- lake street capital -- analyst
all right. good luck in the second half.

thank you. your next question today is coming from david mizrahi from berenberg. your line is now live.
david mizrahi -- berenberg capital markets -- analyst
hey, guys. so i understand the higher operating expenses in '21, but could you just speak to how you're thinking about some of that leverage moving it in '22? do you have any goals you're talking to just with respect to those operating expenses?
lilach payorski -- chief financial officer
hi, david. good morning. so specifically, we are not providing a specific guidance in terms of 2022, but definitely, i can speak with you in the overall business model that we are anticipating. it's important to remember that as our revenue will grow with the new adoption of our new manufacturing base system, we expect to see higher profit as we're going to have a higher profit pool, and we are planning to leverage scale on our operating model. we have in place already the infrastructure incorporated and in go-to-market to capture new technology without adding significant costs in the long-term, and this is really our vision, this is our goal in '22 and beyond, in '22 and '23, we definitely will be able to see this leverage on the revenue.
david mizrahi -- berenberg capital markets -- analyst
got it. okay. and then can you just also comment on how the new printers will impact gross margins going forward, the h350 for example. i know it uses fewer consumables. so i'm just really curious about gross margin impact from new printers and particularly the h350 and it's competitive launches relative to hp's multi jet fusion, for example? thanks.
lilach payorski -- chief financial officer
david, so we are now not specifically addressing the new product. once we launch, we will speak more to that. but our vision at the end of the day that gross margin is, we have a wide portfolio and definitely, it's a mix issue. okay. and so overall, it's a mix issue, but under manufacturing strategy, revenue will be significantly higher, driven by high consumption, which ultimately generate a higher profit even if consumable margin may be lower at this model. plus, we have a design for cost initiatives in place for the new products and for the existing product that we will address over time in the future as we roll-out those new products, focus on improving the cost as product will be more mature as part of the product life cycle. this is something that we definitely are actively addressing.
yoav zeif -- chief executive officer
maybe just to add to lilach, the systems are in line with our overall profitability. we are living within our industry, although we are not giving gross margin guidelines as you know, but i want to relate to the question about h350, we are very proud of h350, it's really a step-change in our industry in terms of mass manufacturing. so of course, i'm not going to relate directly to hp, but i'm happy to share several advantages that the saf has, the saf technology and do it very shortly. we have a whole list of advantages, but in a nutshell, i would say, consistent accuracy and i mean that we have the highest consistency of pulp accuracy. this is must in manufacturing. the second one, second advantage is full control of the printing process environment, which is super important because it enables fast certification of parts and materials, which is critical in manufacturing, everything here is about manufacturing. and the third advantage is really very good economics, because we are working with single fluid. we are having high powder reuse rate and we have an exceptional nesting efficiency in terms of the low that you can put of parts in the cake. so really, it's an amazing machine. we have great plans around it and we are going to reveal more and more material for this platform.
yonah lloyd -- vice president of investor relations
david, as you know, i would add to this as well, because you talk about the ability to manage against competition. remember that we have a very large service bureau that's technology-agnostic and it includes hp, it includes eos, it includes lots of systems from lots of companies. so as we're doing our own research and development for our own products, where actually customers using other products and really informs our ability to make decisions to develop the best-in-class competitive systems out there.

thank you. your next question today is coming from noelle dilts from stifel. your line is now live
noelle dilts -- stifel -- analyst
hi, thanks, good morning. i was hoping that you could expand a little bit on what the m&a pipeline looks like? and specifically, if you could speak to, if there has been any -- how you're thinking about valuations for targets, obviously, the multiples for a lot of the publicly listed companies have been volatile so far this year, is that impacting target pricing at all? thanks.
yoav zeif -- chief executive officer
hey noelle, thank you for the question. i'll start, i'll take a step back and start with what is really important. we have a laser-focused strategy. and everything that we are doing is subject to the strategy, focus, focus, focus, and also m&a for us the strategy is polymer manufacturing and we are actively looking for, i would say responsible m&a opportunities like we did and execute in the past that will accelerate the implementation of the strategy, titled above everything, and there are many opportunities and we are very attractive to many of the start-ups out there like you saw our acquisition of origin and also rps, because we have the infrastructure and they want to succeed and they want to make that they have -- they are growing their sales and they have the earn out in place and we can commit for it, because we have the infrastructure. and we have the machines required and to integrate it into our systems.
so we are continuously looking for potential investments proactively, and we want to maximize the value for our company and the shareholders, and we look all over, we have a structured unit that's there, the way we are working and this unit is going and screening and scouting, and we are focusing on those technologies and companies that will accelerate our strategy in each one of our technologies, and we know exactly what is needed in the market, which is a great advantage compared to anyone else who is looking out there in terms of financial investment or we see and we will keep doing this and we'll keep doing it in a very disciplined way and create value through those acquisitions.
noelle dilts -- stifel -- analyst
okay, great. and maybe just sticking with that theme, obviously, still early days with origin and rps, but maybe could you expand upon how things are progressing so far in terms of how the market has received the deals, particularly origin, and how things are trending relative to your initial expectations? thanks.
yoav zeif -- chief executive officer
thank you. great question. it's going really well. i don't know if you had the chance to participate in our manufacturing events, more than 4500 high-end customers and partners participated there, a significant amount of them, actually i would say, around two-third also participated in the breakout session of origin. and all the guys were there, like all the important companies from fortune 100 and also the top similar fortune 100 in europe and in asia participated, tesla, nike, amazon apple gm, ford, you name it, lockheed martin, they were all there because they are interested in manufacturing and we are bringing the full package for manufacturing and that's why we created this team together with origin, together with rps.
and if you participated, just to close the loop, all those customers of us, as i just mentioned, i don't know, the tesla, the apple, the google, all those customers were there waiting for the origin machines to be on our systems to be more precise for the 770 and for definitely for the h350 participating actively and we are going to deliver them the full package for manufacturing. so we expect strong demand on those machines, and for me as a ceo, most importantly, i was very proud to see both in our press conference and also in our event that at the end, we were one team origin, h350, the zare joint venture and our fdm, you could see that this is a one team that is pushing forward our industry into manufacturing.

thank you. your next question is coming from greg palm from craig-hallum capital group. your line is now live
greg palm -- craig-hallum capital group -- analyst
yeah, thanks. i guess, a question on gross margin, can you quantify the impact that you had from logistics? i'm just curious how that compares to what you said about sdm in mix overall. and if i heard you right, i don't think you're expecting any improvement this year. so even as revenue increases, at least in the second half, gross margin stays at similar levels. and so it almost implies that what you're seeing is worsening, because presumably there is some level of overhead absorption in the second half. so i just wanted to get a little more color there.
lilach payorski -- chief financial officer
good morning, greg. specifically on the logistic, yes, we were impacted by the global logistic issue that you saw overall, we are not the only company who actually suffer from that and it's considerably fair to assume that it's about 1% of our gross margin, this impact due to those logistical. and as we mentioned on the call, we expect gross margin to stay at this level through the balance of 2021 given the uncertainty around the high logistic costs and the consumables impacted by covid. at the same time, i would like to mention that we are analyzing and increasing our inventory level of raw material and finished good to avoid delay, increase in production level and prepare to foresee or held delay in our planning process. the most important things for us is meeting the demand, we try, we are evaluating a wider array of shipping option to ensure we can deliver goods with minimal business and cost impact. it's very, very important to us to address the....
yoav zeif -- chief executive officer
yeah, maybe i will just add to it. there is also some positive aspects, there are some positive aspects to the logistic side. so just to put to sleep on the gross margin, gross margin is a combination of the logistics, the consumable mix and sdm, and logistic was quite a large part there and really you can solve it by yourself. but those what's really impacted our gross margin, and since there is uncertainty on the recovery on the consumable and the logistic, there is no control there on the sdm side, that's why we are cautious with our projections on gross margin. but what is the positive aspect of this? what is the opportunity here? supply chain are fragile, and it's not only because of covid, they were fragile before covid because of the trade wars and because of some barriers, and looking forward, with the uk, europe, brexit we'll see more trade issues and tax freeze, then you saw the suez canal, the suez canal blockage and the weather issues and so on and so forth. so supply chains are fragile and are being disrupted. so it's clear to everybody that we need more resilient supply chain, by the way we are facing the same issues.
so we are also receiving some parts and machines with the suez canal and we were exposed to the congestion in ports all over the world, 7 days, it's the average delay globally and in some ports it could be 10 days or 20 days. so no doubt, everybody understands that the future has to take into consideration digital inventory. this is a great solution. you have no shipping issues, no cash term, no weather impact, no, nothing instead of delivering from a to b across the atlantic you just deliver from a to a because you produce on the spot with digitally stored inventory. it's also an opportunity, that's what i'm trying to say and this is practically what we call industry 4.0.
greg palm -- craig-hallum capital group -- analyst
yeah, i know it's a good point. i guess just as a follow-up, because i'm still not entirely clear, because usually when you have a better volume in top line, you see better absorption and you see higher gross margins. so, if the assumption is that volumes in top line revenue are going to increase solidly in the second half, yet gross margins are going to stay at the same level as q1, it implies that something is worsening from what you saw here in the most recent quarter. so are you assuming that either the mix or logistics or sdm worsens from here, just something just doesn't add up, and i just want to make sure we're all clear on that.
lilach payorski -- chief financial officer
greg, basically we are still conservative in terms of what we see currently. no one really, really know what's going to happen with the logistics constraint that we have, there is some publication that even say that maybe it will take us to the end of the year. how severe it will be? also no one knows. okay? so we see prices that we knew in q1 actually now even higher what we see in q2. so prices will continue go high. so we believe the logistics situation and challenge all over will impact us significant.
yoav zeif -- chief executive officer
that's a great point and also the prices went really up and more to the end at least our prices of logistics from china and from israel went up more at the end of the quarter. so we are being cautious, but i want to make one thing very, very clear. it's all about mix as we mentioned and logistics and sdm, but overall aps in general, stayed at the same level.
yonah lloyd -- vice president of investor relations
yes, asps.
yoav zeif -- chief executive officer
sorry asps, the average selling prices stayed more or less, in general, in the same ballpark. and the issue is not coming from there. this is very important to mention.
greg palm -- craig-hallum capital group -- analyst

thank you. your next question today is coming from brian drab from william blair. your line is now live.
brian drab -- william blair -- analyst
thanks. i was going to ask something, it's kind of related to pricing as well. but just specifically on consumables, you're down 10% organically year-over-year in consumables, but i think customer activity would have increased materially year-over-year given many of the service bureaus manufacturing design companies were shut down or at least slowed down materially last march, and also if you compare it with first quarter of '19, if you go back 2 years, consumables revenues down about 15% and product gross margins down over 600 basis points since first quarter of '19. so i mean there are few things that can explain this, i don't know, is it lower utilization of your machines, even though machine sales have been soft, there's more machines in the market than there were 2 years ago. so is it lower utilization of those machines going out to the market or you lowering price in consumables or what is it? thanks.
yoav zeif -- chief executive officer
great question. thank you. you know, you just answered it, it's lower utilization, definitely; it's not that all our customers are back, and even if they are back, they are not utilizing at the same level as throughout pandemic. add to it the fact that there are some segments that's really were heavily hit guide by the pandemic and are slow to recover, mainly aerospace, and within aerospace, commercial aerospace, they are slower to recover, also automotive and we are highly focusing on those, because those are the high-end segments that are buying our high-end machines. this is manufacturing. so we are more exposed, but i have no doubt that in the future, we will see them coming back strongly, the utilization will go up, and consumable, as we said, will grow sequentially throughout the year.
brian drab -- william blair -- analyst
okay. and i guess, is it the same dynamics that's playing out in the system sales, because i mean that's a great result that system sales are up 40% year-over-year, but they were down 40% year-over-year last first quarter and going down 40% and then back up 40% means you're still -- on a 2-year stack basis you're still down 15% in system sales from first quarter '19 levels. is that the same dynamic that you're just -- it's going to take another year maybe to get back to 2019 levels?
yoav zeif -- chief executive officer
so in general, yes. we don't know exactly when aerospace will be exactly in 2019. but what we can see is that hardware is, as you see, because of the deep decline in q1 that we had in some areas of the world, we see the spend demand, and the spend demand is assigned for consumable, because hardware is probably a phase or two phases before the consumables. so you can use the hardware in order to predict the demand for consumables.
brian drab -- william blair -- analyst

thank you. our next question today is coming from wamsi mohan from bank of america. your line is now live.
wamsi mohan -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
yes, thank you. you did a capital raise last quarter, you are calling this as growth capital. you obviously already have a pretty strong balance sheet before that, so how should we think about maybe pace of either m&a or investments? is this going to be at some level of accelerated pace versus even the last few years or how should we think about the relative pace of investments in m&a, if you could share any color on that, that would be helpful.
yoav zeif -- chief executive officer
we are sticking to our strategy and to the same concept that we mentioned 2 quarters ago. we have a strategy, part of the strategy is a structured m&a proactive, i would say, proactive scouting and screening to make sure that we are bidding pipeline for m&a in a way that will maximize shareholders value through synergies, and the synergies are very clear here. there has to be some -- it has to be something that accelerate the strategy, it has to be something that either accelerated through technology or go-to-market or material or software. so we work on the workflow, which is the software and other type of workflow, or material or hardware technology and we'll keep doing it in a disciplined way. we build an m&a team internally and it's a very strong team. we are not rushed to do anything, but we do it in a very disciplined way to accelerate the strategy.
wamsi mohan -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
okay. thanks, yoav. and you talk about this acceleration in revenue growth in '22 and beyond. when you think about that in relation to maybe market growth, are you expecting to take share and grow in excess of the market? and maybe if you could just talk about that growth acceleration coming between existing products and new products, i'm trying to isolate what is sort of a cyclical recovery that can drive an acceleration in '22 versus a more secular, sustainable recovery in that growth? thank you.
yoav zeif -- chief executive officer
we are going -- we are leading, but also in the future we will lead the polymer manufacturing segment. we are leading additive manufacturing in polymer. this is the strategy. this is the target, and the way to do it is by making sure that we have the right match for every application, this is why we expanded our portfolio to 5 technologies in each one of them, we believe, we have the best-in-class technology and i am already in this industry almost a year and a half now and i can tell you that it's quite simple. you need to have the best part, and this is scientific. you need to make sure that you have the best parts, properties, and we are working on each one of the technologies. we leverage it through our channel partners, and we are delivering to our customers. we focus on manufacturing a full package of hardware, software, material and services; and we package all of it in a single platform of software. this is a big advantage. this is something we hear from our customers. they want to have one supplier, and we will be this one supplier in polymer manufacturing, and as we said last quarter, we believe that our specific revenue will grow over 20% in this sector of additive manufacturing. so we are currently, as we said last quarter in 2020 around 25% of our sales went to end-use parts, we are going to grow in the mid-teen this year and 20% from next year onwards.

ananda baruah -- loop capital -- analyst
hi. thanks guys for taking the questions. i guess, just when you guys talk about, yoav, when you talk about the revenue acceleration beyond the 20%, seemingly starting kind of in '22 going into '23, can you share with us -- presumably that would be sort of through most of the pent-up demand. could you sort of share with us if that's the case, do you really think at that point the production systems are really driving the growth? and then if they are, do you yet have the qualifications in the key verticals, kind of aero and auto, that you would need for that? and if you don't have them, what do you think the difficulty level to getting there is? thanks a lot.
yoav zeif -- chief executive officer
hi ananda, thank you very much for the question. so i want to be very clear, and i want to separate short-term catalysts and long-term catalysts here in the market. so we said, and again, just to clarify, that the part in our sale that is growing for manufacturing as we defined it as end-use parts will grow mid-teens this year and about 20% from 2022 onwards. so this is the statement. why we believe in it, because, first of all, there are some catalysts and pent-up demand in the short-term because of the recovery from the covid, because of supply chain pressure that people want to make sure that they are insuring themselves against it, because off the entire environment that we see in the macro economy. this is one.
and then, which is more important. everybody is seeing the long-term trends that we are facing, which lead us to an inflection point in additive manufacturing, and this inflection point is underlined by, as i said before, by 3 very strong forces; one, is the need to have responsive and versatile supply chain. this digital manufacturing we discussed so many times. the second very strong trend is the fact that additive manufacturing technology reach, i would say, new levels in terms of the ability to deliver end-use parts and mass production. so we were in the hundreds, we may be thousands, now we are in the dozens of thousands and maybe hundreds of thousands and you saw in the case of the nasal swabs that we even printed millions. so it's a different era in additive manufacturing. and add to it the third very strong trend, which is the old industry trends that you have those new segments, like electric vehicles and new type of aerospace solution where polymer and composite are so important for the type of the part, for the complexity of the part, but also for the need for customization and short series of products.
so it is a new era. it leads us to manufacturing. being in manufacturing, it's a whole new story. because in manufacturing, you need to develop new applications. it's about new materials, it's about very strong and solid service, because you cannot allow yourself downtime, and not less important, you need software. you need software in order to be connected to the manufacturing system, the mes, the erp, the plm, you need to be there. and you need to put all this in one package connected. so connectivity is also very important, and we have relationships with those blue chip customers, fortune 100 customers, we are leading these formations, and those oems are working with us to transform the industry. it gives us a confidence that we are on the right direction because at the end, we are not walking in a vacuum, but we are walking with our customers to take this industry into manufacturing.
ananda baruah -- loop capital -- analyst
that's super helpful, yoav. i really appreciate. that's really great context by the way. thanks for that. and just a quick follow-up to that, it sounds like you have like at least a good amount of the capability improvements today you made. so you just referenced your ability to do, production parts and volume, start production parts in volume, and i like that you're sticking your neck out and giving the growth context. so, thanks for that. this is fluid, how much of, sort of the capability you've mentioned, software, m&a et cetera and workflow, how much of the capability do you think you need to get to putting together the solution, software services, like you said putting into one package, how challenging is that over the next, call it 4 to 8 quarters, to get to where you want to be, where your production customers just saying they want you to be to be able to really reflect that growth? i know that's a lot, but i think, the context would be helpful.
thanks, and that's it for me.
yoav zeif -- chief executive officer
another great question. we have currently the internal capabilities to deliver our strategy. having said that, it's also clear to us that we can accelerate it, so the focus is on acceleration, not on enabling, because we can do it. and this is a great place to be when you are looking for m&a, because you are coming from a place where you have the certainty that you are good with alternatives. we are not depending on any one to execute our strategy. we have many that can help us to accelerate.
ananda baruah -- loop capital -- analyst
that's great. thank you.

yoav zeif -- chief executive officer
thank you, yonah. good morning everyone, and thank you for joining us. today, i will touch on the highlights of the first quarter and share insights from a very exciting global event we held last week.
at stratasys, we are committed to being at the forefront of the polymer 3d printing market, producing and delivering the most innovative next-generation technologies that address the fastest growing manufacturing applications. 3d printing is migrating from being primarily a prototyping tool to providing full scale digital manufacturing platforms at mass production level. stratasys is leading this transformation with manufacturing applications in polymers, which we believe is a higher value opportunity than method.
this year has gotten off to an exciting start for stratasys. last week, we hosted an unprecedented online event attended by over 4,500 customers, resellers, and partners. at the event, we provided details on 3 new manufacturing-focused product offerings that will play an integral role in our future growth. we continue to be energized by the tremendous potential that our business and our industry has especially in end-use part manufacturing. we expect this demand driver to produce compound annual growth of over 20% starting next year. we believe that our leadership position in 3d printing will strengthen as we execute on delivering current products while expanding and launching additional new products.
turning to our results for the first quarter. our revenues of $134.2 million were in line with our previously stated outlook. we saw particular strength with nearly 41% growth in system revenue, which should drive future recurring revenue from consumables. our operating cash flow was $22.8 million following last quarter's $23.7 million.
during the first quarter, we achieved several important milestones to drive our strategy. we continued our focus on expanding the grabcad software platform with the launch of the grabcad software partner program. this is an ecosystem of software provider integrating their offerings with stratasys to provide our customer with end-to-end additive manufacturing solutions. the program will enable customers to expand on their prototyping and manufacturing workflow to better address the opportunities for 3d printing.
we also released the grabcad connectivity software development kit, sdk. this will enable developers and customers to integrate our technology in the factories and make them industry 4.0 compatible. our connectivity sdk is a sophisticated 2-way communication platform. our customers can monitor the fleet of stratasys printers and also use enterprise software applications like mes or erp to communicate back. in addition, we added the industry standard mtconnect communication protocol to more systems to support data exchange between manufacturing software applications used for monitoring and analytics. this recent software releases support our customers increasing deployment of our additive manufacturing product to the production floor.
we introduced our j5 dentajet 3d printer to serve the growing demand for dental solutions. it is the only multi-color, multi-material 3d printer enabling technicians to load mixed trays of dental parts. it can produce 5 times more dental parts on a single mixed tray than any of our competitors offering in a compact office friendly size. we have already started to see excellent customer attraction such as neolab in massachusetts, which served 3,000 orthodontics and dental clinics across the u.s. our customers are impressed by the j5 ease-of-use, multiple models in one print, minimal post processing, and the fact that models go from concept to production faster than ever. the dental industry has been an early adopter of additive manufacturing for true production parts and is currently over a $1 billion opportunity for 3d printing.
we also introduced a new carbon fiber material for our award winning f123 series 3d printer that is specifically formulated for applications such as tooling, jigs and fixtures. the strength and lightweight of carbon fiber make it an excellent replacement for metal across many applications. we acquired rps adding a top quality product line of industrial stereolithography systems complementing our portfolio to give us a full suite of polymer 3d printing solutions across the product lifecycle from concept and design to end-use part. we continue to expect the acquisition to be slightly accretive to revenue and non-gaap earnings per share by the end of 2021.
our customers continues to validate our innovation and technological advances as evidenced by the recently signed contract extension and expansion with airbus. the agreement significantly increases the range of cabin interior components and other parts. this is a perfect example of our stratasys executes a land and expand strategy. the original agreement signed over 5 years ago only focused on parts for the airbus a350 as an alternative to traditionally manufacture parts increasing supply chain flexibility. once airbus started printing parts with our fdm technology, they soon progressed from a small number of alternate parts to using the technology for serial production at a much larger scale. we are also able to provide on-demand part service through our stratasys direct service bureau. the updated agreements increases the range of aircraft type to also include the a300, a320, a330, and a340 as well as replacement and sales of through mro applications. our additive manufacturing is now part of the typical interaction with procurement to standard supplier channel as a regular course of business.
as i mentioned earlier, last week at our manufacturing launch event, we announced 3 new product updates, which will strengthen our market leading offerings and value potential that we bring to customers. the stratasys origin one, best-in-class photopolymer 3d printer that received a top to bottom optimization upgrade to improve serviceability, performance and utilization. key use cases include medical device components, automotive aerospace, defense consumer goods and dental applications such as splints, bridges, aligners and dentures. we also shared some great insights for origin customers, specifically, we highlighted te connectivity, a leader in connectors and central products. they are now printing thousands of parts using origin p3 technology including the first-ever 3d printed aerospace production connector. we plan to begin shipping this upgraded version in the fourth quarter this year.
the h350 powered by selective absorption infusion or saf technology and build for true thermoplastic mass production of consistently accurate end-use parts. our stratasys direct service bureau as well as others in europe have already started producing parts on the h350 as better users for customers in automotive, consumer goods and healthcare. we also introduced a renewable bio-based pa11 material that is derived from sustainable castor oil which has superior thermal resistant and is less brittle than pa12. it is the first of many new polymer materials for the h series. and the h350 is even its own customer. it doesn't pass on the system, were actually printed with saf technology. we plan to start shipping the h350 in the second half of the year.
the f770, designed with the longest fully heated build chamber in fdm. it is a large addition to our f123 product line. we did testing cubic foot build volume. despite its size, it's designed to be a simple to use as our other popular f123 printers and is priced under $100,000. in addition to the heated build chamber, the soluble support is another important differentiator from most other large-format printers. this will save customers time and enable them to make more complex parts. we plan to begin shipping in late june.
we are on track to enter this next phase of product launches which combined with our multiple competitive advantages will advance our position as the leading provider of polymer 3d printing solutions for our world-class customer base. we have the broadest, most advanced polymer technologies, that span the full product life cycle from concept to end-part. our polyjet and fdm systems have been the best selling units in their class. and we have introduced new system for both technologies this year with more to come.
our recent rps acquisition adds multi-purpose thoroughly progressive systems to our portfolio and we are now entering through mass production with p3 and saf technologies. no other company has both the range and the best-in-class innovation that stratasys can deliver to our end markets. our software strategy, as discussed earlier, is based on the customer centric dynamic of working closely with many oem across the industry. we offer a unifying comprehensive platform across our technologies that is built to interface with the top standard enterprise system. today, grabcad has 36,000 application users and 8.8 million community members, more than any other platform of its kind and is at the heart of our cloud-based strategy and growing software ecosystem that includes partnership with siemens ntopology identified 3d, link3d, keyshot and others.
supporting our product will have the leading global channel that can market, sale and maintain our system for our customer. over the years, we have built an unmatched sales and service infrastructure with market access across a network of over 200 channel partners. this is the largest and most experienced channel in the industry.
the success of these systems and technologies relies on the talented team that build, manage and maintain them. these are the expert application engineers that educate the market and continue to push the innovation envelope each day as they work with customers to address an ever-expanding universe of applications. stratasys has the largest team of engineers and customer support in our industry. they have deep multi-disciplinary experience especially in quality and process certification, which is critical for success in aerospace, automotive, healthcare and other sectors. and we have a proven resilient business model designed to scale across a range of macroeconomic conditions, including our successful navigation of the covid-19 pandemic.
we believe that as our revenue growth accelerate, we can leverage our model and deliver increasing profits while continuing to generate cash. these key advantages combined with the new technologies that we launch in the future, position stratasys to deliver on our growth strategy. we expect that as our customers return to their production facilities, we will benefit from the pent-up demand.
i will now turn the call over to lilach, who will share the financial results of the quarter. lilach?
lilach payorski -- chief financial officer
thank you, yoav, and good morning everyone. we are pleased to have delivered on our stated goal this quarter. the revenue growth, especially the 40.9% growth in our system sales along with our strong cash generation, both are cautious optimism around the continuing economic recovery from covid-19.
for the first quarter, total revenue was $134.2 million, in line with our previously disclosed outlook. on a constant currency basis, total revenue declined 1% versus the first quarter of 2020. product revenue in the first quarter was $90.3 million, an increase of 8.6% compared to the same period last year, or 6.1% on a constant currency basis. within product revenue, system revenue increased 40.9% compared to the same period last year and increased 37.6% on a constant currency basis. this growth rate demonstrates signs of end-market recovery compared to 2020 where system sales were lower in the first quarter. this was due to the impact of covid starting in the back half of the quarter when our sales are typically strongest. system sales began to improve by the end of q2 last year. so while we expect system growth to continue throughout 2021, the comparable percentage rate will naturally come down over the course of the year.
as we noted on our last call, consumable utilization is subject to the impact of covid. this quarter, consumable revenue was off by 8% compared to the same period last year and was down 10.2% on a constant currency basis. as the market recovers from covid and usage rates of our systems increase, we expect to see sequential growth in consumable build as we move through the balance of the year.
service revenue was $43.9 million, down 11.8% compared to $49.7 million in the same period last year. on a constant currency basis, service revenue was off 13%. within service revenue, customer support revenue was $27.6 million, a 2.2% decline compared to $28.3 million in the same period last year, and decrease of 4.3% on a constant currency basis. we continue to see softness in our parts service bureau business, sdm which has notable exposure to commercial aerospace, where covid recovery has been slower than for other industries, such as healthcare and education.
gaap gross margin was 41.4% for the quarter compared to 45% for the same period last year. non-gaap gross margin was 46.7% for the quarter compared to 48.4% for the same period last year. the pressure on gross margin is due primarily to the lower proportion of consumables, increased logistic cost and lower sdm contribution. as a reminder, sdm has a relatively high percentage of fixed costs, so the lower revenue is an impact on gross margin. we believe that impact from the logistic issue, a well-known global situation, as well as the slower covid recovery impact on consumables will remain for the near future. given the ongoing uncertainty of these issues, we expect gross margin to remain at similar level throughout the year.
gaap operating expenses were $73.9 million, an improvement of $5.9 million or 7.3% compared to the same period last year. non-gaap operating expenses were $65.2 million, an improvement of $7.5 million or 10.3% for the quarter as compared to the same period last year. non-gaap operating expenses was 48.6% of revenue for the quarter compared to 54.7% for the same period last year. the improvement in operating expenses was due primarily to the proactive resizing measures we took in the second quarter of 2020.
from an earnings perspective, gaap operating loss for the quarter was $18.4 million compared to a loss of $19.9 million for the same period last year. non-gaap operating loss for the quarter was $2.6 million compared to a loss of $8.4 million for the same period last year. gaap net loss for the quarter was $18.9 million or $0.32 per diluted share compared to net loss of $21.7 million or $0.40 per diluted share for the same period last year. non-gaap net loss for the quarter was $3.8 million or $0.06 per diluted share compared to net loss of $10.6 million or $0.19 per diluted share in the same period last year.
we generated $22.8 million of cash from operations during the first quarter as compared to generating $11.3 million of cash in the same quarter last year. this was driven by strong collections and reduction in spending and inventory level. during the quarter, we successfully raised gross capital of $230 million of gross proceeds and ended the quarter with $530.4 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term deposit compared to $299.1 million at the end of 2020. we have recently made strategic investments, the acquisitions of origin and rps to help build-out our product portfolio and we continue to evaluate additional opportunities that will further accelerate our time to market and other key strategic initiatives.
last quarter, we provided our outlook for revenue growth in the second quarter and operating expenses for the full year, and we are reaffirming both. for revenue, we still expect mid-teens percent growth for q2, and we expect to see sequential growth in the back half of the year with the fourth quarter being the strongest. opex for the full year include an increase of $25 million to $30 million compared to 2020, likely closer to the high-end of the range. the increase is due primarily to the return to a 5 days work week and the cost associated with the recent acquisitions. capital expenditures are projected to be in the range of $24 million to $30 million.
looking ahead, with a debt-free, fortress balance sheet, we are well-positioned to capitalize on value enhancing market opportunities. we will continue to invest capital into strategic high growth area of our business, particularly around manufacturing, where increasing customer demand and a proven history of the high utilization should support substantial upside in revenue, earnings and cash flow in the coming years.
with that, let me turn the call back over to yoav for closing remarks. yoav?
yoav zeif -- chief executive officer
thank you, lilach. our company is executing on our strategy to expand our leadership position in polymer 3d printing. the investments we have made to drive organic growth coupled with the targeted and strategic acquisitions to enhance our end-to-end solution portfolio should result in value creation for our shareholders.
with that, let's open it up for questions. operator?

operator
thank you. [operator instructions] our first question today is coming from shannon cross from cross research. your line is now live.
shannon cross -- cross research -- analyst
thank you very much, appreciate it. and good afternoon. i wanted to dig a little bit more into what appears to be somewhat of an inflection point in clearly your revenue growth, or revenue trajectory. but also, i'm curious from an industry perspective, if you could talk a bit more about what you're hearing from your customers about why they're buying the product? what they're looking at using the product for? and essentially, i'm trying to understand how much of the growth is sustainable past the rebound following covid? so, anything you can you can provide to us would be helpful. thank you.
yoav zeif -- chief executive officer
hi, shannon, good morning. great question. because we are definitely in an inflection point for the entire industry. and we benefit from this inflection point, because we are the leader in polymer 3d printing. but we also work very hard to make sure that we are supporting it and delivering the expectations of our customers.
so, in a nutshell, no bells and whistles here to be honest, a lot of hard work to deliver constant growth by addressing the customer's needs. it sounds a cliche, but it is what it is. and it's all about delivering the best part, good economics, reliability, all within a package of material and software and service, that support the workflow in manufacturing, and can really be something that the customer can lean on, in terms of adopting 3d printing. and this is what we are doing day after day.
and it's a journey. but i'm happy to say that we see the start of getting there. and those manufacturers, our customers, this huge installed base that we have the leading companies in the world, they are updating their factories plan, they are updating i would say the vision that they have, each one of them has a specific theme that looks at the plant of the future. and 3d printing is part of it. 3d printing is definitely part of it in the long term. and we are there and we keep supporting them.
shannon cross -- cross research -- analyst
i guess, how has the conversations changed maybe in the last three to six months as you've been talking to customers, because again, it seems as just like you said this is sort of an inflection point for the industry? or do you think this is something that's been building for quite a long period of time, and it's just starting to happen now?
yoav zeif -- chief executive officer
i would say there are two underlying forces here. one is that the covid, as we said in many earnings calls over the last year opened the eyes of leading manufacturers to the benefit of 3d printing supply chain. so, instead of having a distributed supply chain, let's have digital inventories. let's shift from long lines of manufacturing and production into a file and the machine which is supported by the whole system what we are providing that very strong force that we are it's a different level of engagement and the second force is what we are doing here within stratasys.
so, we are working on addressing those needs. so, we have this benefit of having the direct interaction with our customers. and we are tailoring what we are doing. so, we have great example with gm and te connectivity. and we are leveraging relationship to tailor our solution that has to be manufacturing great. so, we have materials, we have software critical in manufacturing. we have service, as i said at the beginning, no bells and whistles here. a lot of hard work to make sure that we are coming with manufacturing great solution.
operator
[operator instructions] our next question is coming from wamsi mohan from bank of america. your line is now live.
wamsi mohan -- bank of america -- analyst
yes, thank you. and congrats on a good quarter. in your press release, you say a longer term, the company continues to expect significant leverage benefits from its investments as revenue growth should start to accelerate in 2022 and beyond in those. i was curious, what is your baseline of for which you're saying acceleration, clearly 2021 has got?
you're showing very strong growth in this past quarter. you're projecting quite strong growth even for the next quarter. but it's coming off of a very tough year. so, when you're speaking about acceleration in '22, how should investors think about the magnitude of revenue growth? or what is the relative base over which you're expecting to accelerate? and i have a follow up.
yoav zeif -- chief executive officer
thank you. thank you, wamsi. good to hear from you. i would say, technically and let lilach add some comments afterwards. technically, we are looking at two-time horizon. so, we need to be better than last year. let's not forget covid is still here. okay. but we are doing well on this front. and we need to make sure that we are improving against 2019. and that's also what you see in our script. so, it's very clear, what's the baseline where we need to improve. but this is technical.
what is more important and more meaningful is what are those catalysts that will take us forward, that we can say that we feel comfortable with continuously showing growth and accelerated going forward. and in one word, its manufacturing. we have a very clear strategy, we stick to the strategy, we added three new technologies this year. stratasys is no more a company of two technologies. we are a company of five technologies.
and we make sure that in each one of those technologies, we have-don't want to be to hear too arrogant, but we have the best solution. in terms of the print quality, its manufacturing, we need to deliver the expectation of the manufacturer. we add three new technologies, we'll start introducing them in q4. and then 2022 will be the first year where we have really full coverage of every problem that any manufacturer of polymers can have.
so, we are not coming with one or two, we are coming to solve this problem of our customers. and this makes us feel very comfortable in terms of the top line next year. because we are coming with three new technologies and leverage what we have. we have the infrastructure, we have the network, we have the software system, we have the materials, and we just push three more technologies into the market.
lilach payorski -- chief financial officer
wamsi, good morning from me.
wamsi mohan -- bank of america -- analyst
hello.
lilach payorski -- chief financial officer
hello.
wamsi mohan -- bank of america -- analyst
okay, thanks for that. and if i could follow up, i think you were very clear on sort of gross margin impact and cost pressures continuing to persist. and yoav you just said that, covid is still here. is there a revenue headwind that you're factoring in as well in your guidance here in next quarter and beyond that could be coming because of component issues or supply chain issues outside of cost, but more from a demand or revenue standpoint? thank you.
yoav zeif -- chief executive officer
so, we are always managing the day-to-day and the day-to-day is also delivering product every day and developing product every day. we have a solid pipeline. as we wrote, we have a very solid pipeline for the new technologies. we manage the supply chain on a daily basis, we restructured our snmp process to make sure that we are on top of the issues.
we gave our operations high degrees of freedom to increase inventories. every company in our sector and in high tech are facing the same issues. currently, it seems that we are on top of the challenges, but definitely there is uncertainty. and yeah, it looks good. i cannot say that it doesn't exist out there. it's a daily struggle.
operator
thank you. our next question is coming from brian drab from william blair. your line is now live.
brian drab -- william blair -- analyst
hi, thanks for taking my questions. so obviously, the revenue growth isn't improving and things are recovering. my question is, how expensive is this growth going to be longer term? you mentioned in the prepared remarks leverage on cost going forward. but, if you look historically, over the last many years, opex has averaged about 50% of sales. looks like it'll be about that this year.
what sort of targets do you have in mind even just roughly for where you think opex can be as a percentage of sales, because i think a lot of capital equipment type companies, similar companies would be in the 25% range? and it's been elevated for a long time here.
lilach payorski -- chief financial officer
good morning, brian. so, at this stage, we are not providing specific long-term guidance. but as we discussed previously, regarding our scale, we do anticipate to leverage significantly our skilled position. we have a border infrastructure from a go-to-market perspective and corporate to address three new technologies on top of the two one that we have.
so, practically will have fast technology on the same infrastructure. it's true that in 2021, you don't see that level that much. i would like to remind you that we are still in a covid related year, right. and we increase cost coming back in organization to five-days workweek and we add two acquisitions. but definitely, when we look at the horizon in the future, we are anticipating significantly accelerated growth in revenue and be able to leverage the infrastructure without adding meaningfully additional cost to our cost base. at that point, i cannot specifically show the specific percentage, but definitely this is the direction.
yoav zeif -- chief executive officer
maybe i'll just add. in general, we resized the company last year to make sure that we are releasing resources to invest in our growth. and that's exactly what we are doing. we are in an investment mode. long term we are leveraging our scale. our intent is not to deliver only on the top line growth, but also gradually to improve profitability. it's very clear, we know exactly what we are doing. and we are leveraging what we have. and we have a great company and great people here.
brian drab -- william blair -- analyst
thanks. and i just need to follow up on wamsi's question because every analyst buy side and sell side is going to be looking for a clue as to what's happening in 2022. and you gave guidance for this year that for sequential growth that is going to lead us to model somewhere in the range of 12% to 14% year over year growth in 2021.
and then, in the opening of your press release, you say you'll accelerate revenue growth in 2022. and just by definition, that means a faster growth rate. but what you answered wamsi with was led me to believe that you're not necessarily saying that 2022 revenue growth will be greater than 2021. is that-are you not forecasting faster growth in 2022 than '21?
lilach payorski -- chief financial officer
hi, brian. we're actually not providing guidance for 2022 right now, but the growth will come. we know what are the driver for the growth. as i mentioned to wamsi, we are introducing two new technologies in the second part of the q4. so, we are planning to a see meaningful growth coming for these two technologies in 2022. we believe the growth will come in the right time, we will also want to share the specific expectations for the growth side.
operator
thank you. our next question today is coming from noelle dilts from stifel. your line is now live.
noelle dilts -- stifel -- analyst
hi, guys and congratulations on a nice quarter. i was hoping you could just kind of give us an update one on how you'd be the-so far how things are progressing with the recent acquisition's origin and rps? and generally, how that's compared to your initial expectations? and then also if you could just comment on how you're thinking about m&a moving forward, and what you're seeing in terms of opportunities in the market and valuation if there's been any change that relative to last quarter? thanks.
yoav zeif -- chief executive officer
hi noelle, good morning. it's going well, it's going well. we acquired really good companies with leading technologies, i will say disruptive technologies in terms of their specific areas. so, you look at origin and their dlp solution, it's a completely different dlp solution than any other in the market. completely different. origin is on track. rbs is better than originally we thought for q2. so, we're doing better than we expected.
and m&a as i said in many other calls before, it's all about accelerating our strategy. we are becoming more attractive for start-ups. and for some established company, because we have the infrastructure. this becoming to many of the leading and most innovative and disruptive companies out there in our industry, the one thing that they are missing is this infrastructure.
and we can provide this infrastructure. and that's why we had a win-win situation with origin and they joined us and today they're part of stratasys, an integral part of stratasys. we are on track. and we will introduce the completely new upgraded, better machine in q4.
noelle dilts -- stifel -- analyst
great, thanks. and then a couple of somewhat related questions here. so first, just given the number of technology upgrades and new product introductions you've had this year. we didn't have rapid our formnext last year, how important are these events moving back to live events and going to be for you in terms of getting folks comfortable with these products? and second, you've obviously, again, had a lot of introductions this year, how should we think about kind of the pace of technological and new product rollouts as we move into next year? thanks.
yoav zeif -- chief executive officer
great question. so, we are engaging with our customers. by the way, i'm very excited really, it's exciting to engage again live with our customers currently in the u.s. for a long time. and i start meeting customers face to face, which is really exciting. i wouldn't say back to normality, but it's exciting. and we are going to participate in rapid and inform next to introduce our whole baggage as i call it. because we have five technologies supported by an ecosystem of software and material and we are going to introduce it.
having said that, we didn't stop interacting and engaging with our customers. all the time, we found a different alternative solution. so, we have a track that is going all over the u.s. we were the first one to do it. and we have in some cases, in one location, we have more than 100 leads of specific engineers because they are coming to the parking lot to see our truck and our new solution. and it works and it works well.
another alternative that we doubled down on it was the whole digital interaction and engage webinar, it works really well. so, i can say, we are not sharing those numbers, but we have a better pipeline. and so, we found alternatives. we found alternatives. and i want just to be clear, we're talking about the new technologies, but we are doing well with the current technologies as well. so, the current technologies are growing, we are innovating with what we have, because no one has better fdm or better polyjet material jetting than us.
we have new systems. in polyjet, i just mentioned the medijet and the dentajet, which targeted very lucrative market, we have fantastic unique new machines below 100k in the fdm space, the f770 and all of them are doing better than expectations. as we put all our efforts on the new technologies to make sure we have solution instead of just technologies, but also the existing technologies we'll keep innovating, and we're doing well on them.
operator
thank you. our next question today is coming from paul chung from jp morgan. your line is now live.
paul chung -- jp morgan -- analyst
hi, thanks for taking my question. so, for the origin, just to follow up on the origin. you mentioned kind of incremental $200 million over five years for this product when you acquired it. i know, it's ramping in q4 and it's early, but kind of based on initial customer feedback, have your views changed at all, since you acquire the asset, either in magnitude or kind of timeline on how that ramps? and what are your expectations for margins on the product and for the system and consumables there? and i have a follow up.
yoav zeif -- chief executive officer
as you said, nothing changed. and nothing changed from our perspective as well. we are confident in our focus. and as you know, we are not updating gross margin by product. but we are confident, actually even more confident because we are into the details of the technology, it's not any more due diligence, or we just run benchmarks. we are into the details of it. we are engaging with customer.
we have some large customers that are very interested in this new technology. and just maybe, to put kind of flavor around it, it's generating for us many what we call new logos, which is really exciting. because it's so unique, because it's expanding our span in terms of technologies and solution, we keep the focus that we have in the past and we are very happy with this acquisition.
paul chung -- jp morgan -- analyst
okay, great, thanks for that. and then just on cash flow, can you talk about kind of working cap dynamics. should we expect some inventory build ahead of product launches in the second half and possibly a bigger drag this year in inventory on a higher component cost relative to last year, we saw a nice funding source there. if you could talk about those dynamics? and then, given the strong start to the year, can you be in positive territory for cash from operations for the year? thank you.
lilach payorski -- chief financial officer
good morning, paul. so, following to what you mentioned the most important things for us is obviously meeting the customer demand and specifically, in manufacturing make sure that the system are not in downtime. so, make sure that we have inventory in place at a region at a time is critical. so, we will do everything that we can in order to overcome those shortages and this is what we are doing.
it may also impact our inventory levels. so, we are ramping up now the inventory level as well as because of the new product introductions, we are ramping up the inventory levels. so, we do expect at the second part of the year to see inventory level going up and it may impact the cash flow in a level. with that, we believe that this is the right thing to do for the company and for the business where the growth is coming.
as we look for the second half of '21, we are not providing specific guidance. but we expect the majority of the growth also, of the revenue to occur in the second half of the year. so much of the cash flow benefit will come in 2022 and beyond. and as i mentioned that the preparation for to the launch of the three significant npi were recently introduced, coupled with cyber safety stock we're building to mitigate the raw material shortage, is expected to increase our inventory level and a payment in the coming quarter.
paul chung -- jp morgan -- analyst

thank you. your next question today is coming from troy jensen from lake street capital markets. your line is now live.
troy jensen -- lake street capital markets -- analyst
hey, good morning. thanks and congrats on really nice results here. a quick question for yoav. i guess h350, hoping we can spend a little time on that. i guess my thoughts are, that's probably going to be the most production focused product you're launching here. that's the material sales could be pretty significant. but can you just talk about how much open or closed or can customers use third party materials? or how much material consumption on h350 do you guys think you guys can capture?
yoav zeif -- chief executive officer
hi, troy. good morning. thank you for highlighting the h350. yes, this is a manufacturing machine, no doubt. and we have big expectations from it. we build it for years together with the inventor. and we believe we have a very strong offering for mass production in 3d printing. and just to highlight the most important thing, this is a fantastic machine, but in general, we believe that we will deliver the best consistent accuracy.
there are i would say better control of the whole printing process, but mainly around thermal control, which allows easier certification of material and easier development of materials and get best to it. and also better economics, because we are using only one agent, one engagement which allow us to have better recycling ratio and better density within the cake.
so, when we are talking about better control, it means that we will be able to introduce more materials because the control allows you to certify materials to develop and certify materials in an easier and faster way. so bottom line, this is the strategy with h350, to go out there, to develop the hybrid material that we discussed many times.
so, hybrid material will have our materials, third party's materials, and different levels of cooperation, which will allow us to come with the most, i would say wide manufacturing powders. so, that's that in nutshell, the strategy. and we are optimistic on the h350. the materials are going are looking really good. and customers are happy and we are producing a new spot.
troy jensen -- lake street capital markets -- analyst
all right, perfect. about the second question would be on you guys have had good traction here with your carbon fiber with the f123. have you looked at all at continuous carbon fiber? i'm assuming you guys are mainly just chopped.
yoav zeif -- chief executive officer
great question, troy. thank you. so, we are seeing good traction for our new carbon fiber for the f123 series. and we have a huge advantage in terms of our part quality with carbon fiber. we just took it from our high-end machines and put it also our door or i would say entry level series, which works really well and incentivize many customers to adopt this type of printers. and we see also new logos there.
so, this is a great direction. here in minnesota, we have knowledge about carbon fiber for years and we reach i would say the largest size of material with carbon fiber in the industry because of our filter chambers capabilities and knowledge on the fdm side. some of those parts are being used as end used parts mainly in aerospace, but also in some cases in automotive. so, this knowledge will help us to develop the next generation.
but as you know, we don't talk about development. we are not sharing here our development plan without competition-without competitors. but we have the base, the knowledge, the experience to be there and to lead the carbon fiber market. and the benefit, it's right there. this is the whole idea behind focusing on polymers, because we believe that it's lighter than metal, stronger, could be stronger, allow some geometric freedom.
and we leverage all these to make sure that we combine our experience and knowledge in it together with our vision to replace metal and we will be there with end use parts with composites.
operator
thank you. your next question is coming from jim ricchiuti from needham & company. your line is now live.
jim ricchiuti -- needham and company -- analyst
hi. question i have again is going back to the acceleration that you're seeing in the business. so certainly, q2 stronger than expected q3. a nice acceleration. so, my question is, how much of this are you seeing is potentially some share gains but how much of this is just catch up from abnormally low levels of demand and equipment utilization? and really that ties into my follow up question about '22 which we're all struggling with? does that begin to normalize in '22 and then you overlay the new products? is that the way we should be thinking about your growth?
yoav zeif -- chief executive officer
hi jim, good morning. so...
lilach payorski -- chief financial officer
hi, good morning, it's lilach. so, it's basically combination. so, we definitely see recovery at our end market for sure. okay. and we're happy to see that. we see companies are coming back specifically, consumable companies are coming back to work. start utilize the system. and we see those on services, to remind you in systems, we are a very like nearly 2019 levels in a utilization of consumables.
in services, we actually are even more than 2019 level pre covid so, we're definitely happy about that. see, the market is open up and companies are coming back. on the same time, we are seeing also a new trend like, for example, in emea a very strong emea manufacturing application demand for products. we see companies, we see government providing a funding for the industry. and this is where 3d printing actually in our technology have the benefit.
and we leverage in this uptick demand as company understand the adventures of additive manufacturing. we also introduced new machines in healthcare systems, our new dentajet, as well as the medijet. these also contribute to the strong growth that we see this quarter, as well as the customer reception to our lps product. it was excellent even more than what we expect. and this is definitely a testimony to what we believe in the future will happen.
we have the best go-to-market in infrastructure and as we introduce more and more technology on the same install base and the same go-to-market, we definitely can enjoy from accelerated course.
yoav zeif -- chief executive officer
just to add to it, it's a combination very hard to draw the line here, but it's a combination between returning to growth. and this is also the assumption going forward. no one can predict the future but we assume that the world is coming back to growth. but not less important, we are introducing new products. we are improving the execution of this company. we are having better relationship with our customers. and on top of all this, we have already rps and stuff. so, that's why we feel confident when we are talking about our future.
jim ricchiuti -- needham and company -- analyst
okay, my follow up is just with respect to gross margins, similar gross margins over the balance of the year that you were talking about that you saw in q2. with the new products that you're bringing out later this year, is there any things that we need to consider about your gross margins, at least in the early part of next year?
lilach payorski -- chief financial officer
hi jim. at that point, we are not providing specific guidance on gross margin for next year. and obviously, gross margin is a-we have a wide portfolio and ultimately, it's a mix issue. so, if we think about manufacturing strategy in overall manufacturing application, we expect revenue to be significantly higher, a bigger profit pool, which will drive consumption up, will generate a higher profit.
at that point, we are not providing any a specific detail in terms of how this will play. but we do believe that it will have an impact in our gross margin. on the same time, we also have content design focused initiatives for the new product. and as we introduce new products, usually they are in their highest growth stage in their life.
and as they mature from also consulting perspective, as well as some design perspective, we are anticipating to see the cost is down. so, we are also working on this, is another initiative. and as we noted earlier, specifically, we have mentioned about the fact that we are ramping up the monetization of our software business. and over time, we're going to see some positive impact of these margins on the business as well.
jim ricchiuti -- needham and company -- analyst
thanks a lot.

thank you. our next question today is coming from ananda baruah from loop capital. your line is now live.
ananda baruah -- loop capital -- analyst
hi, i guess good afternoon. good evening, guys. you guys, congrats on the solid quarter. thanks for taking the question. i have two though, i'll ask them at the same time, they may-as the answers may be related. the first part of it is you guys sort of the degree of strength above what your expectations are, do you have any context you can share that you've discerned as to what the drivers of that strength was? and then the second part of that is, i guess, in the...
yoav zeif -- chief executive officer
sorry, you're disconnected. sorry for cutting you. can you please repeat the question?
ananda baruah -- loop capital -- analyst
certainly, thanks. so, do you have any context or visibility around what the drivers of the strength of your expectations were for the quarter? and it really feels like it's for the second half of the year here? and then the second part of the question is, any context you can share around the shift of your revenue mix toward production kind of currently away from the classic credit cycle business would be helpful as well? thanks on this.
lilach payorski -- chief financial officer
good morning, ananda. so, we are definitely we're happy to see a higher revenue rate compared to what we previously thought. and there was a couple of the elements that drove this trend. first of all, is the consumption of the consumable. it really depends also on the market recovery, and we're happy to see that the market recovery is actually is going better than what we thought. and utilization of our system is going up as companies are coming back.
having said that, we all know the recovery is still here. but we definitely see a good sign. and if you compare it to last to pre covid, we are nearly pre covid level. so, this definitely is a good time that it contributes to the increase of revenue above what we expected. as well as we see on emea side, a significant impact from government funding of customers. and industries specifically in italy and uk, a manufacturing application.
so, we see this trend, and we hope to see this trend also going forward. as well as the introduction of our healthcare system including the new jet dentajet and medijet, we just launched it in march and in may. and we saw a very, very good reception to this product. and the last thing is the lps product that we just acquired in q1. and we immediately launch it within our install base. and we see a very, very good reception within our go-to-market and our customers. and this is again a testimony of our scale strategy with the new technology.
yoav zeif -- chief executive officer
thank you, lilach.
ananda baruah -- loop capital -- analyst
[indecipherable]
yoav zeif -- chief executive officer
i will-ok i will relate to the manufacturing and prototyping question. so, as you know, we shared, we were the first company in the industry to share the ratio of our sales going to manufacturing. we are measuring it, and we promise and we do it to review it once a year on an annual basis. every first quarter, we will announce it. so, we are measuring it and we are following it. we're optimistic.
as i said, at the beginning of this call, leading manufacturers in the world decided that the plant of the future will include additive manufacturing. this is a fact. and when they are going there, they value our establishment. they want to do it with stratasys. it's very clear, and we can see it on a daily basis. it's a journey. but we are leading this journey. we are shifting this industry on the polymer side, from rapid prototyping to manufacturing.
and just to remind you, we just launched three systems focused on manufacturing. so, it also gives more confidence to our customers that we are committed to this journey. we launch it, we announced that we will have on the origin and on the software hybrid material model. and we are building a software platform to support it. so, we are building the full package.
and put yourself in the seat of someone in the fortune 100 when they are taking those huge decisions because they are challenging the status quo and changing the way they manufacture products. they want to make sure that they have the right partner on their side. and we are the right partner.

thank you. our next question today is coming from greg palm from craig-hallum. your line is now live.
greg palm -- craig-hallum -- analyst
yeah, thanks. so, you mentioned this sort of continued headwind and rising input in logistics cost. i guess i'm curious if you saw any supply chain challenges that may be impacted your ability to fulfill orders and are you able to quantify at least what sort of those rising input and logistic costs is? is it a 100-basis point impact? 200 basis point impact to gross margin? a little bit more color will be helpful.
lilach payorski -- chief financial officer
good morning, greg. as we discussed earlier in the call, we definitely prioritize getting our product to our customers on time. and despite the challenges of global shipping issues, we're mainly impacted to regarding on-time delivery. the most important things is, specifically as we sell manufacturing application that customers will not have a downtime, and system will work all the time. so, this is our focus and the main focus.
having said that, we are definitely working, we analyze an increase in our inventory level for materials and finished goods to avoid any delay, increasing production levels, and preparing for c and l delays in our planning process. we are evaluating a wider array of shipping options to ensure we can deliver goods with minimal business impact. from a cost perspective, it does impact our cost base.
and what we saw this quarter that we actually had a more significant cost, even compared to q1 since the situation is worsening. and if i helped you a little bit to quantify it, it's about 2% overall between logistic costs as well as inflation in higher raw material cost overall.
greg palm -- craig-hallum -- analyst
okay, that's helpful. and knowing that, i mean, how are you thinking about pricing? i don't know if that's changed at all. but curious, is pricing a lever that you can pull to offset some of these rising costs? or is that not something that you're looking at necessarily?
yoav zeif -- chief executive officer
yeah, of course, we are sensing it. we are on top of it on a daily basis and we are adjusting where is needed.
greg palm -- craig-hallum -- analyst
okay, fair enough. thanks. and best of luck going forward.
yoav zeif -- chief executive officer

now, i would like to turn the call over to our chief executive officer, dr. yoav zeif. yoav?
yoav zeif -- chief executive officer
thank you yonah. good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today. today, i will walk you through the highlights of the second quarter and some recent developments. i will then discuss our ongoing progress to expand our leadership position in the polymer 3d printing market, producing and delivering the most innovative, next generation technologies that address the fastest-growing manufacturing applications. lilach will then provide financial details for the quarter and give an update on our outlook before we take your questions. the second quarter continued to show accelerating growth for our company.
the 3d printing industry is moving toward providing full-scale digital manufacturing platforms at mass production levels, rather than being primarily a prototyping tool. stratasys is at the forefront of this shift with our best-in-class solutions for this high-value market opportunity. the company's quarter was highlighted by 25% year over year revenue growth, well above our previously shared expectations and driven by growth of 32% in hardware and 39% in consumable, offset by slower growth in our parts business due primarily to the relatively slow recovery of the aerospace market.
while we are pleased to have produced our third consecutive quarter of sustained revenue growth, we know that it is critical to continue to invest in technology, software, material, and talent to further enhance our leadership position and to drive future profitability. our business momentum and customers' manufacturing operations are nearing full recovery from the pandemic, as evidenced by both consumables and services revenues returning to near 2019 levels. we are seeing good reception to three recently launched systems; the dentajet and medijet specifically for the healthcare sector and the rps stereolithography systems that we acquired in q1.
we are also seeing excellent market reaction to our new carbon fiber material for the f123 series. importantly, we realized year over year growth across all of our regions and business lines, with notable strength from emea and the americas. during the second quarter, we achieved several important milestones to drive our strategy. as we mentioned on our prior earnings call, we hosted our manufacturing experience event that was attended by over 4,500 customers, resellers and partners. at the event, we provided details on three new manufacturing-focused product offerings that will play an integral role in our future growth. these include the origin one, a best-in-class photopolymer 3d printer that received a top-to-bottom optimization upgrade to improve serviceability, performance, and utilization.
the h350, powered by selective absorption fusion, or saf technology and built for true thermoplastic mass production of consistently accurate end-use parts. and the f770, designed with the longest fully heated build chamber in fdm but as simple to use as our other popular f123 printers. during the quarter we also strengthened our healthcare offerings with the launch of our j5 medijet medical 3d printer.
this printer meets the highest standards in terms of running biocompatible materials and sterilization protocols. it is designed for anatomical models, surgical guides, and any production parts in a medical environment, such as tooling. it is 510k approved with leading medical segmentation software and has multi-material capabilities. on the dental side, due to our latest technology expansion, we are now the only company with a full technology portfolio.
polyjet, p3 by origin and stereolithography that enables us to address and develop the most suitable solutions across the dental industry. this allows us to best match the right solution for each customer type. polyjet offers multi-materials and mix-tray printing, allowing for different dental parts on the same tray. p3 offers industrial scale and a wider material system, all while providing better cost per part. and in fact, the j5 dentajet printer launched in q1 is already performing very well in the market.
these systems collectively expand our reach into healthcare as utilization of 3d printing in the medical and dental communities accelerates. mass customization is a key benefit of 3d printing, so it is ideal for providing personalized healthcare. given the range of products we are bringing to the market, we view healthcare as a key growth component for our portfolio going forward. this quarter also saw us make great strides enhancing our esg initiatives. 3d printing has some inherent sustainability benefits over traditional manufacturing. and during the quarter we created an esg leadership team to guide our strategy.
we recently became a founding board member of the additive manufacturer green trade association. the leading organization focused on our industry, and in a few weeks, we look forward to announcing more details related to our esg plans. in software, we expanded our partner program to six companies in the first six months of 2021 with the addition of teton simulation, which uses our new grabcad design for additive manufacturing or dfam, software development kit to help customers improve the reliability of additive manufacturing builds.
this is another example of how we are using our leadership position in 3d printing to build ecosystems of partners across software, materials, and post-processing to provide superior solutions for customers. our software business has seen great progress over the first half of 2021, and we have started monetizing our offerings into paid subscriptions. the first example is grabcad shop, which provides customers with an all-in-one tool that helps teams communicate 3d printing needs, fulfill internal 3d printing work orders, and monitor 3d printing job progress. grabcad shop improves over-the-air with regular updates to meet customer's new and growing needs.
to-date, grabcad shop is being used by several large customers from around the world including schneider electric, mclaren, virginia tech and many more. we will grow our monetization strategy through the sale of annual run-time license subscriptions which enable customers to connect their stratasys printers to our third-party partners such as siemens, link3d, identify 3d and others.
in may, we launched our customer hub, a new digital ordering platform for partners and customers to help make us not only the best but also the easiest 3d printing company with whom to do business. over 25 million in orders were placed globally in q2, with all regions well represented, and we already have over 2,000 new account activations. in addition to giving them a complete dashboard view of their portfolio of stratasys 3d printers, users find it to be a fast and convenient way to order from us, particularly for fdm and polyjet materials.
with the powerful combination of our next phase of product launches moving ahead and our multiple competitive advantages, we will further advance our position as the leading provider of polymer 3d printing solutions for our world-class customer base. i'd like to remind you of those competitive advantages. we have the broadest, most advanced polymer technologies that span the full product lifecycle, from concept to end-use-parts.
our customer-centric dynamic software strategy continues to evolve from the close working relationships we have with many oems across industry. this approach provides a unified, comprehensive platform across our technologies that is built to interface with the top standard enterprise systems. supporting our products, we have the leading global channel with over 200 partners that can market, sell and maintain systems for our customers.
we have the largest team of engineers and customer support in our industry. and we have a proven and resilient business model designed to scale across a range of macro-economic conditions. these key advantages, combined with the new technologies that will launch primarily in the fourth quarter and beyond, position stratasys to continue delivering on our growth strategy. our improved results in the past few quarters demonstrate the renewed strength of the company and that our strategy is on the right track. this is only the beginning of what we believe will be an accelerated pattern of growth in the coming years.
i will now turn the call over to lilach, who will share the financial results of the quarter. lilach?
lilach payorski -- chief financial officer
thank you, yoav, and good morning everyone. we are pleased to have exceeded our stated targets in the second quarter. the 25% total revenue growth compared to the corresponding quarter of 2020, especially the 35.8% growth in our products sales, along with our positive cash generation, support our growing optimism around the continuing economic recovery from covid-19 and our unique position to lead the market. for the quarter, total revenue was $147.0 million, up 25% versus the prior-year quarter and in excess of our previous outlook of mid-teens growth. this was primarily due to stronger than expected performance in europe, a substantive increase in our consumables sales to almost pre-covid 2019 levels, our customer support revenues exceeding 2019 and the successful launch of the rps resin-based systems.
customer reception to rps has been solid, demonstrating our ability to leverage our go-to-market access to customers that helps to accelerate sales. on a constant currency basis, total revenue grew 22.4% versus the second quarter of 2020. product revenue grew almost 36% in the second quarter to $100.3 million, compared to the same period last year, or 32.6% on a constant currency basis. within product revenue, system revenue grew 32% to $45.6 million compared to the same period last year and increased 29.2% on a constant currency basis. this growth was bolstered by the introduction of the new systems we discussed earlier, including rps and the new healthcare printers.
the rate of growth clearly demonstrates that an end-market recovery is well underway compared to the corresponding quarter of 2020, which was fully impacted by the pandemic. the quarter also saw improved consumables utilization, showing strength after the covid slowdown. consumables revenue rose 39.1% to $54.7 million compared to the same period last year and was up 35.5% on a constant currency basis. relatively to the 2019 quarter, consumables improved to the point of being off only 3.4%, showing a nearly complete reversal of the impact of the pandemic as our customers increase the utilization of our systems. you may recall that earlier this year we announced the launch of our carbon fiber material for the f123 series.
we believe it is the best of its kind in the market, providing the benefits of both strength and more geometric freedom while staying lightweight. the material continues to perform well, and importantly, it has also been a meaningful catalyst for sales of our f370 system. service revenue was $46.7 million, up 6.8% compared to the same period last year. on a constant currency basis, service revenue grew 5.3%. within service revenue, customer support revenue increased 10% to $28.3 million, an increase of 8.2% on a constant currency basis and up 1.4% compared to q2 of 2019, which was pre-covid, another good indication of market recovery and increased system utilization.
turning to margin, gaap gross margin was 43% for the quarter, compared to 37.2% for the same period last year. non-gaap gross margin was 47.5% for the quarter, compared to 45.4% for the same period last year. given the increase in hardware and consumables growth, overall sales margin benefited from change of mix. this was partially offset by increased global cost pressures that included logistics and raw materials inflation, which were both more costly this quarter than q1, and ramp-up production costs for new product introductions.
at this point, it looks like these issues will continue to be a negative impact for the back half of this year. due to the ongoing uncertainty of these macro issues, along with the introduction in the second half of new systems and the anticipated associated upfront margin pressure, we expect gross margins for the balance of the year to remain similar to what we saw in q2.
gaap operating expenses were $86 million, an increase of $13 million or 17.8% compared to the same period last year. non-gaap operating expenses were $72.5 million, an increase of $11 million or 18% for the quarter as compared to the same period last year. non-gaap operating expenses were 49.3% of revenue for the quarter, compared to 52.2% for the same period last year. operating expenses were up primarily due to the return to a five-days workweek, post-covid expenses as the market started opening up, and commissions due to more revenue.
we also incurred additional operating costs associated with the inclusion of our new acquisitions. these costs were funded by the resizing plan implemented in may 2020 which allowed us to allocate resources to area where we believe we will generate stronger growth. from an earnings perspective, gaap operating loss for the quarter was $22.7 million, compared to a loss of $29.3 million for the same period last year. non-gaap operating loss for the quarter was $2.6 million, compared to a loss of $8.1 million for the same period last year.
gaap net loss for the quarter was $20.2 million, or $0.31 per diluted share, compared to net a loss of $28 million, or $0.51 per diluted share, for the same period last year. non-gaap net loss for the quarter was $1.6 million, or $0.02 per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $7.4 million, or $0.13 per diluted share in the same period last year. we produced cash of $5.6 million from operations during the second quarter as compared to using $9.7 million of cash in the same quarter last year.
this totals $52.1 million generated in the last three quarters, an excellent achievement despite the impact of the pandemic. we are pleased to have generated this level of cash flow given our second half plans to continue investing to accelerate the growth of our business. we ended the quarter with $522.7 million in cash and cash equivalent and short-term deposit, compared to $530.4 million at the end of the first quarter of 2021.
beyond the strategic investment, we have recently made to help expand our product portfolio, we continue to evaluate additional opportunities that will further strengthen our leadership position as we execute on our strategic initiative. now turning to our outlook for the balance of the year. as we previously stated, the revenue growth will be sequentially linear. we expect q3 to be approximately 17% to 18% higher than q3 of last year and q4 will be sequentially higher.
we continue to expect our opex for all of 2021 to be approximately $30 million higher than 2020 due primarily to the return to a five-days workweek and operating costs as the markets are gradually opening post-covid. we continue to expect our capital expenditure for all of 2021 to range between $24 million to $30 million. we have a strong balance sheet that will support our ongoing growth both internally through strategic investments in high-growth area of our business that focus on manufacturing, and externally when additional growth opportunities emerge.
in the coming years, as the 3d printing industry expands and shifts to mass production from prototyping, we are committed to not only maintain our leadership position, but to growing it.
with that, let me turn the call back over to yoav for closing remarks. yoav?
yoav zeif -- chief executive officer
thank you, lilach. the second quarter was an exciting one for stratasys, as we saw growth across all platforms accelerate. we expect that our existing market-leading offerings and our new platforms that will begin to ship in the fourth quarter will provide incremental growth that should contribute to revenues, cash flow and earnings in the coming years.
the order pipeline for these new systems is solid, and we look forward to updating you further after the launch. we are executing on our strategy to enhance our leadership position in polymer 3d printing, and with our strengthened balance sheet we are in a position to create long-term value for all of our stakeholders.
with that, let's open it up for questions. operator?

[operator instructions] our first question come from the line of greg palm with craig-hallum. please proceed with your questions.
greg palm -- craig-hallum -- analyst
great. thanks for taking the questions. congrats on the good results here.
yoav zeif -- chief executive officer
thank you.
greg palm -- craig-hallum -- analyst
i wanted to maybe start with the revenue guide. it's a pretty specific number and a pretty uncertain environment. so maybe help us understand some of the assumptions behind that? are you expecting that some of that contract with the u.s. navy, i think the first eight of those were maybe expected to ship in q4. so is that included, but just maybe a few assumptions behind the actual revenue guide would be helpful.
lilach payorski -- chief financial officer
hi. good morning, greg. yes, i will be happy to share with you some of the assumptions that we have. so first of all, you touched about the u.s. navy, yes, some of the u.s. navy part of the backlog, and it's part of the expectation for q4, that has been discussed. this is a multiyear deal, and we're going to see some of this impact in the h2. what we provided for q4 is basically 16% higher than last year. and specifically, we have anticipated a nice growth in our systems relatively to q4 last year as well as the q4 in 2019. so we basically expected to see growth almost in all of our streams, all of our platforms, the continued trend, the strong trend that we saw at manufacturing platforms and offerings. we also expected to see growth coming from consumables as we see consumable pace picking up compared to last year as well as compared to 2019. we are expecting that most of the growth will come still from organic growth, and this is why we're definitely encouraged by that. to remind you that our p3 platform as well as saf will introduce in the coming few months and impact 2021 just a little bit, and the majority of this impact will be in 2022
greg palm -- craig-hallum -- analyst
okay. that's really helpful. and that was going to lead me to my follow-up, which was diving into contribution from new products. so it doesn't sound like you have or you're least, you're expecting significant contribution from rps, origin, h350 in this year. so is that the sense and we should really be thinking about the ramp-up happening over calendar 2022?
yoav zeif -- chief executive officer
hi. greg, thank you for the question. and thank you for investing so much in studying this industry and us as well. yes, the answer is, yes. we will not have significant impact of the two new technologies. we have one technology out there already, the rps, the sla, which have really, really good traction. as for the other two, we are going to have some sales, practically we'll have the saf outside there. both of them are in better stage. saf is already a few months into and we are going to outside at the end of this year, and we are now shipping an extensive data program for the p3. and we are very, very optimistic about it, but the significant impact will come definitely in 2022. and of course, we're looking forward to share more about those two exciting technologies.
greg palm -- craig-hallum -- analyst
interesting. i'll leave it there. thanks.
operator
thank you. our next questions come from the line of troy jensen with lake street capital markets. please proceed with your questions.
troy jensen -- lake street capital markets -- analyst
well, first of all, congrats on just a great quarter. i guess my first question is going to go to yoav. specifically on the h350, it's our belief that hp discontinued -- excuse me, their 540 and their 580 product line, and they're just going with the production model of 5200 going forward. so i guess i'd love to hear your thoughts just on the opportunity in the mid-range for high-speed setting. do you guys need to have a larger format one in the market, too, to compete margins what hp is doing that with the 5200? and then also post-processing [indecipherable] that's one thing that i hear about that. it seems like hp may have thought of better so far for the high-speed setting, but go ahead, please.
yoav zeif -- chief executive officer
thank you, troy. as always, a great question. so first of all, we have our own program and the h350 is only the first machine or system in a line of products. so let me be very clear here. we are very optimistic. we think that the saf technology, it's a transformation. the whole agents set is transforming powder bed fusion practically because it gets us closer into real manufacturing. and we see it every day because already our beta sites are producing end-use product to end customers, and they are very happy. now if i will relate specifically to the hp announcement, i think it's a good announcement for us overall because there is a segment that we'd be very happy to adopt our new technology, the saf technology and the fact that we will be in this kind of midrange will give us a lot of points. on top of it, we are good enough to be here also very clear. we are good enough in terms of cost of part, quality of the part, accuracy to compete also with the largest system that we also will have in the future.
troy jensen -- lake street capital markets -- analyst
all right. perfect. and just my follow-up to -- you guys talked about this other leading global oem win in the quarter. you made it sounds like it was a repeat customer. is this the same customer that was announced like 1.5 years ago that came in with kind of a big chunky order also?
yoav zeif -- chief executive officer
we cannot share the name. i'm sure you understand it. i can only share that this is what we dream of to be...
troy jensen -- lake street capital markets -- analyst
i understand you cannot share the name, but can you just confirm it's the same guy?
yoav zeif -- chief executive officer
i cannot relate to it. i can only say that this is what we dream of because when we are talking about manufacturing, it's about this relationship and partnership with major oems, where can -- we really can roll out global distributed manufacturing with the same practices, with the playbook, and this is exactly what we are doing. and i think this will be a great example for many other oems as well. and the fact that it's a repeating purchase just proven our point that those large oems are looking for an established player that can deliver, that has the certification and can support them globally. and we're trying to be humble, but this is stratasys.
troy jensen -- lake street capital markets -- analyst
i completely agree. congrats. good luck going forward and i will see you in january.
operator
thank you. our next questions come from the line of jared maymon with berenberg capital markets. please proceed with your questions.
jared maymon -- berenberg capital marketsa -- analyst
hi. good morning guys. nice job executing during the quarter. first question for me. you guys have made some great moves in the last year or so to expand the number of technologies and processes that you offer. so from here, i'm wondering kind of is your plan to buckle down and focus on developing and scaling those technologies in the consumables for those technologies? or do you think there's some more room to go for adding additional processes and technologies in the near to midterm?
yoav zeif -- chief executive officer
hi, jared. thank you for the question. we have more than $500 million in the bank. we have a very clear strategy. we know where we are going. it's a growth strategy. and in order to accelerate the growth, we'll, first of all, make sure that those technologies are best-in-class and leading each one of the segments we are competing in. so this is number one priority. then we would use our cash to accelerate and to have some technological shortcuts, which we identify many of those, and we believe that we will be able to accelerate this growth strategy. on top of it, of course, this is the whole essence of what we are doing. we are bringing to our customers the full package and the full package includes the technology, the system, the materials. we invest a lot in material, and we developed many, many more materials in many different ways.
and also, we are expanding our service to fit what a manufacturer expect from us. and on top of it, we'll make sure that all this is being connected through what we call our -- the base, the foundation is our software platform. we tie everything through the software platform, and we believe that will kind of make the offering perfect, suitable, beneficial for our manufacturing customers. so this is the strategy, and we will combine it with very extensive r&d in each one of the groups that are developing this technology plus extension through material and software and service, some of them organic and some of them inorganic.
jared maymon -- berenberg capital marketsa -- analyst
got it. thanks. and then there was a service bureau that reporting -- sorry, reported disappointing results last week, and they attributed that largely to supply constraints, particularly around labor and logistics. so i'm wondering, given that they have a big additive business, did you guys see similar headwinds across the business? and then particularly in sdm, did you see those same labor and logistics headwinds there?
yoav zeif -- chief executive officer
so let me relate first. by the way, now i remember that i didn't answered troy question about post-processing in hss. we are developing it troy, and we are going to introduce it in the coming year. so it's there. we are investing in it. it's integral part of our workflow. now back to your question, i'm sorry. sdm, definitely, we are seeing an improvement there, a meaningful improvement, a year-over-year growth of over 25% in q3 2021 versus q3 2020. we have a -- we have the highest hand of the service bureau industry. we are working with the top customers, mainly in aerospace and automotive. and yes, we are seeing progress over the last few months versus a very big hit that we experienced during the pandemic. about headwind for sdm of logistics and supply chain, it was not meaningful in sdm in our service bureau, but we are definitely have like any other industrial company on earth, we have challenges of logistics and supply chain in our overall business. it's a daily fight.
i want to thank my operations team for really doing amazing things, so creative, and we are successfully delivering. we didn't have any delivery issues. but every day is a challenge, and definitely, there is uncertainty there. having said that, we are one of those privileged industries there are -- that are not only suffering from the supply chain challenges, but also enjoying it long term because this is what brings to life, the all essence and the power of additive manufacturing. you want no more offshoring. you want to have digital inventory. you want to produce near the customer, and we see it every day in the level of engagement we have with the largest oem on earth. so we fight every day, but we see the light and we see that the world of manufacturing is going to change and be much more digitalized than what we see now.
jared maymon -- berenberg capital marketsa -- analyst
great. thank you.
operator
thank you. our next questions come from the line of shannon cross with cross research. please proceed with your questions.
shannon cross -- cross researcha -- analyst
thank you very much. i wanted to dig a little bit more into the conversations that you had with customers at rapid. i know you mentioned that you signed more -- it definitely seemed to us like the people who bothered to shop in chicago were ones that were really, really interested in 3d printing. but i'm wondering, have you seen any change in the timing that they have in terms of the intensity of what they're looking at, the projects that they're focused on? because it does seem like there's an inflection going on for your company as well as for the industry. so i'm just kind of curious as to what you heard. thank you.
yoav zeif -- chief executive officer
thank you, shannon, and thank you for coming to our booth in rapid. you're very, very brave, i would say. yes, it was a great opportunity to meet many manufacturers that understand really reading the global map and understand that they need to move forward and so have a change. and we see a completely different level of engagement. i would say that it's being reflected in two -- kind of two horizons. and one is the time line. and you can see it here with our navy deal, for example, or with our oem deal, suddenly, people -- the cycle is shorter. it's still long, but it's shorter because we're talking about long deals that involve service and software and material and support and -- but it's shorter. definitely, the time line is shorter, still long, but shorter. and the second big difference is the level of engagement. so we used to engage with technicians, engineers like those champions that drive change or the change agents within organizations. following the rapid+tct meetings, i had whole visit in the aerospace hub in denver and the level of people that i met within the organization, ceo, c suite executive, it's completely different than what we used to have in the past, which means that we have more challenges because we need to make sure that we are delivering value and on time, but it means that it's much more -- those organizations are much more serious about 3d printing, which is great from our perspective.
shannon cross -- cross researcha -- analyst
thank you. that's helpful. and then i guess the other question i have from an inventory perspective, can you talk a bit about any backlogs, challenges you have? i mean, clearly, your inventory continues to come down. just where you sort of set at the end of the quarter and maybe if you saw linearity during the quarter as well in terms of demand and bookings and signings? thank you.
lilach payorski -- chief financial officer
yes. good morning, shannon. so from an inventory perspective, as other oem and the manufacturers, we do suffer from raw material shortage for sure that the most important thing is really meeting the customer demand. so we are constantly increasing our inventory level, even though you see that at the end of the quarter, it actually went down compared to last quarter, but we are proactively taking steps in buying raw material for six or nine, or even 12 months ahead to make sure that we're going to meet customer demand and to meet the up demand that we see. so we're working very intensively in making it happen. of course, we are trying to mitigate the issues of sea and air delays in our planning process, and we continue to evaluate a wider area of shipping option to ensure we can deliver goods in a minimal business impact. it may come with costs associated with that. but the objective is clear, meeting the customer demand. we're happy to report that so far, we were able to do that. and we have a good backlog going into q4, and we do everything we can in order to meet the demand.
shannon cross -- cross researcha -- analyst
great. thank you very much.
operator
thank you. our next question has come from the line of paul chung with jpmorgan. please proceed with your questions.
paul chung -- jpmorgan -- analyst
hi. thank you for taking my question. great quarter. so just on margins, can you quantify the component inflation and kind of freight costs hitting 3q and 4q? just want to get a sense for kind of your normalized gross margins as we head into 2022. can you kind of rebound back to the fiscal year 2019 levels in the low 50s next year?
lilach payorski -- chief financial officer
hi paul, good morning. so yes, our gross margin has been pressured by the global logistic constraint as well as raw materials. first of all, we are definitely very happy to see the sequential improvement over the quarters. ok? and we believe that these trends will continue as we're going to continue to see hardware and consumable in the mix. we saw this impact in this quarter and also as compared to last year. if you compare to 2019, the impact of logistic cost as well as the raw materials is probably closer to the 2%-ish difference, at the same time, we are still not in a full capacity from production level. we still have a shortage in raw material. so this has also impact our level of production as well as investing in ramp-up of our production line, addressing the new platform.
so we still have a gap, obviously compared to our -- for 2019, we believe that when the market recovery, but it's not going to be a short term in terms of -- i'm talking about from logistics and raw material shortage. no one expects that next quarter, this is what's going to be the picture. it's going to be -- probably for the coming few quarters, we will be able to leverage a better gross margin as the global economic improved. at the same time, we are working also on improving our cost on our new platform as part of the product life cycle. and at that point, we are yet to provide guidance for 2022 in terms of our gross margin. with that, we believe that for q4 specifically, our gross margin level will stay relatively similar to what we saw in q3.
paul chung -- jpmorgan -- analyst
got you. and then just on quarterly opex, you're going to see a step up to the $80 million new run rate moving forward. so is that the right way to think about quarterly opex moving forward? and then assume xaar revenue contribution is minimal, but how do we think about how that business scales over time as well?
lilach payorski -- chief financial officer
paul, can you please repeat your question, please?
paul chung -- jpmorgan -- analyst
yes. so just on the quarterly opex levels, we saw -- we're going to see a step up to $80 million kind of the -- is that the new run rate moving forward? is that the right way to think about it?
lilach payorski -- chief financial officer
yes. so we are increasing opex in q4 and definitely compared to last year, and this is basically because of the return to five days work week, the higher expenses as the markets recovered, we see a higher commission due to higher revenue. and we also include -- incur additional operating cost associated with the inclusion of our new business. rps, origin and now in q4 we also adding xaar, this is all part of our strategic investment going forward. i just remind you that 2021, it is a year of investment. it is a year of investment, and we are -- believe we are continuing to invest, but we are committed to show improvement in profitability in the near future.
paul chung -- jpmorgan -- analyst
great. and then lastly, on cash flow, you've been positive for last five quarters, a very good job there. so can we end fiscal year 2021 kind of in positive territory? are there any working cap things we need to see like inventory investments or maybe reversal of accounts payable that might weigh on 4q?
lilach payorski -- chief financial officer
yes. as we look to the fourth quarter of 2021, we are not providing guidance on the operating cash flow. but in 2021, we have stated that we expected the majority of our growth to occur in the second half of the year, and this is what we are delivering. so much of the cash flow benefit will come in 2022 and beyond. the preparation for the launch of the three significant npi we recently introduced coupled with the safety stock. we are being -- to mitigate the raw material shortage is expected to increase our inventory level and related payments in the next few quarters, which will increase our operating cash outflow, would certain led in a cash inflow from collection after we started selling.
paul chung -- jpmorgan -- analyst
thank you very much.
lilach payorski -- chief financial officer
i just want to point out that nothing out of the ordinary expected for q4.
operator
thank you. our next questions come from the line of wamsi mohan with bank of america. please proceed with your question.
john -- bank of america -- analyst
hello and thanks for taking my question. this is john [phonetic] on behalf of wamsi. i just wanted to come back to the guide. you mentioned acceleration in revenue in '22 and beyond. could you just provide more color regarding maybe like the magnitude and the key drivers, whether it's coming from products, services or even in certain end markets? and from that guide, how much it's predicated on the economic recovery? thanks.
yoav zeif -- chief executive officer
okay. thank you, john, and send our regards to wamsi. we are still working under the same assumption suggesting an accelerated mode. so we have the same underlined very strong driver that boost 3d printing forward like the one that we already mentioned, the supply chain issues, but really, this is the perfect storm for us in terms of engagement, like i mentioned to shannon. the fact that people are changing the way they are manufactured in terms of geometries and new technologies that are out there that we can provide those new parts and new products that are needed there like moving from metal to composites, for example. that's a very, very strong trend that we see out there. and the last one is the overall move into manufacturing, which is more customized and more personalized. and just to share with you an anecdote about those drivers, i met a customer lately in the aerospace and i spend like half a day there. and i asked them, ok, you are using our f900, this is the one by the way that we sold in the navy deal. and they are using it for end-use parts, very high-end, customized -- one of the customer using for end-use parts and other for jigs and fixtures for aerospace, for space to be more precise. and i asked them, what is the roi on our f900? and they told me between four to six months.
when i'm buying here in stratasys equipment for production, it takes us -- we are happy with four to five years. and this is four to six months. i think this is the biggest example or reflection of what we are experiencing now. and our customers are so advanced, much more advanced than us in many cases, in some applications to take this forward, and we practically build a strategy that address exactly those needs, one to one. for each application, you need a different technology. we have all the needed technologies that will fit those challenges in polymers. done. then they need a variety of materials. we have those warehouse materials, and we are working in it, and we certify it and we make sure that it delivers the promise. then the last thing is software. we need those -- the software that will carry the user from the design -- the early design and the conceptual design to the manufacturing and the production through this old trend through a software platform. those are the growth engines. we have three new technologies. we have the basic core technologies of sdm and polyjet, the best in the world. we have software and we have material, and we put all this with service that we can support 24/7 because we have such a big service organization, and this is the catalyst. and we will see this really coming to life next year. the details, of course -- this is a high level, the details we'll be happy to share in our next call.
john -- bank of america -- analyst
got it. thank you. and if i could squeeze in a quick follow-up. so in regards to the new products coming into the market in 2022, just wondering if we were to think about the contribution from these products relative to 2021, how much growth do you expect them to contribute? thank you.
yoav zeif -- chief executive officer
great question, but you know that our policy is not to share these type of details in 2021. we get to the quarter in 2022 -- early 2022, and we'd be happy to discuss it.
john -- bank of america -- analyst
got it. thank you.

thank you. our next questions come from the line of jim ricchiuti with needham & company. please proceed with your question.
jim ricchiuti -- needham & company -- analyst
hi. good afternoon. congratulations on the quarter. and maybe just as a follow-up to the prior question, and you may not be able to answer it. but if we think about the newer products, the h350, the p3, and i realize you can't be granular, but can you tell us if you anticipate those products ramping in the earlier part of 2022? or is this -- is the expectation that your optimism, the scale-up in that takes place more in the second half?
yoav zeif -- chief executive officer
we are now in the process of closing our budget or aop for next year. so even if i want to give you the exact numbers, i don't know them yet. so we are very authentic on this one. we have beta sites, many beta sites with h350. we are on the verge of launching it. the beta sites are very happy they are producing end-use parts to end customers, very large oems, by the way. we get very good feedback from the end user. so from the automotive company, from the consumer good companies, from the aerospace companies that are using our part, this is very encouraging. we are going to launch it. we'll ramp it up next year, and i believe it will be a significant revenue stream next year and definitely as a product line in the next five, six years.
jim ricchiuti -- needham & company -- analyst
that's helpful. and if i could, just on the stratasys direct business, you're seeing -- well, there appears to be a nice recovery there. and presumably, some of that is just the industry recovery. but i'm wondering if you're also potentially taking some share there? or is this just a case of a broader industry recovery that you're benefiting from?
yoav zeif -- chief executive officer
no. first of all, it's really a very nice recovery, 25% year-over-year, and also we see very good booking data, which is great. in terms of are we gaining share or not? i believe it's less gaining shares because we are in a very unique high-end -- i would say, using a metaphor, in the luxury goods of this space of this industry. we are working with the highest quality certified part. not many -- we are not in the quick part business. so not many service bureaus out there are really competing with us. so we are very dependent on the aerospace, automotive. when they are going up, we have our fair share and more.
jim ricchiuti -- needham & company -- analyst
so the key drivers are aerospace, space and auto and just your strong position in those key verticals with the advanced equipment you have, is that a way to think about what's happening there?
yoav zeif -- chief executive officer
yes.

hi. thanks for taking my question. i just wanted to ask about opex again and see if you could give -- i don't know how to ask this question in a way that you'll answer it. but for 2022, i'm just wondering, can you give any guidance around -- directionally around opex? you mentioned, lilach, 2021 an investment year, but i would assume 2022 continues to be an investment year and then more trade shows, more travel and entertainment, etc, type of expenses coming back. so i'm just wondering -- the street is now modeling up like 6% growth in opex for 2022. and i'm just having flashbacks from like 2013, 2014, when things were starting -- it really seemed like they were going well and everything is picking up, and then opex was up like $100 million plus the next year. so can you just give us some comfort that -- is opex going to grow in line with like an expected revenue growth? or does opex grow slower than revenue in 2022? is $80 million the right kind of run rate to think about? or is it higher than that? like any sense for that because this, i think, is the biggest variable in the model right now.
lilach payorski -- chief financial officer
yes. good morning, brian. you definitely can appreciate it at this stage of -- you probably can appreciate that at this stage, we are not specifically providing guidance on 2022, and we will come back at the end of february to address it. but for sure, i can share with you in terms of directionally the way we view our business model, we're definitely looking to see the opex as a percentage of revenue is going down. we already demonstrated this even in this quarter, ok? and definitely, this is -- directionally, this is what we are planning into. we are committed to steadily improve our profitability, and we will see the impact over time. in terms of how much of that will be in 2022 and how much will be more in the long term, it's more further -- too detailed. it's true that this year, 2021 was a year of investment. we include three new platform as part of our broader portfolio, and we are planning to invest in broaden those technology also in the future, but all along, we are planning to see a leverage model as part of our business model.
brian drab -- william blair & company -- analyst
okay. thank you. thanks. and then i don't know if you said this, but how much did acquisitions, within the last 12 months, contribute to revenue in the third quarter, whether it's rps and origin, etc?
lilach payorski -- chief financial officer
brian, as i commented before, in q3 or in the last three quarters, we didn't see yet the impact of p3 and saf. we do -- we had some impact, definitely a very nice impact of rps. we're very encouraged by the reception of this product in our market, in our customers. it's open for us in new markets, new applications. we are not providing specifics on each of the -- on the specific numbers on this opportunity. but definitely, it was a growth driver as well as a, like i said, a door opening. so the majority of this...
brian drab -- william blair & company -- analyst
so you can't give a collective -- sorry, lilach, you can't collectively, though, give the contribution from acquisitions, just so we can -- and maybe foreign exchange just so we can have an organic revenue growth number to put in the model? i'm asking just like the dollars from total -- from acquisitions dollars swing from fx, just so we can get the exact organic revenue growth, which i'm sure was a nice number. i'm just trying to get to the number.
lilach payorski -- chief financial officer
so we are not providing the specific dollar value associated with our acquisition of rps. but definitely, it was a good traction. and the most important thing is apart from just how much in the specific quarter. i think the multiproduct things take away to take from rps is how it's actually open for us market and the opportunity and the demand and the discussion that we are having around this product is so significant, and this is what the essence of what needs to be focused on. if you ask me specifically about fx, you definitely can see in the numbers, so the impact compared to 2020, it's about $2.8 million between q3 2021 to q3 2020.
brian drab -- william blair & company -- analyst
it's a positive, i mean, added to revenue?
lilach payorski -- chief financial officer
yes, it is.
operator
thank you. our next question has come from the line of greg palm with craig-hallum. please proceed with your question.
greg palm -- craig-hallum -- analyst
all right. i'm just going to ask one more follow-up and just try to take a stab. i know you're not guiding for fiscal 2022, but i guess if we think about guidance for this year, which you've said includes very little contribution from the three new products. it assumes revenue is down about 5% from the 2019 levels, right? so $605 million versus the $636 million. so i guess what i'm trying to figure out is based on your visibility into next year, would you expect your core business -- so mostly fdm, polyjet, so excluding the contribution from the three new products, would that have increased to pre-covid or 2019 revenue levels next year, if you're following the thought pattern there?
yoav zeif -- chief executive officer
okay, greg. simple answer, yes, we expect it to grow. and you can see it also, most of our growth came from the core businesses. we enter new application. we came with the full solution approach and it works. and we took them to manufacturing, and we'll keep doing it.
greg palm -- craig-hallum -- analyst
okay. so that would get you to at least 5% growth. and then if we layer on whatever we think is contribution from new products, i mean my assumption is you'd probably be disappointed if you weren't growing somewhere in the double digits next year, is that at least a fair characterization?
yoav zeif -- chief executive officer
you know that we are not providing guidelines now. we are optimistic. we are growing with all business lines, with the core, with the acquisition, and we didn't really put into the market, the new two most promising technologies that we have. so i'm optimistic. we keep working out, keep sweating and make sure that we will be the leader in polymer 3d printing with a full package and solutions.
greg palm -- craig-hallum -- analyst
all right. fair enough. i thought i'm gonna [indecipherable]. thanks and good luck.

yoav zeif -- chief executive officer
thank you, yonah. good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. today, additive manufacturing and stratasys are at an inflection point. industries around the world better understand the benefits and are increasingly adding 3d printing to their production plans. this is to a number of improvements that increased throughput capacity a growing range of high-performance materials and consistent part quality. additionally, there are compelling economic and sustainability advantages and software workflow solutions that can support the shift from prototyping to manufacturing that is happening across industries. parts can be lighter, equally strong, less expensive and personalized. and when considering the supply chain challenges in the world today, our customers are increasingly looking to flexible distributed additive manufacturing to overcome the logistics disruptions we are witnessing around the globe. in short, additive manufacturing is now viable for production of a wide range of end-use parts at volume scale for global distribution.
the investments we are making at stratasys, along with the strategic initiatives we have undertaken are steadily driving revenue growth. just over a year ago, i laid out our strategy to become the first choice for polymer 3d printing with a focus on the biggest addressable market manufacturing. this quarter, we truly accelerated execution of our strategy. we signed large-scale deals for manufacturing systems. we completed our acquisition of xaar 3d, and we expected to see incremental upside as we prepare to launch two new mass production offerings, the origin one and the h350. i will now walk you through the highlights of the quarter and some exciting recent achievements, lilach will then provide financial details for the quarter and give an update on our outlook. the third quarter delivered revenue growth in all business lines and regions. results were highlighted by top line improvement of 24% year-over-year. this was driven by growth of approximately 35% in systems and 27% in consumables.
our stratasys direct service bureau is not yet at 2019 level, but was up over 25% from q3 last year and is expected to continue growing. and importantly, system sales grew nearly 7% over q3 of 2019, thanks in part to our manufacturing focus system. system sales typically lead to increased consumables and services that generate profitable revenue as customers ramp up their utilization. one of the many highlights of the quarter was our participation at the annual rapid+tct trade show, where i was honored to deliver the opening address. we secured significantly more leads than the 2019 event, even though there were less people at the show this year, with especially strong interest for our origin system. in less than two weeks, we will be attending formnext our industry's largest trade show, where we look forward to sharing more of our exciting new innovations across our portfolio of systems, materials and our open software platform.
during the quarter, our focus on manufacturing gained additional traction as we signed two major end-use part manufacturing wins. the u.s. navy will purchase up to 25 f900 systems, materials and support services over five years for a total consideration of $20 million. the f900 is our largest fdm system, featuring the widest range of premium materials. we believe this is the biggest government additive manufacturing deal of its kind. this purchase advances the u.s. department of defense stated strategy for increasing its use additive manufacturing. it's allowed the navy to produce mission-critical parts closer to their point of need and demonstrate the ability to use distributed manufacturing with digital inventory and global deployment. the system will be used for producing end-use parts, tooling and training aids and will be part of the navy's aircraft maintenance program. the second major contract also for multiple f900 system is a repeat purchase from a leading global brand name, oem.
it is also a multimillion-dollar multiyear award, and we expect to share more details at a later date. these two notable manufacturing awards demonstrate our outstanding reputation for excellence in both technology and service. just as importantly, it shows the continuing deep penetration by stratasys with leading manufacturers that are turning to our technology for true production of end-use parts. we believe there are many similar opportunities for scale additive manufacturing being considered across industries worldwide. to further strengthen our manufacturing focus, we acquired the remaining 55% share of xaar 3d, giving us complete management of saf product development. saf technology is a major leap forward for powder bed manufacturing and is a significant improvement of other powder bed systems. we are excited to welcome the xaar 3d teams to stratasys. we have already deployed h350 system at better sites, including service bureaus. the feedback from our customers has been outstanding, with these early installation already printing end-use parts at volume scale. the h350 can also print many of its own part, enabling more efficient production capacity support.
health care has been an increasing growth driver and has grown faster than any other end market for us over the past two years. 3d printing brings key benefits such as personalization for medical needs and mass customization for dental applications. during the quarter, we furthered our extension into dental, particularly through strong sales of our new dentajet system. we continue to add new customers to our installed base as they appreciate our unique advanced features such as the ability to print a mix of parts on a single trade with unattended operation. on the medical side, our journey toward making our technology accessible at point of care started with the launch of our medijet system last quarter, and we continue to expand our reach through partnerships. for example, we recently started working with ricoh 3d to provide anatomical model at the point of care for hospitals across the u.s. with the help of integrated ibm watson health technology. this collaboration help clinicians see inside anatomy for greater visibility into patients' needs. it offers both clinical and economic benefits reducing barriers to entry that healthcare providers can encounter when setting up a 3d printing facility.
stratasys j750, digital anatomy and medijet printers create lifelike anatomical models. this reflects the pathologies of the patient and can be physically manipulated like human tissue. hospitals can use our hipaa compliance state-of-the-art technology on site or through an on-demand powered service. they can deliver more personalized care through better surgical preparation and patient education and can also improve medical training. and we have a similar agreement in europe with bone 3d to provide hospitals with on-site access to 3d printing through their hospifactory project. our stratasys direct business really added an atomical modeling to its services with our j750 digital anatomy printers. demand by medical device manufacturers and healthcare providers has been strong with well over 1,000 models already printed. the opportunities in healthcare will continue to expand, and we are often reminded how our advances touch and change people's lives. a few months ago, one year old twin girls were conjoined at the back of their head underwent a successful operation to separate them.
stratasys technology was used extensively preparing both the medical team and the families with presurgical modeling to help ensure the positive outcome and reduce the time of the operation. we continue to develop other exciting healthcare use cases that we believe will have a significant impact and look forward to sharing more in the future. i would now like to update you on our software initiatives. we have been actively developing our software solution with several exciting milestones in the past few months. we introduced a new data security solution called protectam to enhance cybersecurity of additive manufacturing as its role in government and defense applications grew larger and more essential. this solution is the first in additive manufacturing to work with red hat enterprise linux, the world's leading enterprise linux platform and the platform preferred by the u.s. government. this is a great example of being tuned into a specific vertical need, in this case, the u.s. government and tailoring our solutions accordingly. we also recently announced the grabcad additive manufacturing platform.
the world is increasingly turning to software to help scale additive manufacturing. in a recent report, research firms smarttech analysis forecasted that the total global additive manufacturing software market will reach $3.3 billion by 2026, up from less than $500 million in 2020. we believe stratasys can be a catalyst for this growth. our new platform provides us with the opportunities to strengthen our leadership position in the additive manufacturing industry through this growing addressable market for a number of reasons. first, we are able to leverage our deep additive manufacturing expertise and existing relationship with many of the world's leading manufacturers. second, we built our platform to be the best solution in the industry. it is enterprise-ready with the capability to integrate the entire digital trade from design through manufacturing. and third, it is also open. we are open to a broad set of additive manufacturing partner applications, giving our customers the freedom to use a wide range of software applications to our grabcad sdks and yes, we are open to integration with many non-stratasys 3d printers. leading manufacturers tell us they want stratasys to be their primary entity platform for industry 4.0, recognizing our leadership position and open approach.
as a result, we anticipate software will be an increasing part of our revenues and profit stream, driven by recurring software license subscriptions and sdk licenses from partners and customers. it's a key part of our overall rapid growth plan for our manufacturing business. finally, in the area of software design, we recently announced a collaboration with adobe to make full color 3d printing easy and accessible for their large user base of adobe substance 3d painter with no third-party software or tools needed, which had previously been required. our multiple competitive advantages when coupled with our new product offerings will further advance our position as the leading provider of polymer 3d printing solutions. we have the broadest, most advanced polymer technology portfolio, a comprehensive enterprise-ready software platform to scale additive manufacturing for production, the leading global channel with over 200 partners, the largest team of engineers and customer support in our industry and the proven resilient business model designed to scale. we expect strong purchasing cycle to gain momentum as we bring new system to market, generating increased consumables service contract and software to drive recurring revenues and long-term profitability.
i will now turn the call over to lilach, who will share the financial results of the quarter. lilach?
lilach payorski -- chief financial officer
thank you, yoav, and good morning, everyone. we are pleased with the third quarter results that demonstrate our continued strength in growing our markets while also generating operating profit and cash. the revenue growth driven by 30.3% growth in our product sales is indicative of the inflection point we are experiencing. for the quarter, total revenue was $159 million, up 24.3% versus the prior year quarter. we saw increased performance across all revenue streams, in particularly encouraging system growth of 6.7% over q3 of 2019. improvement in the pace of our consumable sales was another key contributor. there was also strong performance from our manufacturing business, in particular, improvement from automotive and industrials in europe. additionally, both the new rps systems and our stratasys' direct service bureau delivered more than originally expected. i would also note that healthcare continues to be our fastest growing business, driven primarily by increasing dental opportunities. on a constant currency basis, total revenue grew 23.8% versus the third quarter last year. product revenue grew 30.3% in the third quarter to $108.9 million compared to the same period last year or 29.7% on a constant currency basis. within product revenue, system revenue grew 34.7% to $52.3 million compared to the same period last year and 34% on a constant currency basis. there was a particularly notable growth from our manufacturing system like f900, f770, the f370 driven by the new carbon fiber material and the new dentajet.
the quarter also saw improved consumable utilization as revenue was 26.6% to $56.6 million compared to the same period last year and up 25.9% on a constant currency basis. relative to the 2019 quarter, consumables were off by only 1.3%, showing a nearly complete reversal of the impact of the pandemic as our customers increase utilization of our systems. service revenue was $50.1 million, up 13% compared to the same period last year and 12.8% on a constant currency basis. within service revenue, customer support revenue increased over q3 of 2020 by 7.2% to $29.5 million, flat on a constant currency basis. importantly, it was up 5.7% compared to q3 of 2019. our stratasys direct service bureau also continues to rebound, up 25.4% over q3 of 2020. these are good indications of market recovery trends. turning to margins. gaap gross margin was 42.9% for the quarter compared to 38.9% for the same period last year. non-gaap gross margin was 48.2% for the quarter compared to 46.8% for the same period last year. we are pleased to see the positive impact on margins of our product sales, both sequentially and relative to last year. we are carefully monitoring the ongoing macro issues of high global logistic costs and inflationary pricing of raw materials, which have pressured margins.
our top priority is to deliver our product in a timely manner. to help ensure this, we have increased production levels to offset sea and air delays in our planning process. we continue to evaluate a wide area of shipping options to ensure we can deliver goods with a minimal business impact. given this situation, we expect gross margins for the fourth quarter to be similar to the third quarter. gaap operating expenses were $90.1 million, a decrease of $364 million or 80.2% compared to the same period last year, where we recorded goodwill impairment. gaap operating expenses, excluding goodwill impairment, was 56.7% of revenue for the quarter compared to 53.1% for the same period last year. non-gaap operating expenses were $74.9 million, an increase of $14 million or 23.1% for the quarter as compared to the same period last year. non-gaap operating expenses improved to 47.1% of revenue for the quarter compared to 47.6% for the same period last year and 49% for the first half of this year. 2021 has been a year of investment in our growth, particularly with the cost associated to return to a five-day work week and the acquisition of origin and rps.
together with strong increase in revenue, opex went up in dollar terms, but is lower as a percentage of revenue. from an earnings perspective, gaap operating loss for the quarter was $21.9 million compared to a loss of $404.3 million for the same period last year. non-gaap operating income for the quarter was $1.8 million compared to a loss of $1 million for the same period last year. gaap net loss for the quarter was $18.1 million or $0.28 per diluted share compared to net loss of $405.1 million or $7.35 per diluted share for the same period last year. non-gaap net income for the quarter was $0.5 million or $0.01 per diluted share compared to a net loss of $3 million or $0.05 per diluted shares in the same period last year. we generated cash of $3 million from operations during the third quarter as compared to generating $2.6 million of cash in the same quarter last year. this represents five consecutive quarters of positive cash flow from operations, totaling $57.7 million an excellent achievement considering broader economic conditions. we ended the quarter with $519.9 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term deposits compared to $522.7 million at the end of the second quarter of 2021. we are constantly reviewing opportunities that will accelerate our growth strategy and strengthen our leadership position.
turning to our outlook for the fourth quarter. based on current market conditions and assuming that the impacts related to pandemic of global supply chain constraints do not impact the economic environment further, the company is reiterating and updating its outlook as follows. we expect q4 revenue to be approximately 16% higher than q4 of last year, driven by continued growth in systems relative to q4 of both 2020 and 2019. we expect our opex for 2021 to be approximately $36 million, higher than 2020 due primarily to now fully owning xaar 3d in line with our investment strategy, along with higher operating costs relative to our higher revenues. as we have said throughout the year, we are in investment mode. one of our main differentiator is that our business model infrastructure is built to leverage as we scale. so the cost we are allocating today will drive increased revenue and profits in the future. we continue to expect our capital expenditures for all of 2021 to range between $24 million to $30 million. stratasys is in a healthy position. we are executing on our strategy and our revenue are shifting from prototyping to manufacturing. this is expected to drive strong top line growth with more favorable mix of sales across systems, materials, software and services, enhancing profit in the coming years. our balance sheet, together with our resilient business model will support the investments needed along the way.
with that, let me turn the call back over to you yoav for closing remarks. yoav?
yoav zeif -- chief executive officer
thank you, lilach. last month, gartner predicted that by 2025, over 50% of all discrete manufacturers will be using 3d printers for the products they sell or service, up from 10% in 2019. that's why stratasys is laser-focused on being the leader in polymer additive manufacturing as the industry continues to shift to additive manufacturing for end-use parts production. to achieve that mission, we now have solutions for every step in the product life cycle chain, design, prototyping, tooling, molds, all the way to end-use production at scale. there is no single comprehensive solution for every manufacturing application. therefore, it is important to use the best technology for each specific manufacturing challenge, but manufacturers are also looking for efficiencies where systems can be interfaced and network with each other as well as with their existing infrastructure.
only stratasys provides the full range of best-in-class technologies for polymer 3d printing offering our customers the ability to choose the best fit for their applications. our exceptional portfolio of hardware and materials, software platforms and partnership ecosystem, together with industry-leading global expertise sets us apart and allows our customers to achieve a powerful and efficient production environment. as i said earlier, stratasys is truly at an inflection point, and we are quite excited for the coming years. the investment we are making, coupled with our fortress balance sheet, position us to build long-term value for all of our stakeholders.
with that, let's open it up for questions. operator?

thank you. [operator instructions] our first question is from greg palm with craig-hallum capital group. please go ahead.
greg palm -- craig-hallum capital group -- analyst
yeah. thanks. congrats on the continued progress here and eitan, congrats on your transition to cfo. i look forward to working with you more closely going forward.
eitan zamir -- chief financial officer
thank you, greg.
greg palm -- craig-hallum capital group -- analyst
i guess i wanted to just start off on new product contribution. and i guess the question more lays upon the feedback and traction out in the marketplace and what you're seeing and hearing from both your installed base and new customers. and again, this is specific to the new products.
yoav zeif -- chief executive officer
hi greg, good to talk with you. great question. we are fully geared to leverage the new product in the market. just think about thousands of customers that we have out there and hundreds of partners.
they just need to sell one or two or three more technologies to the same customer, and we have a fantastic new product in the market. and now, i can go briefly start with the saas, great pipeline, solid pipeline and really unmatched quality of parts. i'm amazed every time that i see the flexibility of this machine and the ability really to compete with injection molding. and i'll go to the origin.
we just finalized the beta and move to general availability. and we are not sharing great, but we had great remarks and grades from our customers, both industrial customers and dental customers. the main advantages of this machine, this is a unique patented layer separation, really a complete different way of running dlp systems and the result is an unmatched part quality, speed, and reliability. and we really look forward to provide to you and to the public more information throughout the year on the performance of those two machines.
we also introduced the rps, great results above our expectations. also, the dentajet on the polyjet side, when you combine it with dental origin, it's an amazing great portfolio, a new portfolio that we have that is very attractive to the dental industry. so when you combine all of it together, practically, we have new products in each one of our technologies. i'll start with the polyjet, the j35, the medijet, the dentajet, i'll move to fdm, we have the f770, which is the largest build chamber, the longest build chamber in the industry.
really great traction in the market. then i move to the saas and the origin and the rps, we are really geared to grow based on the new product.
greg palm -- craig-hallum capital group -- analyst
that's helpful. and i guess, yoav, when you joined, i think you talked a lot about stratasys being kind of a one-stop shop for customers looking to invest in additive. and now that you have the product portfolio sort of set, are you seeing any tangible evidence of this happening? i don't know whether that's market share gains, maybe that's just increasing sort of wallet share spend within existing customers or maybe just new growth with new customers. but what's your thought on how that strategy is playing out?
yoav zeif -- chief executive officer
short answer is yes but let me elaborate on it. we already have two automotive players, oems using all five technologies, which is amazing. and why so important because manufacturers, bottom line, when you look at manufacturer, they prefer to have one provider with one ecosystem with one production environment with someone they can count on. and this is exactly what we are bringing to the market.
we are not selling technology. we are selling the best solutions that fit your problem. we are coming to solve programs to our customers. this is a completely different position in the market compared to where we were two years ago, and it works.
and of course, this is just the beginning, but we are very encouraging from what we are seeing in the market and from the discussion i have with customers on a weekly basis.
greg palm -- craig-hallum capital group -- analyst
ok. perfect. i'll hop back in the queue. thanks, and good luck.
operator
thank you. our next question is from troy jensen with lake street capital. please go ahead.
troy jensen -- lake street capital markets -- analyst
hey gentlemen, congrats on the good quarter and good year.
yoav zeif -- chief executive officer
thank you.
troy jensen -- lake street capital markets -- analyst
i guess my first question, i want to talk -- you are very welcome. can you just talk about -- your q1 guide seems a much better than normal seasonality? and i guess you can feel balance sheet deferred rates were up slightly quarter over quarter. just wondering, was there any constraints in q4 that held back in sales? are they flowing into q1 or is the better than normal seasonality really just the h350 starting to launch?
yoav zeif -- chief executive officer
hi, troy. good morning. good question. there were no constraints in q4.
the increase is driven by our new products, as well as our other technologies or old technologies and we started the year with a strong backlog.
troy jensen -- lake street capital markets -- analyst
ok. perfect. and could you just confirm you did have h350 revenues in q4? and then are you expecting to ship the origin for revenues in q1 also?
yoav zeif -- chief executive officer
yes. in q4, we already had the saas product. and in q1, we started shipping origin and we'll have revenue from origin in q1.
troy jensen -- lake street capital markets -- analyst
awesome. guys, congrats. good luck this year and i'll follow up on call later.
yoav zeif -- chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
our next question is from jared maymon with berenberg. please go ahead.
jared maymon -- berenberg capital markets -- analyst
hey, good morning, guys. and congrats on the strong results. first question from me. i'm just wondering, with the origin one dental, you have some big customers trialing that yet? and how likely do you think the opportunity is there to take share with that product?
yoav zeif -- chief executive officer
so thank you for the question. of course, we run a beta program with large and some medium and also some small customers to make sure that we are covering the whole range and we got fantastic feedback from the beta. so we are very encouraging. it's really a unique value proposition in industrial dental in terms of the quality of the power, the accuracy and the speed and this is only the beginning.
so we can do many different applications with one platform. you can go to the origin in dental, in tooling, in molds, in liner, dentures, spleens, guards, temps, bridges. and when you combine it also with our polyjet, we are covering the whole range and this is a really great value proposition to medium and large dental customers that we are targeting.
yonah lloyd -- chief communications officer and vice president of investor relations
yeah. jared, it's yonah. i would just add on top of that quickly that as strong as the aligner market has shown to be the good adopter of this technology over-time, we see dentures as an even larger market opportunity. and so, we -- and the origin system.
we discussed when we first announced it a little over a year ago that that was going to be one of the target markets. so we really look forward to updating the market around that particular end use at the appropriate time.
jared maymon -- berenberg capital markets -- analyst
perfect. good to hear. and then, i'm just curious, you mentioned briefly, you have a team that's deploying some capital in various opportunities and one of those you called out was continuous fiber. is there any color you can provide on this?
yoav zeif -- chief executive officer
we received this question so many times, so it's good to decorate it. we have a very strong balance sheet. so we have to use it in the best way that will generate returns to our stakeholders and we believe that the best way to do it is to focus on our strategy. we have a laser sharp strategy on polymer manufacturing, we are doing really well on the growth side and creating the most sustainable, strongest company in the industry and this is very attractive to many start-ups.
and so, we are being approached by many start-ups and we decided to establish an investment arm, we call it stratasys ventures, but it's all about accelerating the implementation of our strategy. we know exactly where the gaps that we have, mainly in the workflow and exactly where are the needs and the gaps in the industry and we are bringing the go-to-market. so we are investing in very exciting technologies. like we said in the script, like continuous carbon fiber, we just recently invested in 90 labs that have a very unique way of having x,y, and z continuous carbon fiber, not only x,y, they just closed 17 million round and we were there.
and other companies that we cannot elaborate now, but it's a very strong pipeline for external innovation that will help together with our great people in r&d to make sure that we are keeping our technological leadership in this market because our machines are the most reliable, the most repeatable in the market with the highest throughput and this is what manufacturer looks for out there, and we can deliver it internally and externally and we have a very clear framework how to do it.
jared maymon -- berenberg capital markets -- analyst
got it. thanks, yoav.

our next question is from jim ricchiuti with needham and company. please go ahead.
jim ricchiuti -- needham and company -- analyst
hi, thank you. question i had is just with respect to the comment that i believe you made regarding the gross margin pressures being temporary. and i'd like to follow-up on that and maybe drill down a little bit more. are you anticipating just the mix of revenues, benefiting your gross margins, the scale up in volume or are you taking some other measures to offset some of the pressures that you're facing because it doesn't sound like some of these cost issues are necessarily going away.
yoav zeif -- chief executive officer
hi, jim. good morning. it is a good question.
jim ricchiuti -- needham and company -- analyst
good morning.
yoav zeif -- chief executive officer
so first, one part is the anticipated improvement in logistics and raw materials in the future. but we also proactively as we scale-up our business as the new products become more mature to optimize and to improve our margins in our processes.
jim ricchiuti -- needham and company -- analyst
ok. just with respect to your outlook for 2022 on the revenue side, maybe you could talk a little bit about which of the verticals do you see the biggest growth potential? i think you're clearly -- it sounds like you're excited about what you're seeing in the dental market. but i wonder if you could just give us a little bit more color in terms of how you're thinking about the year from the standpoint of vertical markets.
yoav zeif -- chief executive officer
thank you for the question. we, by definition, when we launched our new strategy going for manufacturing or what we call end-use part, we decided that we are going to focus on a much larger market to increase the total addressable market, both because of the new technologies, but not less important because of new verticals and new applications. so of course, we have our vertical like the government and the defense and aero and auto and we are doing really well there. but within that, we want to shift from prototyping to manufacturing.
we are the first company in this industry to say 25% of what we are selling is going to end use stock. it was 2020, 2021, we are already 29%. and we believe that it will keep growing -- this share will keep growing above 20% every year. so the strategy works.
so where we focus manufacturing and healthcare, manufacturing across many verticals from consumer, go to aero and auto. and when you go from manufacturing to healthcare, healthcare, it's mainly dental, but also not less important is the whole psp, what we call pre-surgical planning. we are sitting on the best technology in the industry. we are the only one who can deliver real imitation of anatomic models where you can really imitate this issue.
and we just launched this year what we call digital anatomy creator, where the surgeon or the radiologist can really imitate the tissue and customize it to the different patients. and we believe it will position us as the leader when insurance and reimbursement will occur in this area because it is saving life. so bottom line, manufacturing and healthcare.
jim ricchiuti -- needham and company -- analyst
thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question is from ashley ellis with cross research. please go ahead.
ashley ellis -- cross research -- analyst
hi, thank you for taking my question. eitan, i was wondering if you could dig a little bit deeper into the revenue guidance. you're obviously going against some pretty tough compares in system revenue, and i know you're launching the origin and saas should ramp up. but how should we think about system growth versus your recurring revenues in consumables and customer support? should we expect that there should be some sort of follow-on from the strong system sales in 2021? and then i have a follow-up.
thank you.
eitan zamir -- chief financial officer
thank you, ashley. it's a good question. we are very excited about 2022 and we expect all our strengths to grow, and hardware will be the driver for the increase, but consumables and services will follow.
ashley ellis -- cross research -- analyst
and are you factoring any software contribution into the revenue guidance?
yonah lloyd -- chief communications officer and vice president of investor relations
ashely, it is yonah. hi. software is not going to yet be meaningful. it's sort of just starting to launch through.
as we mentioned earlier, there will be some software licensing revenue was going to start to get as we do the open materials, which is beginning in the back half of the year on the f450, but we'll be sure to update you as software becomes a more meaningful part of the revenue.
eitan zamir -- chief financial officer
yeah. and if i may add, we are going to launch new software products in 2022.
ashley ellis -- cross research -- analyst
ok. and then, yoav, could you talk about the decision to open-up the fdm printers to third-party materials? why now? and then is there a potential you could open up your polyjet systems in the future?
yoav zeif -- chief executive officer
i would say it's an act of leadership. we are leading this industry from prototyping to manufacturing. we had a very thorough analysis and many discussions with manufacturers out there and we identified the barriers. and one of the barriers is the variety of materials they can use for real manufacturing applications.
so it's clear to us that it's better to be in manufacturing and sell thousands of tons instead of few kilos per machines as we have a much better unit economics and to support our customers. bottom line is delivering higher value to our customers. and the open material, it's all about innovation and partnering around innovation because it's not that we open it without any responsibility on the quality of the part. this is a hybrid model, a controlled open material model where we are working together with our customers in three tiers.
we have tier one, which is preferred. we already announced it. it's exclusive for strategy. the second one is certified.
we are certifying other suppliers, third-party suppliers, but it meets our standards. and then, we have exploratory where everyone can innovate and do better things, but it's fdm. we have focused on this new innovative model is focusing on manufacturing. so it's fdm, it's up and it's origin.
and we get great feedback from our customers, and it will allow us not to introduce one or two or three new materials a year and you will see it because it's in the road map, but to double or triple the amount of new materials that we are introducing. and we see it also in rps, for example, it's open. it's doing really well and give us a competitive edge and a lot of value to our customers and to us. so bottom line, when we are talking about opening the material, it's not about having now a model that is where we are losing responsibility or compromising on the quality, it's exactly the opposite.
it's about giving more value to our customers in a responsible way and making sure that we are creating the value indicated to everyone. as for polyjet, no current plans to open it up because it's prototyping and it's a completely different type of need, and we have most of the materials needed for prototyping. so focusing on manufacturing, doing it with our customers, they love it and also they appreciate the leadership here.
ashley ellis -- cross research -- analyst
all right. thank you very much.
operator
thank you. our next question is from paul chung with j.p. morgan. please go ahead.
paul chung -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
hi, thanks for taking my questions. so can you talk about the interesting things you're doing in aerospace. can you expand on the boom partnership, u.s. navy contracts and how you see those relationships evolving? and then maybe kind of potentially leading to interest from other customers and how material can this part of the business contribute to growth? and then i have a follow-up.
yoav zeif -- chief executive officer
thank you, paul, for this question. i think it's a reflection of how we are partnering with our customers to change the world, not less than that. so i'll take the navy, for example. this is the ultimate example of distributed manufacturing.
so people are talking about it for years, a decade about distributed manufacturing. we are working with the government. we are working with the navy to really implement distributed manufacturing. so there were supply chain issues, long supply chains.
we are going to have f900 machines within the u.s., outside of the u.s. globally to create spare parts. it's amazing, and i want to thank the navy and the u.s. government for taking it together with us, taking all the industry a step forward.
it's a real manufacturing opportunity across all government bodies. and if i take it to boom, it's a great example of innovation in action. so we started with them only with prototyping just to cut their development cycle and to save significant time and i believe we save between two to three years and even more because this ability of the engineer to think about it about something and then printing the same day to check it is remarkable, but they took it to different pictures and tooling and then to end use pulp. i visited there.
and it's like you see pulp within the most exciting new generation of passenger aircraft and it is 3d printers. it's amazing. i learned a lot from both those customers. and this is part of the dna of stratasys.
we work with our customers to make sure that they will be more successful and that 3d printing will be significant in manufacturing and we have many more of it.
paul chung -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
great. thanks for that cool stuff. so just on cash flow, you managed inventory levels really well and seeing some funding benefits from kind of longer accounts payable days. but if you could expand on how you manage the inventory level so effectively this year? and then how do we think about kind of working cap dynamics in '22? and then can you grow cash from operating in '22, keep the streak of kind of positive quarterly operating cash kind of ongoing? thank you.
eitan zamir -- chief financial officer
thank you. it's a good question. we're not guiding on cash flow. but on one hand, we continue to increase and to purchase inventory to be prepared for the growth during 2022.
and we do have over $500 million of cash to invest. so we're very positive about 2022 as far as it's concerned with cash flow, but we do not guide on cash flow.
paul chung -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
great. thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question is from wamsi mohan with bank of america. please go ahead.
wamsi mohan -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
yes, thank you. i just wanted to follow up on the cash flow question. if we look at your midpoint of your operating income guidance, it's about $18 million improvement on a year-on-year basis, which is great to see in 2022. maybe if you don't want to give an explicit cash flow guide, can you talk about some of the underlying puts and takes that might influence how that increase or decrease in cash flow might trend relative to that increase in operating income? and i have a follow-up.
eitan zamir -- chief financial officer
thank you wamsi. so first of all, without guiding on cash flow, when you think about cash flow compared to operating income, you take into account all the working capital elements. as i mentioned earlier, we continue to invest and try to increase our inventory and we will continue doing this during 2022 and this should also be taken into account when you model cash flow for 2022.
wamsi mohan -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
ok. thank you for that. and then, if i think about the excitement that you're really showing around new products and some of the potential contribution from that, especially in the back half of the year. is there any way for you to talk about it in your revenue guide of, call it, mid-teens for the year or somewhere close to that growth? how many points of growth do you think these new products can contribute in year one, year two, like i'm sure you have a plan that sort of thinks about contribution sort of on a more ongoing basis.
can you maybe help us think through how much -- how we should be thinking about revenue growth on a more sustainable basis? and particularly, contribution from these new products? i mean you essentially felt like you're going from two platforms to this multi-platform approach and that's really resonating with your clients. so if '22 is maybe some sort of transition year or launch year in some ways, '23, we should start to see some more acceleration from that. so just trying to parse through how many points of growth maybe you can see stacking up over the next few years. any color there would be helpful.
thank you.
eitan zamir -- chief financial officer
right. thank you for the question. we do not provide guidance on specific products. however, i can say that in 2022, we expect all of our technologies to increase compared to 2021.
naturally, the launches of saas and origin will have a significant impact in 2022 compared to 2021, but we do expect that all our products and all our technologies will generate growth in the future and after 2022.
wamsi mohan -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
ok. thank you so much. good luck.
operator
thank you. our next question is from ananda baruah with loop capital. please go ahead.
ananda baruah -- loop capital markets -- analyst
hey, thanks guys. congrats on the ongoing momentum and really appreciate you guys taking the question. i guess just two quick ones, if i could. going back to paul's question, you guys -- you provided some really good context on the navy relationship as to what's driving -- sort of driving business with them.
could you provide us some context in a general set of what customers are doing that's leading to the increasing momentum, the ongoing momentum and just in a tangible way for us. and then, i have a really quick follow-up. thanks.
yoav zeif -- chief executive officer
hi ananda, thank you very much for the question. it's a great time to be part of the additive manufacturing industry. i didn't plan it, but i'm lucky. because customers understand the global trends and they understand also that additive will be part of the manufacturing of the future.
so everybody is planning now their future in manufacturing, the plans of the future, the micro plans of the future, customization, industry 4.0, etc., etc., etc. and then, the pandemic with all the supply chain issues that we are facing as well where the ultimate -- created the ultimate stone for us to start engaging with our customers. so you take together like the most fundamental trends that we are experiencing now, the supply chain needs, the customization, especially in healthcare, the need for sustainability and lighter part in order to use less fuel and the innovation in so many areas like in electric vehicles, and the need for new geometry for this, additive is the best solution. and the navy deal proved it.
manufacturing can be this, manufacturer can distribute the digital inventory worldwide. you don't need physical inventory, you can have digital inventory. and you can provide parts wherever they are needed. so the people understand it.
and the moment they understand it, they are looking for a partner they can interact with in order to develop those plans of the future. and i think we are positioned quite well because we are a one-stop shop with one operating system with one material platform with one software platform and with a lot of reputation, reliability and repeatability and the ability to deliver. so it's a very exciting time.
ananda baruah -- loop capital markets -- analyst
that's super, super helpful. i appreciate the context. and my quick follow-up is just on the op margin guide for '22. i believe you said about 2%.
can you just describe what are the puts and the takes? and i guess really what i'm wondering is sort of like what are the things that allow you to begin to expand those operating margins, i'm assuming as we go kind of through 2023.
eitan zamir -- chief financial officer
thank you. so when we think about 2022 and the over 2% margin, we have the growth, the significant growth in our revenue. when we think about opex, it will decrease as a percentage of revenue during 2022. however, we continue to invest in our growth drivers, origin, saas and healthcare and operating margins can expand longer term due to a number of factors, including the increase in consumables, adding software that is coming with higher margins and the entire business, the entire revenue increase that we expect.
ananda baruah -- loop capital markets -- analyst
the scale.
yoav zeif -- chief executive officer
if i may add, i think that's exactly the right direction. but if i may add, it's a combination of external and internal forces. externally, we do believe that the current logistic cost is not sustainable. we believe that the second half of the year, maybe next year, at the end of this year, we see better results because of the capacity in sea because of the port issue, it will solve itself.
this ongoing crisis that fuel itself will somewhat solve itself as well. so this is on the external side. but we don't base our projection only on external forces. we base on projections on activities and what we are doing, on being proactive.
and we believe that selling more, however, it means that we sell more consumables, selling more consumable, better gross margins. we are investing in higher efficiencies across the company. we are lowering the production cost. what can we do internally? we take control over our destiny.
and we design for cost and we add software and we have npis. so we are working on it. we're not coming here and saying gross margin will be better. we are working on it, and it will be better.
ananda baruah -- loop capital markets -- analyst
that's really helpful. thank you, guys, so much.
operator
thank you. our next question is from noelle dilts with stifel. please go ahead.
noelle dilts -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
hi, guys, and thanks for taking my question. first, i was hoping you could comment on if you're seeing any notable differences in demand from a geographic perspective, how you -- what you're seeing in europe versus the u.s. and asia? thanks.
yoav zeif -- chief executive officer
so great question. we are not in general. we are not giving the details, but i can give you the high-level trends, share with you the high-level trends. so it's kind of a combination of recovery and innovation, i would say.
so we see that emea, which was lagging compared to the u.s. in adoption of new technologies in many verticals like aero and auto are catching up. so we see very nice results from our emea region. and then, we see also great results from the u.s.
and then, asia. so this is more or less the ranking, but i believe it's only a matter of the pandemic and the recovery from the pandemic. so asia, they adopted a more strict, i would say, omicron policy. so we see it, which is not in europe and not the case in the u.s., but bottom line across the geographies, we see really good demand and the growth across region is positive and looks really good.
noelle dilts -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
ok. great. thank you. and second, i was hoping you could just expand a little bit on what your acquisition pipeline looks like as you look out over the next year or two.
any maybe details on -- are you seeing more smaller deals or larger deals? and what's your appetite for m&a if you look at 2022?
yoav zeif -- chief executive officer
we have a very structured framework for business development activities. starting from acquisition -- but the bottom line, if i start with the bottom line this time is about accelerating our strategy, the implementation of our strategy. we don't do anything which is not within the strategy. but within the strategy, there are so many opportunities.
we started with acquisitions of base technologies, and now we are moving, i would say, to the next phase, which is about really strengthening those technologies, but investing a lot in workflow and materials. so we are moving down the road. we have the best technology. now, we need to make sure that they have the full solution, which is the best and this is material.
this is a workflow software and also a lot of collaboration. so it's a combination of investment and collaboration. bottom line, we increased dramatically the size of our investment team and we believe that the combination of external and internal innovation will put us completely in a different way and will secure our technological leadership.
noelle dilts -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst

thank you. our next question is from brian drab with william blair. please go ahead.
blake keating -- william blair -- analyst
hi, good morning. this is blake keating on for brian.
yoav zeif -- chief executive officer
good morning, blake.
blake keating -- william blair -- analyst
brian ended up being double booked but wanted to get clarity on a couple of items. what is different about 2022 in terms of your revenue visibility compared with 2019, because in 2019, you initially guided between 670 and $700 million in revenue and reported $636 million in the end. so what's driving the confidence this year?
eitan zamir -- chief financial officer
hi, blake. good question. we feel very confident about our ability to meet the 2022 numbers. we started with a strong backlog of the year and with the new products and also the existing technologies, we feel confident in being able to meet the guidance.
blake keating -- william blair -- analyst
got it. thank you. and then, how should we reconcile below the ebit guidance. it implies about $14 million to $15 million in ebit with the adjusted eps guidance.
is it tax rate or how should we think about it?
eitan zamir -- chief financial officer
sorry, blake, could you say that again? we didn't hear the last part of your question.
blake keating -- william blair -- analyst
yeah. how should we reconcile the difference -- the ebit guidance of about $14 million to $15 million to the net income guidance, the adjusted eps guidance. is it tax rate or what's the -- how should we get down to it?
eitan zamir -- chief financial officer
so blake, it's a good question. there is no between the ebit and the net income. there are no significant items or one-timers as far as it's concerned. so when you look on our tax and financial income in the past, you can use similar levels to model 2022.
blake keating -- william blair -- analyst
got it. thank you. i will pass it along.
operator
thank you. our next question is from greg palm with craig-hallum capital group. please go ahead.
greg palm -- craig-hallum capital group -- analyst
yeah. thanks. just for one quick follow-up or hopefully quick. but i want to take a stab at long-term operating margin guidance.
so commentary suggests double-digit operating margins, which would be a pretty big step up relative to sort of anything you've done in the last five, six, seven years. so i guess, are you targeting a certain year or a certain level of revenue to maybe achieve this? help us understand your thought process behind it, if you can.
eitan zamir -- chief financial officer
thank you, greg, for the question. when we think about the longer term, the next few years, as mentioned earlier, first we expect the gross margins to go back to the level of 50% and then which will contribute the bottom line. and then, when we think about opex, so we believe that in the next few years, as revenue grow, we will be able to leverage our scale and we already have the right infrastructure to be able to increase revenue significantly and then increase opex much less than the increase in revenue.
yoav zeif -- chief executive officer
yeah. and if i may add, this is the entire strategy here. we have the infrastructure to do many, many more things and to sell many, many more products with the same infrastructure. we need the patience, but not too long.
i'm not talking here about a long horizon of dozens of years. we have the infrastructure. we need to leverage the infrastructure. that's exactly what we are doing.
so this is on the financial side. but the most important thing in profitability is to deliver value to our customers. and we believe that no one can deliver this level of value and we base it on very, very simple things. one, we have laser-sharp strategy on polymer manufacturing, and we already showed it as we move from 25% to 29% of our total sales only in one year.
we have well-defined growth engines that are working the technologies, the software platform, the material platform and use cases that we are developing, we have execution that it's a new level of execution within stratasys. this year 30 products, 2021, 30 products. this is a completely new level of execution and most importantly, customers, our customers, are loyal and trust us and work together with us in collaboration to make this happen and to create this value. then when you translate it, we will have double-digit operating income like eitan described.
very optimistic on this.
greg palm -- craig-hallum capital group -- analyst
i mean, you're going to see some operating leverage this year, but i don't want to put words in your mouth, but it sounds like it only should sort of get better in the out years. i mean, is that kind of the right way to think about it? i mean that's what the math implies to get to double digit.
eitan zamir -- chief financial officer
it's a journey of two to three years that you will see notably strong year results on the operating income, but we are here to build the strongest 3d printing company in the industry with sustainable profitable growth. and that's exactly what we are doing. we are balancing between profitability and sustainable growth and the result is double-digit operating income.
greg palm -- craig-hallum capital group -- analyst
ok. fair enough. appreciate the color. thanks.

yoav zeif. yoav? 
yoav zeif -- chief executive officer
thank you, yonah. good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. stratasys had a strong quarter with over 17% revenue growth compared to the same period last year, driven by the highest system sales since q4 of 2018. each of our technologies and all of our regions contributed to this growth.
i will share a general overview of our achievements and milestones in 2021. and after our financials and guidance, i will conclude with some thoughts for 2022. stratasys today is in a very different place than it was at the beginning of 2021. until last year, our business had been centered around two core technologies, fdm and polyjet.
and while we maintained leadership in these areas, this limited portfolio meant we were missing opportunities to participate more fully in the fast-growing applications at the heart of the shift from prototyping to manufacturing. and we have not developed and launched meaningful product upgrades in a number of years. it was critical to evaluate the entire business and target strategic investment to evolve our product portfolio. we established our strategy to be the first choice in polymer 3d printing, encompassing the entire product life cycle with multiple technologies and complete solutions for superior application feeds across design, manufacturing and healthcare.
we believe this approach provides the largest total addressable market in the industry. this strategic focus drove us to specifically increase our exposure to manufacturing applications. a year ago, we shared that in 2020, over 25% of our revenues came from manufacturing. we are pleased to say that for 2021, it was 29%, and we expect 2022 manufacturing sales to grow at least 20%.
clearly, our focus on manufacturing is working. we accomplished this with new systems tailored to manufacturing at scale, a software platform to integrate the entire manufacturing digital thread and a material strategy that rapidly opens-up new applications for our customers. today, we are collaborating with the world's leading materials companies, software partners and our customers, creating many new avenues for growth through a combination of direct sales and licensing. we are excited about this broader portfolio and believe it will further complement our systems offerings to help drive our overall growth strategy, and there is more to come in the years ahead.
we also dramatically strengthened our balance sheet in 2021. at year-end, we had over $500 million in cash and equivalents, up from $272 million as of the end of 2020, giving us flexibility to seek opportunities that will support our future growth. we believe that by continuing to prudently invest capital back into the business, we will achieve meaningfully accelerated revenue, earnings and cash flow in the years ahead. now, let me provide more specific color on our 2021 accomplishments that were supported by our strong balance sheet.
the first area of focus was strategic acquisitions, including origin, which was completed at the very end of 2020, rps and xaar 3d, which will support our customers' manufacturing needs and begin notably contributing to our growth in 2022. next, we extended our software capabilities and plan to add licensing to give customers access to our new open materials options. additionally, we initiated a long-term technology invested arm that has already deployed capital in companies with cutting-edge technologies such as material jetting, cost processing and continuous carbon fiber. building on our five industry-leading 3d printing technology, we introduced several new product offerings over the course of the year, including three systems targeting our manufacturing customers.
first, the origin one, designed for end-use manufacturing applications that uses p3 technology to produce parts at volume from a wide range of third-party photopolymer material. after a very successful beta program, we just recently started shipping this system. next, the h350. the first of our new eight series, powder bed systems, powered by saas technology and built to deliver production level throughput of end-use part, which we started shipping in december.
and the f770 and fdm printer ideal for large parts, featuring the longest fully heated build chamber on the market. we also introduced 3d printers tailored to some of our most important industry application segments. this includes the origin one dental printer and the j5 dentajet. together, they provide dental labs with comprehensive additive manufacturing solutions for the large and growing dental markets.
we also launched the j5 medijet printer, which gives healthcare customers the ability to print highly detailed anatomic models and drilling and cutting guides quickly and cost effectively with approved third-party 510(k) cleared segmentation software. we introduced the j35 pro and j55 prime polyjet printers, along with new software solutions for research and packaging prototyping. finally, after acquiring rps in q1 last year, we launched the new line of industrial stereo-lithography system, expanding our offering to use cases such as investment casting patterns, orthodonti, clear aligners molds and large design parts. in addition to the new systems, we made significant progress on increasing our software focus and offerings.
we introduced an enterprise-ready open software platform, tailor-made for manufacturing. this is important because it gives our customers the ability to integrate fleets of stratasys printers with their existing industry 4.0 infrastructure and workflow, allowing them to really scale the use of editing manufacturing. it also strengthens our relationship with our customers because we can use software to continue to add value to their investments in 3d printers. that in turn means recurring software revenues can become a growing contributor to our business.
for example, we announced that we have extended grabcad print software to our h350 printer. for annual licensing fee, this enable functionality focused on optimizing production throughput that is specifically designed for end-use part manufacturing at scale. we also continue to invest in additive specific applications to streamline the workflow of orders to the factory shot. on the material side, we introduced cf10, our new carbon fiber material that we believe will increase the adoption of our technology into production lines, especially for manufacturing aides.
cf10 has also proven to be a catalyst for increased sales of our f370 system and we introduced open materials option for fdm that we plan to launch in the back half of this year, starting with our fortus 450. we expect this to spare materials innovation, accelerate the adoption and expansion of our consumables and contribute to increasing our software revenues. we also entered into a number of important partnerships, including ecco, adobe, red hat and others as we seek to provide our customers with complete end-to-end solutions for specific industry applications. these accomplishments in 2021 were thanks to the hard work of our exceptional team at stratasys.
together, while managing through the many pandemic and related challenges, we successfully launched over 30 new products into the market. i am very proud of our team and excited to experience even more this year. as we execute on our strategy and build momentum, customers continue to express their confidence in stratasys. for example, ecco, a leading global shoe manufacturer is using our origin one to print molds and shoe laps for development purposes.
not only do these parts fully match the quality requirements of the cnc machined aluminum counterparts, but they are faster to produce and far more economical. another example is radford motors, one of the two automotive oems that are already utilizing all five of our technologies. for each of their coach-built supercars, radford prints hundreds of stratasys parts from design through prototyping, tooling and end-use parts that can be found on the final vehicle. we believe this level of 3d printing technology adoption will become standard in the automotive industry.
i would like to take a moment to discuss our efforts and accomplishments with regard to esg. this is an area of primary focus for our company and our industry. 3d printing has the ability today to address many of the environmental issues facing global manufacturing and we are in the forefront of those efforts. at stratasys, we are deeply embedding our esg strategy in our products and processes.
as part of our dna and company purpose to empower people to create without limits for an economical, personalized and sustainable world, we are addressing many of our business processes and along with our customers, we seek to take climate action while improving social impact. we call it mindful manufacturing, a call to action to redesign processes, parts and supply chain with great thoughts and clear intentions to secure manufacturing, utilizing 3d printing in a way that maximizes sustainability while also supporting business growth. by digitizing, localizing and optimizing for additive manufacturing, we believe net zero targets are not only achievable, but easier to reach than with traditional manufacturing technologies and processes. our efforts encompass product innovation and improved circular economy for additive manufacturing an extensive outreach in our communities through education and healthcare csr activities around the world.
we plan to publish a first-of-its-kind market-leading pure polymer additive manufacturing, gri sustainability report next quarter. as market leader in 3d printing, we see our role as leading the shift to responsible consumption and production, helping our customers achieve their carbon neutrality, net-zero goals and working to address our own footprint, supported by the data and research needed to drive this transformation for the entire additive manufacturing industry. before i turn the call over to our new cfo, eitan zamir to share the financial results, i wish to thank lilach payorski for her leadership and many significant contributions to strategies over the past nine years. lilach built a strong, talented finance organization and her dedication to excellence and professional expertise has helped to preserve and strengthen our financial health as we navigated dynamic markets and pursued strategic growth initiatives.
we wish her the best in our future endeavors. eitan?
eitan zamir -- chief financial officer
thank you, yoav, and good morning, everyone. before i begin my remarks, i would also like to personally thank lilach for her guidance in the over two years i've been with stratasys. her contribution and commitment to the company have been a fundamental part of our success, and i am honored to be assuming the role as cfo at this time in her journey. now, turning to the numbers.
the fourth quarter of 2021 was another period of successful execution for our company. we delivered the highest quarterly total revenue and highest quarterly system revenue in three years. cash generated from operating activities was positive for the sixth consecutive quarter. for the fourth quarter, total revenue was $167 million, a 17.3% increase from the prior year quarter, driven primarily by strength in system sales, which was the highest in 12 quarters and is typically a driver for future consumable sales.
total revenue was up 5% sequentially from the third quarter and was 4.3% higher as compared to pre-pandemic q4 '19 level. on a constant currency basis, total revenue increased 18.3% year over year. product revenue in the fourth quarter was $118 million, an increase of 19% compared to the same period last year or 20.1% on a constant currency basis. within product revenue, system revenue increased 25.9% to $61.8 million compared to the same period last year, an increase by 26.9% on a constant currency basis.
consumables revenue increased by 12.3% to $56.3 million compared to the same period last year and increased by 13.6% on a constant currency basis. service revenue was $49 million, an increase of 13.3% compared to the same period last year. on a constant currency basis, service revenue increased by 14%. within service revenue, customer support revenue increased by 7% compared to the same period last year and increased by 8.1% on a constant currency basis.
we were pleased to see a strong and growing contribution from healthcare and dental and also to see consumable and customer service revenue above 2019 levels. now, turning to gross margins. gaap gross margin was 43.7% for the quarter compared to 46.4% for the same period last year. non-gaap gross margin was 48.7% for the quarter compared to 49.5% for the same period last year.
the decrease in gross margin versus the prior year period was driven mainly by raw material inflation and ongoing logistical challenges, partially offset by the impact of higher sales and sales mix. gaap operating expenses were $89.2 million, an increase of $20.7 million or 30.1% from the same period last year. non-gaap operating expenses were $79.6 million, an increase of $17.4 million or 28% compared to the same period last year. non-gaap operating expenses were 47.7% of revenue for the quarter compared to 43.7% for the same period last year.
the increase in operating expenses was driven by a number of factors, including the return to a five-day work with higher expenses as the market recovered, higher operating costs and commissions due to more revenue and additional operating costs associated with the inclusion of our new acquisitions, including full ownership of xaar 3d in the fourth quarter. these costs were funded by the resizing plan implemented in may 2020, which allowed us to allocate resources to areas where we believe we will generate stronger growth. regarding earnings, gaap operating loss for the quarter was $16.2 million compared to a loss of $2.5 million for the same period last year. non-gaap operating income for the quarter was $1.7 million compared to $8.3 million for the same period last year.
the difference reflects the increase in operating expenses in the fourth quarter of 2021 described before, including due to our move from a four-day work week to a five-day work week. gaap net loss for the quarter was $4.8 million or $0.07 per diluted share compared to net income of $11 million or $0.20 per diluted share for the same period last year, which reflected a one-time $14 million tax benefit in the fourth quarter of 2020. non-gaap net income for the quarter was $0.5 million or $0.01 per diluted share compared to $7 million or $0.13 per diluted share in the same period last year, reflecting the increased operating expenses in q4 2021 compared to q4 2020. adjusted ebitda of $7.9 million compared to $14.6 million in the same period last year, reflecting the increased operating expenses in q4 2021.
we generated $4.4 million of cash from operations during the fourth quarter compared to generating $23.7 million of cash in the same quarter last year. this was our sixth consecutive quarter of positive cash flow from operating activities. it was driven by strong collections and achieved despite of an increase in inventory purchases. we ended the quarter with $502.2 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term deposits compared to $299.1 million at the end of the fourth quarter of 2020.
our cash position was bolstered by a $230 million capital raise in q1 of 2021. we have executed with excellence to overcome the negative impact of the pandemic and remain well-funded and well-positioned to capitalize on value-enhancing market opportunities as they arise. now, let me turn to our initial outlook for 2022. we are guiding that our 2022 revenue will be in the range of $680 million to $695 million.
we expect to realize sequential revenue growth each quarter as we progress throughout the year with the second half of the year notably stronger than the first half. the sequential growth is somewhat different than our historical seasonality pattern, primarily due to the timing of new system releases and the corresponding ramp in sales, as well as gradual shift in sales mix. q1 revenue growth is expected to reach high teens as a percentage over the first quarter of 2021. from a gross margin perspective, given our experience with the global logistics and material cost issues, full year 2022 is expected to be flat to slightly higher than 2021 with the second half stronger than the first half, based primarily on higher revenue.
we expect the first quarter to be relatively flat to the first quarter of last year. i would like to emphasize that we view the current gross margin situation as temporary as the headwinds caused by these external issues pass and we continue to execute on our long-term plan, we expect our margins to head back over 50%. we will continue to invest in our growth engines to generate significant leverage benefit as we responsibly build a strong company for the long term. in 2022, we expect our operating expenses to be approximately $20 million to $25 million higher than 2021, primarily due to the impact of owning xaar 3d for the full year, higher costs that result from higher sales and investment in new growth drivers such as origin and healthcare.
i would like to remind you that starting from the second quarter, operating expense is typically higher than the first quarter due to the normal timing of compensation expenses. and despite the higher absolute dollar value, year over year, we expect to see a continuation of reduction in operating expenses as a percentage of revenue throughout the year, improving profitability objective for us and for 2022, we expect to see continued improvement in our earnings. we expect non-gaap operating margins to be slightly above 2% for the full year, with small operating losses during the first half and turning to profit in the back half of the year due to the anticipated revenue increase. longer term, we expect operating margin to achieve double digits as our growth plan unfolds in the coming years.
we anticipate a gaap net loss of $74 million to $67 million or $1.11 to $1 per diluted share and non-gaap net income of $10 million to $13 million or $0.14 to $0.19 per diluted share. adjusted ebitda is expected to be in the range of $38 million to $41 million. we expect our capital expenditures for 2022 to range between $20 million and $25 million. with that, let me turn the call back over to yoav for closing remarks.
yoav?
yoav zeif -- chief executive officer
thank you, eitan. 2021 was a transformative year for stratasys in many ways. we vastly improved our offerings, strengthened the balance sheet and invested in technology, positioning us for continued growth in the years to come. we experienced our largest contract in company history with a $20 million order from u.s.
navy for 25 f900 manufacturing systems. importantly, this is more than just a one-time sale. we are fully qualified and selected as an additive production partner, opening the manufacturing door for us and we expect to scale adoption quickly. we had another large long-term f900 sales as well to a leading global oem.
these and other manufacturing-related deals demonstrate market confidence in the use of stratasys technologies as the market shifts from rapid prototyping to true manufacturing, a clear signal the 3d printing industry has reached this important inflection point. in 2022, we will advance our efforts to strengthen our leadership in polymer 3d printing. we have established the foundations for long-term growth based on leading polymer 3d printing systems, complemented by continuous innovation across our portfolio. two key components of this effort include the a350 and origin one.
both products have been well received in their beta programs and we believe this system will help to more than double our addressable market over-time. equipped with best-in-class offerings, unmatched go-to-market network and support infrastructure, a strong balance sheet and the best 3d printing talent relentlessly focused on execution, we are positioned for sustained growth and strong stakeholder returns as we further build on our momentum in 2022. looking ahead, we are energized and excited for the future of stratasys. with that, let's open it up for questions.

[operator instructions] our first question is from greg palm with craig-hallum. please proceed with your question.
greg palm -- craig-hallum capital group -- analyst
yeah. thanks. congrats on the progress here, and thanks for taking the questions. yoav, you've been a big believer in having this kind of, call it, full product portfolio across different kinds of polymer technologies.
and curious, now that everything is launched in the market, are you seeing that synergies in line with what you expected or are they better? i mean, you mentioned the second auto oem that's using all five, but curious if you think you're capturing more wallet spend with some of the existing customers as well?
yoav zeif -- chief executive officer
thank you, greg, for the question. as we wrote in our script, the strategy is working good. so the ability of stratasys to leverage our infrastructure, our go-to-market, our expertise in polymer, our cutting-edge technologies, and build out these onto ecosystem to platforms, which are the materials and the software with cutting-edge technology capturing the synergies across technologies, but also within customers with the same go-to-market, it works and we are very encouraged by that, because we really put in place our differentiation and our uniqueness to work, and it worked.
yonah lloyd -- chief communications officer and vice president of investor relations
yeah, greg, it's yonah. what i would add on that is, it's very encouraging to see how customers are actually making that permanent switch from their traditional manufacturing to additive. we highlighted a few of the customers in the slides, but there's dozens and dozens and i think that really is the strongest demonstration from the market that they believe in the technology, they believe that we can help them improve their production lines. and we look forward over the course of the next quarters and years to building and building on that, because that's how you start to disrupt the traditional manufacturing and begin to take away the $13 trillion addressable market piece by piece.
yoav zeif -- chief executive officer
yeah, completely agree. and it goes beyond just the five technologies, it's the ability to create a solution with the material, which is open, which is validated, with the software, with the service, and put everything together around this package, which is practically we are connecting everything with the software, rarely, i think it would be very difficult to competitors to meet this offering to our customers.
greg palm -- craig-hallum capital group -- analyst
yeah, that makes a lot of sense, and thanks for that commentary. my follow-up was going to be along those lines, in terms of who or what you think you're displacing. it sounds like maybe it's more of a byproduct of displacing traditional technologies. but if all of a sudden, you've got customers that are using all five of your technologies, presumably you're displacing maybe some competitors in the additive field as well.
what are your thoughts on that versus traditional?
yoav zeif -- chief executive officer
we are focusing on delivering value to our customers. and we believe that using one platform of material and software and service with five technology, with our expertise, with our application engineer is the best value that we can deliver, and very competitive in the marketplace. and that's what will take us forward. in some cases, we see customer replacing and is taking other additive manufacturing providers.
but we are focusing on adding value and not on taking out other systems or other providers.
greg palm -- craig-hallum capital group -- analyst
ok. good. well, best of luck going forward and look forward to seeing you this week.
yoav zeif -- chief executive officer

our next question is from troy jensen with lake street capital. please proceed with your question.
troy jensen -- lake street capital markets -- analyst
hey gentlemen, congrats on a 22% growth here. it's pretty impressive.
yoav zeif -- chief executive officer
thank you.
eitan zamir -- chief financial officer
thank you.
troy jensen -- lake street capital markets -- analyst
hey, so first, clarification for eitan. could you give us the dollar amounts again for systems and consumables?
eitan zamir -- chief financial officer
you mean the total revenue after q1?
troy jensen -- lake street capital markets -- analyst
yeah. total system revenues in q1 and consumable revenues in q1.
eitan zamir -- chief financial officer
so total system is $64.5 million and total consumables is $58.6 million.
troy jensen -- lake street capital markets -- analyst
awesome. thank you. and for yoav, polypropylene, i guess to my knowledge that material isn't available at all in the industry and i think you said it wasn't widely available. so i guess i'm curious, is it real polypropylene or polypropylene like? am i correct in thinking that it's not really available?
yoav zeif -- chief executive officer
so it is available, but we believe that our offering will be a much better one in terms of accuracy, speed, like all the -- the whole list as we put together in the script. and cost per part, because of the -- i would say the versatility of our machine and the ability to have great thermal control which is very important from polypropylene. for many years, i was managing plants, where the main input was polypropylene. it's a great material and it's really a great step into manufacturing.
this is the most common plastic out there.
troy jensen -- lake street capital markets -- analyst
yes. i totally agree. and am i correct that it was just the h350 that this is on?
yoav zeif -- chief executive officer
yeah. you are right.
troy jensen -- lake street capital markets -- analyst
awesome. awesome, guys. well, congrats on the great results and i'll see you tomorrow.
operator
our next question is from wamsi mohan with bank of america. please proceed with your question.
wamsi mohan -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
yes, thank you, and congrats on the strong results. really nice revenue growth. i was wondering if you can talk a little bit about gross margins. i think you guys alluded to both macro challenges and availability of material.
so can you help us think through how much are gross margins pressured by inflation and supply chain issues currently because i understand your target is to be significantly higher. what sort of pressure you're currently absorbing?
eitan zamir -- chief financial officer
right. so thank you, wamsi, it's a good question. i think related to this in the script that in q1, we had approximately a little bit more than 2%, 200 basis points compared to q1 2021. that's the impact of the inflation and the material cost.
we did compensate with price increase, but we really -- we are focused on delivery to our customers and that's the focus and we're able to mitigate some of these pressures and costs with price increase as i mentioned.
wamsi mohan -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
ok. thank you. i'm also trying to understand the ebitda bridge, as it pertains to the second half versus the first half. if i just look at your opex guide increase for the year of '20 to '25, you already have about $10 million of that increase absorbed in q1 and you already said q2 is going to be up sequentially.
so is it right to think that most of this opex increase is very front-end loaded for you in the year? and if so, if the back half opex is relatively flat, and you're already doing $8 million in ebitda, why would you not see much more stronger ebitda leverage in the back half of the year, because you're annualizing already to $32 million ebitda and your low-end of your guide is $38 million, but your opex is so much front-end loaded. so can you just help me think through the moving pieces on this ebitda bridge? thank you.
eitan zamir -- chief financial officer
so that's a good question. so first of all, when you look on 2021 spread over the quarter -- over the year, so there was a difference between the different quarters and opex increase in the second half of 2021, partially related to this xaar acquisition and other items that we've mentioned in previous calls. so that's why the change -- the increase that you see q1 versus q1 does not necessarily reflect the trend for the next quarter. and i hope that it addresses the question.
then on the improved ebitda or the kind of ebitda that we guide, as mentioned on the script, we are very confident about our ability to meet our numbers and to meet our guidance. but we do take into account the challenges -- the macroeconomic challenges and the high certainty in the current market. so we embedded that into our bottom-line guidance. and as we move throughout the year, we will be able to update further if those conditions improve.
wamsi mohan -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
ok. thank you very much.
yoav zeif -- chief executive officer
maybe one thing, i would just want to leverage your question, just to thank our operations team, your question about supply chain, because they did a really above and beyond. and i know many companies in our industry and out of our industry that couldn't deliver and couldn't meet the revenue targets because of supply chain. and our guys did fantastically well. we are sourcing globally, but they found so many creative ways to deliver.
and i thank them for that. and despite the fact that we put delivery as first priority, we improved gross margin, all the flows for our upscale.
operator
our next question is from paul chung with j.p. morgan. please proceed with your question.
paul chung -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
hi. thanks for taking my questions. so just on consumables, should we kind of expect some acceleration here maybe after such a strong rebound here in system sales over the last couple of quarters? how typical is the lag for reorders for some of these newer systems? and then just on utilization rates from your installed base for consumables, where you see kind of pockets of strength there on both materials and applications?
yoav zeif -- chief executive officer
thanks, paul, for the question. you saw the increase in our hardware this quarter and also in the last few quarters. and the higher the hardware growth is, the more consumables and services will follow. we already started to see those fruits in this quarter, which was the consumable was the highest since q2 2018.
and we expect to continue to see this growth also coming from our new products.
paul chung -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
ok, great. and then follow-up on the u.s. government initiative here, you have a slide here pointing that out. are your discussion kind of accelerating from some of those key companies in aerospace in this slide.
do you get a sense or may be kind of possible government funding involved or are you seeing any catalyst from the policy side? thank you.
yoav zeif -- chief executive officer
thank you for the question, paul. we have a long relationship with the government, and specifically with the u.s. government. we believe that government is a catalyst practically for the adoption of 3d printing because it's so fit -- i think it's the best fit for long sustaining programs for spare parts.
we showed it with our navy air deal, which is a long-term deal and we are supporting it. and we're seeing more of those deals going forward. so we have a lot of appreciation to the u.s. government as a catalyst for the adoption of additive manufacturing.
but the ability to leverage also our relationship with corporate america and leading aero and auto players like lockheed martin and others, and to build a package that addresses not the leading company but many, many, many suppliers is really unique to stratasys. because as i mentioned at the beginning of this call, we have the solution, we have the full package. and when someone wants to step into additive and to start manufacture, it's a lot of training, it's a lot of support, it's a lot of -- we need to hold the hands of those small suppliers and make sure they are meeting the requirements and the certification and they allow that we invest so much for the high end. so we believe that the combination of corporate america, the government, and our infrastructure and capabilities can be a great success.
it's a journey, but we are happy to start stepping into it.
paul chung -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
great. thank you.

our next question is from jim ricchiuti with needham. please proceed with your question.
jim ricchiuti -- needham and company -- analyst
hi. question, just given where we are middle of may, wondering what you've seen in terms of demand? you obviously had a strong q1 in terms of top line growth. but i'm just wondering in light of some of the macro challenges that we're hearing about, are you seeing any change in demand either in specific verticals or geographies, or are you seeing the same level of demand exiting the quarter that you saw in q1?
yoav zeif -- chief executive officer
hey, jim, thank you for the question. to date, demand is strong and it doesn't mean that we as leaders of this company, are not looking all over and planning for the future, because we are looking what's going on in the capital market and in other markets, but it's clear to us. today, demand is strong. and this is why we build our inventory, you can see it in the report.
we build out inventory because the demand is strong and we need to meet the demand. but we are not driving blind and of course, we are cautious but thank god, and thank the industry and good technology, the demand currently is strong.
jim ricchiuti -- needham and company -- analyst
and a separate question in somewhat unrelated area, just but i wanted to follow up on the new products that you've introduced into the textile printing market. i wonder if you could talk a little bit about the strategy for this product, it seems like it's a different channel. and to what extent is this more of a gradual introduction in terms of planting a flag in this market?
yoav zeif -- chief executive officer
it's a great question. as i mentioned, we have four growth engines, the cutting-edge technologies, the five technology, the software, the material, the service, but nothing will work if we're not cross the chasm of this industry from prototyping to manufacturing. and you can cross the chasm only with use cases. and fashion is a great use case with huge potential, our addressable market is the high-end fashion market.
so we are talking about luxury goods, high-end fashion, because we can do something that no one else can do. with our polyjet technology, we can have design, we can work with the best house brands in the world and we are already doing it. so we already have some fantastic results, and we are talking about thousands of items, like shoes and garments that are already there. of course, it's just the beginning of the beginning.
but we are going to show it in the milan show, i think it's in june. it's super exciting, because it's mass market, and it's real manufacturing, and it's real manufacturing with material jetting that no one believed in the world that it's possible, but we made it happen.
jim ricchiuti -- needham and company -- analyst
and are you going direct or using a channel partner here?
yoav zeif -- chief executive officer
we are doing both and we were using also service bureaus. because this industry is working a lot with outsourced to high-end manufacturers, so we are doing both. it's really exciting, i really invite you to come and see in the milan fashion show, it's amazing.
jim ricchiuti -- needham and company -- analyst

yoav zeif -- chief executive officer
yeah, this is a great question. thank you. now it's clear. we had last week our manufacturing event, experienced stratasys manufacturing.
and within this event, we were very clear on what are the new product. and the focus now is to take what we have and make sure that it's suitable for manufacturing. so it starts with two new materials, the pa-12 and the polypropylene for the saf or the saf technology. we have eight --- 16 overall -- 16 new materials.
i don't know if others -- i don't want to say something that i'm not sure, but 16 materials to launch in one year, this is remarkable. this is really remarkable. on top of which we are putting all our technologies on grabcad, which is a new product. so grabcad will be also in saf and also on the origin.
and we also have the origin local which is suitable for manufacturing with defense and other similar industries and verticals. so we are making sure that we are following our strategy, it's not only the cutting edge machine, but you have also the software and the material and the service to be successful. from my perspective, this is real additive manufacturing 2.0, because it's not about the technology. it's about solving the problem to the customer.
this is 2.0 and you can beat 2.0 am only if you have the full solution. and i'm proud to say that we have the full solution.
ananda baruah -- loop capital markets -- analyst
that's great. that's it for me. thank you so much. really helpful.
looking forward to seeing the rest of the year.

our next question is from noelle dilts with stifel. please proceed with your question.
noelle dilts -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
hi, guys. and again, congrats on a good quarter. it seems like you're pretty satisfied with your current hardware technologies and offering. but can you revisit if there is anything you feel you need to add on that front? and if you could just generally speak about your m&a priorities? thanks.
yoav zeif -- chief executive officer
hi, noelle. thank you. it's a great question. we are not satisfied at all with what we have.
that's not our nature here. we're not satisfied with anything. for each one of our technology, we have a five years roadmap to make sure that we will be at the front of this technology for many years to come. and we spent very high level of r&d in order to make it happen.
having said that, and by the way, it's in our five years plan, it's in our annual operating plan in each one of our technologies. but let's put this aside, we also understand that we must invest in material and in software and improving our service because we are taking our solution and those technologies to manufacturing. and this is a completely new set of requirements from the customer side. so that's exactly what we are doing.
in terms of the technology to get back to your question, we are investing, i think we already mentioned this, we have an arm, and we should probably announce it in more detail. but we have an arm that invest in technologies to make sure that we are not only innovating internally but also externally to secure our polymer leadership position. and we invested in companies like genera and 9t labs, like inkbit, which are really -- this is the new generation of am, and we will make sure that that will be part of our offering as well.
noelle dilts -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
ok. thanks. and jim asked this question a bit, but could you expand a little bit on what you're seeing from a geographic trend perspective? thanks.
yonah lloyd -- chief communications officer and vice president of investor relations

yoav zeif -- chief executive officer
thank you, yonah. good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining us. today, i will touch on the highlights of our first quarter and share insights on a number of key milestones achieved so far in 2022. i will then hand it off to eitan to discuss our financial results and outlook in more detail.
the first quarter was our strongest in six years, a great start to an exciting year for stratasys. we delivered solid results that include contributions from across all platform to drive top line growth and improved margins. all of our technologies grew, and i'm happy to say that all of our key businesses showed improvement compared to our pre-covid first quarter of 2019. we are particularly excited by the early momentum from our new origin p3, h350 saf and neo systems, designed specifically for high volume production of end-use parts.
our focus on execution is yielding results, that demonstrate how our strategy to grow our leadership position in polymer 3d printing is working. our revenues of $163.4 million were up 22% versus the prior year quarter. we see particular strength in systems which grew 37% and we ended the quarter with a robust balance sheet that included over $475 million of cash and no debt. during the first quarter, we expanded our penetration further into applications for aerospace, automotive, and fashion, we tailored industry-specific solutions.
for example, working with our partner lockheed martin, we uniquely qualified a high performance and tailored material for aerospace end-use parts. in automotive, radford motors is now second auto oem using all five of our technologies for using design, prototypes, tooling, and final parts used in vehicle production. we also officially launched the commercialization of our fashion solution with techstyle, that's techstyle. the industry's first 3d printer designed specifically for printing direct to garments and other end products.
it opens unlimited possibilities for the fashion industry to personalize and customize premium textiles, clothing bags and accessories, footwear, and many other fashion applications. i would like to highlight three important milestones reached since the close of the quarter, that we expect will contribute to our ongoing efforts to outperform. first, we announced the creation of the new entity comprised of makerbot and ultimaker. with our focus on industrial, healthcare, and production scale, polymer 3d printing for manufacturing, we determined that makerbot, a desktop solution fell outside of our core businesses.
the transaction serves several purposes. it allow us to further concentrate our efforts to grow our leadership position in our area of focus. it has a margin accretive benefit on our business, and our commercial agreement provides us access to entry-level 3d printing users, allowing us to potentially realize incremental synergies without distracting our resources. we believe that the desktop sector is growing at a healthy pace, and that the new company will be a leading force in that industry and we view our investment as having the potential to realize incremental long-term value for our shareholders.
second, we recently published our inaugural report on environmental, social and governance activities, which we believe is the first report published to gri standards in our industry by an oem. this report outlines our commitment to esg and establishes benchmarks for future targets. our sustainability priorities include design for responsible production and consumption, transparency, people-first initiative and social impact programs. we are also focusing on renewable energy projects, quality education, industry innovation, and climate action.
the 3d printing industry is ideally situated to drive innovation and improvement in manufacturing from a sustainability perspective, and stratasys is aiming to lead those efforts. i encourage visiting our website to review the report. and third, and last week, we hosted our annual flagship manufacturing virtual event, where we announced a number of new product updates, which will strengthen our market-leading offerings and the value potential our products can bring to customers. pa-12, the most popular industrial 3d printing material is expected to be available later this year for our h350 printers.
also for the h350, we announced the upcoming availability of polypropylene, which is very popular in traditional manufacturing, but not widely available in 3d printing. this material further demonstrates the competitive superiority that our saf technology provides in powder bed space with respect to materials, speed, accuracy, cost per power and total cost of ownership. in fdm, we are upgrading our f123 series, with the launch of the f190cr and the f370cr systems. cr means composite ready and includes the new nylon-cf10, a carbon fiber material that is both exceptionally strong and light, thereby extending the end market opportunities for the f123 series.
we also announced our first stratasys validated fdm materials from third party materials partner which our channel will begin to sell in the second half of 2022. it's a great example of our open materials ecosystem approach beginning to bear fruit. with our p3 technology, we are adding grabcad print software to origin, completing the integration efforts to have a single platform across all of our co-manufacturing systems. we announced the availability of the first origin compatible materials from our origin open material license.
and importantly, we launched origin local, an offline non-cloud version, which is ideal for use by certain defense and government applications. when you consider all of these developments along with the new product that we recently launched, you can see why we are so excited about the future. every execution on our strategy and build momentum, customers continue to permanently replace a number of their traditional manufacturing choices with our additive manufacturing solutions, expressing their long-term confidence in stratasys. the recent supply chain and related issues have been a catalyst across industry to rethink how they manage their product lifecycle.
we see it happening with leading companies such as general atomics, which invested in both stratasys and stratasys direct and has been expanding its additive manufacturing program for unmanned aerial vehicles beyond tooling to end-use parts. they have a goal to increase the percentage of parts using additive on their uav drones to 50% on their smaller ones and mid-single percent on the larger ones. we see it with healthcare companies like medtronic, which has moved from machine tools to 3d-printer tools with stratasys because they can create more accurate and complex path while reducing cost by 80%, saving millions of dollars. and we see it with transportation giant, like alstom, which is 3d printing spare parts, tens of thousands of them, so far.
as part of its industry of the future program reducing its dependence on outside suppliers, while reducing lead time by 95%. there are many more such changes taking place across industries and we believe that this clearly shows the path that manufacturers have owned as they make their production lines more efficient, less costly, more sustainable, and simply better with stratasys. we are also encouraged to see the u.s. government and large manufacturers step up to help more companies get involved in our industry through the additive manufacturing forward program.
this initiative was announced by the white house earlier this month and reflects their belief in 3d printing's benefit to the manufacturing economy. this includes building more resilient supply chains and onshoring manufacturing to help grow the economy. the program is specifically designed to help suppliers to companies like raytheon and lockheed invest more in additive manufacturing, ge aviation, honeywell, and siemens are also some of the initial participant companies. while many of our largest customers are building out sophisticated advanced manufacturing centers, it's their suppliers who manufacture a lot of their end-use parts.
this program helps incentivize more companies to invest in additive manufacturing given large oem are now committing to purchasing additively produced parts. the program also will provide training, technical assistance, and standout development, all things needed to help additive manufacturing to go in the mainstream, and stratasys has the full solution and broadest portfolio to support this initiative. with that, i will now turn the call over to our cfo eitan zamir to share the financial results and update our outlook for 2022. eitan?
eitan zamir -- chief financial officer
thank you, yoav, and good afternoon, everyone. we're pleased to have delivered a strong start to 2022. the revenue growth especially just 36.7% growth in our system sales along with our improving margin position us to build momentum through the balance of the year and beyond. for the first quarter, total revenue was $163.4 million, a 21.8% increase from the prior year period, driven by growth from all technologies and primarily by strength in systems.
on a constant currency basis, total revenue increased 24% versus the prior year quarter. important to note is that all key businesses were higher than the pre-pandemic first quarter of 2019, resulting in total revenue being 5.2% higher as compared to that period. product revenue in the first quarter was $113.1 million, an increase of 45.2% compared to the same period last year or 27.8% on a constant currency basis. within product revenue, system revenue increased 36.7% to $54.5 million compared to the same period last year and increased by 39.3% on a constant currency basis.
system sales reflected the highest first quarter total in five years, strengthened by the launch of the origin one in mid-february and the first full quarter of h350 sale. importantly, the higher margin consumable business showed revenue increase by 16.1% to $58.6 million compared to the same period last year, an increase by 18.8% on a constant currency basis. consumables revenue also exceeded the first quarter of 2019, as well as the fourth quarter of 2021, reflecting the impact of strong system sales throughout 2021, and their expected flow through as initial materials are replenished. service revenue was $50.3 million, an increase of 14.8% compared to the same period last year, and slightly higher than the first quarter of 2019.
on a constant currency basis, service revenue increased by 16.1%. within service revenue, customer support revenue increased by 10.1% compared to the same period last year, an increase by 11.7% on a constant currency basis. we note that 2022 is a year of strategic execution, following the important acquisition we made in the past two years to strengthen our technology portfolio and ensure we could provide comprehensive solutions at across the entire polymer application space. these investments are already contributing to revenue, putting us ahead of the curve, and increasing our competitive advantage in the 3d printing industry.
now turning to gross margins. gaap gross margin was 42.6% for the quarter compared to 41.4% for the same period last year. non-gaap gross margin was 47.3% for the quarter compared to 46.7% for the same period last year. margin improvement year over year was driven by higher revenues in system, consumables, services, and improved operational efficiencies.
this was partially offset by macro issues related to logistical challenges and availability of materials. gaap operating expenses were $89.3 million, an increase of $15.3 million or 20.7% from the same period last year. non-gaap operating expenses were $75.3 million, an increase of $10.1 million or 15.5% compared to the same period last year. non-gaap operating expenses were 46.1% of revenue for the quarter, our lowest q1 opex as a percentage of revenue in seven years compared to 48.6% for the same period last year.
the $10.1 million year-over-year increase in operating expenses on an absolute basis was driven primarily by the impact of three acquisitions xaar 3d, origin, and rps, as well as higher commission based on higher revenue. we were pleased to see the efficiency of our model, where the additional operating expenses reflected only a 35% incremental cost, instead of the historical range in the mid to high 14%. regarding earnings, gaap operating loss for the quarter was $19.6 million, compared to a loss of $18.4 million for the same period last year. non-gaap operating income for the quarter was $2 million, compared to a loss of $2.6 million for the same period last year.
the difference reflects our business scalability and improved operational efficiencies, which resulted in better gross margin and lower operating expenses. gaap net loss for the quarter was $20.9 million or $0.32 per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $18.9 million or $0.32 per diluted share for the same period last year. non-gaap net income for the quarter was $1.2 million or $0.02 per diluted share, compared to a loss of $3.8 million or $0.06 per diluted share in the same period last year, adjusted ebitda of $8.1 million, compared to $3.5 million in the same period last year, reflecting our improved profitability levels. we used $16.1 million of cash from operations during the first quarter, compared to generating $22.8 million of cash in the same quarter last year.
the use of cash was driven by deliberately increased inventory purchases and an increase in accounts receivable. we ended the quarter with $475.6 million in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term deposits, compared to $502.2 million at the end of the fourth quarter of 2021. we remain well-funded and well-positioned to capitalize on value-enhancing market opportunities as they arise. now let me turn to our outlook for 2022.
i would note that our guidance continues to include full year anticipated contribution from makerbot, as the announced business combination with ultimaker has not yet closed. we expect the transaction to be margin accretive upon closing and we plan to update our outlook later this year. today, we are tightening the revenue range from our previous guidance for 2022 revenue. it is now $685 million to $695 million.
while we are encouraged by the level of engagement with our customers and confident in our growth potential, we are also monitoring global issues that can have an impact, such as the shutdowns in part of china, currency fluctuations and continued other supply chain constraints. we continue to expect revenue to grow sequentially each quarter throughout the year with the second half of the year notably stronger than the first half. revenue growth for the second quarter is expected to be low to mid-teens as a percentage over the second quarter of 2021. from a gross margin perspective, we continue to expect full year 2022 to be flat to slightly higher as compared to 2021, with the second half stronger than the first half, based primarily on higher revenue.
we expect the second quarter to be relatively flat to the second quarter of last year. as a reminder, we view the current gross margin situation as temporary, when headwinds caused by logistics and material macro issues path, and we continue to execute on our long-term plan, we expect our margins to add back over 50%. in 2022, we continue to expect our operating expenses to be approximately $20 million to $25 million higher than 2021, primarily due to the impact of owning xaar 3d for the full year, higher costs that result from higher sales and investment in new growth driver, such as origin one and healthcare. operating expenses are typically higher in the second quarter as compared to the first quarter due to the normal timing of compensation expenses.
and while the absolute dollar value of these expenses will grow, we expect to see the percentage of revenue remain flat or even improved slightly throughout the year. while the first quarter came in stronger than expected, we recognize that the above-mentioned supply chain and other macro issues could impact our revenues and costs. so we continue to guide non-gaap operating margin to be slightly above 2% for the full year. longer-term, we expect operating margin to achieve double-digits as our growth plan unfolds.
we continue to anticipate a gaap net loss of $74 million to $67 million or $1.11 to $1.00 per diluted share. and non-gaap net income of $10 million to $13 million or $0.14 to $0.19 per diluted share. adjusted ebitda is still expected to be in the range of $38 million to $41 million and capital expenditures in the range between 20 and $25 million. with that, let me turn the call back over to yoav for closing remarks.
yoav?
yoav zeif -- chief executive officer
thank you, eitan. our strong start to the year, and the strategic moves we continue to make demonstrate that we are executing on our plan. the powerful combination of our new technology offering, expanding the material and software solutions, strong balance sheet, and our dedicated talented team positions us well to execute on our strategy with excellence. we will continue to grow our top and bottom lines, improving profitability over time due to increasing scale.
as i noted earlier, we are relentless about our focus to grow our leadership position in polymer additive manufacturing. our results over the past two years, clearly reflect that our strategy is working. with that, let's open it up for questions. operator?

thank you. [operator instructions]. our first question today is coming from greg palm from craig-hallum. your line is now live.
danny eggerichs -- craig-hallum capital group -- analyst
yeah. thanks. this is actually danny eggerichs on for greg today. i guess, just starting off, maybe any further color on what you're seeing in the broader demand, broader demand trends given the current macro and maybe if you could even break that down further into the geographic markets that you serve?
yoav zeif -- chief executive officer
thank you for your question. we are seeing a very nice level of engagement with our customers, and we are focusing on the opportunity. the nice thing with us of course, we are operating in the same world like anyone else. but in the last two years, we opened up for us new markets.
we practically doubled our total addressable market. so, despite the fact that outside deal, there are issues, macro issues, supply chain issues, inflation, we, in the micro level, as strategies, i think double size of the market, which means that we have a very nice space to grow. and that's what we are doing, and that's why we have a nice demand. and you can see it also in our guidance.
danny eggerichs -- craig-hallum capital group -- analyst
yes. and then, i guess, just off that, are you surprised to the upside or downside on any geographies europe or the americas or anything like that.
yoav zeif -- chief executive officer
in general, things are going as planned. and the nice thing with stratasys is that we are very diversified, both in terms of products and geographies. so luckily enough, it's not luck, we planned it. but we planned well and we are meeting our numbers.
danny eggerichs -- craig-hallum capital group -- analyst
yes. ok. and then, just moving on to some of the guidance, still targeting double-digit operating margins longer term. any way you can go into more detail on that, maybe the timeline or the level of revenue associated with that, just being that it's a fairly significant jump from this current year estimate of that 2%?
eitan zamir -- chief financial officer
daniel, that's a very good question. and similar to our message, i believe the last quarter, the whole story or the main story here is the scalability, right? and we have five technologies, and we are well positioned to grow long term, double-digit kind of with the coming year. and with that double-digit revenue growth, the scalability, the ability to bring opex in very, very low margin or much lower margins, that's the story here. and i think this quarter the second quarter just demonstrated, right? so, if you compare q2 2022 to q2 2021, and you look on almost $20 million revenue increase that came with $5 million opex, that's 25% opex on that incremental revenue, right? so that's the scalability that's the way to improve gross margins and opex as we get bigger, bringing us to the double-digit sale operating profit.
operator
your next question today is coming from paul chung from j.p. morgan. your line is now live.
paul chung -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
hi. thanks for taking my questions. so just on cash flow, you're seeing a drag this year in the first half on inventory investments and other kind of working cap investments. how do we think about cash flow generation in the second half? and can you breakeven or positive for the year after heavy investments in the first half?
yoav zeif -- chief executive officer
yes. that's a very good question. so first, maybe taking you back to the last eight to nine quarters, right? so, after seven quarters with a significant positive operating cash flow, seven consecutive quarters this is the second quarter that we have negative operating cash flow. but this is the liberty that basically our focus on the demand, on meeting our clients' expectations, customer expectations.
keep in mind that we are a global company, we demand everywhere. we want to make sure that we have the inventory in place globally in the different locations available. we're trying to leverage our strong cash position with no debt and even if it means a couple of quarters of a negative operating cash flow in order to meet our demand in order, by the way, also to improve our gross margin in the future because that will enable us to shift more to sea versus air shipment in the future, having the right scale of inventory. that's the way we think about it.
obviously, we're very sensitive. we're very cautioned to it, to cash flow, but this is a temporary deliberate action by the company. and we do see that in the future, in the later future, we see ourselves again coming back to positive operating cash flow and positive free cash flow in the mid to long term.
paul chung -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
and then just a follow-up. historically, it's been quite difficult to kind of break out beyond the $700 million in revenues for the year, you're almost there in '22. but as we think about '23, expand on the confidence you have in the product portfolio any other levers you want to call out, why is it different this time around? and you mentioned 50% gross margin target. what's the expected timing of rebounding back to those levels? and are you seeing some evidence of consumables demand kind of accelerating? thank you.
eitan zamir -- chief financial officer
thank you for your question. i will divide my answer to two. first, i would like to start with the revenues. we are quite confident that we will pass the $700 million and more because we created a growth engine, and we put them in place in the last two years.
so, we have the most innovative polymer technologies. we have a great more than great, you know what? material platform that it's open now, and we will keep strengthening this material platform, and we'll see more revenues out of it. we have a very strong software platform and a service that is much better plus used cases that will go one by one and concur that. so, we have a very clear five-year plan, and we are very confident that we will be able to achieve it, including passing the $700 million, starting with the origin and the top and the rps, we have plenty of room to grow.
that's on the revenue side. then if i look at the profitability measure, as we said before, it will take us two to three years, but we'll be there.
operator
thank you. next question is coming from troy jensen from lake street capital. your line is now line.
troy jensen -- lake street capital markets -- analyst
hey, gentlemen, congrats on the nice results here.
yoav zeif -- chief executive officer
thank you.
troy jensen -- lake street capital markets -- analyst
hey, congrats on the nice results here. so, i want to look at second half guidance here. if you kind of do the math, you're talking about a $21 million increase over last year's second half. so, i'm always curious to know if the base business is growing.
so, with this $21 million increase, how much of that is coming. i guess, you want to tell me how much is coming from the new products. but are you assuming that your base business, your fdm and polyjet will be growing in the second half over last year second half?
yoav zeif -- chief executive officer
hey, troy. all businesses are growing, in particular, the hardware. the hardware is the driver. look at our results today, 29% practically in retail, 33% growth in hardware.
so, this is the driver for material and service and goes across the different technologies to both the base technologies, fdm and polyjet and the new technologies are growing. and for me, the most important thing is they're growing hardware. so, we'll see more revenues from this growth.
troy jensen -- lake street capital markets -- analyst
perfect. all right. now my follow-up here is, you provided us an update of your operating margin targets at double digits in the long term. i'm curious to know if you guys will avoid doing dilutive acquisitions while you guys strive for this higher level of profitability.
eitan zamir -- chief financial officer
that's a good question. so obviously, we're talking about two to three years to get to the double-digit operating income. it will be a mix of doing the right thing for the company. but i can tell you, i think i answered earlier, we really believed that our organic business today, like the platform that we created, the technology, the value proposition, those by themselves, as we grow as we as our revenues continues to increase double digits in the next year will bring significant incremental operating profit and will get us closer to the double digits.
operator
thank you. next question is coming from wamsi mohan from bank of america. your line is now live.
wamsi mohan -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
thank you. good morning. yoav, you noted increased tam now and resiliency in demand, you obviously kept your guide sort of outside of fx. and i'm curious to hear a little bit about maybe what your customers are doing with the installed base in terms of usage metrics, maybe that can be a way for us to gauge what the demand looks like of your installed base of systems.
if you look at consumables' growth, there was some deceleration, and i know some of the compares are strange. so maybe you can give us a sense what you're hearing from customers around intention in the back half of this year in terms of usage metrics? are you thinking they're going to remain relatively consistent? are you anticipating that to either increase or decrease in any significant fashion? and i have a follow-up.
yoav zeif -- chief executive officer
thank you for the question. let's start with the long term because this is what is really important here. what is really important is there is a shift from using our machines for prototyping with very limited utilization to using our machines for real production, even if it is slow volume for personalized end-use part, but it is real manufacturing. and we know that real manufacturing machines consume four to five times materials than a prototyping machine, which this is the essence of everything that we are doing here.
and it's a long journey, but we are starting -- we are reporting on it, as you know, every first quarter, and we are step-by-step making these effects use case by use case, application by application. so, it doesn't matter if it's dentures or crowning bridges, or pre-surgical planning or deducts for automotive or airplanes. this is exactly what we are doing. we are identifying the use cases where manufacturing can benefit from additive manufacturing and then we come with the full solution, and we open the market together with our customers.
and it will grow year-over-year, as we said, 20%, we committed to 20% year-over-year growth of this poster of our business. this is the big picture. now when i'm looking at next -- the second half, who knows exactly what will have it. but what we do know is that we have biotechnologies, the largest installed base in the industry, very pro-balance sheet, and we become more critical to our customers.
so, when we look at the inventory that we built up, their means and the fact that they are consuming more material across five technologies are optimistic that we are resilient enough for any market condition.
wamsi mohan -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
ok. thanks for that, yoav. and then, maybe one for eitan. how much pressure are you currently experiencing from inflation on your gross margins? you're obviously seeing a nice uptick in revenue.
you're signaling a lot of confidence in continued revenue growth and you're getting back to 50% gross margins. is it right to think that you have obviously positive operating leverage as you're getting increased volume on your revenues. but then the inflation pressures are more than offsetting that positive leverage in some ways. and so, if we think about the bridge to get to your 50%, are you absorbing like 300, 400 basis points of gross margin headwind right now because of inflation or are you expecting other levers to get you over to 50%?
eitan zamir -- chief financial officer
thank you, wamsi. so first to answer your -- kind of your last part of the question. when we compare it to q2 2021, we see roughly 300 basis point impact give or take, ok? so, 3% on our gross margin year-over-year. however, as you noted, there are a few things that we've done to compensate.
one is the higher revenue. so, scalability works on the gross margin as well, higher revenue, improve our gross profit with the fixed cost and so on. second, we did increase prices several times over the last year. so, when we compare ourselves to q2 2021, there was a price increase by us to mitigate to offset the logistics inflation.
and there is also the operational efficiencies we try to be more efficient. the higher inventories, the higher production levels come with make the unit -- the cost per unit, naturally lower and that's part of the scalability. and there's also the fx that has some impact on our gross margin. so, when you aggregate all these together and we see we look one, two, three years ahead, the scalability, the higher revenues and the combination of what i mentioned, should get us to the 50%.
operator
thank you. your next question is coming from kieran mccabe from stifel. your line is now live.
kieran mccabe -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
yes, thank you for taking my question. my first question was on the slide, the j5 dentajet. you mentioned that you're seeing significant dental sales, particularly in emea. i was wondering if you could provide any other color on demand in the dental area in the other regions, north america, europe
yoav zeif -- chief executive officer
thank you for the question. we are building the strongest dental portfolio and the manufacturing. and we can do it because we have five technologies, very strong portfolio of materials and deep knowledge and expertise in dental historically, and we are now leveraging it. we have a portfolio both in dlp and in polyjet and the polyjet is disruptive.
the ability to print everything, every different application on the same the same tray plus the ability to expect and with different materials, this is very early unique and disruptive in the market. this is the polyjet. then we have the dmp, which i believe the best part, the best accuracy in the business. and as with the rps, which is [inaudible] last four months that helps us to get into the liner business and other dental applications.
so, what we are focusing now is on building the material portfolio that will go with those three technologies, supporting them with application engineers and unique service offering. we started to build a unique service offering. it's not like our regular service and when you put everything together, the speed, the yield, the quality that we will be able to provide to our customers plus disruptive solutions that you will see in the future, really disruptive solutions that you will see in the future that we are working on it. i think we'll would be a leading player in dental offering, starting with the dentajet.
kieran mccabe -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
great. and my follow-up question was on the slide on non-gaap margins. we're seeing -- you guys have seemed to have a very good improvement in the service gross margins sequentially in year-over-year. just kind of wondering if you could provide any color on what's really driving that improvement in the service gross margin.
eitan zamir -- chief financial officer
thank you. the improvement on gross margin in the service is driven by price increase that we've generated, as well as deals and deals that came with better gross margin that's more and more positively impact our gross margin on service. these are the two main elements that improved the gross margin on the service business.
operator
thank you. next question is coming from brian drab from william blair. your line is now live.
brian drab -- william blair -- analyst
hi. thanks for taking my question. i was wondering if you could maybe give a little more color on makerbot just to help us model help everyone model. you said in material impact on revenue.
i'm just wondering what is the definition of material in this case? and you're going to see that revenue come out of the -- since you're reporting the equity method come out of your top line. so, can you give us any more color on that? and also, what does that do for profitability? i imagine that has at least -- i guess, maybe it's you're going to save some material, but a small step-up in margin after it after this move.
yoav zeif -- chief executive officer
thank you, brian. as we mentioned previously, we're waiting for the deal to close and the timing of the deal close will impact our results for the rest of the year. so, bear with us we will get back to you after deal close, and we'll update on the numbers. however, to one of your comments, one of your points, the makerbot business, the exclusion of the makerbot business will improve our margin for the rest of the year.
brian drab -- william blair -- analyst
and just irrespective of the timing of it, you can't comment on how generally, how this business is doing in the level of revenue?
yoav zeif -- chief executive officer
not at this time, but we'll update later.
operator
thank you. our next question is coming from ananda baruah from loop capital. your line is now live.
ananda baruah -- loop capital markets -- analyst
hey. thanks, guys, for taking my question. yeah, just two quick ones, if i could. can you talk about where you're still seeing the supply constraints the most? and then i have a quick follow-up.
thanks.
yoav zeif -- chief executive officer
ananda, thank you. no, nothing new here. business in china still there, some releases here, and there, traffic jam in u.s. board and overall shortage mainly in electronics and some raw materials because of the war.
so, i think it's usual suspects, i would say. and we are working strongly with our team. i want to thank my operation team. we didn't miss a pay this quarter despite the fact that it's a war out there in supply chain.
we are investing in increasing the inventory. we are willing to pay in order to deliver -- to pay and leverage our strong balance sheet in order to deliver value on time to our customers and ensure that we can supply them. i believe it will really gradually because it's part of the cycle.
ananda baruah -- loop capital markets -- analyst
and would you consider -- that's really helpful context. and would you consider the supplier sort of collectively seems to be easing at all yet?
yoav zeif -- chief executive officer
not yet, but our expectations by the end of year will see it becoming easier and i'm optimistic, i'm optimistic nature. it's good for additive manufacturing. so, look at the bright side.
operator
thank you. we've reached the end of our question-and-answer session. i'd like to turn the floor back over for any further or closing comments.
yoav zeif -- chief executive officer
so thank you for joining us. looking forward to updating you again next quarter.

i will now turn the call over to our chief executive officer, dr. yoav zeif. yoav? 
yoav zeif -- chief executive officer
thank you, jon. good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. our second quarter results reflect a continuation of our ongoing business momentum. i am proud of the stratasys team as we delivered our strongest second quarter in four years.
revenue of $166.6 million were up 13.3% versus the prior year quarter, 16.4% taking fx into account and then sequentially over first quarter. these metrics are in line with our prior outlook. we saw particular trend in system revenue, which grew by over 29% compared to the second quarter of 2021, with year-over-year growth across all printer technologies. importantly, our balance sheet has us well positioned with $441.5 million of cash and equivalents and no debt, we are operating in an environment of supply chain constraints, global economic uncertainty around inflation, rising interest rates and slowing gdp.
as we face these challenges, our ongoing laser focus on execution of the business plan continues to help us deliver positive financial results and drive progress toward our stated goal of growing our leadership position in polymer additive manufacturing. the first half of 2022, saw us advance our strategy on several fronts. we continue expanding our penetration into applications for aerospace, automotive, healthcare and fashion, we tailored industry-specific solutions for customers like pepsico, toyota, and rady children hospital in san diego. as noted on our last call, we have launched two new composite ready 3d printers in q2, along with the new tech side printer for the fashion industry.
in addition, we launched grabcad software on the origin line of 3d printers and introduced a broad area of new materials. this breadth of manufacturing expertise is leading to new business opportunities. we recently made two exciting announcements in the auto racing industry. specifically, stratasys was named a nascar competitive partner where we are teaming with nascar to provide the first-ever 3d-printed part to be used on all of their next-generation cars.
those cars utilize stratasys' high-yield da11 material derived from sustainable sources and our manufactured its stratasys direct using our a350 3d printers. other parts are produced by nascar on our fortus 450 mc system. we also became the official 3d printing partner of toyota racing development. our 3d printed parts will be used in the toyota gr 86 vehicle for competition in 2023.
stratasys' f370 and the new sv370cr systems are expected to be utilized as part of this partnership. and similar to the nascar relationship, toyota racing development will also utilize stratasys direct to print pa11 parts on the a350. auto racing is an excellent development proving ground that can ultimately lead to mainstream production runs to millions of consumers and commercial vehicles. we have demonstrated the suitability of the a350 using our saf technology for producing a wild variety of automotive parts.
this can include ducts, front grill, side mirrors, electric cable and electrical connector among many others. as we execute our materials ecosystem strategy, we will be opening up even more automotive use cases. we have seen similar momentum in other areas. in dental, we continue to see strength in the j5 dentajet line that we launched last year.
in q2, we released an updated version that doubled the throughput without sacrificing quality. making improvements in resin consumption reduces to both usage and waste and increases the number of parts the customer can place on the print rate. and on the medical side, in early july, we released radiometrix for our digital anatomic region, which uniquely let healthcare professionals and medical device company, visualized 3d printed models under x-ray and ct scan in unique way. this attention to the need of healthcare professionals is helping us grow our presence in the market.
for instance, we recently shared how the university hospital of southern denmark went from a single material x-ray printer to our multi-material full color j5 medijet printer. and now their surgeons are saying they no longer want to do surgical procedures without 3d printed guides. i'd also like to add with you that we are progressing on the merger of makerbot with automaker and we expect it to close during the third quarter. as we previously announced, once the transaction closes, we will hold approximately 45.6% of the combined company, post-merger and will account for the combined company via the equity method rather than by consolidating it within our own results.
this change is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated revenues. i will now turn the call over to our cfo, eitan zamir to share the financial results and update our outlook for the rest of 2022. eitan?
eitan zamir -- chief financial officer
thank you, yonah, and good morning, everyone. we are pleased to have built upon the strong start we saw for 2022. revenues were driven by a 29.2% growth in our system sales compared to the second quarter of 2021, continuing the strong trend that is expected to increase sales of recurring consumables and services in the future. and we saw ongoing operating leverage that reflects the strength of our business model.
in general, we see continued strength in our business performance as revenue growth drove improved margins and earnings results. for the second quarter, total revenue grew by 13.3% to $166.6 million from the prior year period. on a constant currency basis, total revenue increased 16.4% versus the prior year quarter. product revenue in the second quarter rose by 16.4% to $115.7 million compared to the same period last year or by 19.4% on a constant currency basis.
within product revenue, system revenue grew by 29.2% to $58.9 million compared to the same period last year and increased by 33.5% on a constant currency basis. system sales reflected the highest second quarter total in four years, strengthened by the continued ramp of the origin 1 and a350 mass production system. consumables revenue was up by 3.9% to $56.9 million compared to the same period last year and grew by 7.5% on a constant currency basis. service revenue was $50.9 million, an increase of 9% compared to the same period last year and up by 10.9% on a constant currency basis.
within service revenue, customer support revenue grew 9.1% compared to the same period last year, an increase by 12.9% on a constant currency basis. now turning to gross margin. gaap gross margin was 40.5% for the quarter compared to 43% for the same period last year. non-gaap gross margin was 47.6% for the quarter compared to 47.5% for the same quarter last year.
higher systems and consumables revenue and raised pricing, along with operational efficiencies, helps to offset the growth in logistics and material costs, which were mostly attributable to global inflation. gaap operating expenses were $90.9 million compared to $86 million during the same period last year. non-gaap operating expenses were $77.4 million compared to $72.5 million during the same period last year. non-gaap operating expenses were 46.4% of revenue for the quarter compared to 49.3% for the same period last year as we continued to focus on operational efficiency improvement.
the $4.9 million year-over-year increase in operating expenses on an absolute basis was driven primarily by the impact of the xaar 3d acquisition, as well as increased travel and trade show activities and higher commissions based on the higher revenue. last quarter, we noted that the incremental cost was only 35%. this quarter, we are pleased to note an improved efficiency of our model, where the additional operating expenses reflected only 25% incremental cost instead of the historical range in the mid to high 14%. regarding earnings, gaap operating loss for the quarter was $23.5 million compared to a loss of $22.7 million for the same period last year.
non-gaap operating income for the quarter was $1.9 million compared to a loss of $2.6 million for the same period last year. the difference reflects our business capability and improved operational efficiencies, which resulted in modest gross margin growth and improved operating margin. gaap net loss for the quarter was $24.4 million or $0.37 per diluted share compared to a net loss of $20.2 million or $0.31 per diluted share for the same period last year. non-gaap net income for the quarter was $1.2 million or $0.02 per diluted share compared to a loss of $1.6 million or $0.02 per diluted share in the same period last year.
adjusted ebitda of $7.4 million compared to $3.5 million in the same period last year reflected our improved profitability levels. we used $22.8 million of cash in our operations during the second quarter compared to generating $5.6 million of cash from operations in the same quarter last year. the u.s. cash was primarily driven by deliberately increased inventory purchases of over $20 million.
we ended the quarter with $441.5 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term deposits compared to $475.6 million at the end of the first quarter of 2022. with our fortress balance sheet and strong cash generation profile, we remain well funded and well positioned to capitalize on value-enhancing market opportunities as they are identified. now let me turn to our outlook for 2022. i would note that our guidance continues to include full year anticipated contribution from makerbot as the announced merger with automaker has not yet closed.
since our last update, currency exchange rates have continued to decline across a number of our key foreign currencies, impacting our outlook for revenues for the second half of the year by $10 million. we expect the timing of such impacts to be relatively even across the third and fourth quarter. and as a result, adjusting our full year revenue guidance accordingly. we now expect revenue in a range of $675 million to $685 million and for revenue to continue growing sequentially throughout the remainder of the year.
revenue growth for the second half of the year is expected to be approximately 6% to 7% higher than the second half of 2021, with the fourth quarter anticipated to grow at a higher rate than the third. as i noted earlier, the change in full year revenue outlook is due to declines in currency rates. from a gross margin perspective, we continue to expect full year 2022 to be flat to slightly higher as compared to 2021, with the second half stronger than the first half based primarily on higher revenue. we expect the third quarter to be relatively flat compared to the third quarter of last year.
as a reminder, we view the current gross margin situation is temporary. once headwind caused by macro logistics and material issues passed and we continue to execute on our long-term plan, we expect our margins to head back over 50%. in 2022, we now expect our operating expenses to be approximately $18 million to $23 million higher than 2021, primarily due to the impact of owning xaar 3d for the full year, highest costs that result from higher sales and investments in new growth drivers such as origin one and healthcare. and despite the higher absolute dollar value year-over-year, we expect our operating expenses as a percentage of revenue to continue improving by decreasing throughout the year.
we continue to expect non-gaap operating margin to be slightly above 2% for the full year. longer term, we expect non-gaap operating margins to achieve double digit as our growth plan unfolds. we now anticipate a gaap net loss of $78 million to $69 million or $1.17 to $1.04 per diluted share and non-gaap net income of $10 million to $13 million or $0.14 to $0.19 per diluted share. adjusted ebitda is still expected to be in the range of $38 million to $41 million and capital expenditures in the range between $20 million to $25 million.
while we are encouraged by the level of engagement with our customers and remain confident in our growth potential, we continue to monitor global issues that can have an impact. with that, let me turn the call back over to yoav for closing remarks. yoav?
yoav zeif -- chief executive officer
thank you, eitan. we are pleased with our strong first half results and how they position us to execute our plan. we have aligned our business expectations based on the current global macroeconomic conditions. importantly, 3d printing is uniquely positioned to help our customers address and overcome many of the concerns that arrives in time like this.
with our expanding portfolio, we should continue to capture market share on the factory floor of fortune 500 companies around the world as the relevance and adoption of 3d printing growth, and as we build on our leadership position, drive growth and improved profitability, we expect to outperform and create long-term shareholder value. with that, let's open it up for questions. operator?

operator
thank you. the floor is now open for questions. [operator instructions] the first question today is coming from shannon cross of credit suisse. please go ahead.
shannon cross -- credit suisse -- analyst
thank you very much. i was wondering if you can just provide some more color on what your customers are saying in terms of both geographic, as well as the size and vertical of customers in terms of the selling of purchases, but also where people are looking at investing, how customers are thinking about 2023 budgets in terms of capex. maybe timing of deferred purchases. do they expect that will come back fairly quickly, or is this a longtime deferred kind of decision? just whatever you can do to, sort of, frame the current outlook from a customer perspective.
and then i have a follow-up. thank you.
eitan zamir -- chief financial officer
thanks, shannon. thank you for the question. yoav?
yoav zeif -- chief executive officer
well, we are optimistic. it's a challenging time, but the good side of challenging times that this crystallized the differentiation. and in those times, the guys that -- or the players that will shine are those that have those long-term relationships with strong installed base and are part of the daily activities of the customers, but also the part of their long-term plan. and in that sense, we're in a great position because we have direct discussion with our customers.
they are long-term plans. yes, there are delays. there is an economic global slowdown, no doubt. but it's not that they are going back and said, ""sorry, we are not interested."" it's just about the base of adoption, but it exists.
and we have a great example from this quarter like what we mentioned, the auto player, the automotive player oem deal. it's a major deal, which is a continuation for a long-term plan. so, long-term plans are exactly as we envision them with some delay. in terms of -- and geographies, i would say automotive is doing well.
aerospace is gaining some traction, but in a slower pace. education is doing very well. defense is doing very well by government. and also, the whole medical, dental is doing quite well.
of course, there are impacts there -- we see some impact there as well, but they are doing well. in terms of geography. surprisingly, europe is doing well, despite the fact that it's in the middle of the war and a lot of pressure on the fx. but in terms of real results, europe is doing well.
also, the u.s., but in all geographies, we see those, i would say, increasing or longer sales cycles.
shannon cross -- credit suisse -- analyst
great. it sounds like you're probably gaining some share in europe. can you talk a bit more about the gross margin? what the drivers are? there are obviously many puts and takes between pricing and mix and commodity costs and all of that, if you could talk both on product, as well as materials and maybe lay out a bit more about how you think gross margin will trend. thank you.
eitan zamir -- chief financial officer
hi, shannon, it's eitan. thanks for the great question. starting with the results, as you probably saw, we improved our gross margin from q3 2021, which was 48.2% and 48.5%, which is really a great success in terms of everything that is going on in the world. this improvement, this trend is, we believe, is sustainable.
again, we cannot speak about the macro, and we cannot expect exactly how things will go globally. but as far as it's concerned with us, managing our business, managing our operational efficiencies, increasing revenue, which naturally helps to improve gross margin, all these aspects that are within our control, these are things that we're very focused, and you can see the results this quarter. another thing to add, as we've discussed in previous calls, we've increased deliberately increased our inventory. that helps us to better balance the shipment fee to air and some other aspects that impact gross margin, and it impacts our cogs in a positive way, so we can better manage the logistics and the shipments, and that's something that we've been doing in the last few quarters.
and also, this quarter, and that's reflected in the good gross margin results. and we continue the trend -- this trend to -- we plan this trend to continue. also, taking into account the divestments and other elements is the divestment of makerbot, which positively impact our gross margin level.
shannon cross -- credit suisse -- analyst
great. thank you so much.
operator
thank you. the next question is coming from greg palm of craig-hallum. please go ahead.
greg palm -- craig-hallum capital group -- analyst
yes. thanks for taking the questions here. i guess just kind of following up on the last thinking there. i'm just trying to figure out what your actual visibility levels are.
obviously, the last couple of weeks of a quarter or of a year-end are especially important for the business. and so, i guess what i'm trying to figure out, is the reduction in guidance specifically a byproduct of some bigger projects that you think are going to get pushed out, or is it just the expectation that you might not get the same magnitude of a budget flush this year than you would have been in previous years?
eitan zamir -- chief financial officer
hi greg. thank you. we are in a good shape in terms of visibility. stratasys is a very well-organized company, and we are running forecast and quite accurate one and models, and we're in good shape.
the last few weeks of the quarter, it's all about unexpected delays. so, this is the situation. so, we have a longer sales cycle. we have a certain amount of delays because some of our customers are saying, ""ok, ok, but i'll take it next quarter."" so, we baked it all into our model, and we decided that we better be in a safer mode and adjust our plan, and also to balance our inventory to make sure that we are learning quarter by quarter.
but by this, i would say, longer sales cycles, and therefore, we adjusted the guidance. we don't see that the demand is moving. we just see a longer sales cycle. so, it's relatively a small adjustment, as you can see, which, when you calculate it, it's this uncertainty level that can happen at the end of the quarter in terms of delay.
but if you take the overall guidance change that we have implemented, it was 7% of our sales. so, it's really smaller jump.
greg palm -- craig-hallum capital group -- analyst
yes. understood. and i guess kind of looking forward, if we assume that this environment stays the same or potentially worsen, i guess, what kind of levers do you have internally to sustain this level of profitability? and i guess, under a more challenging macro, are you still comfortable with your double-digit operating margin target looking out a couple of years, or is there a risk that gets pushed?
eitan zamir -- chief financial officer
yeah.
yoav zeif -- chief executive officer
ok. go ahead, eitan. go ahead.
eitan zamir -- chief financial officer
hi, greg. so, our long-term plan that we've discussed also in previous calls, we still stand behind it. we believe that we have created the right infrastructure to get to the over 50% gross margin and double-digit operating profit in the mid to long term, doubling our addressable market that we've discussed in previous calls by the addition of the new technologies and everything else that we've discussed and we'll discuss today. that puts us -- gives us a lot of confidence on the ability to get to that result with respect to profitability.
naturally, it is impacted by the revenue growth, but there is a lot on management and building -- on building the right business model that, as you can see in the last few quarters, that works. we managed to remain or to increase our profitability level even in a challenging environment, even with everything that is going on. you can see that this is the fifth consecutive quarter with profit, and the profit actually increased compared to the last few quarters. so that's something that is -- a lot of it is within our control and our focus.
greg palm -- craig-hallum capital group -- analyst
ok. makes sense. appreciate that. best of luck.
thanks.
operator
thank you. the next question is coming from troy jensen of lake street capital. please go ahead.
troy jensen -- lake street capital markets -- analyst
hey, gentlemen. first off, congrats on good results here in a tough environment.
yoav zeif -- chief executive officer
thanks.
troy jensen -- lake street capital markets -- analyst
maybe starting with you -- you're very welcome. i guess, i got a couple of questions on covestro. so, as you know, a lot of your competitors use the dsm somos resins in their printers. and i don't think there's too many case studies of competitors, system companies using other system companies material.
so, i'd just love to know your conviction whether or not you can kind of maintain all of the dsm somos revenues that are going through your competitors' business models.
eitan zamir -- chief financial officer
thank you, troy. it's a great opportunity to share our vision about material. one of the most important obstacles in our journey toward manufacturing is all about materials. materials today are not sufficient, not in terms of -- mainly in terms of variety, but also in terms of, say, the profile of the material to replace real manufacturing.
and here, we are in a journey to transform it. and covestro is the super important growth engine for us for the future, both in saas -- between three technologies: in saas, in dlp, and in powder because they have unique talent, know-how, and patents that we will leverage with our new technology. so, this is the big picture. now to your question.
of course, we checked it from all possible angles, and we are going to grow this business and there is -- i would even share with you that it's not that there is a retaliation from the customers. on the contrary, the moment stratasys acquired it, and we have more attention and more knowledge into additive manufacturing, they approach me proactively and want to look for collaboration and doing things together for the long term. so, we're in a good shape there. and you will see that our infrastructure will leverage covestro both on the material side but also on the hardware side because it's also a driver for hardware.
troy jensen -- lake street capital markets -- analyst
all right. perfect. good luck with that. so, my follow-up, i guess, on the new products, i'm always focused on origin and h350.
i guess my checks always indicate that origin is really doing extremely well for you guys. h350 may be a little bit more complex sale. i just want to get your thoughts on how those two products are meeting your expectations.
yoav zeif -- chief executive officer
we are, like you, monitoring it, but -- on a daily basis. good traction on both. there is a need in the market for those technologies, which is basic. and we have good technologies with very clear competitive edge in both of them.
both technologies are ramping up according to plan. of course, the ramp-up of origin is faster, very impressive and faster than saas because of the nature of the technology. it's technology that is easier to use when known in the industry where the high-speed sintering, the powder, the new powder, the future of powder is something quite new in our business. and we make sure that the ramp-up of saas, which meets our expectations and plans, is a big success.
so, we ensure that the adoption is being done in the right way and our customers are successful. so, it's controlling and it's going well.
troy jensen -- lake street capital markets -- analyst
keep up the good work, gentlemen.
operator
thank you. the next question is coming from brian drab of william blair. please go ahead.
tyler hutin -- william blair and company -- analyst
hi. this is tyler hutin on for brian. good morning. thanks for taking my question.
just want to start off with the usage rate of your manufacturing machines. and i know, obviously, there's macro headwinds that would play into this. but as the hardware -- as your installed base picks up and you get more usage out of these manufacturing machines, does that give you any more visibility into your gross margin target of 50%? and then i have a follow-up.
yoav zeif -- chief executive officer
i can answer. tyler, thank you for the question. we are monitoring the utilization of our system through the connectivity mainly through grabcad, and we have a good -- by the way, it's a great dataset for us to understand what's going on in the market. we are not sharing it, but i can give the high-level direction -- in terms of the high-level direction.
prototyping is more sensitive  or at least what we are seeing. prototyping is more sensitive to slowdown in terms of utilization. manufacturing is less sensitive. and overall, in terms of consumption of consumables manufacturing, because it's an ongoing operation, consumed in our, what we call unit economic model, between three to five times than a prototyping.
so, it's really a transformation in terms of our industry. and of course, it has an impact on the gross margin. i'll let eitan share it.
eitan zamir -- chief financial officer
yeah. the utilization of manufacturing materials will definitely have a positive impact on our gross margin. we expect to see this more in the coming quarters and years as manufacturing -- and production becomes more and more toward manufacturing. and as we said in the past, when manufacturing percentage of our total revenue will grow, that will have a positive impact on our gross margin.
tyler hutin -- william blair and company -- analyst
ok. thank you for that. and yeah, you had nice even sequential improvement in gross margin. i was just wondering if you could quantify kind of what the macro headwinds were from inflation and supply chain disruptions, the headwind going toward gross margin? thank you.
yoav zeif -- chief executive officer
eitan?
eitan zamir -- chief financial officer
sure. so, high level, as we mentioned, the net impact is a growth of -- from 48.2% to 48.5% year over year. but to your point, there were a more significant trends. one is higher revenue, had a positive impact on our gross margin.
we increased prices, which over the year from q3 2021 over the last year that had a positive impact on our gross margin. on the other hand, the cost and logistics had a negative impact of roughly 200 basis points, give or take. and we also have the positive impact of the exclusion of makerbot. it was only one month, only the month of september since the deal closed at the end of august, but that had a slightly positive impact on our gross margin.
these are the main items that impacted the gross margin trend.
tyler hutin -- william blair and company -- analyst
ok. thank you for all that and good luck going forward.
operator
thank you. the next question is coming from paul chung of j.p. morgan. please go ahead.
paul chung -- jpmorgan chase and company -- analyst
hi, thanks for taking my question. so just on the opex side, you had a minimal bump this year. can you talk about kind of the opex discipline you're driving here? and as we think about kind of the pace of opex growth maybe as a percentage of revenues next year, what do you think we should expect in what range? and what are some of the efficiencies you're kind of focused on next year?
eitan zamir -- chief financial officer
thank you. maybe i'll start with the mid to longer-term opex as a percentage. as we plan and this is, in a sense, pure math, but there is a detailed plan to get there. so, the pure math, if we plan to reach double-digit operating income within the next few years, and we plan to get 50% plus gross margin, that means that opex will have to go to 40 level and maybe a little bit even lower, right? so that's a journey.
and it is step-by-step improving -- continue to improving our scalability. if you will look on the last four, five, six quarters of opex as a percentage of revenue, you will see a continuing improvement. so, 0.5% or maybe up to 1% every quarter, improvement -- the improvement of opex as a percentage of revenue, down to a level of 45.8% that you see this quarter, this journey will continue. it will take a few years to get to the 40 levels.
but we believe that this is -- we will continue to see improvement as we continue in our journey and as the business scales.
paul chung -- jpmorgan chase and company -- analyst
great. that's super helpful. and then -- just a follow-up on the consumables purchases. can you, kind of, quantify how below trend they are? and how are the teams looking to kind of drive consumables higher in the coming quarters and into 2023? and you mentioned the benefits of kind of strong system sales over the years -- over the last couple of years.
so, how does that kind of play in? and talk about the initial successes you're seeing with the expansion of consumables and what materials are seeing nice momentum and your expectations for kind of a gross margin uplift as well. thank you.
yoav zeif -- chief executive officer
thank you for the question. we are optimistic about our consumable offering, and it will be a driver -- one of the drivers which will increase our gross margin over time. and we'll make sure that we are a company with a 50% -- above 50% gross margin and 10% operating income. so, this is an essential part in our five years plan.
in terms of the way we look at consumables, there is the long term and the short term. in the short term, we have challenges because of the slowdown and because of, as i shared the impact on prototyping, most of the main reasons for the results of the consumable in q3 were the fx, which has an impact of around $5.1 million only in this quarter, some supply chain rollbacks, challenges, both in production and supply chain and the makerbot divestiture, but we are coming back to growth in q4, and that's the short term. now, i'll take it to the long term. it is one of our growth drivers.
that's why we are investing in covestro. that's why we have an open material. we are leading the industry with our open material license. hybrid model, this is why we just introduced now 13 new materials in fdm that usually will take us between three to four years, and we did it in one shot, that's your perform, high-end materials for manufacturing.
and on top of it, there is this long-term impact we call it the life cycle impact. and what do we mean by the life cycle impact? this is the in and out of consumption of materials in this pool. look at it like the baby boomers that were born in '45 and then in 2010, they went to pension, and then you have a decline in their consumption because they went and started their pension period or retirement period. same here, you need to make sure that new hardware is getting in when [inaudible] out there, it's going out.
we are very optimistic because the model is working, and we will see growth going forward. but of course, the pool was not filled enough during the weak times of 2019 and 2020, especially the covid time. but we are optimistic, consumable is essential for us, and it will drive our gross margin higher. on top of this, we are -- and that's one of the reasons of covestro, but not -- the only one we are going to be disruptive with our material.
and a good example is our denture material as we are coming with a solution that we disrupt the market. we disrupt the market because it will have property that does not exist today in this market.
paul chung -- jpmorgan chase and company -- analyst
great. thank you so much.
operator
thank you. the next question is coming from wamsi mohan of bank of america. please go ahead.
wamsi mohan -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
yes, thank you so much. i know you're not providing an outlook here for 2023, but just given what your comments were about demand trajectory and macro caution and some customer deferrals. i was just thinking, is it reasonable to assume at this point in time normal seasonality for the first quarter off of your fourth quarter guidance, or should we be anticipating something that's either better than seasonal or worse than seasonal? and i have a follow-up question.
yoav zeif -- chief executive officer
thank you, wamsi. it's a bit too early to speak about q1 2023 and the entire year of 2023. i can say that we're very confident about our ability to grow, but we should be mindful of the situation in the global markets and the macroeconomics. so, providing a detailed forecast for 2023 will be -- it's too early for that.
but i think it's important to note, we truly believe that we are -- with our diversified portfolio and the technologies that we have, we have the ability to grow in 2023. it's only a matter of being more mindful of the situation, the uncertainty that is currently in the world. and the profitability in addition to the revenue growth, the profitability, this is something that is more within our control. we believe that we should be able to sustain profitability and even improve it based on the model that we've built.
wamsi mohan -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
ok. thank you for that. as my follow-up, the cash on your balance sheet, and i know you have a very strong liquidity position, but the cash went down about $93 million. can you talk about what all items bridge that because you've had divestitures and acquisitions in the quarter, and obviously, you're operating at elevated inventory levels? can you just walk us through what are the moving pieces that got you to that cash level? and as we think about cash burn rate, potentially in a weaker demand environment, how should we think about the quarterly run rate of cash burn as well? thank you.
yoav zeif -- chief executive officer
thank you, wamsi. so, cash flow, as a starting point, i would say that we started this journey with a significant cash balance with no debt, which is something that is one of our strengths, especially when we enter into this potential recession that puts us in a very, very good position to continue our journey and to continue to grow with that healthy cash position. with respect to the quarter -- and maybe a little bit some of the other questions that you raised. so, with respect to the quarter, this quarter, we paid for certain m&a, for certain transactions.
makerbot is the largest in this quarter we paid, and that's something that was announced in the last few quarters in certain press releases. as part of the investment in the new business with ultimaker, both companies invested, stratasys invested in this new company roughly $47 million. we also invested, as mentioned earlier on the call, in a few other businesses, which is roughly $10 million to $20 million that were invested in those smaller investments. and then, obviously, we have the operating cash flow that was 80 million.
and we have other smaller items that are more on the normal, kind of, level capex, and so on. that's basically the bridge that gets you to the roughly 90 million that were used this quarter. but the vast majority is m&a related, which is significant driver in our future and in our growth. with respect to the excess cash burn rate, and i would start with saying, if you look on the last few years, we had significant positive operating income -- sorry, positive operating cash flow in both 2020 and 2021.
the two years of covid, we generated roughly more than $60 million of positive operating cash flow combined, which reflects our ability or basically reflects the trend that our business generates positive cash flow. the trend that you see this quarter and for the last few quarters is something that is deliberately and managed by us. it is focused on increasing inventory to put us in a better position to supply the demand. we have a few new technologies, as you know, and altogether, we believe that we need the right level of inventory to support the demand, to better manage our gross margins in an optimized way.
i mentioned this, i believe, as an answer to one of the questions earlier. and that's basically the way we look at it. but on a normalized quarter, our business generates operating cash flow that's important to some extent.
wamsi mohan -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
ok. thank you so much.
operator
thank you. the next question is coming from ananda baruah of loop capital. please go ahead.
ananda baruah -- loop capital markets -- analyst
yeah. good morning, guys. thanks for taking the -- i guess, good afternoon for you and good morning to us. thanks for taking the question here.
two, if i could. yoav, just going back to one of your earlier comments, sounds like you think manufacturing holds it better than prototyping going through macro here. do you think that -- inside of manufacturing, do you think it's consumables or equipment sales that would hold up better inside the manufacturing? and then i just have a quick follow-up. thanks.
yoav zeif -- chief executive officer
good morning, ananda. thank you for the question. yes, manufacturing is less sensitive because it become more critical for your customer. and, of course, number one is consumables because they need to produce and only then hardware.
so, the moment they adopt the new technology, although is important, but still more sensitive than consumables to economic pressure. but overall, we are -- have been doubled the addressable market, and we have every month, every week, a greater position in manufacturing. that's what make us so resilient. and we are optimistic because we see that our customers are willing to explore and to take this journey with us.
ananda baruah -- loop capital markets -- analyst
yeah, that's helpful. i mean it's actually going to be interesting as well. i won't go into diet track, but it will be interesting to see sort of the contribution from the newer technology can allow you to grow through '23 if macro really is persistent. i think we're all looking forward to finding that out with you.
just a quick follow-up is on services revenue. how is that -- so if macro becomes very persistent as we go through 2023, how sticky is that customer support? like what's really the driver? it's sort of at this $50 million level a quarter. is this the right way to think about it regardless of what happens with a macro? just context there. and that's it for me.
thanks a lot.
yoav zeif -- chief executive officer
thank you, ananda. remember, in our model, materials and service are lagging after hardware, and the most important driver to value our performance is hardware. if you don't have the box or the machine at the customer's place, you will not consume materials and you will not pay for service, a very simple equation. and when you look at it -- the fact that we transformed the ratio of hardware within our sales, and you see quarter over quarter over quarter for the last 10 quarters, we are increasing the sales of hardware means that we are good with service because service is being driven by hardware.
that's the bottom line. that's the model.
ananda baruah -- loop capital markets -- analyst
and if equipment takes a little bit of a hit from a few quarters from macro in 2023, it would seem -- what you just said would seem to suggest the installed base of the hardware could still support current service levels, current support levels. would that be accurate?
yoav zeif -- chief executive officer
accurate. it's not the marginal that drives it. it's the installed base, it's overall hardware in the pool.
ananda baruah -- loop capital markets -- analyst
understood. awesome. thanks a lot. appreciate it.
operator
thank you. the next question is coming from jim ricchiuti of needham and company. please go ahead.
jim ricchiuti -- needham and company -- analyst
thank you. hello, yoav, and eitan. wanted to go back to a comment you made about consumables, if i heard you correctly, growing in q4. what i'm trying to do is reconcile that comment.
what you're suggesting, i think, is continued challenging demand in prototyping. are you anticipating just an acceleration in manufacturing-related consumables revenue? and -- or maybe is pricing playing a role in this?
eitan zamir -- chief financial officer
thank you, jim, for the question. it's a process, and it's not in one or two quarters. we look at this more holistically. we look on the next quarter but also into 2023.
when we think about the new technologies, and yoav related to this earlier about the lag period and the model, the -- what we call the baby boom model, that we believe is very similar here. that's something that will take a few more quarters to be reflected on our financials. that's one of the growth engines or the reason we believe that consumable will grow in the next quarter, starting q4. we do raise prices.
i mentioned this earlier, we did this a few times during the last year, and we will continue to do that. so that's another element. taking into account the covestro acquisition, that's something that will have a significant impact on our consumables and on our business, as yoav mentioned, not only the business that was acquired, but also the existing business and the other technologies that can benefit from that acquisition. when we take all this into account, we have a confidence about our ability to grow consumables.
it might be a small or limited growth in q4. but as we enter into 2023, we believe that we'll be able to see more significantly a considerable growth.
jim ricchiuti -- needham and company -- analyst
thank you. my follow-up is just on that $13 million of customer-related delays, how much of that was in q3 versus q4? and when you describe them as delays, the presumption is that these orders will come back in the next one to two quarters. is that the case, or is there the risk that these longer sales cycles result in rolling delays as we think about the business over the next quarter or so?
eitan zamir -- chief financial officer
all right. so, jim, maybe as a start, i would say that the $13 million that you related to fx is also part of it. so, the headwinds that we see on the fx side are higher than the ones that were known three months ago, last time we spoke. so that's one of the elements within the $13 million.
that's one comment. second, that reduction reflects the uncertainty that currently exist in the market. this is the estimate that we put into our q4 guidance, but it's hard to say exactly how much it will actually be. however, we do consider this as a delay.
so, it may be pushed into q1 2023, that at least our expectation.
jim ricchiuti -- needham and company -- analyst
got it. thank you.
operator
thank you. the next question is coming from noelle dilts of stifel. please go ahead.
noelle dilts -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
hi. thanks. a lot of my questions have been answered. so, i just have one, but it's kind of multipart.
so, one, i was hoping you could just expand on how you're thinking about acquisitions in the current -- in the weaker macro environment? are you a little bit more cautious given the economic headwinds, or do you think you might maybe accelerate some m&a just given that there may be assets out there that are attractively priced?and i guess the second part of this is, just it feels like they're we're in a period where, given where the group is trading, you could see some consolidation, whether that's across kind of the public companies or fields similar to what we saw with nikon and slm. so, if you could just give me some thoughts on how you're thinking about the potential for consolidation? that would be great. thank you.
yoav zeif -- chief executive officer
thank you. thanks for the question. we are in a great position in terms of our balance sheet to be deconsolidated of this industry. for two main reasons.
one is the balance sheet position. but the other one is that in tough times and in macroeconomic challenges or slowdown, it's also an opportunity. it's an opportunity because it's differentiating the strong player with strong infrastructure that can stand and win versus others that have more challenges. and i think that's a good opportunity just to share three factors that will make sure that we are the one that will capture the additive manufacturing opportunity in mass production because we are in the best position, both financially in terms of the infrastructure, in terms of the offering.
and i want to relate to three very important factors. one is our foundation as a company. the second one is the fact that we have the most resilient business, as reflected in our profitability within the industry, and the third one is a promising future that we have and the leading position in attractive use cases. i'll go one by one because it has implication to our position as the consolidator.
the first one is the foundation. we are laser-focused. we are going for polymer manufacturing, and we focus on the largest profit pool in this industry with differentiated technologies. we don't have even one machine that is a commodity, which is very unique, and it is reflected in our gross margin because if you are not differentiated, you have low gross margin.
this is the name of the game. the other things in our fundamental is those five leading technology with those -- with clear competitive edge, put us in a position in front of the customer, where we are not selling a machine, we are solving the customer product plan because we are agnostic between technologies. we can offer our customers what he really needs to be successful. the third thing in our foundation is the full solution of hardware, software, material, services, with clear synergies across there because if you are with stratasys, you are using the same software, you are using the same material.
you have the same application engineer that you are facing. it's quite significant advantage. and we do it for use cases. those are our growth engine.
we have a very strong growth engine, where we focus on manufacturing use cases, supported by the best go-to-market our industry in terms of the network and the largest installed base that is happy to work with us and to have repeated sales. but we cannot do it if we wouldn't have a resilient business model, practically the most resilient business model in our industry because we are having continuous growth all over geographies, verticals, technologies, and we are driving this weak hardware, which will carry software, which will carry material in which we carry service we did. we have the leading gross margin, as i said before. that's resiliency because it means that we have resources to invest, and it's a reflection of our customers' appreciation to our value proposition.
they are willing to pay. that's why we have this high gross margin. when you are with limited differentiation, you will have lower gross margin. and that's what we see around that.
and last but not least, in terms of the resiliency of our business model is the fact that we are the most diversified company, both in terms of geographies, technologies, customers. we, by definition, do not have customers where we have high dependency. we don't have any material dependency on two or three or five customers which puts us in a very good position in hard economic times. and then, the third factor is about our promising future.
we build the foundation. we have a resilient model. and then, when you go out there, and build your future, it's all about focusing on the most attractive use cases. we have the broadest polymer manufacturing offering for use cases, in automotive and aerospace, like jigs and fixtures with proven results.
we have now -- we built it over the last three years, the most extensive offering and technologies and disruptive one, in dental, and you will see it in the near future, like the denture solution that we are going to launch. we have a unique position in medical and the material really differentiate us because we will have already the largest material portfolio in polymer manufacturing with this hybrid model that will secure our gross margin for many years. combine this with a unique software offering and mainly with a team that has a spirit and culture, which is above and beyond, otherwise, we wouldn't be able to cope with those challenges. and that put us in a situation where, i believe, we will be the first additive manufacturing company that will pass the 1 billion scale milestone, i call it, with the 50% and above gross margin and 10% operating income.
so that puts us back to your question in a great position to consolidate the industry.

i will now turn the call over to our chief executive officer, dr. yoav zeif. yoav? 
yoav zeif -- chief executive officer
thank you, yonah. good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us. our results this quarter demonstrate the ongoing solid business performance and fiscal health of stratasys. we delivered our highest third quarter revenue in seven years, as well as five consecutive quarters of positive earnings, demonstrating our unique capabilities to generate profitable growth, and we believe we can continue generating sustained operating profitability for the foreseeable future, assuming no further material deterioration of the broader economic environment.
it is a compelling time to be a leader in 3d printing. in fact, many of the challenges facing our target industries today, are the same factors that ultimately justify accelerating the transition from traditional to additive manufacturing. this includes the ability to adapt rapidly and cost effectively to logistics bottlenecks, higher transportation costs, new sustainability requirements and faster product innovation times. stratasys continues to expand our customer reach across our technologies and our vision of the future of additive manufacturing is more robust than ever.
we continue to have strong engagement with both our installed base and new customers for our leading fdm and polyjet offering, as well as our three newer technologies. however, the opportunities that we have, also come with some obstacles in the current macro space. customers are facing challenges today that are impacting their purchasing behavior. the market has slowed, resulting in longer sales cycles and occasional deferral of orders.
to that point, we remain laser-focused on controlling what we can to be best positioned to effectively execute sustained profitable growth. importantly, we have a broad global diverse set of offerings across a multitude of systems and materials. the steady contributions from our organic technologies and the incremental revenues from our new technologies enable us to deliver consistent growth with improving margins. we also enhanced our results through a relentless focus on costs.
we are tightly managing our cost structure as evidenced by the ongoing improved efficiency in our opex spending, reflected in the year-over-year 130 basis points improvement this quarter in opex as a percentage of revenue. we expect to continue finding efficiencies in the business to further demonstrate the resiliency of our model. as a reminder, our main oem business is to deliver polymer-based 3d printing solutions through hardware, materials, software, and services, with a focus on shifting more of our revenues from prototyping to manufacturing. revenue in our oem business, this quarter, was up approximately 10% year over year at constant currency.
overall, revenues were up 7.8%, excluding divestitures and on a constant-currency basis, driven by our highest third quarter system revenue in six years, which grew 18.9% adjusted for fx and divestiture compared to the third quarter of 2021. we believe that the contribution from our new technologies, saas, p3, and neo, has more than doubled our addressable market and opened up new use cases and opportunities to replace traditional manufacturing across verticals. we are expanding and improving our line of fdm systems and materials, as well as starting to see the positive progress on p3 and saas, our more recently launched mass production solution. fdm delivered solid growth this quarter and is still the largest technology in 3d printing today.
a recent proof point of the continued demand for fdm is a repeat sale this third quarter to a global automotive oem for more of our industrial manufacturing grade f900 system. furthermore, to fund additional growth, we ended the quarter with a strong balance sheet that includes no debt -- this continues to support our growth through organic investments, as well as accretive acquisition opportunities that we uncover, including early stage but highly compelling technology-driven businesses that we believe will contribute to our growth by leveraging our infrastructure. now, let me turn to some of the exciting achievements and milestones reached since the end of the first half of 2022. we believe that a comprehensive materials offering that competes with and even improves on traditional manufacturing is key for taking 3d printing into true production applications.
we are very excited to update you about our progress on this material journey across all of our technologies. in august, we agreed to acquire covestro's additive manufacturing materials business, which includes r&d facilities and activities, global development and sales teams across europe, the u.s., china, a portfolio of 60 additive manufacturing materials, and an extensive ip portfolio. with hundreds of patents and patents pending, covestro is an example of a business we believe can thrive as it leverages our infrastructure and relationships. it has been an important part of our third-party materials ecosystem, as we are already a distributor of their somos resins that are available for use in our neo and origin one 3d printers.
adding this business to the stratasys portfolio provides us ability to offer more complete solutions to customers, accelerate next-generation material development and expand our already differentiated materials offering in terms of lithography, dlp resins, and powders. closing remains on track for the end of the first quarter of 2023 and is expected to be immediately accretive. for fdm, we announced availability of 13 new validated materials and our open am software. this includes several materials from covestro and partners like victrex and kimya, it also includes several existing materials now available in new colors.
for materials like ultem 9085 thermoplastic, this is significant, because it makes it easier for our customers to use 3d printed production parts in more customer-facing applications, where static matters such as in commercial aircraft and train and car interiors. these 13 materials represent a tremendous acceleration in the pace of new materials innovation for fdm, opening up new applications far faster than ever before. we also introduced two new validated industrial materials for the origin one printer in the quarter. p3 stretch 475 is a new resin from our partner, henkel loctite that adds a softer elastomer to our portfolio, which our customers have requested.
for example, we have a large automotive customer that has been using the material for end-use door seals. in addition, we introduced p3 deflect 120, which is our first validated material for evonik. p3 deflect 120 is designed to stay strong at high temperatures ideal for applications like molds in manufacturing. we are also excited to have reached key milestones in the dental industry which is the largest manufacturing target market in 3d printing today in terms of the amount of materials consumed, and it continues to grow.
i'm happy to share that stratasys has recently received fda 510(k) approval of a new revolutionary resin for our j5 dentajet that we believe will be a disruptive growth driver for us in the dental industry. 3d printing of dental is particularly exciting as it is only in its ground floor stage. it is a $5 billion addressable market today and growing, and we plan to take a meaningful share over time. we are currently working with several leading industry partners to prepare for its commercialization and look forward to officially launching the solution at lmt lab day in chicago at the end of this coming february.
this is a great example of how we are expanding the polyjet end market universe, and believe that it has a promising future for non-prototype and use parts in medical, dental, and fashion applications. in addition to these strategic initiatives, we invested in one company and acquired another that will enhance our capabilities in the area of artificial intelligence for 3d printing. both reflect our strategic plan to incubate innovative technologies by bringing them under our umbrella, cultivating their advancement, and positioning them to contribute to our overall long-term growth, and both will be available to our customers in 2023. first, we invested $10 million out of $15 million raised by medtech start-up, axial3d.
axial3d ai-powered cloud-based 3d printing platform enables healthcare providers to easily segment ct and mri scans for anatomic models at a fraction of the cost and time of other solutions. 3d printed model created with our digital anatomy and j5 medijet systems are used for pre-surgical planning in many leading hospitals to improve surgery success rates and patient recovery time. we are now working with axial3d on a joint offering that we believe will remove barriers to entry for the majority of hospitals in many of our key markets, allowing our solution to truly become a standard part of patient care. we look forward to sharing more at the upcoming rsna trade show later this year.
second, we acquired riven, a cloud-based software company for additive manufacturing. we know riven well, having watched them grow as one of our connectivity partners. their cloud-based solution will be fully integrated into our grabcad additive manufacturing platform. riven technology helps customers weekly inspect, diagnose, and automatically correct deviations between cad5 and actual printed parts within a closed-loop additive manufacturing process.
this means -- every step in the process is interconnected from inspection to diagnosis to correction. the latest version in testing uses artificial intelligence to actually predict and readjust model changes in advance. the result is more accurate production runs in much less time, weeks or even months of potential improvement, and at a lower cost; key areas for focus for the manufacturing industry. these are just two examples of companies joining our platform that we believe will help drive our innovation vision forward.
to sum up, we are laying meaningful foundation for further growth, and we are proud of the expansion of our capabilities this quarter through new technologies and materials that will drive our industry leadership for the long term. i will now turn the call over to our cfo, eitan zamir, to share the financial results and update our outlook for the rest of 2022. eitan?

thank you, yoav, and good morning, everyone. we achieved solid results against an increasingly challenging backdrop in the quarter. and as we've shared, growth within our oem business was even stronger, up almost 10% and on a constant currency as compared to the third quarter of 2021. we are particularly proud of the improvement in opex as a percent of revenue, which shows the progress that we are making on driving efficiencies across the platform.
in general, our results demonstrate the resilience our diversified offering provides. now, let me dive deeper into the numbers. for the third quarter, consolidated revenue of $162.2 million was up 2%, and revenue adjusted for divestitures and at constant currency was up 7.8% from the prior-year period. product revenue in the third quarter rose by 3% and to $112.1 million compared to the same period last year or by 10.5%, excluding divestitures and on a constant-currency basis.
within product revenue, system revenue grew by 7.7% to $56.3 million compared to the same period last year, and increased by 18.9%, excluding divestitures, and on a constant-currency basis. consumable revenue declined by 1.4% to $55.8 million compared to the same period last year, but grew by 3.4%, excluding divestitures, and on a constant-currency basis. aside from fx and makerbot, consumable spending was impacted by the general slowdown in the market, especially for materials used for p3. additionally, there is a natural lead time between hardware purchases and consumables.
and given the lower hardware sales for the five years prior to 2021, it takes time for our installed base to drive sales back to the level before that time period. the good news is now that hardware sales have been growing again, we expect consumables to grow steadily beginning next quarter and beyond. service revenue was $50.1 million, down 4.1% as compared to the same period last year, and up by 2.1%, excluding divestitures on a constant-currency basis. within service revenue, customer support revenue grew 4.7% compared to the same period last year, and increased by 9% on a constant-currency basis.
now turning to gross margin, gaap gross margin was 43.6% for the quarter, compared to 42.9% for the same period last year. non-gaap gross margin was 48.5% for the quarter, compared to 48.2% for the same period last year. gross margins benefited from operational efficiencies and the divestment of makerbot during the quarter partially offset by the fx impact. gaap operating expenses were $86.4 million, compared to $90.1 million during the same period last year.
non-gaap operating expenses were $74.2 million, compared to $74.9 million during the same period last year. non-gaap operating expenses were 45.8% of revenue for the quarter, compared to 47.1% for the same period last year, as we continue to focus on operational efficiency improvement. last quarter, we noted that the incremental revenue came with an implied cost of only 25%, an improvement from 35% in the q1 period. this quarter, we are pleased to note an improved efficiency of our model, where the additional operating expenses were actually negative instead of the historical range in the mid-to-high 40%, clearly a driver of the improved margin profile.
regarding our consolidated earnings, operating loss for the quarter was $15.6 million, compared to a loss of $21.9 million for the same period last year. non-gaap operating income for the quarter was $4.5 million, compared to $1.8 million for the same period last year. the increase reflects our business scalability and improves operational efficiency which once again resulted in gross margin growth and lower operating expenses. gaap net income for the quarter was $18.7 million or $0.28 per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $18.1 million or $0.28 per diluted share for the same period last year.
gaap net income included $39.1 million gain from the deconsolidation of makerbot. non-gaap net income for the quarter was $3.3 million, or $0.05 per diluted share, compared to a net income of $0.5 million or $0.01 per diluted share in the same period last year. adjusted ebitda of $9.9 million compared to $7.8 million in the same period last year reflected our improved profitability level. we used $18.4 million of cash in our operations during the third quarter, compared to generating $3 million of cash from operations in the same quarter last year.
the use of cash was primarily driven by deliberately increased inventory purchases. we ended the quarter with $349 million in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term deposits compared to $441.5 million at the end of the second quarter of 2022. during the quarter, we used cash to make investments in companies that we believe will help further advance our strategic goal. our balance sheet and cash generation profile remain strong, and we are well-funded and well-positioned to capitalize on value-enhancing market opportunities as they are identified.
now, let me turn to our outlook for 2022. i would note that our guidance now excludes any further contributions from makerbot as the merger with ultimaker is now closed. as yoav described earlier, market conditions have become more challenging since our last update, and currency exchange rates continue to pressure the business. we believe this challenging backdrop will continue for the balance of the year and well into next, primarily affecting our prototyping business.
the impacts include delayed purchases of systems and materials, longer sales cycle, and overall inflationary and recessionary concerns reflected in buyers' behavior. given our year-to-date results and current visibility of our end market, we are updating our full year revenue guidance as follows. our previous guidance was provided before the makerbot divestiture closed. makerbot divestiture reduces our guidance by $17 million, bringing us to $658 million to $668 million.
in addition to makerbot divestiture, we are further updating our guidance to $648 million to $652 million as we are impacted by delays in purchasing activities by our customers and continuing fx challenges. the new guidance represents approximately 10% full year growth over 2021 after adjusting for the makerbot divestiture. from a gross margin perspective, we continue to expect full year 2022 to be flat to slightly higher as compared to 2021. as a reminder, we expect our margins to get back over 50% and once the current macro headwinds pass.
in 2022, we now expect our operating expenses to be approximately $5 million to $10 million higher than 2021. this improvement from previous guidance is primarily due to the impact of the makerbot divestiture and improved opex efficiency. we continue to expect non-gaap operating margins to be slightly above 2% for the full year. longer term, we expect non-gaap operating margin to achieve double-digit as our growth plan unfolds.
we now anticipate a gaap net loss of $48 million to $39 million or $0.72 to $0.59 per diluted share and non-gaap net income to $6 million to $8 million or $0.09 to $0.12 per diluted share. adjusted ebitda is now expected to be in the range of $34 million to $37 million down from $38 million to $41 million. capital expenditures are now expected to range between $15 million to $20 million, down from $20 million to $25 million. we're encouraged by the level of engagement with our customers and remain confident in our growth potential, and we will continue to monitor global issues that can have an impact.
with that, let me turn the call back over to yoav for closing remarks. yoav?
yoav zeif -- chief executive officer
thank you, eitan. the challenges our customers and our business face today, in many ways, highlight the benefits of additive manufacturing going forward, resulting in confidence for the years ahead even as we navigate the current environment. with our robust balance sheet, we continue to invest in an expanded portfolio of hardware, materials, and software solutions that should allow us to meaningfully increase our set of applications to capture a wider range of customers, a development and adoption of 3d printing growth, and we drive additive manufacturing to scale. i want to thank our global teams for rising to the challenge and helping drive continued profitability as our business continues to grow.
the relentless focus on execution and investment for growth and ongoing profitability today is expected to drive outperformance and create long-term shareholder value. with that, let's open it up for questions. operator?
