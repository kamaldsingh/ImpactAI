ann-sofie nordh
before we move into the q&a so i just would like to say that i understand that the operator had some technical issues while sending the pre-recording and just reach out to us in ir to fill out any blanks. and also, the recording will be available on its full on our website. so you can also go and listen in there later on. but now we move into the first question, and that will come from martin wilkie at citi.
please go ahead.
martin wilkie -- citi
thank you, and good morning. it's martin from citi. the first question would be just to clarify on your growth outlook for the year. you commented, firstly, that the market should grow a cagr of 5.1% through 2023, but you commented, i think we shouldn't compare that to your 3% to 5% growth target.
so i just wanted to clarify first, exactly what you mean by that. i think secondly, just on the growth for the year. you've commented it should be in line with your midterm target. so is that in line with the 3% to 5% or in line with this 5.1% market growth? thank you.
bjorn rosengren -- chief executive officer
thank you, martin. i think i'll take that one. yes. i mean, what you've seen during the year is that we're slowly getting recovery.
and during the quarter, we saw actually flat orders and flat revenues. moving into next year, of course, we will see a kick back in the markets, which we're looking forward to. and what we're seeing in that guidance here that that the market short-term might be a little bit higher than over a business cycle, which we said in our long-term targets. and what we are saying here that even though we have strong focus on financial performance, getting the ebita to the right level, 2023, we are definitely going to grow in line with the markets.
and maybe even exceed if we are -- things moving. but that's our objective so -- on the growth part. so what i think you referred also second question was a little bit this three to five targets. what we're saying a little bit here is that in the end markets where we are and what we expect to do, including m&a, we should be around three to five, but that's over business cycle.
so that means both in ups and downs. and we said actually during the capital markets day that we expect the markets to grow. of course, no one knows yet, but to be 5% during -- until 2023 because of the dip. and then, we said, of course, we will meet that.
so that's a little bit what we say. i hope that explains it, martin.
martin wilkie -- citi
yes, it does. yes. that's very helpful. thanks.
bjorn rosengren -- chief executive officer
sure.
martin wilkie -- citi
and then, one follow-up on that, you pointed automotive is in the gray part of the bar, negative 5% to 15%. i would say a few other companies, both in robotics and automation over the past few weeks have been a bit more constructive on automotive. so i just wondered why you thought that was going to be still quite negative for the next three to six months?
bjorn rosengren -- chief executive officer
yes. it's correct that we've seen automotive kicking back in many parts. on the other hand, there is a lot of expectation. when you look at the -- fully coming back to this $90 million part, it's not 2021, as we have seen it.
it will take a little bit longer. on the other hand, there is a transformation also toward more electric vehicles, which will do there. so from our perspective and what we -- the one who's looking into the future of the automotive industry that, yes, this transformation toward e-vehicles might keep people back a little bit from making that full investment so we are saying that we believe that that would have some kind of impact. if you're looking at how the automotive industry impacts us is mostly in the robotic business.
and that's been a very challenging year for the robotics. on the other hand, that has come back somewhat. on the other hand, we are focusing more on other segments than those turnkey solutions where there is low abb content within. so we see good opportunities in many other industry, and that's really where the big focus is today.
logistics, general industry, electronics and just give you an indication on that part. in china, on the robot and squeeze automation, we saw a 90% increase during the quarter. so there are a lot of opportunities in other segments for us.
martin wilkie -- citi
ok, thank you very much.
bjorn rosengren -- chief executive officer
yes.
timo ihamuotila -- chief financial officer
can i just comment, martin, just a quick comment for everybody's benefit, i presume you are referring to the slide where it says three- to six-month view. just to clarify that we are talking about here, three- to six-month view, where we still have quite a bit of covid impact expected in europe and u.s. so this is not like a full-year thing.
bjorn rosengren -- chief executive officer
yes. so if you look at the full year, it might be a little bit more optimistic.
martin wilkie -- citi
great. thank you very much.
ann-sofie nordh
thank you. and we move on to the next quesiton and that will be from shane mckenna at barclays. please go ahead, shane.
shane mckenna -- barclays -- analyst
good morning, bjorn, timo and ann-sofie. just wondered if you could elaborate a bit more on the restructuring actions taken in ia or i should say, process automation? and how much of the total group restructuring you guided for '21 of $200 million is going to be specific for this division. and then, i see you've made some comments on the timeline for the sales spin of turbo. as this business moves out, where do you see the white spaces in ia to plug the margin gap from etex.
and then, i'll squeeze one final one in. how long should we expect this drag from lower-margin system solution order in robotics & discrete automation to continue into 2021? thanks.
bjorn rosengren -- chief executive officer
thank you very much. let me start to elaborate a little bit on my favorite subject, the process automation or early call industrial automation. i mean, to understand where we are on that business, you need really to dig into the details, and that's quite enjoyable from my side. in those numbers, there is -- first, if you look at the underlying performance of these businesses, it's about 10% margin.
so what you're seeing in the numbers, that includes the kusile settlement and then another project in india, an old one, which has been cleaned out, actually. so that is some part. but when you look at the pa, there are a number of let's say, divisions that are being challenged, mainly on the service business. and this is, from my perspective, very unusual.
the cruising industry is standing still and no shifts, and we're talking about hundreds of cruising ships, which is full with our solutions, in is not operating, then, of course, you do much less service. also in some power plant markets, where we have turbocompressors in tourist areas, which has been standing still, this is very unusual. so the service business is quite dramatically down compared to the -- actually the product and solution sales. and that is giving a very negative mix.
these installations are not going to disappear. they are out there. and as soon as things are opening up from covid and restrictions are getting down. this business will kick back.
so we feel very optimistic about that. more challenging side, i think, from the industrial automation, it is some of those segments, oil and gas, as well as conventional power generation. and there, we're taking big actions to restructure ourselves. so we will be in line with the demand that are expecting.
it will take a little bit longer to kick back on that. so there is a lot of actions that have been done and is being done during this period. we will expect a coming back, a good coming back in margin during 2021. we feel quite comfortable about that, especially when the service is kicking back.
on the robotics side, yes, we've been -- i mean, the margins there is embarrassing low. if you look at where robot should be. and we have been very clear to that that's the 15% market when we come to 2021. that's the levels where they need to be.
so yes, we have, in our orders on hand. during this quarter, some deliveries of what we call these turnkey solution with low abb content, which have low margin, which is affected. this will be some of that in q1 and then you will gradually see improving margin because we have pretty good control over our margins of the big orders that we have received during these periods. so in q2, q3 and q4, you see the gradual improvement of that part and you should be -- see also a good kick back in margin for this business during '21.
i hope that explains it. i think, timo, you wanted to add on a little bit there.
timo ihamuotila -- chief financial officer
maybe i'll just drop in a couple of numbers here. so shane, on the restructuring, where we say $200 million for the year. so you can look at it in a way that -- bit less than $100 million is in ia-related and a bit less than $100 million is in geis type of related and rest is sort of corporate and other business areas ballpark. and then, i think what bjorn meant was that the market is 15%, 2023, when we said we will be well within the margin range at our capital markets for the robotics business.
so just throw that one in there as well.
bjorn rosengren -- chief executive officer
i appreciate the correction, timo.
shane mckenna -- barclays -- analyst
thanks a lot.
ann-sofie nordh
thank you, shane. and now we open up for the next question, which will come from guillermo at ubs. your line is open now, guillermo.
guillermo peigneux-lojo -- ubs -- analyst
thank you. good morning, ann-sofie, bjorn, timo. i wanted to ask a question on robotics and automation, maybe adding short-cycle exposures at abb. and i guess, obviously, they are virgin trains now in china, europe and americas, and i wanted to focus on china.
first, how was china doing through the quarter? what kind of shape of growth you saw on basically month-to-month basis? and what would you think the environment is at q1 stage for the visibility you do have at the moment? and then, in europe, obviously, germany, also on, i would say, sequential flat or, if i take comments in the right way, but how did it evolve through the quarter? and what would you think about the sequential development, i guess, in q1? thank you.
bjorn rosengren -- chief executive officer
thank you, guillermo. yeah, let's start with robotics in china is, as i mentioned before there, it was quite -- actually, robotic part was actually 95% improvement compared to last year. so it's quite dramatic. we have a strong robot position in that market.
and of course, a lot of good orders from the electronic industry, which has helped us great there. so i think the whole -- i think the whole year has -- or let's say, the last half year has been gradually improving on the chinese market. and you saw also our robotics side now was actually, if you put back our robotics & discrete automation, if you put back the $50 million adjustment in orders is actually flat, compared to the year before or 2% improvement actually from previous years. so finally, we are moving into the right direction.
europe is trailing a little bit, i would say. and germany is an important market there, and it's quite heavy lockdown at the moment. so we feel that there are effects from that. on the u.s.
market, on robotics, we are not that strong. we have quite a weak market share and a lot to be done there. so we're not really benefiting from big kick back there in the automotive industry in the north american market. but i think the important thing from robotics for the year, we've done a great job during the year to put that business in relation to the demand in the market.
we spent more on r&d than we've done ever before. and we are actually launching a whole new range of collaborative robots during the first quarter now in february, where we are quite excited about. so i think, robot, my belief is that robots will be a good contributor going forward.
guillermo peigneux-lojo -- ubs -- analyst
thank you. and if i may follow up on robotics again. on the china, you planned. could i have basically a full stick on how is that developed and the ramp-up a bit? thank you.
bjorn rosengren -- chief executive officer
yeah. just on the factory there, i mean, the factory construction is going on. and we -- from the beginning, we had an objective to have ready in 2021. but i think it's rather be 2022, that it will be finished.
and it will be the world's largest most modern robotic factory in the world. so that's going to be a good support to the chinese market, which is really doing well at the moment for us.
guillermo peigneux-lojo -- ubs -- analyst
thank you so much.
bjorn rosengren -- chief executive officer
thank you.
ann-sofie nordh
and the next question will come from mattias holmberg at dnb. your line should be open, mattias.
mattias holmberg -- dnb markets -- analyst
thank you, and thanks for the time. i'm sorry to get back to this, but i still don't fully understand the 2021 guidance when you say you expect the comparable revenue growth to be in line with the target, which i then interpret as 3% to 5%. you also say that you expect the market to grow above 5% in 2023. so is this that you expect to grow less than the market in 2021? or is it that you anticipate growth to be back-end loaded, so less than 5% in 2021 and above 5% market growth in '22 and '23?
bjorn rosengren -- chief executive officer
i've been trying to make myself clear, but let's give timo a chance if he's a little bit clear than i am.
timo ihamuotila -- chief financial officer
all right. yes. thanks, matthias. so as we are saying, the visibility to the short-term part of the market is not exactly stellar at the moment.
we can all understand that. and in our case, especially, as bjorn said, it depends quite a bit also on how the service business is coming back. so we are saying that at the moment because we are saying this 3% to 5% range. we expect the growth to be at this point in time for 2021, slightly lower than the five-year -- 5% for the three-year period, i.e., a little bit lower growth now in the beginning and then picking up later.
of course, as bjorn also said, if we see a better market this year, we are expecting to grow with the market or better. so it could be better as well. and that's why we say also broadly in line. so i don't think these are in contradiction, but that's our expectation now going into the year with this visibility.
mattias holmberg -- dnb markets -- analyst
that's clear. and one more. beyond the support you expect from volume recovery, can you elaborate a bit on the most important items that you believe will drive the margin expansion year over year in 2021?
bjorn rosengren -- chief executive officer
yes. i can do a little bit on that. i mean, this is, of course, the big focus and the whole setup and the foundation that we have been building during this year. and i think that's gone really smooth actually.
we have the new setup that decentralized with the businesses with full accountability. we introduced a scorecard system, which is a performance management. there are thousands of activities out in the different businesses that is actually driving continuous improvements in the businesses. we take, as you see, in a lot of restructuring costs also during this quarter and this year.
and then, of course, our operations is getting a better fit going forward. so this is everything from pruning portfolio to closing factories, which we are doing in many parts of the world, as well as improving pricing and other activities. so we are driving them. and then, we think that the targets that we have set up, we are, of course, fully committed to them.
and i think it's important, from our perspective, that you will be clearly seeing an improvement in the right direction starting 2021. so coming from a challenging year, we're looking forward to an exciting 2021 for abb.
mattias holmberg -- dnb markets -- analyst
thank you so much.
ann-sofie nordh
thank you. and then, we follow up with a question from ben uglow at morgan stanley. please, ben, you on the line?
ben uglow -- morgan stanley -- analyst
yes, i a.m. good morning, everyone, and hope everybody is safe and well. so apologies for laboring the point on robotics. but i wanted to understand exactly how the team are thinking about it in terms of direction.
if i look at the information that was given at the capital markets event in february. if i simplify it, the overall market -- addressable market for robotics was quoted at just under $20 billion, of which roughly 20%, $3 billion or so was basically ev and the ice portion going down, am i correct in assuming that what you guys think is that the addressable market overall for auto, robots would come down. ev grows, but ice comes down more. so that's the first part of the question.
the second part is, if that's around half of what you do in the division, is your assumption that you can kind of offset that with electronics in the general industry. is that the right way of thinking about it?
bjorn rosengren -- chief executive officer
well, ben, that's pretty detailed. when we look at the automotive industry, we're saying that the ev part of that business is increasing gradually, it's going to be doing -- there, we have, of course, a very strong position in most of these installations that are coming. so i think that will support us toward the -- to the automotive industry. what we have done, which i tried to be clear, is that we take a little bit more cautious look on the automotive when it comes to this turnkey solution, where we have very few.
so that's holding it down. so we, of course, see good opportunities in other segments, which is actually moving quite dramatically. and we believe that that will compensate for the lower sales within automotive industry. so yes, we are quite optimistic on that.
but it's a combination here that the margin on that low automotive side will be compensated with a higher-margin business from other segments. that's the importance. and that's how we're going to get back to the margin corridor also for the robotics. so i don't know if i was clear enough there.
but i'd be happy to give you a little bit more from sami there. we can connect you a little bit there into the details on the automotive side.
ben uglow -- morgan stanley -- analyst
no. thank you. i understand directionally how you guys are thinking. and one follow-up for timo.
timo, i wanted to make sure i properly understood exactly what you guys are communicating on the cash flow. in the press release, the point that's made in the cash flow section is that ex the sort of one-off effects this year, your continuing cash flow as i understand it would have been $550 million higher. so just doing sort of back of the envelope basic math. if i take the $1.875 million of continuing cash flow and add back the $550 million.
on a pro forma basis, am i correct to assume that our sort of starting point for cash flow this year is about $2.4 million, $2.5 million? is that the right understanding?
timo ihamuotila -- chief financial officer
thanks, ben, for the question. no, i actually think you are a little bit too conservative there.
ben uglow -- morgan stanley -- analyst
ok.
timo ihamuotila -- chief financial officer
because we are also saying that our restructuring, which is, of course, in kind of like both of those comparable numbers, '19 and '20 goes down further $200 million. so if you turn that to cash, you would add $200 million into the cash, and then we're also expecting, as we discussed earlier, some growth and also profit improvement, which would also drop down. so it should be better.
ben uglow -- morgan stanley -- analyst
understood. ok. but just pro forma for last year, our starting point is $2.6 million or thereabout ex any organic improvement basically. and then, we have $750 million of capex approximately to give us our free cash flow.
is that a fair way to think about it?
timo ihamuotila -- chief financial officer
yes, i would say $2.6 million, $2.7 million. and then, capex.
ben uglow -- morgan stanley -- analyst
that's very helpful. i can see my model now. thank you very much. all right.
ann-sofie nordh
thanks, ben. and now we see daniela costa from goldman sachs. are you on the line, daniela?
daniela costa -- goldman sachs -- analyst
i'm on the line. good morning. thank you for taking the question. i'll ask three quick things.
first, i mean, we've been hearing a lot about like shortages of semis and other components in high transportation costs and a lot of inflation. can you elaborate like within your margin view for 2021? kind of how is the balance between this inflation on roce cost and pricing? can you help --
bjorn rosengren -- chief executive officer
daniela, please, i didn't really get your first part of the question. i understand some of the raw material you said, but you started the question with what?
timo ihamuotila -- chief financial officer
i guess, semiconductor component?
daniela costa -- goldman sachs -- analyst
yes.
bjorn rosengren -- chief executive officer
ok. yes. i mean, looking forward, we mentioned in a couple of places in the press release that there are raw material increases that there will be some headwind going into 2021. we've been quite well hedged at the moment.
and this will gradually work itself in. we, of course, our business taking mitigated actions, not least when it comes to value-based pricing, which is being quite active at the moment. of course, in a lot of other restructuring -- and restructuring efforts that are being taken. so from the margin perspective, i think you should look at following.
where are we today? yes. i mean, if you add back kusile and some of that core things on the part, our basis is about 12% running rate margin for the business. then 2023, i have promised, the other one i promised is within a corridor, but i promise 15%. so you can see that gradually, we should see moving equally in the direction toward the target of 2015.
so you should clearly see that we are moving the right way when we are moving out of the next year. i don't know if i can be more clear in my guidance without telling you a number.
daniela costa -- goldman sachs -- analyst
ok. sure. and then, just a question on the recovery we're starting to see on electrification. i was wondering if you could comment on distributor inventories, whether there has been any restocking or visa versa?
bjorn rosengren -- chief executive officer
no, i mean, electrification is a great story coming back. and china is one of the strong driving -- very, very strong driving force for the electrification business. so that developed a little bit better, both when it comes to the growth number, as well as the margin number, which is quicker. which is quickly coming there.
so yes, i think they are on a good way toward the margin corridor, which they have committed to. we feel comfortable about that business.
daniela costa -- goldman sachs -- analyst
ok. and one final question. going back to the cmd in terms of the three businesses that are under divestment. i think you've mentioned one could have potentially be -- could potentially be a spin.
but given the taking slightly longer to maybe sell them, why not just spin them off?
bjorn rosengren -- chief executive officer
yes. but no, i don't think we're taking longer term. i think we were pretty clear on that. but these three businesses are really high value business, well-performing in the market.
but the only thing we said that we are not going to have any fire sales here or any covid discount on these businesses. so we're going to make sure that we get full paid for them. and the first one, which has been extremely resilient in the downturn that's still performing fantastically during the whole covid that is the dodge business that's why we say that that is probably the first one that we -- and we have actually started the process. we should be doing that during the first half year, somewhere there.
there is, of course, separation work that needs to be done and takes a little bit of time, and we need, of course, our support from the advisors also to move it. but there is a big interest for this business and we start. the second one will probably interpret charging which is also a very strong business, even though they have some effect from the service business, which is 75% of that business, a lot in the cruising industry, where they have a lot of turbo on the engines, on the vessel engines. that's been hampered a little bit.
so we want to see that business coming back a little bit. so that business will be fully valued. then we don't really know if that is going to be spin-off or if we do sales of that one. that's a later decision that we will take.
daniela costa -- goldman sachs -- analyst
understood. thank you very much.
bjorn rosengren -- chief executive officer
thank you.
ann-sofie nordh
thank you, daniela. and we'll finish off with a question from andreas willi at j.p. morgan. please.
andreas willi -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
good morning, everybody. thanks for your time. i have two questions, please. the first one on machine automation, b&r.
maybe you could talk a little bit more about what's going on there. we've had the management change at the end of the year. we had the goodwill writedown in -- which we already discussed in q3, yet this order reversion now in q4, what's not on right there that you want to put right now with new management? and the second question is on price cost, particularly in electrification also on the motion side. you mentioned the raw materials.
are we going from kind of a net positive you had in the second-half enterprises were resilient raw materials were down to more of a neutral? or do you expect actually to see a temporary negative price cost in the first half of '21?
bjorn rosengren -- chief executive officer
ok. let me start with the b&r. which is a great business where we've also seen a fantastic recovery during the last quarter when it comes to orders. so that looks quite exciting.
yes. we took some goodwill right off during that period. but maybe you remember, this has been part of the transformation of abb we're doing. all the goodwill was earlier centrally in the group.
and we still have a lot of goodwill left here for all the businesses that we are not really selling. and now when we move the goodwill out into the business is because we want the business to carry the goodwill from their acquisition. we think that makes good sense. then there was some goodwill, which was not really related to the b&r business, it's actually to another acquisition we did earlier.
and then, we have the opportunity to, of course, offset that and write that off. so that's no negative to the management of the b&r people. so they are totally free from that. on the order reverse side, yes it's correct.
we are changing the manager. and hopefully, next week, we'll come out with a press release, who will be the new head of that business. but the orders on hand, these are orders that were in the order book since long before, and that is actually being reversed. it's not even order that we received last year, but even further back.
now we are taking that out of the book because that would not be delivered, and that was $50 million. so that is hitting them. so i wouldn't blame the management for any of these two. maybe on the order side, that could have maybe been cleaned up.
but i think it's fair for the new guy who comes in to -- when he runs this also that the orders on hand are fresh and sound. that's part of it. but yes, we think the b&r business, you know from my perspective, when we talk about this business. this is a business we should be -- we're growing that business, but it should also be more profitable than we are today.
and i think we need also to have a management to have the same ambition on this, and i think we will have that now, we'll take it to the level where it deserves to be. but otherwise, i think we're in a good position. and as i said in the report, we actually had a lot of wins when it comes to new oem customers during the quarter. so the -- finally, we're getting some tailwind on this business also now.
it was a little bit challenging in the beginning of the year when the covid was hitting. but we're pretty optimistic for the year to come. does that explain it, andreas? is that good enough?
andreas willi -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
yes. thank you. and on the price cost?
bjorn rosengren -- chief executive officer
yeah, on the electrification, yes, it's correct that last year, we reported that the price increases had a good impact, of course, in the improvement during the year. we've seen many of the mineral prices going up during the year, which is fantastic for the mining business -- for being an old mining guy, it feels always good. but yes, for us, we have a lot of coppers in our products, both in electrification and in motion. it will have a negative effect.
we're already seeing that, but we are hedged -- we are well-hedged for this year, that last year and in the beginning of this year, then you will see it gradually come into the year. so they have been more aggressive start of the year to make sure that our pricing is in line to cover this. there is a risk, of course, that this will have a -- not as a positive thing on the price comparison there. there might be some negative effects on the results from pricing compared to pricing input from materials side there for the year.
but that is, of course, going to be compensated by the integration of geis and all the efforts that are being done by closing factories and getting the product portfolio approved and so on. so we should continue to see good profit improvement of that business in line with -- as we move forward.
andreas willi -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
thank you very much.
bjorn rosengren -- chief executive officer
thank you.
ann-sofie nordh
thank you. and with that, we close this session. thank you for your attention. and if you have any additional follow-up, please reach out to us in investor relations.
and -- we all that remains is wish you another good quarter until we see you next time.
bjorn rosengren -- chief executive officer
thanks a lot, all of you.

ann-sofie nordh
greetings to you all, and welcome to this conference call and webcast for abb's fourth-quarter and full-year 2020 results. the press release and financial information documents were published this morning at 7 a.m. and can be found on our website along with the presentation, we will go through here today. following the presentation, we will open up for a q&a session.
with me today to present here are abb's ceo, bjorn rosengren; and cfo, timo ihamuotila. before we begin, i would like to draw your attention to the information regarding safe harbor notices on our use of non-gaap measures on slide 2 of the abb presentation. this conference call will include forward-looking statements. these statements are based on the company's current expectations and certain assumptions and are therefore subject to certain risks and uncertainties.
with that said, i will now hand over to bjorn and timo for the presentation. please go ahead. 
bjorn rosengren -- chief executive officer
thank you, ann-sofie, and welcome to everyone on the call. i have now been with abb for almost exactly one year. and looking back, it has been a very eventful and exciting year. let us go through some of the highlights on slide no.
3. it was a year when we transitioned abb toward improved performance. we implemented a decentralized operating model. we call abb way, making the division the highest operating level.
they now have the cost ownership. they drive r&d for profitable growth, and they evolve their business portfolios. we launched our 2030 sustainability strategy and updated our financial network in november. and we delivered on the simplification program as achieved targeted net savings run rate of $500 million, one year ahead of plan.
i'm very confident that the actions taken in 2020 will leverage going forward. 2020 was also a year of the pandemic with dominated the market development. i am thankful for the speed and dedication of the abb team on how mitigation actions were implemented. the agile response to covid-19 challenges enabled our organization to prioritize health and safety while keeping operations running and undertaking strong cost mitigation efforts.
after a year like 2020, i'm proud to see the progress we have made in our employee engagement survey. it shows that our employees have more clarity of their roles and responsibilities, as well as of our overall purpose of the company. we really saw the culture change gain momentum in 2020. timo will talk you through the full-year numbers a little bit later on.
turning to slide 4. we shift focus to the fourth quarter. we saw a continued sequential improvement in customer activity from the low level noted during summer. in total, orders and revenues remained broadly stable year over year.
the positive impact from mid-single-digit growth in the short-cycle business was offset by subdued demand for services and headwinds in selected end markets such as oil and gas. we secured some larger system order wins for our world-leading azipod propulsion technology. the machine automation division also closed out the period with an all-time high level of future design wins. this creates a good base to build from after the management change in machine automation division is completed.
revenues were stable, but we still managed to the operational ebita margin by 140 basis points. and the increase was led by stellar performance in electrification and motion. synergies from geis came in ahead of target, $120 million run rate, and the integration is now approximately two-thirds completed. further down the income statement, we had some adverse impact on the basic eps.
this related to pension and debt action taken during the quarter to strengthen our long-term financial position, but also to power grids book gain adjustment, reflecting ordinary closing-related balance sheet adjustments. operational eps for continued operations improved by 20% to $0.26. turning to slide 5, showing abb's regional order trends in comparable year-on-year terms. asia, middle east and africa grew strongly, while both europe and americas remained impacted by the covid-19 pandemic.
in europe, orders were 12% lower year on year, and the business areas were challenged. in germany, expansion in motion and electrification stands out, with total orders in each of these business areas up in double-digit terms. in the americas, orders were 6% lower, led by a decline of 12% in u.s. alongside demand impact from the covid restrictions, orders intake was also impacted by a downturn in oil and gas activities.
a significant recovery was noted in asia, middle east and africa, orders rose 23%, with strong support from china improving by 21% in the quarter. we highlight excellent growth in ra in china with orders up close to 90% year on year. and with that, i hand over to timo to cover the results in more details. please.
timo ihamuotila -- chief financial officer
thank you, bjorn, and good morning, everyone. on slide 6, i will begin with a review of what, in our view, was a solid end to a challenging year. on stable revenues, we increased operational ebita by 12% on constant currency and 16% in u.s. dollar terms.
margins improved by 140 basis points. i'm pleased to see our prompt actions yielding results in margins in the fourth quarter. while other costs were down, r&d expenses in the fourth quarter -- in our four businesses increased by 3% year on year. looking at below the line items, all divisions carefully reviewed their operations, and this shows in restructuring-related expenses at $220 million, compared to $99 million the prior-year period.
charges mainly related to the future delivery of abb-os savings, synergies from geis' integration and planned performance improvement industrial automation. the planned actions undertaken to strengthen abb's financial flexibility and derisk the balance sheet also weighted on results as did the adjustment to the power bridge book. in total, basic eps amounted to a negative $0.04. operational eps in continuing operations, which adjusts for nonoperational items and excludes impacts from the divestments of power grids was $0.26, up 20% year on year.
cash flow from operating activities in continuing operations was $1.2 billion after out close totaling about $200 million from the kusile settlement and pension plan transfers. i will come back to the full-year cash flow dynamics in a bit. turning to the fourth-quarter results for our business areas, i will begin with electrification on slide 7. electrification's orders were 2% lower, benefiting from strong demand in data centers and e-mobility and solid growth in renewables, rail and food and beverage.
oil and gas was challenged. buildings improved sequentially with residential activity outpacing nonresidential. revenues increased by 5%, supported by strong backlog execution and short-cycle business. electrification's operational ebita margin improved 250 basis points to 15.6%, in its target range for the second quarter in a row.
the excellent result was driven by better volumes, supportive pricing and rigorous cost management. although the current low level of, for example, travel expenses is not expected to be sustainable in the long term. in addition, both geis integration and the turnaround of installation products progressed well. during the quarter, we noted rising raw material prices.
while it did not impact the q4 result, it will be a headwind to manage during 2021. looking ahead into the first quarter, we expect a low to mid-single-digit growth in revenues to support close to similar year-on-year improvement rate in operational margins as seen in the fourth quarter. next, on slide 8, we look at industrial automation or process automation, as we call it from the beginning of this year. orders increased by 9%, a strong result driven by large orders in the marine business, mainly for lng specialty vessels.
ia saw select activity in process industries such as mining and water and wastewater. energy industries, particularly oil and conventional power generation, were challenged. the order backlog at quarter end was $5.8 billion, an increase of $650 million from the end of the third quarter. revenues declined 11%, reflecting subdued levels of book and bill activities with service being particularly weak in end markets such as cruise.
the operational ebita margin of 6.8% was 530 basis points lower year on year. this includes the combined impact of 270 basis points from the settlement of the kusile project with eskom in south africa and charges related to legacy power generation projects in india. aside these items, profitably was hampered by lower volume and unfavorable mix, predominantly related to lower services activity. in response to the current low profitability level, ia has initiated structural actions to improve long-term performance.
looking into the first quarter, order growth is expected to decline significantly on the back of a higher comparable from the first quarter in 2020. revenue is foreseen to decrease at a similar rate as noted in the fourth quarter, and the margin should remain largely stable on a sequential basis, excluding the impact from the project charges. on slide 9, we turn to motion, which again noted a solid delivery. orders declined 5%, mainly reflecting a tough large order comparison.
demand from rail and water wastewater was healthy. some end markets, particularly oil and gas, remained challenged. revenues were flat, with development reflecting solid growth in short-cycle business and strong execution of the backlog. the operational ebita margin of 16.8% expanded 140 basis points year on year, benefiting from good cost mitigation, stable volumes and supportive mix, even if rising price costs were a headwind.
looking at the quarter ahead, we recognize the record high comparable to be reflected in the expected negative order growth for q1 '21. however, revenue growth should improve compared to q4, while anticipated business mix is expected to lead to a slightly smaller margin improvement when compared to q4. on slide 10, we turn to robotics & discrete automation. orders were 5% lower.
however, the result includes reversals of about $50 million, mainly in the order book for machine automation. these reversals adversely affected the business area's comparable growth rate by about 7%. adjusting for this accounting impact, orders for machine automation were up clearly double digit. in robotics, strong activity in 3c, improved activity in general industry and select investment in ev manufacturing supported the order result.
demand from china was stellar. as bjorn highlighted earlier, ra's orders were close to 90% higher year on year in china. the order development also reflects the more selective approach now being applied toward robotic systems business in the automotive industry. part of the division's strategy to improve margins by shifting its mix toward higher value-add smart systems and application sales.
revenues declined 3%, supported by positive developments in machine automation and good backlog execution. this was, however, more than offset by weaker development in particularly due to weak automotive segment and service business. the operational ebita margin declined to 7.3%, impacted by lower volumes, but also by unfavorable mix, primarily related to deliveries from the robotics order backlog to the automotive segment. looking into the first quarter, we currently foresee orders to be slightly up on a sequential basis while the growth rate should be adversely impacted by a more challenging comparable period.
revenue growth should return to positive territory, supporting a slight margin improvement year on year. let's now turn to slide 11 and look a bit closer at the makeup of our operational ebita margins during the recent years. we can see that the amount of extraordinary items is steadily decreasing both when we look at q4, as well as full-year comparisons. we have eliminated the stranded cost after the closing of the power grids transaction.
in noncore business, the exposure continues to decrease significantly with clearly less than 10 projects still under execution. we are looking to exit the remainder of the noncore business as soon as practicable. however, as said at our capital markets day, we still have two main exposures, and our exit from these exposures is partly reliant on legal proceedings, which could stretch beyond 2021. regarding kusile, we are not expecting further operational charges after settlement done in q4 with eskom in south africa.
that said, the settlement does not cover regulatory proceeds outside south africa, which are currently not estimable. moving to slide 12, and the cash flow from operating activities and continuing which remained stable at $1.9 billion in 2020. this is in line with our guidance of resilient cash performance for the year. the 2020 result includes lower income from businesses in the wake of the pandemic and a favorable development of trade net working capital.
it also includes a total of approximately $1 billion outflows incurred from abb's transformation efforts. on a year-on-year basis, when excluding these impacts in both periods, cash flow from operating activities in continuing operations was significantly higher. looking to 2021, we expect to deliver a meaningful uplift in cash flow from operating activities. on slide 13, let's look at the benefits from our capital structure optimization program now largely concluded.
as discussed earlier, we are using the proceeds from the divestment of power grids on our ongoing buyback program. we purchased 109 million shares in the second of 2020, just over 5% of our share capital. in addition, we continued to build on actions started during the third quarter to deleverage abb in an efficient way and in a value-maximizing way. in terms of debt and credit in the fourth quarter, we opted to an early retirement of approximately $1.2 billion of bonds, which had high coupons.
at the start of this year, we also were able to benefit from favorable market conditions by issuing a 0% long duration bond of eur 800 million. also, in the fourth quarter, we transferred certain pension plan obligations to third-party insurers. in total, pension deals completed during the second half of the year, cover an estimated $2.5 billion of bad pension obligations that were underfunded by an estimated $770 million. the deals have been enabled by about $360 million of cash contributions, as well as the transfer of approximately $1.8 billion of existing pension plan assets.
as a consequence, we recorded a nonoperational pension charges of about $380 million and $140 million in our income statement in the third and fourth quarters, respectively. these transactions are an efficient way to deleverage, significantly reducing the underfunding of our pension liabilities and making future negative cash flow and p&l impact less likely. in summary, we have significantly improved our financial flexibility, using proceeds from the divestment of the power grids in a responsible and efficient way, placing abb in a stronger financial position for 2021 and beyond. to conclude, let's move to slide 14, where we summarize the full-year results.
you can see in the chart that although the short-cycle business recovered in the latter part of the year, we remained in negative comparable growth of 6% for the year. revenue declined by 5% on a comparable basis, but we managed to keep operational ebita margin stable at 11.1%, with increased r&d investment in our business areas. cash flow from operating activities was $1.7 billion for the year, including outflows of close to $1 billion related to special items, stemming from our transformation and capital optimization programs. operational eps declined by 21% to $0.98.
however, excluding the difference in operational eps from power grids, continuing operations eps was 7% lower. the broad board signals its strong belief in future performance with a proposed stable dividend of chf 0.80 per share. and with that, let me pass you back to bjorn for his closing remarks.
bjorn rosengren -- chief executive officer
yes. thank you, timo. let's take a look at our short-term end market outlook on slide 15. we stick to our base case profile of a protractive recovery.
as indicated in the chart, on one hand, we expect some of our end markets, particularly in the short-cycle part of the business to continue to recover. on the other hand, we expect negative development to continue in some of our longer cycle business, like oil and gas and conventional power generation. for the first quarter, we also note that we faced a challenging comparable of orders. this may put pressure on the growth rate in the first quarter before we expect to return to positive order development in q2.
we foresee a fairly stable sequential market development in q1, with a moderate year-on-year revenue growth, but i expect us to meaningfully improve margins. forward visibility is limited. and i would say that market uncertainty increased through the fourth quarter due to the pandemic. at this stage, we foresee revenue growth for the year, broadly in line with our target range.
and i expect us to make steady progress in margins and earnings per share, as well as posting a solid cash delivery. our base case scenario for gradual recovery of demand remains unchanged. we foresee estimated growth in our addressable markets of about 5% until 2023, and we should grow at least in line with our markets in this period. this is not to be compared with the through-the-cycle growth targets of 3% to 5%.
to conclude, on slide 16, let us look at some key priorities for 2021, a year when i expect us to make steady progress in profitability. we have now laid the foundation for improved performance by implementing the decentralized operating model and improved performance management. we have seen the culture change in abb gain momentum in 2020. we now need to firmly cement the culture of accountability, transparency and speed.
we are already making good progress. starting with operational performance. i clearly expect us to show good progress toward our 2023 margin targets. our base case is not a significant market recovery in 2021.
and we will continue to execute on efficiency measures. we have additional activities in the pipeline with anticipated restructuring charges of about usd 200 million in 2021, mainly as automation to improve performance and electrification to drive the final miles of the geis integration. of course, there are challenges to manage, for example, rising raw material costs, increased focus on value-based pricing is one way to offset these increased costs. still, we acknowledge that we are in the midst of a pandemic.
and our no. 1 priority remains the health and safety of our people. active portfolio management is high on our agenda and we have already moved into execution mode on the three divisions to be exited. that said, value creation is the most important for us, and we will not go into fire sales.
in other words, it may take some time to complete some of the deals. we also expect all of our divisional managers to build a pipeline of potential m&a targets. but also to continuously review the business portfolio with their divisions for potential consolidation. finally, looking at capital allocation, you heard timo talking about the stronger financial position, and we expect meaningfully uplifting in cash generation in 2021.
we will continue to invest in r&d to maintain a leading technology position to drive long-term profitability growth. we expect to spend about $750 million in capex. we continue to execute on the share buyback program, and the board has proposed a dividend share of chf 0.80, in line with our policy to pay a rising sustainable annual dividend per share over time. we are looking forward to an exciting 2021.
ann-sofie nordh
thank you, bjorn. and now we will open up for questions, and i can see that there are many waiting and wanting to put questions to bjorn and timo. so we kindly ask you to limit yourself to two questions.
",2020-Q4,ABB
,,":
operator
our first question comes from chris schott with jp morgan. your line is open.
chris schott -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
great. thanks so much for the questions. the first one for me was on rinvoq and dose. as we think about fda, i guess, balancing lowest effective dose versus incremental efficacy and safety risks, i guess what would the impact of only having a 15-milligram versus a 15 and 30-milligram approval have on your view on the atopic derm opportunity, which i think you talked about is about a $2 billion sales potential previously? and then my second question was just a little bit more color on the aesthetic dynamics, i guess, is there anything we're seeing -- with the results we're seeing very, very strong here, is there any catch-up type event as the world reopens that we're seeing with these results or are these kind of sustainable underlying trends that are kind of coming in above expectations for that business? trying to get a sense of just how to think about that progressing as we go through the rest of the year.
thanks so much.
michael severino -- vice chairman and president
so thanks, chris. this is mike. i'll take the first question and then rick will take the second question that you asked. with respect to rinvoq, we feel very confident in the benefit risk profile across indications and across the doses that we've studied.
having said that, both the 15 and 30-milligram doses have performed very well, both from an efficacy and a safety perspective. and so if you look at the efficacy results that we drove with 15 in atopic dermatitis, we drove high levels of response -- very rapid response and had a very prominent impact on itch, which is one of the most bothersome symptoms with 15 as well as with 30. and with the 15-milligram dose, for example, we saw statistically significant and clinically significant reduction in edge after only two days, which is really quite remarkable in this disease. and again, that's really one of the most bothersome symptoms to patients.
so we think we could be successful with either dose, to answer your question specifically, but we also remain confident in the benefit risk of both doses.
rick gonzalez -- chairman of the board and chief executive officer
so chris, this is rick. i'll cover the aesthetics one for you, as mike said. i think if you look at the underlying performance of the aesthetics business, in particular, the market growth in the u.s. and in china, it's driving the fundamental growth that we see to the business.
certainly, there is some impact still from covid. so we're seeing some impact there. but i think the majority of it is, when we took over allergan, we made a decision to really invest in promotion at a much higher level than they were investing in a prior and they had an approach that was more of an episodic investment approach where we have basically made a decision that we'll fund across the entire year at a relatively significant level. to drive demand because the data clearly supports that you can grow this market.
and i think the best comparisons are starting to look at what it really looks like versus 2019 because you obviously have the covid impact in 2020. and but you take, for example, botox, botox versus 2019, cosmetic botox versus 2019, it's up about 27%. the market is growing very robustly. some of that is probably cover driven.
these are just the u.s. numbers i'm describing right now. some of that is probably cover driven. but i wouldn't say a lot of it at this point is co driven in the u.s.-china continues to grow very well.
in fact, i'd say, china is back to the level of growth. and we have expanded the sales force in china once about 4 or 5 months ago. we're in the process now of going through a second expansion in china. i would expect that china will continue to drive growth going forward.
the one area that still is being impacted in a fairly significant way from covid is the european market. we still see it starting -- we see it starting to emerge in areas like the u.k. but there are other areas in europe that are still in lockdown. i would expect that europe and brazil as well will then hopefully start to see some recovery as we get into the second half of this year.
and they can start to contribute, which would add additional growth to the overall business. but i would tell you, i'm very pleased with the decisions that we've made around driving more promotion, and i'm pleased with the execution of this. and this team has done extremely well in executing and driving the kind of share position that we want and the growth that we want. so i think it is sustainable going forward.
chris schott -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
thank you.
operator
our next question comes from geoffrey porges with svb leerink. your line is open.
geoffrey porges -- svb leerink -- analyst
thank you very much. i appreciate a couple of questions. first, rick, something we don't talk about a lot, which is the neuroscience portfolio, and you've started reporting it combined. i know there's four products in there but adding them up the long-term guidance you provided previously was about $8.3 billion, i think, and you're already annualizing it close to $6 million so could you give us a sense of how much upside that portfolio has given the trends that you're seeing? and then sort of on a related question, i also hate to harp on the jak question.
but obviously, there's a lot coming to ask from what this impact might be. so if you look confined to the 15-milligram dose, not because of any signal, but because of the regulators' view of the safety of the class, and how much impact would that have on the $8 billion long-term guidance? and so do you have other levers that you could pull to fill whatever shortfall that would cause? thanks.
rick gonzalez -- chairman of the board and chief executive officer
on the neuroscience portfolio, it is an area that we're very excited about. so maybe jeff and i will tag team here. but i think when you look at the two major growth franchises there, being the migraine franchise and the antipsychotic franchise with baylor. both of those, we think, have significant opportunity to continue to grow.
i mean you're obviously seeing ubrelvy now perform extremely well in the marketplace. i think jeff can give you probably a little more color on that. and baylor is now continuing to perform very well as well. i think if we are able to achieve one positive study on mdd, i think that will give us significant growth going forward.
so this is a franchise that we're excited about. and i also think it will be a meaningful franchise for us over the long term. it's an area where we continue to look at assets that we could potentially add to it. so i absoluttely think that it will be a nice growth driver for us.
jeff?
jeff stewart -- executive vice president, commercial operations
yes. i think just to reiterate, as i mentioned in my comments, the oral cgrp market is moving very nicely. it's hit -- i mentioned 16% for the quarter, but now in the weeklies, it's 17 or above on just the penetration of that segment. and so we see a lot of runway in that segment over our long-range planning.
certainly, the availability of another oral cgrp, in this case, for episodic migraine, allows us to compete in a much larger segment beyond the acute. and to rick's point, remember we have the big anchor asset with botox therapeutic in migraine on the back end for chronic migraine and we have plans in place to expand that upstream also into episodic migraine. and this is actually in some ways non-overlapping because we have a big injector base for botox and then we can have the neurologist and primary care base for atogepant. and so when you look basically really across the waterfront, the leading acute agent, oral, very, very potent and active oral agent in the middle with episodic, and then on the back end with botox, it's a very nice portfolio for us that will drive growth.
as rick mentioned, we are encouraged on the potential for adjunctive mdd. and that segment itself, when we do the market analysis, is about as large the adjunctive mdd segment, as bipolar depression. and so this basically has the opportunity for us to really double the potential penetration over our long range plans, so we're very encouraged over this set of assets.
rob michael -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
and jeff, this is rob. i would just add, if you can take the pieces we've given in terms of long term guidance, for vraylar we've talked about approaching $4 billion with the current approved indication. for migraine, both ubrelvy and atogepant, we've talked about peak potential greater than a billion for each of those assets. and then we have duopa plus we have 951 in the pipeline that i think can drive significant growth.
in addition to our early stage pipeline in neuroscience, i do see that as a therapeutic area that will drive long term growth in the company going forward.
geoffrey porges -- svb leerink -- analyst
great. thanks. then the jaks?
rick gonzalez -- chairman of the board and chief executive officer
on the jaks, we've obviously evaluated carefully the positioning of the product. i think if we look at where we are today, one, we're confident in the high dose. that has a good risk-benefit profile, but i would tell you it wouldn't change our guidance going forward. the assumptions that we have made in areas like atopic dermatitis, we believe that we can get to those assumptions without a high dose.
that doesn't mean that we don't want the high dose. by the end of the day i believe we will maintain the guidance that we have based on that.
jeff stewart -- executive vice president, commercial operations
the other thing that i would point out is that we've had additional data on rinvoq across a number of areas since that guidance, including ibd. so we've had the uc data that have come largely since that guidance, and those have exceeded our expectations. and so we remain confident overall in the performance of rinvoq.
geoffrey porges -- svb leerink -- analyst
great. thanks, guys.
liz shea -- vice president of investor relations
thanks, geoffrey.

our next question comes from andrew baum with citi. your line is open.
andrew baum -- citi -- analyst
many thanks. a couple of questions, please. there's not much bipartisan agreement in the u.s. over drug price reform, but there seems to be a lot when it comes to antitrust in relation to the pharmaceutical industry.
so perhaps we could comment following last night's house committee on the judiciary, where there was lots of pointed talk from both sides, focusing firstly on patent tickets. second, on having a presumption of anti-competitive behavior in terms of assessment of large scale, in particular, m&a, meaning that it would impact future business development for the industry. so that's the first question. and then the second question, rather more positive, in terms of the jak, when i look at consensus, the forecast for invocare is about $6 billion.
when you look at the size of the opportunity in ra alone, let alone psoriatic arthritis, atopic dermatitis, you see the other indications you have. is it conceivable to you, short term, if the drug affected the class being heavily limited or pulled from the market? that gbp 6 billion looks like an incredibly conservative estimate for what this drug could do.
rick gonzalez -- chairman of the board and chief executive officer
andrew, this is rick. i mean, i'll obviously comment maybe on your point of view around the antitrust discussions. clearly, i've accepted the invitation to be able to testify to the committee on may 18th. we certainly feel absolutely comfortable and confident in the way we operate in this market.
it's a highly competitive market where humira competes. and certainly, as we look at the patents that were issued for humira. they went through a rigorous process in order to be issued. they represent true innovation to the product.
they were challenged by competitors. just like every competitor has a right to challenge a patent if they don't believe it's valid or appropriate, and those patents were challenged and the vast majority of those patents survive that challenge. and what i'd say is when we look at our behavior in this market, i think our behavior was absolutely pro competitive. we have patents that went all the way out to 2034 in that portfolio.
and yet, we chose to license every single biosimilar player in 2023. literally 11 years before the last patent would have expired. so i feel highly confident in the position that we have taken in this marketplace and that we have operated totally appropriately. and then your next question on rinvoq -- i'm sorry.
i was thinking about the first one. so can you repeat your question?
andrew baum -- citi -- analyst
i will. i mean, i -- just finishing on the first, so you referenced your future test a bit. i guess it was more general rather than just abbvie-centric, how it would impact bd and the abilities -- the ability of the industry to operate if pricing can't get resolved. but moving on to the second question, so my question was whether consensus forecasts for rinvoq look unrealistically conservative, given the scale of the opportunities and given in ra alone, looking at the size of that market, it's an expressive disease that you don't actually need atopic dermatitis to get in excess of where consensus currently pegs forecast, which when we look, about $6 billion.
rob michael -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
andrew, this is rob. i'll start, and then i'll hand it over to jeff. i think we agree with you. we do think consensus is conservative.
we've given that 2025 guidance of $8 billion for rinvoq. and we would expect it to grow beyond 2025. when i look at the current consensus, obviously, as you quoted, it's a little bit -- just a little bit above $6 billion from the numbers i'm looking at. and i look at the growth beyond 25%.
it's nowhere near what we're expecting. so we feel very good about the opportunity there. i think what we've covered with you in december still holds as we've broken out the contribution by indication. we still feel very good about that, but we would agree that consensus is very conservative right now.
jeff stewart -- executive vice president, commercial operations
yes. thanks, rob. this is jeff. and agree, it's -- these are spectacular assets with incredibly dynamic markets.
so we see across the rheumatology markets, the atopic derm market. we see the ibd market, which with both assets, we think, is underappreciated. i mean even expansions in second and third lines as new assets come in that are really breakthrough assets with higher levels of efficacy. and so we clearly believe that consensus is conservative here.
and just to comment on atopic derm, this is an explosive market. i mean it is significantly underdeveloped in terms of the penetration. so this is going to grow substantially. and even if you look at conservative assumptions on where we source business, the growth of the second line.
that's not to say that we're not going to be very competitive in frontline. it's a very, very attractive space. and again, i think the performance that we've seen -- clinical performance that we've seen right now, primarily on the induction trials for skyrizi and rinvoq, skyrizi in crohn's, rinvoq in uc, is very, very encouraging. and so we see that cascading over our long range plans as well.
we are very, very bullish and agree that consensus is conservative.
andrew baum -- citi -- analyst
many thanks.
liz shea -- vice president of investor relations
thank you, andrew.
operator
our next question comes from vamil divan with mizuho securities. your line is open.
vamil divan -- mizuho securities -- analyst
great. thanks so much for taking my questions. maybe a couple, if i could, on the migration side. so first on ubrelvy, you mentioned it looks like the class is doing very well and gaining share.
it also looks like over the last few weeks or so, you've been gaining a little share within the class relative to nortech. so i'm just wondering if you can sort of share your perspective on what you think is driving that. some of us thought it might be due to pricing and access but based on our calculation, it looks like your gross to net is actually lower than what it is from the biohaven side. so any perspective would be helpful.
and then on atogepant, maybe just a little more of your top two-year go-to-market strategy, assuming approval in september, especially given nurtec will likely have an indication for both treatment and prevention. so how do you see coming in with two separate drugs? it could be two co-pays, could be just a different message relative to a single drug. so just any perspective on how competing with that would be helpful as well. thank you.
jeff stewart -- executive vice president, commercial operations
yeah, ok. perfect. it's jeff. and in terms of the acute market, as i mentioned, the penetration of the overall segment is increasing very, very nicely, as i highlighted.
if you look at the mix between ubrelvy and nurtec, we have gained a little bit over the last few weeks, but it's very close. i mean, we typically run at 51%, 52%, 53% of the new prescription basis.i think you are quite perceptive over the value creation that's taking place there. and i clearly don't have full insight into the biohaven fall through, but we've been quite disciplined. we have over 90% commercial access.
so we're quite comfortable where we are from an overall access perspective and our team remains quite disciplined in terms of making sure that we both drive the right type of volume with our positioning but also the right type of profitability over time. so we're encouraged with our continued momentum with ubrelvy.in terms of atogepant, i think what's quite impressive about our program there is just the sheer level of efficacy that we have, and i think this is very important in terms of sometimes the narrative over simple or easy versus, look, how do you think about the best drug for episodic prevention, particularly when you choose an oral? so we are at the very, very high end of the migraine freedom or the days of migraine control with this new asset, and we think that, frankly, you need to take care of the migraine and atogepant will be very well positioned to do that. we also think that we'll have nice synergies. obviously we have a fairly significant sales force that is promoting ubrelvy to both the neurologist and high prescribing general practitioners, and it will fit in very well as we put atogepant into that sales fleet.
so we're set up well, we think, for our go-to-market.
vamil divan -- mizuho securities -- analyst

our next question comes from tim anderson with wolfe research. your line is open.
tim anderson -- wolfe research -- analyst
thank you. a couple of questions please. i haven't heard really any drug company this reporting season talk about future potential austerity measures in ex-u.s. geographies, meaning broad-based price cuts following from the impact of covid.
as a company -- as one of the few companies that's given detailed long term financial guidance, i'm guessing you have been thinking about this, and i'm wondering how you are currently viewing this in terms of its likelihood of occurring, what the magnitude could be and what the timing might be.then second question just on an early stage pipeline asset, your tnf-steroid antibody drug conjugate, i believe you have in-house probably a fair amount of data that the markets haven't seen yet. i'm wondering when we might see additional human data and what your current level of enthusiasm is toward that platform.
rick gonzalez -- chairman of the board and chief executive officer
tim, this is rick. i'll cover the ous austerity measures. certainly if we go back to 2008, we saw that kind of an impact as we were building out our long range plan, we have made some sets of assumptions around that. i would expect that we will see some pressure outside the u.s.
going forward over the next couple of years. it's certainly manageable within the expectations that we have built for the business going forward, certainly based on that level of experience that we've seen historically, it's manageable. it is something that we have contemplated and i would, frankly, expect to see some level of pressure going forward.
michael severino -- vice chairman and president
so this is mike. i'll take the second question. with respect to the tnf-steroid conjugate program, we're obviously advancing abbv-154. we have a large phase iib ra study that will start this quarter, and then we're starting studies in additional immune-mediated conditions as well over the course of the year.
with respect to publication of this data from 3373, which is the closely related compound from the same platform that we top-line results some time ago, i think you can expect to see more detailed data over the course of the summer.
liz shea -- vice president of investor relations
thanks, tim.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from steve scala with cowen. your line is open.
steve scala -- cowen and company -- analyst
many thanks. first on rinvoq, i'm curious what additional safety data has fda been provided that it did not have previously. and has all of it been previously presented and if not, what was the conclusion of what now has been submitted? so that's the first question. secondly regarding imbruvica, to what extent can abbvie tease out covid impact on new patient starts versus competition from new frontline agents? thank you.
michael severino -- vice chairman and president
this is mike. i'll take the first question, and then rick will handle the second. with respect to rinvoq, the additional safety data that were presented to the fda or provided to the fda are essentially a roll forward of the analysis that we did at the time of the nda submission. obviously our database continues to grow.
we accumulate patient years experience, and so there weren't fundamentally new analyses but we did an updated assessment with the additional data that have accrued in the time between submission and when we submitted both responses. so what i would say is the data that we reviewed have not changed our impression of benefit-risk in any way. i think they're very consistent with all of the data that have been publicly presented. obviously since they represent data that were current up to the time that we submitted just a few weeks ago, not all of these data have been presented in the public domain, but i would say that our response is very consistent with what we have described publicly in the past.
rick gonzalez -- chairman of the board and chief executive officer
and on your second question -- this is rick, we get data on new patient starts, so we have relatively, i think, accurate data. it's offset by a couple of months -- maybe jeff will talk about it in a little more detail. so we know any cll patient, when they start, regardless of therapy, we can measure that, and obviously we can measure again what type of therapy they start on, so i think the level of data integrity that we operate with from a market standpoint here is pretty good. it's offset by a few months.
maybe jeff can speak to the time offset.
jeff stewart -- executive vice president, commercial operations
yes, so steve, it's jeff. we have pretty good visibility to what's happening from the share perspective versus the market start perspective. i'll give you some flavor. with regard to calquence, we can see the impact of the approvals in the front and second line cll.
and it's largely consistent with what our expectations were, so they're ramping in a similar fashion to what we saw in the mcl or nhl, so we know that there's some impact on imbruvica there.the largest impact has been, unfortunately, into the market. and unfortunately i mean for the patient. i'll give you a little bit of the numbers. typically the cll market, which is the largest driver, it grows sort of at a population level, like 2% every year.
if you look at the impact from covid, we can see almost three different waves. we can see a wave where the new patient starts in the market, we're down in the high teens in the first part. then it started to claw back a little bit into the single digits down, and then it got hit again into the teens in the august period and we saw it down again in early january of about 18%. so we can see what's happening, and as i mentioned in my remarks.
the biggest impact here has been on continued market suppression due to covid.
rob michael -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
steve, this is rob. i would just remind you also on the first quarter that we had the stocking impact from covid last year. so if you adjust for that, it's about a four point impact on imbruvica's growth year-over-year due to the prior year comp with the stocking impact.
steve scala -- cowen and company -- analyst
thank you.
liz shea -- vice president of investor relations
thanks, steve.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from david risinger with morgan stanley. your line is open.
david risinger -- morgan stanley -- analyst
yes, thanks very much, and congrats on the results and updates. i have two questions.first, just to follow on, on that comment, could you just help us understand a little bit more about why imbruvica is such an outlier in the cancer market? why the pandemic is hitting imbruvica very hard whereas the pandemic is not hitting other cancer agents so hard? then second, with respect to esthetics, it's obviously booming and it is validating your acquisition of allergan. but i think that you updated guidance for the year for botox cosmetic to $1.9 billion, and that implies classic sequential sales from the $477 million that you booked in the first quarter. so if you could explain that please.
thank you.
michael severino -- vice chairman and president
this is mike. i'll take the first question and then others will comment on your second question.with respect to why imbruvica is being hit harder than other anti-cancer agents in the pandemic, i think it has to do with the underlying rate of progression cll. so cll, while it is a very significant limiter of long-term function and survival, in the short term there's a sense that therapy can be delayed if necessary because the rate of progression is relatively slower than other forms of cancer. for example, certainly much slower than aml, another indication that we are very active in in the hema-on space.
i think in the setting of the pandemic, that's why you are seeing more deferrals for start-up therapy and, in some cases, longer time to switch therapy, which would explain why imbruvica dynamics are different than other anti-cancer agents to treat other diseases.
rob michael -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
and, david, this is rob. on your question regarding botox cosmetic, we did see in the first quarter, if you just look at toxins market growth, it's over 30% in the first quarter. there is some impact from pent-up demand as we come out of the pandemic, but we feel very good about the forecast we put forward. we obviously took it up $100 million, so it's essentially pass through to beat in the quarter.
i'd say your math on flat sequentially, i think it's up a little bit. but really if you consider that we did have some level of pent-up demand come through in the quarter, you've got to back that out to truly understand the underlying demand dynamics.
david risinger -- morgan stanley -- analyst
thank you.
liz shea -- vice president of investor relations
thanks, david.
operator
the next question comes from ronny gal with bernstein. your line is open.
ronny gal -- sanford c. bernstein -- analyst
hi, everybody. congratulations on a very nice quarter, and thank you for fitting me in. two questions, if i may. first, there was data presented from richter about negative symptom improvement using vraylar.
i was wondering what was your take on the data in terms of your ability to use it in the united states? is it something that you consider doing a trial on? could this then be added to the label, and so forth? second, the growth in botox neurology is really impressive. it seems relatively odd that there was such a big jump in the middle of a wave of the epidemic in january-february for a physician-administered product. can you just give us a flavor of what's the underlying trends there? is there just a lot more success that you're having in pushing first patients who failed citrino into botox? how should we think about this?
michael severino -- vice chairman and president
this is mike. i'll take the first question and then others will comment on your second question.with respect to negative symptoms and the treatment of those negative symptoms in schizophrenia, it's a very challenging area, it's a very important area because they're responsible for much of the long term loss of function in patients who suffer from schizophrenia. it has been a very difficult area to approach in general, and we believe vraylar has a good profile there and has a good overall impact on the disease -- a very strong overall impact on the disease, but it's also one that's been very challenging from a labeling perspective in the u.s. it's been a very difficult claim to get in the u.s.
so it's not clear that there is a specific path to negative symptoms in the label, but i do think the overall profile of vraylar in schizophrenia, both with respect to symptom control and benefit risk, are viewed very positively by treating physicians, and i think the overall benefits are well understood by treating physicians and i think that is reflected in vraylar's overall strong performance.
jeff stewart -- executive vice president, commercial operations
and it's jeff. in regard to botox, it's insightful because we are seeing some robust activity, particularly in migraine. i think there's a couple reasons for that. one, rick highlighted the sales force dynamics in china.
we've definitely focused our sales team on the migraine component. and the other thing that's taken place is a little bit, i think, of an investment approach. we've had more consistent consumer investment since we had the integration than previously -- the legacy allergan. so i think the combination of the consumer investment, new waves where if patients access an injector at a neurologist, they can get a sample of botox right at their first appointment rather than wait for many months.
there are various commercial reasons, we think, that give us a lot of encouragement on the therapeutic botox performance, again specifically and particularly in migraine.
ronny gal -- sanford c. bernstein -- analyst
thank you.
liz shea -- vice president of investor relations
thanks ronny.

our next question comes from terence flynn with goldman sachs. your line is open.
terence flynn -- goldman sachs -- analyst
great. thanks for taking the question. maybe two for me. i recognize there are still a lot of unknowns here, but how are you thinking about potential headwind from any changes to corporate tax rates and guilty? then given just the progress you outlined on debt pay down, you'll be back to about a two times leverage ratio, you mentioned.
how are you thinking about capital allocation into the end of the year and into 2022? and what types of assets are you focused on for bd and m&a? thank you.
rick gonzalez -- chairman of the board and chief executive officer
this is rick. i'll cover the tax. as you said, it's certainly early in the process and we obviously know what's being proposed, but we don't necessarily know where we will end up. i think one of the important things that we need to continue to think through is if we go back to--you know, one of the reasons we're back in 2017 tax reform was passed was to make sure that two things happened: one, that u.s.-based companies were competitive with their foreign competitors, and two, it encouraged companies like ours to invest in the united states.
i can certainly talk about the abbvie example. and i think it's pretty compelling when you sit back and look at--you know, we were able to go out and acquire a irish company, redomicile it back to the united states. abbvie today has 24,000 jobs in the united states. we've also increased investment significantly in the u.s.
since tax reform. over the last three years, we've invested $1.5 billion, we committed that we'd do $2.5 billion over time. we're going to exceed that commitment. we've added about 1,500 jobs over just that period of time.
companies like ours clearly took the benefit of tax reform and that has allowed us to be able to be more competitive and certainly in the acquisition of a company like allergan, i think that was clearly demonstrated, but we also have invested much more aggressively in the u.s.so i think going forward, one of the things that important for policymakers to balance is to make sure that we don't go back to where we were, and that is where u.s. companies aren't as competitive against their foreign competitors. the current proposal would make the u.s. have the highest rate of all developed countries -- and i'm not so sure that's the position you'd want to be in, so hopefully as we go forward, there will be a balance that's looked at in raising taxes but also making companies that maintain a competitive position and continue to be incented to invest in the u.s.
rob michael -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
terence, this is rob. on your question regarding capital allocation. i'll start and then mike will add more color in terms of bd. we've said all along as we continue -- we will continue to delever through 2023.
so think about that net leverage ratio getting to two in '22. i think our balance sheet is be in very good shape, but we want to continue to pay down the debt through '23. during that period, we've allocated $2 billion of capital for business development. you've seen us do these very nice deals, whether you look at genmab, i-mab.
we've done a number of nice transactions in this space with that amount of capital. i'll let mike speak to future opportunities as well.
michael severino -- vice chairman and president
in terms of areas in which we would expect to be active between now and the end of 2022, we'll continue to be active in oncology, both in hematological oncology and in solid tumors. that has been an area of focus for us, and i see that continuing as an area of focus. we would certainly like to add to the aesthetics franchise. we've talked about how we will invest and continue to drive that franchise.
and from a business development perspective, i think there are a number of opportunities there that could present themselves in that time frame. and there are other areas that opportunistically we would certainly like to add to. i would point to neuroscience, if we could find the right opportunities and eye care as additional areas where we could be investing.
liz shea -- vice president of investor relations

our next question comes from daniel busby with rbc capital markets. your line is open.
daniel busby -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
hi, good morning. i'd like to ask a follow-up on aesthetics in your high single-digit annual growth target for that business over the next decade. broadly speaking, how much of that growth is dependent on bringing new products to market, such as long and short-acting toxins versus driving continued growth from the aesthetics portfolio that you have today? and second, as your near the one-year anniversary of your acquisition of allergan, can you provide updated thoughts on your appetite for potential divestitures of noncore products and therapeutic areas now that you've had about a year to digest that transaction? thank you.
rick gonzalez -- chairman of the board and chief executive officer
this is rick. i'll cover that and maybe rob can tag team along here. i think if you look at our overall estimate of high single-digit growth on aesthetics, it's not heavily reliant on a large number of new products. there will be new products that come in.
they're probably closer toward the back end of the long-range plan. so they don't have a significant impact on that overall growth rate. so i think we fundamentally believe that the market dynamics are such and the brands are competitive -- highly competitive in this market but we have the ability to grow the market and continue to maintain our share position in that market and that will allow us to be able to drive that level of growth or higher.
rob michael -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes. this is rob. i would just add that. if you look at the aesthetics business, i mean, we'll see significant growth, not just from toxins and fillers but also in body contouring.
so as we think about the potential for that leg of the stool, we think we've got really three key drivers of growth within aesthetics that will help us get to that high single-digit long-term expectation. and again, as rick mentioned, we're not counting on significant contribution on the pipeline, although we will continue to drive innovation, and particularly with the toxins and fillers. and of course, as you've heard before. it's important within body contouring to continue to drive innovation there as well.
and so we feel we're -- very good about that outlook and we're not counting on a ton from the pipeline there.
rick gonzalez -- chairman of the board and chief executive officer
and then on your second question, i would say, even before the allergan acquisition, we constantly looked at our portfolio and determine whether or not there were areas of our business that we ultimately thought. we were interested in divesting. i'd say that's a process that we go through on a fairly consistent basis to ensure that we're maximizing the value of the assets that we have within our portfolio. and so we will continue to do that.
and when we find opportunities where we think that's the right strategy, then we'll execute against that strategy.
liz shea -- vice president of investor relations
thanks daniel.
operator
our next question comes from gary nachman with bmo capital markets. your line is open.
gary nachman -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
thanks. a couple more for me on rinvoq. are you hearing anecdotally any physicians that may be switching patients from xeljanz to rinvoq in ra if there's a perceived safety benefit with rinvoq as a more selective jak? are you able to take advantage of that at all? and then secondly, if rinvoq gets approved for atopic derm, how will you look to build out your presence with dermatologists? will you leverage your current footprint on the aesthetics side or will you have a completely different medical derm team? so just talk about how you go after that opportunity and how you're preparing for it given your clear level of excitement there? thank you.
jeff stewart -- executive vice president, commercial operations
yes. hi. it's jeff, and i'll take both of those. so we are -- we're actually not hearing physicians from our intelligence from our field teams actively thinking to switch patients from xeljanz to rinvoq.
i mean that's a big decision for a physician what we have heard is when we do some of our research and then our ear to the ground, we clearly see that oral surveillance is perceived as a xeljanz issue. typically, what will happen is you may see people take their foot off the gas on some new starts. but we don't see or hear certainly any widespread news of active switching. so that's basically our intelligence here on your first question.
in terms of your second question, we will not be using the aesthetic sales force. we will basically leverage our existing infrastructure that we have with some expansion we've taken place for rinvoq and atopic dermatitis. i think, as you know, that in terms of our reputation among the medical derms is just strong. we have the no.
1 reputation because of the years of humira in psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis and hs. and obviously, we have a very, very strong impression and launch from skyrizi. so we basically designed a sales force that through our management, which has been connected to these derms for about more than a decade. and existing reps with some new reps in there, we are building -- we have built a sales force that will work seamlessly with our skyrizi teams to give a very nice offering to those dermatologists.
and an important fact is that basically, the overlap of those dermatologists that drives basically the atopic derm market is about 90% between the atopic derm market and the psoriasis market. so we feel good, we're well positioned in terms of how we set up our go-to-market approach with this segment.
liz shea -- vice president of investor relations
thanks, gary.
operator
our next question comes from gregg gilbert with truist securities. your line is open.
gregg gilbert -- truist securities -- analyst
thank you. mike, i was interested in your oral psoriasis commentary. are you assuming that a new bar has been set by deucravacitinib in terms of efficacy versus otezla and is that something you're very mindful of as you consider your own programs? and secondly, for rick, i realize abbvie was born out of a company that had devices and pharma under one roof. but clearly, you've embraced in aesthetics, for example, that good franchise building could involve drugs and devices or drugs that need to be delivered by device.
does that apply as you think ahead about ophthalmology or other areas when you consider long-term bd? thank you.
michael severino -- vice chairman and president
so this is mike. i'll take the first question. with respect to oral psoriasis agents, we would want to come in from an efficacy perspective with something that clearly exceeded the threshold that exists in the past with otezla. and i think coming in, in a range that is humira like or better would be our goal.
i think if you look at bms's tyk2, they sort of come in at that humira like efficacy. and so i also think that is the range that we're talking about. i think when 1 talks about a direct comparison in terms of where a bar is set, we have to look not only at efficacy, but it's safety and it's the totality of the data. obviously, it's really extremely early for for our ror game at agent, but we think it is a molecule because it impacts very well understood biology with good understanding of where to go from an efficacy perspective and a good understanding of safety that we get in the range that's very competitive there.
so i think we'd be looking for that humira-like efficacy or the greater as something that we would like to use to enter the space within oral, obviously, coupled with a strong safety profile.
rick gonzalez -- chairman of the board and chief executive officer
on your second question, this is rick. i mean, i think the way we approach the markets that we operate in as we look for areas where there are significant unmet need, and then we ultimately try to come up with solutions for those needs. sometimes it's drug only in fact, i'd say, the majority of some in our historical experience as abbvie has been it was a drug only. but as an example, 951 is a good example of where it's a combination product, right, a device and a drug.
certainly, as we look at ophthalmology, we have implantable devices that were part of the allergan acquisition that are important therapeutic options that are available for physicians and patients. so i'd say we tend to go at it and we're certainly not opposed to devices being part of it. if they can add to the ability to be able to provide for an advancement in standard of care. in aesthetics, as rob indicated a moment ago, we're looking toward what is a big third leg on the stool, and we believe that is body.
and i would say, in the area of body, devices are going to play a much more critical role. and so that's an area where i think you'll see us embrace even device only kinds of strategies because they provide the right solution for that particular improvement. so it's a good area that we, historically, and many of us know well because of our experience, as you pointed out, in our previous life. but i'd say also the teams in the organization itself look for broad-based solutions that can meet the unmet need.
gregg gilbert -- truist securities -- analyst

our last question comes from navin jacob with ubs. your line is open.
navin jacob -- ubs -- analyst
hi. thanks so much for squeezing me in here. a couple, if i may, if we have time. but just on vraylar, you have strong long-term guidance of $4 billion with just the existing indications.
but the script trends at least seem to have slowed down, obviously, in part because neuro has been weak as an overall therapeutic area during the pandemic but just wondering -- and just given that the quarter itself was a little bit weaker, i think, versus expectations, can you talk about the broader neuro market? is there weakness there because we do see strength with ubrelvy and with botox therapeutics? so just wondering if there's something going on specifically with vraylar? has the bipolar depression opportunity been tapped out for some reason? and what can you -- what do you and -- what can you need to do to accelerate growth for vraylar with the existing indications? that's number one. and number two, on rinvoq, i think everyone understands the rates around dvt pe and mace. but if you could give a little bit more clarity on -- based on the updated data that you filed with the agency, what the rate of malignancy is across the indications and whether that's any different between the strengths and how that compares to the background rate. thank you so much.
jeff stewart -- executive vice president, commercial operations
yes, hi. it's jeff. i'll take the vraylar comment. the macro prescription market has been down a little bit versus historical trends but we really think it's simply a timing issue, and i'll give you some numbers that support that.
so before covid hit right in the first quarter of last year, the new-to-brand or the nbrx for vraylar was about 3,500 new-to-brand prescriptions a week. and what we saw is during covid, that dropped down all the way to about 2,700. that was the midyear and then it's consistently come back up. so toward the end of march, we've started to hit or recover that pre-covid historical rate.
so progress is there and ultimately, the way we see these markets functions. as you recover your mbrx momentum, the trxs will start to come. so we're encouraged on the latest trends, but your point is right. it has been a little bit soft on the market.
certainly, as a brand, vraylar dropped because of covid, but is now really fully recovered. and so we should see continued recovery of the momentum there. so hopefully, that helps.
michael severino -- vice chairman and president
so this is mike. i'll take your second question. with respect to the rates of malignancies, excluding non-melanoma skin cancer, that's the way these rates are typically reviewed. i recently described a rate across rinvoq studies with roughly 10,000 patient years experience of 0.8 events per 100-patient years experience.
and that's compared to an expected rate that was 0.9 or higher depending on the estimates. so call it in the range of about 0.9 events, so not different from that expected rate and without any difference between doses. so no evidence a dose response and nothing that we've seen in the recent work that we've done changes that view in any way.
liz shea -- vice president of investor relations

operator
good morning and thank you for standing by. welcome to the abbvie first-quarter 2021 earnings conference call. [operator instructions] i would now like to introduce ms. liz shea, vice president of investor relations.
you may begin.
liz shea -- vice president of investor relations
good morning and thanks for joining us. also on the call with me today are rick gonzalez, chairman of the board and chief executive officer; michael severino, vice chairman and president; rob michael, executive vice president and chief financial officer; and jeff stewart, executive vice president, commercial operations. joining us for the q&a portion of the call is laura schumacher, vice chairman, external affairs, chief legal officer, and corporate secretary. before we get started, i remind you that some statements we make today may be considered forward-looking statements for purposes of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995.
the abbie cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. additional information about these risks and uncertainties is included in our sec filings. abbvie undertakes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements, except as required by law. on today's conference call, non-gaap financial measures will be used to help investors understand abbvie's business performance.
these non-gaap financial measures are reconciled with comparable gaap financial measures in our earnings release and regulatory filings from today, which can be found on our website. unless otherwise noted, our commentary on sales growth is on a comparable basis, which includes full current year and historical results for allergan. for this comparison of underlying performance, all historically reported allergan revenues have been recast to conform to abbvie's revenue recognition accounting policies and excluded the divestitures of zenpep and biotape. references to operational growth further excludes the impact of exchange.
following our prepared remarks, we'll take your questions. so with that, i'll now turn the call over to rick. 
rick gonzalez -- chairman of the board and chief executive officer
thank you, liz. good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. i'll discuss our first-quarter performance and outlook. and then jeff, mike and rob will review our business highlights, pipeline progress, and financial results in more detail.
we're off to an excellent start this year, delivering strong top and bottom line first-quarter performance. we reported adjusted earnings per share of $2.95, exceeding the midpoint of our guidance by $0.14. total adjusted net revenues of $12.9 billion was up 5.2%. on a comparable operational basis, nearly $250 million ahead of our expectations.
these results include strong performance across each of our core therapeutic areas, including double-digit comparable operational revenue growth from immunology, neuroscience, and aesthetics as well as high single-digit operational growth from hematological oncology. additionally, we continue to see robust sales from our key and newly launched products. skyrizi and rinvoq contributed nearly $900 million in combined revenues this quarter, more than double the sales versus the prior year as both products continue to ramp in their initial indications. imbruvica and venclexta delivered combined sales of approximately $1.7 billion, reflecting continued leadership in cll and other hematological malignancies.
baylor, which remains one of the fastest-growing medicines in psychiatry delivered more than 20% comparable operational growth. ubrelvy, the leading oral cgrp for acute migraine, generated revenue growth of approximately 25% on a sequential basis. and within our leading aesthetics portfolio, which is performing well above pre-covid levels, botox cosmetics and juvederm are demonstrating robust performance. both of these brands grew more than 40% on a comparable operational basis.
the integration of allergan also continues to go very well. as illustrated by our balanced results this quarter, we are clearly demonstrating that we have created a stronger and much more diverse company with the scale and flexibility to fully invest in the business for long-term growth. while the pandemic has categorically impacted our day-to-day lives, we are encouraged by the latest recovery trend. we see market growth and new patient activity increasing overall, especially in march, although certain markets continue to remain below pre-covid levels, including cll and hcv in particular.
we expect the increasing vaccinations globally will continue to support a full recovery across our therapeutic areas as we progress through the remainder of this year. based on a robust performance this quarter and the continued strong outlook for our business, we are raising our full-year 2021 eps guidance. and we now expect adjusted earnings per share between $12.37 and $12.57, reflecting growth of more than 18% at the midpoint. i'm also extremely pleased with our r&d prospects, including the number and potential of the opportunities, especially within our late-stage pipeline.
we're on the cusp of the potential commercial approval of more than a dozen new products or indications over the next two years, including five total expected approvals in 2021. this includes atogepant, a novel oral cgrp for episodic migraine, adding to our already attractive migraine portfolio; a new eye drop for the treatment of presbyopia, as well as expanded indications for rinvoq in psoriatic arthritis and colloseum spondylitis, ankylosing spondylitis, and atopic dermatitis, and we expect more than half a dozen new product or indication launches in 2022, including navitoclax for myelofibrosis, abbv-951 for advanced parkinson's disease, skyrizi for psoriatic arthritis and crohn's disease, rinvoq for ulcerative colitis, vraylar for major depressive disorder, and initial indications for imbruvica and venclexta. with these collective new growth opportunities and the continued momentum of our underlying portfolio, our long-term outlook remains very strong. in closing, our focus remains on strong commercial and operational execution as well as pipeline advancement.
i'm pleased with the financial results for the quarter and the overall pace of the recovery across our portfolio. we're off to another excellent start in 2021. with that, i'll turn the call over to jeff for additional comments on our commercial highlights. jeff?
jeff stewart -- executive vice president, commercial operations
thank you, rick. we demonstrated strong and balanced growth across our therapeutic portfolio this quarter, a testament to our differentiated product profiles and commercial execution. our immunology portfolio delivered global revenues of more than $5.7 billion, reflecting growth of nearly 12% on an operational basis. humira sales were approximately $4.9 billion, up 2.6% on an operational basis with continued high single-digit growth in the u.s.
offset by biosimilar competition across our international markets, where the unfavorable impact was more moderate than expected in the quarter. our new immunology agents skyrizi and rinvoq are both demonstrating robust prescription growth, well above all comparable launches. skyrizi sales were $574 million, reflecting 34% in-play patient share, which includes new and switching patients. this is more than double the share capture of the next nearest biologic competitor.
skyrizi total prescription share in the u.s. psoriasis biologic market is now approximately 15%, second only to humira. additionally, we recently received approval for a single-dose prefilled pen for skyrizi, which will reduce the number of injections per treatment. skyrizi is now the only quarterly dose psoriasis treatment available in an auto injector, further improving the patient experience.
rinvoq sales were $303 million with strong in-play patient share of approximately 15% in the u.s. ra market. physician and patient feedback remain very positive on rinvoq's level of efficacy, speed of response, and strong benefit risk profile. internationally, both of these new assets delivered strong double-digit sequential growth with ramping access in share.
skyrizi has now also achieved in-play patient share leadership in the eu5 psoriasis market, exceeding tremfya and cosentyx and at parity with taltz. as mike will discuss momentarily, we are also making considerable progress to expand the uses of skyrizi and rinvoq in several immune-mediated diseases with half a dozen additional indication approvals expected later this year and in 2022. in hematologic oncology, sales were approximately $1.7 billion, up 7.3% on an operational basis. imbruvica continues to perform well across multiple indications, including cll, where it remains the clear market share leader across all lines of therapy.
imbruvica sales increased 2.9% on an operational basis this quarter with performance impacted by lower new patient starts within cll, where the market remains below pre-covid levels. imbruvica growth was also unfavorably impacted by the covid-relating stocking benefit that we saw in the first quarter of 2020. venclexta sales were $405 million, up 24.5% on an operational basis with increasing share in frontline cll and continued strong performance in aml. in neuroscience, revenues were more than $1.2 billion, up 10.9% on a comparable operational basis.
vraylar once again delivered strong growth. sales of $346 million were up 21.2% on a comparable operational basis, reflecting a nearly 2.5% total prescription share of the u.s. atypical anti-psychotic market. within migraine, the launch of ubrelvy is exceeding our expectations, with $81 million of revenue in the quarter.
feedback from physicians has been very positive, highlighting ubrelvy's efficacy, safety, convenient dosing profile, and overall commercial access. ubrelvy is the no. 1 brand in acute treatment for migraine based on both new patient share and prescription growth. the oral cgrp therapies, including our leading ubrelvy, now represent roughly 16% of new prescriptions in the large acute migraine market.
we believe there's substantial room for long-term growth in this rapidly expanding segment based on unmet need and strong patient demand. we also look forward to the expected commercial approval of atogepant, our oral cgrp for episodic migraine later this year. botox therapeutic is seeing a very nice recovery in chronic migraine as well as its other indications with total sales of $532 million, up 7% on a comparable operational basis. lastly, in our other key therapeutic areas, we saw significant contribution from eye care, which had revenues of $817 million.
mavyret sales were $415 million, down 28.4% on an operational basis as treated patient volumes have remained below pre-covid levels. and we also saw double-digit comparable growth from linzess, the leading branded prescription medicine in the u.s. for the treatment of adults with ibs-c or chronic idiopathic constipation. overall, i'm extremely pleased with our execution across the therapeutic portfolio, including the progress we are making with recent new product launches.
we remain on track to deliver a very strong revenue growth in 2021. and with that, i'll turn the call over to mike for additional comments on the r&d programs. mike?
michael severino -- vice chairman and president
thank you, jeff. i'll start with immunology, where we continue to make good progress with rinvoq and skyrizi in new disease areas as well as in our early and mid-stage immunology programs. we recently reported positive top-line results from the second induction study for rinvoq in ulcerative colitis. similar to results from the first induction study, in this phase iii trial, rinvoq demonstrated a very strong impact on disease activity as measured by clinical remission, clinical response, and endoscopic improvement.
the 45-milligram induction dose was well tolerated, and the safety profile was consistent with previous rinvoq studies. in these induction trials, we saw no dvt, pe, mace events or malignancies in the rinvoq groups, and the rates of serious adverse events were numerically lower than placebo. we believe these induction data compare very favorably to other uc treatments on the market or in development. and based on the data generated to date, rinvoq has the potential to become one of the most highly effective therapies for patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis.
we expect to see results from the uc maintenance study this summer with regulatory submissions anticipated in the second half of the year. the rinvoq programming crohn's disease is also progressing very well. and we expect to see induction data from the first of two phase iii trials in the fourth quarter, followed by induction data from a second phase iii trial and maintenance data in the first half of 2022. we're also nearing completion of our pivotal program for skyrizi in crohn's disease.
earlier this year, we reported positive results from the two crohn's induction studies, and we expect to see maintenance data this summer. our regulatory submissions for skyrizi and crohn's disease remain on track for the second half of 2021. following completion of our registrational program for skyrizi in psoriatic arthritis, we recently submitted our regulatory applications in the u.s. and europe with approval decisions expected in the first half of 2022.
we're very pleased with the level of activity we saw with skyrizi on both joint disease and skin clearance in our phase iii program and look forward to providing this new treatment to patients suffering from psoriatic arthritis. our regulatory submissions are currently under review for rinvoq in three new indications in the u.s.: ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis, and atopic dermatitis. as we previously announced, the fda recently extended the review period for rinvoq in psoriatic arthritis and atopic dermatitis, following a request for an updated assessment of the benefit risk profile for rinvoq in these indications. in response to the fda request, we provided updated data from across rinvoq programs in ra, psoriatic arthritis, and atopic dermatitis.
based on the review extensions, we now expect approval decisions for psoriatic arthritis in june and for atopic dermatitis in july. the regulatory action date for rinvoq in ankylosing spondylitis is unchanged and remains on track for june. we remain confident in the benefit risk profile of rinvoq across all indications, and we'll work with the fda to bring rinvoq to market in these new disease areas. earlier this year, we received european approval for rinvoq in psoriatic arthritis and as.
our european regulatory application for rinvoq in atopic dermatitis is under review and we remain on track for a chmp opinion this summer with an approval decision anticipated in the third quarter. we also recently saw results from a four-week phase ib study evaluating our novel small molecule rorî³t inverse agonist, abbv-157, in patients with psoriasis. by targeting rorî³t with an inverse agonist rather than an antagonist, we believe we can more effectively inhibit il-17 production, thus resulting in a greater impact on skin inflammation. in our phase ib study, 157 showed promising activity as an oral psoriasis agent and we plan to move the asset forward to a larger phase iib dose ranging study in the second half of this year.
moving now to our oncology portfolio. we continue to make very good progress with our late-stage programs for imbruvica, venclexta and navitoclax as well as with our early stage oncology assets. we remain on track for several key regulatory submissions, data presentations and stage transitions this year. at the upcoming asco and eha meetings, we will be presenting more than 40 abstracts, including results from the imbruvica plus venclexta captivate trial fixed-duration cohort in treatment-naive cll patients.
the imbruvica-venclexta combination is an important element of our hema-on strategy to provide a differentiated fixed duration treatment that offers deeper levels of response. data from our imbruvica-venclexta combination studies will support regulatory submissions in frontline cll later this year. we will also be presenting four-year follow-up data from venclexta's cll 14 trial in frontline cll as well as updated efficacy and safety data from a phase ib study evaluating venclexta plus azacitidine in treatment-naive, high-risk mds patients. we expect this mds study to complete in the second half of this year.
and if positive, it could support a submission in the first half of 2022 to seek an accelerated approval. in the area of solid tumors, at the recent aacr meeting, we presented phase ii results for teliso-v in non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer. in this study, teliso-v demonstrated promising response rates in heavily pretreated patients, particularly in patients with highly expressed cmet, where we saw a 54% objective response rate. cmet is an attractive target across multiple tumor types, particularly in non-small cell lung cancer, where approximately 30% of patients have overexpressed cmet.
approaches in this area have historically focused on small molecule kinase inhibitors and anti-cmet antibodies, both of which have shown only limited efficacy in this patient population that has not been sufficient for approval. in contrast, our cmet antibody drug conjugate is a novel approach that we believe will have broader applicability and will provide enhanced efficacy compared to previous approaches. we recently began the second stage of our phase ii study, which has the potential to support an accelerated approval in second-line plus metastatic non-squamous, non-small cell lung cancer. we also plan to evaluate teliso-v in the frontline setting, including in combination with other agents as well as in other cmet positive tumor types.
we also have a next-generation cmet adc program that will be entering the clinic later this year. our new cmet adc, abbv-400 utilizes a topoisomerase inhibitor payload, which we believe will provide greater anti-tumor efficacy against both amplified met and overexpressed cmet subtypes, thus providing deeper responses with broader applicability than other anti cmet targeting agents. in neuroscience, we recently presented data from several key programs at the american academy of neurology annual meeting. a total of 33 abstracts were presented, including data from the phase iii advance study in episodic migraine prevention, showing that atogepant has the potential to be a highly effective, safe and well-tolerated oral treatment option with a rapid onset action.
the fda recently accepted our nda for atogepant for the prevention of episodic migraine, and an approval decision is expected in september of this year. we also presented results from an open-label phase iii study evaluating ubrelvy in peri menstrual migraine, which showed that ubrelvy has potential as a safe and efficacious treatment for migraine attacks that occurred during or near menstruation. menstrual-related migraine attacks can be more difficult to treat because they are often longer in duration, more severe and often resistant to treatment. and we presented data from a phase i study demonstrating that abbv-951 subcutaneous infusions maintain an equivalent levodopa exposure to duopa in advanced parkinson's patients.
results from the pivotal program for abbv 951 are expected this summer with the regulatory submissions anticipated in the second half of this year. we also remain on track for readouts in the fourth quarter from two phase iii studies for vraylar, an adjunctive major depressive disorder. and if successful, we would anticipate regulatory submissions in the first half of 2022. in eye care, we submitted our regulatory application in the u.s.
for agn-190584 for the treatment of symptoms associated with presbyopia. 584 is a once-daily eyedrop being developed to help address symptoms that are often corrected through reading glasses. this new technology represents a complementary product to reading glasses and would be a convenient on-demand solution for patients with mild to moderate presbyopia. an approval decision is expected in the fourth quarter of this year.
and in aesthetics, we are investing to accelerate key next-generation toxins and filler programs. by combining the aesthetic team's deep expertise with abbvie's breadth and scale of resources, we'll be able to bring novel products to market significantly faster. looking across our portfolio, we've identified a number of programs to accelerate, including our short-acting and long-acting toxins as well as our next-generation bio-stimulatory tropoelastin and collagen fillers. acceleration of these programs is expected to drive significant long-term growth for the aesthetics franchise.
so in summary, we've continued to make significant progress with our pipeline to start the year and we look forward to many more data readouts, regulatory submissions and approvals throughout the remainder of 2021. with that, i'll turn the call over to rob for additional comments on our first-quarter performance and financial outlook. rob?
rob michael -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thank you, mike. starting with first-quarter results, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $2.95, up 21.9% compared to prior year and above our guidance midpoint. total adjusted net revenues were $12.9 billion, up 5.2% on a comparable operational basis, excluding a 1.1% favorable impact from foreign exchange. the adjusted operating margin ratio was 51% of sales, an improvement of 120 basis points versus the prior year.
this includes adjusted gross margin of 83.9% of sales, adjusted r&d investment of 11.6% of sales, and adjusted sg&a expense of 21.2% of sales. net interest expense was $622 million and the adjusted tax rate was 12.3%. as rick previously mentioned, we are raising our full-year adjusted earnings per share guidance to between $12.37 and $12.57, reflecting growth of 18.1% at the midpoint. excluded from this guidance is $5.10 of known intangible amortization and specified items.
this guidance now contemplates full-year revenue growth of 9.8% on a comparable operational basis. at current rates, we continue to expect foreign exchange to have a 1% favorable impact on full-year comparable sales growth. this implies a full-year revenue forecast of approximately $55.9 billion. included in this guidance are the following updated full year assumptions: we now expect international humira revenue of approximately $3.1 billion and we now expect botox cosmetic sales of approximately $1.9 billion.
all other full-year assumptions remain unchanged. as we look ahead to the second quarter, we anticipate net revenue approaching $13.6 billion. at current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a 1.6% favorable impact on comparable sales growth. we expect adjusted earnings per share between $3.05 and $3.09, excluding approximately $1.78 of known intangible amortization and specified items.
finally, we continue to make great progress on our allergan transaction commitments. we realized over $360 million in expense synergies in the first quarter and are on track to deliver synergies of approximately $1.7 billion in 2021 and greater than $2 billion in 2022. we have already paid down $10.4 billion of combined company debt. we continue to expect cumulative debt paydown of $17 billion by the end of 2021, with further deleveraging through 2023.
this will bring our net leverage ratio to 2.4 times by the end of 2021 and approximately two times by the end of 2022. in closing, we are off to an excellent start to the year, with strong performance across the portfolio and financial results ahead of our expectations. with that, i'll turn the call back over to liz.
liz shea -- vice president of investor relations
thanks, rob. we will now open the call for questions. [operator instructions] operator, first question, please.
",2021-Q1,ABB
1.0,1.0,,1.0,2021-07-22 06:00:00,"prepared remarks:
ann-sofie nordh
greetings to you all, and welcome to the presentation of our q2 results. i'm ann-sofie nordh, head of investor relations. and as per usual, i have our ceo, bjorn rosengren; and cfo, timo ihamuotila, with me here today. they will take you through the presentation, after which we open up for a q&a session.
however, before we begin, i would like to draw your attention to the information regarding safe harbor notices and our use of non-gaap measures on slide 2 of the presentation. this conference call will include forward-looking statements, and these statements are based on the company's current expectations and certain assumptions and are therefore subject to risks and uncertainties. and with that said, we will now kick off today's session, and we will do so with a short video related to the ra's recent small acquisition of asti.
and with that, i will now pass you over to bjorn and timo to take you through the results.
bjorn rosengren -- chief executive officer
thank you, ann-sofie, and a warm welcome from me as well. first, as you saw in the opening video, we have a new member of the abb robotic family. asti is a leader in autonomous mobile robots, or as we call them, amrs. this acquisition is a great example of our new division-led m&a process.
so let's take a look at the q2. it's great to see a strong performance, both overall and in all our four business areas. even though our comparison from last year was the lowest during the pandemic, we now saw demand improve significantly versus last year but also slightly up sequentially. on top of the strong underlying markets, there was an impact of stock building.
but our teams have done a really good job in handling certain component shortages in the q2 and managed to limit impacts on our customers' deliveries. that said, we expect to see continued challenges in supply chain in the coming quarters in part of our businesses. we delivered a step profit improvement in q2, which was helped by higher volumes; a cost base, which is still impacted by the pandemic; and price increases coming through and largely offsetting increases in raw material costs. i'm also pleased that we managed to deliver another quarter of solid cash flow.
so far this year, we have generated 1.2 billion. this sets up nicely for the delivery in 2021, as we have promised. as you can see, on the order charge on this side, we have had a positive sequential momentum since the lowest point in summer last year. in total, comparable orders were up by 24% year over year.
and the key drivers was increased customer activity in most segments of the short-cycle business. we also saw comparable orders in our service business, which was up as much as 20%. we have earlier flagged that we expected improvements in the process-related businesses during the second half of this year. now we see signals of that, with a positive development in several industries.
in the q2 order numbers, there is an element of customer building stocks. in this environment with strong underlying markets, combined with component shortages and cost inflation, many act to secure ability to deliver. we are managing incoming customer orders in an effort to avoid too much inventory volatility in the end-to-end supply chain. now let's take a quick look at the different regions on slide 5.
growth was strong in all three regions. we already touched upon the pandemic impact last year. so on low comparables both in americas and europe improved by more than 40 and 20%. note that europe was actually up 30% when looking at the base orders.
you also remember that amea, driven by china, recovered sooner. still, the region and china noted strong growth of 50% in the quarter, supported by strong development in all our bas. as i've said on numerous occasions, a quality company like abb should deliver a margin of over 15%. i'm pleased that we've reached that level in the q2 and thereby shown that it is possible, even though we are not there yet on a yearly basis.
in the quarter, we benefited from strong markets, price increases and efficiency measures, while the overall cost basis is still fairly slimmed on the back of the pandemic. importantly, we increased the gross margin by 140 basis points and three out of four business areas improved, but we know we face some headwinds in the coming quarters. cost levels will come up for raw materials. freight and travel spend and impacts from component shortages will be challenged.
all in all, our performance was strong in q2. although we are ahead of schedule for reaching our long-term targets, we do see sequential challenges in coming quarters, but we are working hard to mitigate these. and with that, i hand over to timo to take us through the numbers in more details.
timo ihamuotila -- chief financial officer
thanks, bjorn. and now let's take a look at the results of our business areas, and let's start with electrification, where we saw solid improvements in virtually all customer segments. it was really only oil and gas which was the moderate side of this. this led to a double-digit order growth in all divisions, supported by the three regions.
and as you can see on the slide, the absolute levels are high also in a historical perspective. now bjorn mentioned a certain impact from stockpiling, and el is the area where this was noticeable. we have consciously tried to safeguard the quality of the order book when taking orders. in total, comparable orders grew 28% and revenues by 17% and the order backlog increased by 9%.
the high volumes drove better cost absorption. el also benefited from the earlier implemented price increases, all the while raw materials remained partially hedged at a still relatively low level. as we have highlighted earlier, this will gradually change in q3 and q4 as raw materials, both at higher rates, are used in production. i'm really, really pleased to see a continued strong performance from el as they improved operational ebita 70% year on year and increased the margin by 480 basis points to the good level of 17.4%.
looking ahead at the third quarter, we anticipate growth rates to reflect the easy comparable from last year and reach a double-digit pace for both orders and revenues, with orders growing more than revenues. sequentially, there will be some margin headwinds from commodities and fixed cost. let's then turn to slide 8 and business area motion, which delivered yet another quarter of solid performance. as you can see in the charts on the q2 levels for both orders and revenues are high in a historical perspective at around usd 1.9 billion.
this was driven by a strong short-cycle business across all segments. and it is fair to say that also here, we noted some stockpiling among customers, although the team has consciously focused on maintaining a good quality in the order backlog. there were positive indications also in the project business, although it remains to come through in the numbers. in total, comparable orders were up by 16% and revenues increased by 11%.
the operational ebita margin of 17.7% is also high if you compare to history, and you can see it in the chart on the right-hand side of the slide. it remained stable year on year as the adverse impact from the geographical mix was offset by the contribution from additional volume. just like for electrification, the headwind from the raw material costs will increase sequentially in motion when older hedges start to phase out. we are also carefully watching the tightening of the supply in areas of semiconductors and electrical steel, which could particularly impact drive products division.
we do expect somewhat longer lead times in our customer deliveries near term. for the third quarter, we anticipate comparable growth in orders and revenues to be somewhat below what it was reported in q2. next on slide 9, we look at process automation, where growth returned to positive territory for comparable orders and revenues at 11 and 4%, respectively, admittedly from a low level in q2 last year when the quarter was heavily impacted by the pandemic. the positive development was driven by broad-based improvements in the product, as well as the service businesses.
we have earlier indicated that we expect the business environment for the process-related business to improve in the second half of the year, and we now see signs of that realizing. we also saw initial positive signs for service business in the cruise segment, which have been weak during the past quarters, as you know.it looks like customers are gearing up for an uptick in the actual cruising activities, which of course will drive the service business in ba. ba delivered a significant lift of 410 basis points in the operational ebita margin into the target range on higher volumes, stronger mix from higher share of service business and impact from cost measures. this triggered a 67% increase in profit.
in q3, we expect growth in both orders and revenues to be higher than in q2, supporting a second half '21 recovery. on slide 10, we turn to robotics & discrete automation. and as you see in the order chart, the positive sequential momentum continued into q2. year-on-year growth for comparable orders was very strong at 41% from the low level last year, and it was strong in both the robotics, as well as in machine automation divisions and across regions and segments.
looking at the drivers, it is only really the automotive segment, which does not contribute to growth. and as you know from before, we are applying a strategic approach in the segment to deselect systems business orders with low abb content. this is an action to improve the quality of revenues to drive profitability long term. we started this already last year, so the impact on growth in orders should phase out toward the end of the year, while it will roll over a bit into early next year in revenues.
in q2, the automotive business orders were a bit over 20% of total ra business area orders, in line with the above-mentioned strategy execution. comparable revenues rose by 22% with contribution from both divisions improving from last year's low level and a generally strong development in the short-cycle business. the operational ebita margin of 11.5% was up 470 basis points year on year, with substantial improvements in both divisions. the rise was primarily driven by better cost absorption due to higher volumes, positive mix from higher share of service revenues and previously implemented cost measures.
we see some near-term risk for delayed customer deliveries due to semiconductor constraints, particularly in machine and factory automation. looking to q3, we expect growth rates for comparable orders and revenues to be lower than for q2, given higher comparables and also earlier-mentioned supply constraints. we look next at the group revenues and operational ebita bridge on slide 11. as you see in this table, the strongest contribution to the year-on-year progression comes from the organic development.
the volume leverage was good, and we also benefited from our earlier cost actions and somewhat abnormally low discretionary spending still. then to cash. now this is my favorite slide in the pack, and i'm really pleased with how we have made cash come through so far this year. after the strong q1, cash flow from operating activities in q2 amounted to 663 million.
higher earnings is the key driver, but the team has also done a good job at containing the net working capital in this period of strong growth and keeping it broadly stable year on year, while it was up from the previous quarter. for the first half of the year, our cash flow from continuous operations is up by about 950 million from last year. this is a very good start for what we expect to be a year when we see meaningful improvement in our cash delivery. but then to finish off, i just quickly want to discuss the outlook statement.
we lift our projection for comparable revenue growth in 2021 to just below 10%. this compares to the previous statement of about 5% or higher. the short cycle is already supportive and more so than we initially thought at the beginning of the year. we also feel we have stronger conviction in the process-related recovery, including the service business in the cruise segment.
our operational ebita margin in 2021 should improve at a strong pace toward our 2023 margin target. this is a change from the earlier statement of a steady pace and reflects the strong start to the year. in q3, growth rates for comparable orders and revenues will benefit from the lower base due to the covid-19 impact in 2020. we anticipate comparable revenue growth of about 10% year on year with, again, higher growth rate for orders.
on the margin side in q3, i want to mention some key items to keep in mind. we anticipate positive support year on year from a good market situation and a good mix from recovering service revenues. on the other hand, and we have mentioned it earlier in this presentation, we know we will have some sequential pressure from higher input costs, component shortages, most likely, and also increasing cost, for example, from travel as the pandemic-related restrictions hopefully continue to ease. let's see how things pan out, but i at least wanted to mention these factors.
and with that, i would like to hand it back over to bjorn.
bjorn rosengren -- chief executive officer
thank you, timo. and i would just like to share another two slides with you. the first one being the asti deal, which is a good example how the businesses drive the m&a agenda. ra acquires a leading supplier of autonomous mobile robotics or amrs.
it complements them well and further extends the offering of increased flexibility in production. asti offers a portfolio that covers all major applications, enabled by versatile software suites. it has had a close to 30% annual growth since 2015 and is aiming for about 50 million in revenues this year. i expect to see more of these small and mid-sized deals going forward.
we have a strong balance sheet, and we want to use it to grow and add value. lastly, i would like to update you on the progress we are making toward the reduction of our carbon emissions in keeping with the goals of the paris agreement. you already know that our target is to achieve a carbon neutrality in our own operations by 2030. as part of delivering on that, we have joined the initiatives by the international nonprofit climate group.
they include electrifying our fleet of more than 10,000 vehicles, sourcing 100% of our electricity from renewables and establishing energy efficiency targets and deploying energy management systems at all of our sites. our reduction targets are now confirmed to be aligned with the science-based targets initiatives and is in line with the 1.5-degree scenario of the paris agreement. these are all measures and steps for us to deliver on our long-term sustainability targets. and with that, i ask ann-sofie to open up the q&a session.
ann-sofie nordh
thanks, bjorn and timo. but actually, before we move into the q&a, i would just like to do a little bit of a commercial break and take this opportunity to welcome you to our capital markets day, which we're hosting after the summer. on the 29th of september, first of all, we invite you to helsinki to meet with the motion team. and on this day, you will learn more about their offering and strategy and also visit their operations on-site.
then secondly, on 7th of december, we will host a group cmd here in zurich. and on this occasion, we will focus on the topic of sustainable transport. and of course, that is on top of the update of the strategic process for the group. and of course, this is all covid-permitting, but you will be able to join us both on-site and virtually.
so now we open for q&a. [operator instructions]
i can already now see that we have a queue for questions. [operator instructions] so now we'll go to the first question. and i hope we have alex virgo on the line from bank of america merrill lynch. alex are with us?
alex virgo -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
i am indeed. ann-sofie thanks very much. good morning to you bjorn and timo. so two questions then, please.
the first one, i wondered if you could just go through, in a little bit more detail, the divisional performance in demand terms in china, just to give us a little bit of color around the sequential development momentum there and also thinking about how we've started q3. and then second question, i wondered if you could just give us an indication of how much you think inventory building or stockpiling has helped or contributed to the growth you've seen in el and mo.
bjorn rosengren -- chief executive officer
thank you, alex. yes. i mean, first, we have 21 divisions. it will take me the whole day to go through each of them.
but if we look at the four businesses we have, we see we have double-digit growth, i mean, in the chinese market. but of course, sticking out as usual here is electrification and motion, who has a great development in the chinese market. so yes, i mean you should also know that the comparison numbers in china, we had growth actually last year also. so it's been the growth engine for the whole last year, but we still had 15%.
so this was positive to see that growth continues in china. on the stockpiling, we think it's like timo said, it's -- mainly we see it in the electrification business. and we say with maybe 1 to 2% effect on the group that's a little bit how we look upon it.
timo ihamuotila -- chief financial officer
yes.
bjorn rosengren -- chief executive officer
maybe you want to add something there, timo?
timo ihamuotila -- chief financial officer
no, that's exactly right. about 1.5% or so in the group and maybe three-ish% or a bit more on electrification, so it's actually down as an impact from q1 when we said about 5% in electrification.great, thanks very much.
thanks alex.
ann-sofie nordh
thanks, alex. and then we take the next question, daniela costa from goldman sachs. are you there?
daniela costa -- goldman sachs -- analyst
yes, i'm here. good morning everyone. thanks for taking my question. i'll ask two as well.
but on the first one, i wanted to understand, so do you still keep within your margin guidance? you mention the upper end of the guidance for 2023, but would be interesting to hear from you, given the strong performance so far, what would -- what could be the headwinds that would take you away for that already being met in 2022, if any? and then my second question, i think, last quarter, you kind of alluded to doing some review within process automation that you think you were going to present to the board in october. but can you give us a little bit more color exactly what are you looking at there, given all that you have done already in the portfolio so far? those are my questions.
bjorn rosengren -- chief executive officer
thank you, daniela. yes, on the -- what we guided, it's correct that it's great to see 15%, as i said before, in a quarter. and for me, this is, of course, show that it is possible to reach over 15%. you know that's my viewpoint.
a company like abb should be above these numbers. i don't think, on the other hand, that we are there yet. so we -- it's one quarter. we have still quarters to come, and they are a little bit challenging for the next quarters when it comes to these material prices, as well as supplies of semiconductors and anything.
and it's like us -- with us, like everybody else, we don't really know what the real effect is going to be. so we're just a little bit cautious on that part, yes. what is margin? yes, we are ahead of schedule. i think you -- i've said that before.
we still have the margin corridor for 2023. when we feel that we are there, we might make adjustments. but i think this is, from my perspective, a step-target in the direction where i believe abb should be in the long term. but it's a great improvement from all the businesses.
everybody has been contributing well during this quarter, so i'm very pleased with this performance. then on pa. yes, pa is a little bit different from many of the businesses that i have been working with before. it's a lot of learning for me to understand what makes this business tick, what is the actual potential for this going forward.
so we actually spend quite a lot of time understanding this business and what we need to do to get this business up to the profit levels where we are in the group. and that's a journey. i think they have great ambitions in that business to improve, like every other business that we have, so we continue to do that. it's correct.
i said that we will have a special review of this in september because the board also wants to understand this business, what are the potential for the future. nothing else to add at this stage. but good to see the 12.5% really coming from the service kicking in back again. so that's good news for abb.
i hope that's -- the answer, that's ok.
daniela costa -- goldman sachs -- analyst
perfect, thank you.
bjorn rosengren -- chief executive officer
thank you.
ann-sofie nordh
thanks, daniela. and now we move to andreas willi at j.p. morgan. you there andreas?
andreas willi -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
yeah, thank you. good morning bjorn, timo, ann. thank you for the time. my first question is around the raw material component in -- maybe more the raw material impact.
you normally give a little bit more commentary on near-term margins for some of the divisions that you have given earlier in your speech, timo, particularly outside electrification. maybe you could clarify a little bit what do you expect the negative impact to be relative to the likely still positive impact from continued sequential revenue growth or maybe an indication where -- what the impact would have been if you were not protected by hedges still in q2. that's my first question. and the second one on the asti acquisition.
could you give some indication on the kind of range of revenue multiple you paid for this business? and does this highlight a much broader planned expansion or targeted expansion into kind of assembly -- into logistics, robots from kind of the assembly focus historically?
timo ihamuotila -- chief financial officer
yes. thanks, andreas. why don't i start with the raw material impact question? so we'll go business area by business area and talk a little bit about the drivers. so first of all, in electrification, when we look at this sequentially, we're also, of course, coming from a very high level of 17.4%.
and there, we said that we are expecting to see the raw mat -- materials, particularly if you look at copper, a little bit also on the steel to have a negative impact. on the other hand, so far, the team has done a really good job in pricing, but kind of like compensating everything with pricing is getting, i would say, much more difficult going into q3. then if you look at motion, we have impact there. we would also expect, of course, to see a negative impact.
but there, i think we'll also have a bit of a positive divisional mix on the other side of the equation. and then maybe the bigger question mark in motion is really, again, the semiconductors because that could then really impact the deliveries. but so far, the teams have managed that really, really well. and then if you look at pa, there is less impact on the raw materials.
and as we say, we expect stronger order growth, stronger revenue growth in pa going into q3. and also, the services growth was already now better than the overall growth, so we would not expect that much impact on this topic on pa. and in ra, it also is maybe a bit less on the raw material price and a bit more on the component side, especially in the machine and factory automation. so those are really the dynamics.
bjorn rosengren -- chief executive officer
good. and if we look at asti, it's great to see. we moved the strategy of m&a process toward the divisions, and they've been working hard, i think, all our divisions, to identify potential acquisition objects. this is the first one.
and of course, we are encouraged about this. it's a small, nice company that is in growth mode, good technology. and we think we can utilize the platform of robotics' global structure to drive good growth and good improvement here. so it's well in line with the strategy.
we didn't disclose the price. that's pretty clear, but we all know that everything is expensive today. so of course, we paid a good multiple for this business also. on the other hand --
timo ihamuotila -- chief financial officer
reasonable.
bjorn rosengren -- chief executive officer
reasonable. no, i admit, it's not crazy. i think we all think that this will add a lot of value to abb going forward. and this is a typical one of these growth strategic opportunities where we need to.
and this was a little bit of a black spot in us, we didn't have this technology, and i think this will speed up our presence in this way. how they will go forward? yes, this is related to a lot of material transports and logistics also. so there are a lot of applications areas where we can use this. and that's -- in combination with the robots, it really helps our customer to become much more flexible in their production facility, so -- and also distribution centers and so on.
so it's a good add-on. so we're very excited about this acquisition. i hope that question was what you expected.
andreas willi -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
thank you very much.
ann-sofie nordh
thanks, andreas. and then we move to ben uglow at morgan stanley. your line is open.
ben uglow -- morgan stanley -- analyst
can you hear me?
ann-sofie nordh
we can hear you.
bjorn rosengren -- chief executive officer
very well.
ben uglow -- morgan stanley -- analyst
good. that's always encouraging. hi, everyone i hope all are well. a couple of questions, please.
bjorn, i'm going to dig a little deeper on your answer to alex's question at the beginning. you kindly told us that, sequentially, demand was getting a bit better. but i guess what we all want to know is, if we think about the second quarter versus the first quarter: number one, is china still on an improving trend, i.e., is it growing? and then if we look at the two other regions, 2q versus 1q, is it fair -- if i look at your orders, is it fair for us to assume that americas is getting better but europe is more stabilized? really just a kind of idea around how 2q has trended the overall level of demand versus 1q. so that was my first question.
bjorn rosengren -- chief executive officer
ok. let's start with that then. yes, china, we have read in some of the reports here that we see a slowdown, but you know that china actually started to grow already in q2 last year. and you remember, we had a slight growth in the china market even though the pandemic was very hot at that time, while we saw big drops in other parts of the world.
china then has become really the growth engine for us, and we're seeing huge growth numbers. what's great to see here, we -- as you remember, we saw growth in q1 also, even though when we look at the comparison, you maybe remember that the pandemic in china actually hit first quarter the last month last year, which made that it maybe looked like we had a little bit more growth from that perspective. second quarter, china was up and running again, so it was a little bit more challenging from that perspective. so we think 15% is very strong, maybe even a little bit surprisingly strong.
and the good thing is it's not only some of the businesses. it's really all four our businesses, even though we see electrification and motion the one sticking out there on the china growth side. so -- and then, of course, the question, how is that going forward? and that's, of course, difficult to see. we can only see a couple of weeks into this month, and we see the trend continues on a strong basis.
how that will be the rest of the quarter, it's difficult to draw any conclusions. so on the q1 and q2, normally, if you look at traditional abb, first quarter, we normally have higher orders than we have revenues. and normally, in second quarter, we normally see revenues coming up, but some sequentially lower orders. this time, actually, orders grew slightly from q1 to q2, which i think shows that we see a strong market.
but it's clear. and our u.s. looks very big on the paper and even europe looks good. if you look at our base orders, we're up 30%, which i think is a more better indicator of the real demand in the market.
but of course, you remember last year, these two markets was severely impacted from the pandemic while china not. so yes, i mean it's difficult to say, but even the q3 was quite severely impacted last year. so we should continue to see strong growth numbers, both in q3 and q4. that's what i expect.
timo ihamuotila -- chief financial officer
and i make a quick --
bjorn rosengren -- chief executive officer
yes, why don't you add on that, timo?
timo ihamuotila -- chief financial officer
yes, just a quick europe comment. because i think, if i remember correctly, ben, you had in your note, sequential down minus four in europe, but we didn't really have any large orders now in europe during q2. whereas if i remember correctly, we actually had in q1, this goes back to bjorn's base order comment.
bjorn rosengren -- chief executive officer
so base order is a better indicator of the real demand, to be honest.
timo ihamuotila -- chief financial officer
and if i look at europe, all the countries are growing really nicely. so it's really, really broad-based in europe at the moment.
ben uglow -- morgan stanley -- analyst
that's a very helpful clarification. and then just one big-picture question. i guess it sort of relates similarly to the questions that andreas asked about asti and the whole kind of amr space. i remember from the capital markets day back in february 2020, i guess it was, that you were beginning to talk a little bit more about, let's call it, the warehousing area and the potential, not just of material handling and logistics, but actually, the warehouse vertical in particular.
and what i wanted to know is that is a sort of different move in terms of customer base, getting away from more sort of industrial customers toward maybe more consumer/retail. how are you thinking big picture about the warehousing space? is this a part of a new strategy, bjorn?
bjorn rosengren -- chief executive officer
i wouldn't say that this is a new strategy, but i think sami and his team has been very clear. we wanted to get away from the system sales from automotive. that's clear. and i think automotive overall is a low-margin business, and we've seen that.
but we see much better margins in general industry, in electronics, but also in the warehousing. and we had a great success lately with amazon and many other customers also within this area. but it's clear, yes, we are looking into this as a strategic area where we are not just looking at the packing, also transports of components and so from the parts. so yes, it is a very strategic area.
it's also a very growth area where we see good potential for both robotics, as well as these amrs.
ben uglow -- morgan stanley -- analyst
super helpful. thank you very much indeed. i'll pass it on
bjorn rosengren -- chief executive officer
thanks, ben.
ann-sofie nordh
thanks, ben. and then we open up for martin wilkie at citi.
martin wilkie -- citi -- analyst
hey, good morning. it's martin from citi. the first question is just coming back to acquisitions, and i realize you're not disclosing the price of the robotics deal you've done this morning. but just more generally, you've obviously got some announced disposals already, maybe you get some more of those when you do the process later in the year.
when you think that you could be getting several billion dollars coming in over the course of the next couple of years or so, how are you thinking about the m&a environment? i mean you commented on the price as being reasonable or full or whatever the wording might be. but is there an environment still where you can buy these higher-tech businesses at really low rates of return? that's the first question.
bjorn rosengren -- chief executive officer
thank you, martin. i think it's a good question. yes, it's -- the acquisition there, we haven't disclosed the price there but said -- but yes, of course, it's a reasonable margin. it's not super high multiples, but it is high multiples for a business like that.
but we think we're selling bigger businesses, which we think is a very good time of doing that. and we're buying a smaller technology business, which will easily be integrated into the divisions and drive growth, but also drive technology development in these places. so i definitely think this is to be expected going forward. all our divisions have been working a year.
it's actually part of their variable compensation to have these potential m&a candidates in this business. and we say also, also on the software side, so the list of potential candidates are growing every day, and we are approaching them. we're looking at what are the synergies, what are the growth opportunities and how can the division drive this. so i think this is an exciting part.
this is going to cost some money going forward. and we have been very clear that the money from these divestments we hopefully can use for this kind of acquisitions. if we don't, yes, of course, we're not going to be a bank. we always said that.
but we have -- the businesses are getting encouraged by this strategy, and we think there are a lot of opportunities here. why don't you add on that, timo?
timo ihamuotila -- chief financial officer
yes. so i think the question is a really good one. and we are, of course, fully aligned here. and we all the time, when we talk with our businesses, we look at make versus buy.
and i think it's important to note that our organic r&d is going up as well. and in this environment, you often get better return on organic r&d, and then you have to complement that with some stuff to get speed. and that's exactly what we are, i think, doing here with asti. but it's not like -- again, i just want to remind that we have a quite structured view on how we look at this and do the comparisons before we went and pulled the trigger.
martin wilkie -- citi -- analyst
that's really helpful. and then the second question is just related to m&a, but on one in the past. so geis, obviously, another good performance from electrification. are all the geis benefits now done and in the margin? so we should see the incremental benefit of those cost savings from geis beginning to sort of peak? or is there still a lot of opportunity from that acquisition as well?
bjorn rosengren -- chief executive officer
i've been very clear that i think this is -- the geis acquisition, one of the biggest value drivers in abb at the moment. and they've done great job in both putting the footprint in place, the one for the future, but also replacing old technology with new abb technology. the journey is not there yet. we still have more factories to close and to consolidate, and there are still replacement of products, especially on the switchgear for the north american market, where we think there is good potential for improvement also going forward.
so we -- there are more to come when it comes to synergies from putting these together. on the other hand, we've seen a tremendous development from the electrification people. and actually, even surprised me that the improvement has gone that fast.
martin wilkie -- citi -- analyst
great, that's very helpful. thank you.
ann-sofie nordh
thank you. and let's see if we have shane mckenna on -- from barclays on the line. you there shane?
shane mckenna -- barclays investment bank -- analyst
i am here. good morning bjorn, timo and ann-sofie. my first question actually is on robotics & discrete automation. just wondering if you can give us a feel for what the drag on margins was in q2 from delivering these legacy turnkey orders, as well as what you're seeing now in terms of the margin profile of the current order book and how that stacks up versus the sort of 13 to 17% midterm target.
and then as an add-on, where are b&r margins now tracking within that range, given the management changes that we had several quarters ago and the growth that you're seeing? and then i have one follow-up question on el.
bjorn rosengren -- chief executive officer
i'll come back on that one. why don't we take the robotic first? let me start, and then i hand over to the part. i have -- we said and we're very clear that our robotic business is a 15-plus business, and that's our target for 2023. i think we are moving in this direction.
we said we'll be over 10% during this year. it's gone a little bit faster there. and yes, the automotive is becoming less. but in our revenues, there is still a certain amount of drag.
so why don't you give a little bit of clarification on that, timo?
timo ihamuotila -- chief financial officer
yes. thanks, bjorn. and thanks, shane, for the question. so we said earlier that this business is maybe sort of more than 100 million.
so on an annual basis, you could say maybe 150 million number, like that. so it is meaningful there. i'm not going to go to the exact margins, but i think it's important to note that now when you look at our orders in robotics & discrete automation business area, automotive is between 20 and 25% of the orders, used to be about 40%. so this is a really meaningful strategy change.
and how we follow this is, of course, through the gross margin. and when we look at the gross margin now in the order backlog of ra, it is clearly trending up. and that will then help us, as we have said, to get clearly back to the corridor without giving any timing stamp here on that matter. and then also in machine and factory automation of b&r, the margin is clearly improving, i would say, toward the target, which bjorn has given us in general.
shane mckenna -- barclays investment bank -- analyst
very clear. in terms of el, are you expecting a similar recovery in oil and gas and conventional power generation demand for that division as we go into h2, as you're guiding within pa? and just trying to get a feel for how alive that segment is in north america for el. i think, from memory, at the divisional level, it's around 20%. is it slightly larger in north america? is that one of the reasons for the sort of lower growth in el in north america relative to peers?
timo ihamuotila -- chief financial officer
so you are checking now oil and gas for electrification, not for process automation? just to make sure we get the question right.
shane mckenna -- barclays investment bank -- analyst
correct, correct. because it's been an end market that you've been calling out for some time that's been sort of holding you back.
timo ihamuotila -- chief financial officer
yes. it is not --
bjorn rosengren -- chief executive officer
it's probably more in pa, i think, than electrification.
timo ihamuotila -- chief financial officer
yes. well, but there is, of course, medium-voltage stuff in that market as well in electrification, but it's not a significant part. but i would say, overall, when you look at the u.s. growth, yes, maybe proportionately, we have a bit more -- a bigger proportion in u.s.
in medium voltage versus low voltage, which probably has impacted the growth a little bit. but i would say the oil and gas is not a huge driver for our el business. it's clearly a bigger driver in the process automation.
shane mckenna -- barclays investment bank -- analyst
very clear. i'll pass it on. thanks a lot.
ann-sofie nordh
thanks, shane. joe giordano at cowen. are you on the line for the next question please?
joe giordano -- cowen and company -- analyst
i'm here. can you guys hear me?
ann-sofie nordh
we can, indeed.
bjorn rosengren -- chief executive officer
we can hear you fine, joey.
joe giordano -- cowen and company -- analyst
hey, good morning. so a few questions on the robotics side. so for asti, i see in the slides, it's mostly auto-levered currently, it's mostly europe-levered. do you see this as a kind of a flagship business that you expand and kind of bolt other acquisitions into? do you have aspirations for this to be like broaden from an end market and geographic perspective for that business?
bjorn rosengren -- chief executive officer
let's talk about robotics a little bit. as you know, robotics has been with abb started up. it was actually one of the really pioneers within this area. it's always been plays in abb, maybe from some people said a little bit of an odd business within the group.
i think it's more coming into the automation and taking a broader viewpoint. we think robot business is one of our really core businesses when it comes to driving -- i mean, transforming the industry's point. and i think it's even getting even more focused now after the pandemic where people see flexibilities coming higher up on the agenda. yes, i mean it's not -- i mean, it's one of our businesses.
we have 21 businesses in abb. and i always said that i think the businesses we are, are no.1 and no.2 in the areas where we operate. i think robotics is a great business. and i think it has more profit potential.
but growth, definitely, this is one of the strongest growth areas that we have in the group going forward. that's pretty clear.
timo ihamuotila -- chief financial officer
can i --
bjorn rosengren -- chief executive officer
yes, why don't you add, timo?
timo ihamuotila -- chief financial officer
yes, thanks. on the amrs, in particular, i think we said in our presentation today that we are right away starting this now also in china. and we have already got a customer inbound that it's great that this is now abb because it's, of course, totally different to go with this kind of offering as abb to china than as a company which has approximately, as we said, 50 million revenue this year. so we think that we can expand the asti offering quite nicely through our channel and also the exposure to automotive we think that the amrs, as was discussed earlier in this call, will actually get us positioned in a broader market and longer term will help us to even better diversify the overall customer impact to better quality of revenue, as we had spoken earlier.
bjorn rosengren -- chief executive officer
and to add on that, i mean, you mentioned geographically. i think we've been very clear on that part that we are a market leader in europe and in china. that is part -- our market share in north america is not as strong as in other parts of the world, and that's one of the areas where we are planning to strengthen our presence.
joe giordano -- cowen and company -- analyst
and bjorn, in the press release, you mentioned robotics in construction and broadening your superior exposure there. can you maybe talk a bit about that? and maybe lastly, one of your competitors recently buying a cloud-based automation solution, i mean, obviously different markets there, but just curious where you think you are on software and how you see that progressing, whether it's in-house or through partnerships, however you want to kind of tackle that.
bjorn rosengren -- chief executive officer
yes. i mean robot in the strategy that been very clear in is try to move away more from the systems within automotive side, which big risk, low margin. but also the whole automotive segment is a lower margin than other segments. so we are moving toward general industry, as said, electronics, very much today logistics, which is very growing.
but one new area is construction. but construction is maybe not building a house out on the field. they build today modules that are then being assembled out in the field. so building these modules, there are more robots being used.
and it's a new segment for us, and we talk a little bit about because we think it's exciting and there are some potential for that. then on the software side, i think we've been very clear with the strategy that we have in software. we are growing pure software solutions. we have embedded software, building our domain expertise and a lot of software included in our product.
that has continued to grow in the part. we are, of course, also looking for potential software companies that fits well in with the businesses where we operate and that we can see synergic parts from that. but we think that our offering today is both strong and well positioned, and a lot of software embedded in the products. and the pure software is also growing a lot, especially in process automation.
anything you'd like to add there? you're the software guy coming from nokia.
timo ihamuotila -- chief financial officer
no, i think you covered it well. but i think, as you said, we are executing a clear strategy, and i think we are on a good path on that one.
ann-sofie nordh
yes. are you happy with that, joe? i hope so. you've gone quiet. then we see james moore.
joe giordano -- cowen and company -- analyst
i am. thank you.
ann-sofie nordh
very good.
bjorn rosengren -- chief executive officer
thank you, joe.
ann-sofie nordh
james moore from redburn. please i hope your line is open now.
james moore -- redburn partners -- analyst
good morning everyone. thanks. i've got one request, if i could be so bold, and two questions. bjorn, you mentioned base orders are a better indicator of demand.
and i think we'd all agree, and it's a shame when you stopped them. so if you could bring them back, that would be great. and my two questions are on raw material and robotics and factory automation. so timo, really, maybe for you on raw materials, thanks for the color for that division.
but i wondered if you could, in any way, size how much bigger that gross raw material year on year dollar million impact is going to be in the third quarter versus that which you saw in the second quarter. i understand that there will be pricing on the other side. but just trying to flavor what -- the changes, are we talking about a 25-million increase in year-on-year pressure? or is it a big $250-million impact? i have no idea really because it's hard to understand your raw material exposure. and the second question is the 41% organic order growth in ra, could you -- i've lost the three numbers, but if not, can you flavor the differences between auto robotic, auto nonrobotic and factory automation? and i guess i'm really asking was factory automation growing faster globally than the nonautomotive side of robotic?
timo ihamuotila -- chief financial officer
yes. why don't i start with the raw materials? so thanks for the question, james. so it's definitely in between your 25 and 225. but jokes aside, q1, i think we kind of like said that the pricing positive impact was about 25, and that's well-compensated.
and if you calculate the pricing impact from our bridge now, it's somewhere around 60 million, and you can all do the math. and this is, of course, compensating now for a bigger impact in raw material. at least if you look at copper, some stuff has now started to stabilize at least on a very high level. steel is, i would say, even higher now proportionately than copper.
so it's going to be -- i mean, we don't know exactly how this is going to come out, but it's going to be definitely closer to the q2 number than the q1 number. so that much we can say about it.
bjorn rosengren -- chief executive officer
and the other question was? what was that?
james moore -- redburn partners -- analyst
on the robotics and growth --
timo ihamuotila -- chief financial officer
robotics growth, yes.
james moore -- redburn partners -- analyst
and factory automation.
bjorn rosengren -- chief executive officer
yes, yes, yes. ok. sure, sure.
james moore -- redburn partners -- analyst
versus nonautomotive robotics.
bjorn rosengren -- chief executive officer
yes. give you a little bit of a clarification. if you actually take out the -- totally automotive part of the business, it grew about 60%. so that gives you a flavor.
if you take out just the, let's say, the automation part or the system part of that business, it grew approximately 30, 40%. was that correct? 30 or 40%. i think i got -- somewhere around 40%. and then if you include the whole automotive part, we are a little bit above 20%.
i think that's where it is. when you see factory automation, we are closer to 100% growth. so that business has been growing like crazy for two quarters at the moment.
james moore -- redburn partners -- analyst
that's great color. thank you so much.
bjorn rosengren -- chief executive officer
thanks.
ann-sofie nordh
and now we only have a couple of minutes left. so jonathan at exane. if you promise to be fairly quick please will open up your line. thanks.
jonathan mounsey -- exane -- analyst
ok. i'll try. there's been a few questions about the asti acquisition. and i guess maybe people just trying to understand the scope of your ambition.
in the press release, you talk about a 14 billion market by 2025. i mean and you've also mentioned during this call, you're no.1, no.2 in robotics depending on the segment. i mean a 50 million business doesn't address very much of a 14 billion market. and maybe what we're all just trying to understand is what your ambition really is in terms of the verticals you're going to go into.
how much can you upscale this business, given the platform you have in automotive? what are the sales synergies? i mean really, to become a no.1 or no.2 player in amr, is that your ambition maybe for subsegments of amr? really, what are you trying to achieve here?
bjorn rosengren -- chief executive officer
i would say, first, the amr business is a very scattered business. there are so many small players in that. so you probably will see some kind of consolidation also going forward. yes, it's quite a big market, and you can use it in all different regions, everything from logistics to automotive, but also to general industry.
so yes, i think the ambition is that this is definitely growth acquisitions, meaning using the technology platform and then utilize the -- our platform we have all over china and europe but also in north america. and that's where we're going to drive growth in this area. so i think the whole robotic team is quite excited. we can -- a little bit difficult to go in on the growth numbers because we haven't given them out yet, but it's clear, big growth that we are expecting from this business if it's going to be successful going forward.
so yes, and you --
timo ihamuotila -- chief financial officer
can i throw a software comment in here now, if that's ok?
bjorn rosengren -- chief executive officer
yes, surely, that's ok.
timo ihamuotila -- chief financial officer
because this area will benefit from the new software on the whole lidar technology, similar technology which is used in mapping applications when you do street mapping and that kind of stuff, where i was earlier involved a bit. and that's why technology-wise, this will get more complex, and it's going to be tougher and tougher for all these smaller players to survive. that would be my sort of gut software comment on here. so there's a lot of opportunity to expand this from a technology perspective.
bjorn rosengren -- chief executive officer
and we spent quite a lot of time looking at different opportunities here. and we think this is definitely the one that suits us very well, both technology-wise and the potential to grow.
jonathan mounsey -- exane -- analyst
thank you.
bjorn rosengren -- chief executive officer
thanks.
ann-sofie nordh
thank you for that. and with that, we round off for today. thank you very much for taking the time to spend it with us, and we'll see you again in about a quarter's time.
bjorn rosengren -- chief executive officer
yes. i wish you a good vacation.
timo ihamuotila -- chief financial officer
thank you.

ann-sofie nordh
greetings to all and welcome to the presentation of our q3 results. i'm ann-sofie nordh. i'm head of investor relations, and next to me i have our ceo, bjorn rosengren, and our cfo, timo ihamuotila. they will take you through the presentation after which we open up for the normal q&a session.
but before we begin i would like to draw your attention to the information regarding safe harbor notices and our use of the non-gaap measures on slide 2 of the abb presentation. this conference call will include forward-looking statements, and these statements are based on the company's current expectations and certain assumptions and are therefore subject to certain risks and uncertainties. and with that said we will kick off today's session and we will do that with a short video related to the process automation recent launch of the e-mine portfolio, which technology is facilitating the all electric mine, including monitoring and optimizing energy usage. [commercial break] and with that, i will hand over to bjorn and timo to take you through the results.
bjorn rosengren -- chief financial officer
thank you, ann-sofie, and a warm welcome from me as well. today, i got to pick the video. and the e-mining stands close to my heart and the ability that abb has to support the mining industry to become more sustainable. we really looking forward to development of this new product.
now, let's take a look at q3. it was somewhat a mixed bag. let me start with the positives. first, the strong order growth.
it spanned across all business areas with growth in the range of 17 to 40%. secondly, the margin of 15.1%. yes, we had some support from unusually low corporate costs. but that's fine with me.
that said, i do not expect these low corporate costs to stick in going into q4. so we have some work to do before we hit an underlying run rate of the margin target of 15%. but i have promised you to get there in 2023 and we will reach it. i also want to mention the cash flow of 1.1 billion, which is, in my view, was excellent.
last but not least, we have some exciting product launches. on top of the e-mining portfolio in the video, we launched the world's fastest ev charger. it is capable to fully charge an electric car in 15 minutes or less. these could be a game changer, but there were also challenges in the quarter.
we would not deliver as much as we wanted to because of the tight supply chain. it stretch beyond component shortages is also logistics. and the tight labor market. we're at high production levels, meet continued covid constraints.
these impacted us more than we thought it would. and these challenge will not go away quickly. let's turn to page 4 and look to the different segments. i already mentioned that orders were strong.
they increased by 26%, although from a low level last year. it's fair to assume that that is certain contribution from customer putting through orders to manage availability. it's difficult to give an exact number. but we believe it's less of an impact than we saw during the first half of the year.
the improvement was supported by a positively development in more or less all customer segments. and we saw increased demand in short cycle, as well as process industry-related businesses. orders in our service business increased by 18%, while service revenues increased only 2%. these means that we should see in positive mix going in to next year.
in the revenue charge, you can clearly see that the revenues were impacted by the challenges to get stuff out of the door due to the strength in the value chain. we saw an increased impact on ability to deliver compared to q2. comparable growth was limited to 4% year over year, meaning we are building order backlog. now, let's take a quick look at the different regions on slide no.
5. growth was strong in all three regions. in america, the important u.s. market increased by 31%.
in europe, more or less, all the top ten markets improved by strong double-digit growth rates. and emea includes a 9% order growth in china, where we saw solid demand in the quarter. on slide 6, you see the charge with their operation ebitda and the margin of 15.1%. overall, we have kept it stringent cost control.
sg&a was 17.5% of revenues, down from 18.1 last year. as the world starts to open up for business travels, we need to make sure that we have a smart approach; use the virtual earnings from the last year, while still making sure we maintain our relationship with our customers. i'm very pleased about the jump in the gross margin. process automation showed stellar improvements, while electrification and motion were impacted by the higher raw material costs, as we have said they would be.
i already earlier mentioned the unusually low corporate costs where we had some positive coming through in the quarter. but i do not expect this to continue into the next quarter. in summary, considering the challenges from the tight supply chain, i'm pleased about overall delivery in the quarter. and with that, i'll hand over to timo to talk a little bit more about the numbers.
timo ihamuotila -- chief financial officer
thank you, bjorn. and greetings to everyone from my side as well. and as usual, we'll start with electrification, where we saw continued strong demand driving order growth to 17%. the strength was spread across geographies and was particularly strong in americas.
it was also good to see the mid single-digit growth in china. from end-market perspective, we saw a positive development in all segments. i particularly mentioned the higher activity in transport, and infrastructure with solid development in both residential and non-residential buildings. and we also saw an improving pipeline with oil and gas segment.
i would say that in these strong orders, it is fair to assume some positive impact from customers free ordering in the way of a general tight supply chain. we have actively worked with quality assurance in the orders we accept, even stopping away from -- even stepping away from some where lead time to deliver is too long. the strength value chain hampered revenues for electrification in the quarter. the constraints extended beyond just semiconductors.
we also saw impacts from a tight labor market, particularly in the u.s. and logistics issues. there were also some customer acceptance delays as they wait for complete deliveries. these challenges triggered a sequential decline in revenues even though we reached an improvement of 4% year on year.
if we add this up, the order backlog further increased to $5.2 billion, which is a record high level. i'm sure you remember that we said during the spring and summer that electrification we'll be coming off a favorable raw material hedges. we now see it coming through in the numbers. we are close to offsetting this with price increases.
but then of course, we have a situation with cost increases additionally inflated by the tight supply chain. all included, the margin declined sequentially, while it improved from last year, supported by volumes and stringent cost control, excluding last year's positive impact of about 100 basis points of non-repeating items. the underlying operational ebitda margin actually improved by approximately 60 basis points to 15.9%. looking ahead into the fourth quarter, we expect continued challenges in our ability to deliver.
also, comparables are getting tougher. we expect a low or no comparable revenue growth year on year. and the normal pattern of sequential decline to operational ebitda margin. let's move onto motion and you will recognize similar topics as for el.
as you can see in the left side of the chart. order intake remained at a very high level and growth was strong across all divisions and segments. and we saw double-digit growth rates in all three regions. in total, orders increased 22% compared with last year.
i should mention here that also motion continued to focus on maintaining a good quality in the order backlog, meaning, and without putting numbers on that, orders could have been even higher should we have captured all that would have been available to us. comparable revenues improved by 2%, adversely impacted by the semiconductor shortages and imbalances in the value chain. like in electrification, the headwinds from raw -- higher raw material prices and cost inflation in general have increased. it is therefore encouraging to see motion achieving a stable operational ebitda margin at the high level of 17.4%, supported by a favorable mix, price increases, and a small volume impact.
for the fourth quarter, we anticipate around mid single-digit growth for comparable revenues and the normal sequential pattern of softening margins due to the mix in deliveries. we now turn to slide 9 and process automation, where we added further to the order backlog with comparable orders and revenues expanding 40 and 5%, respectively. with order growth benefiting from a low base last year. i'm sure you remember that we have guided for a pickup in business activities in the process-related industries during the second half of this year.
and we see that happening now. we saw good progress in all divisions and a positive development in all segments. i want to mention that we booked a large order of about a $120 million in the energy industry division in australia. we will supply the overall electrical power systems for sub-sea natural gas compression.
the order is a great example of our technology leadership with our solutions operating under extreme conditions at 1400 meters below sea level. i was pleased to see the operational ebitda margin coming in at strong 13.7%, the highest margin in three years. excluding the adverse impact from the charge related to the crusader project last year, profitability improved approximately 330 basis points. the result benefited from the positive volume development, improved business mix, efficiency measures, and strong project execution.
in q4, we expect comparable revenue growth to pick up in the mid-teens range. and q4 tend to be the strongest margin quarter for pa, so i hope we see somewhat over sequential pickup also this time. on slide 10, we turn to robotics and discrete automation, which had another quarter with good order intake, up 26% on a comparable basis. the strength was broad-based, led by strong growth in general industry, consumer segments, and service robotics, as well as machine automation.
however, machine automation division has seen significant impact from the semiconductor shortages and higher input costs. this has meant increased lead times to customers while managing the needed price increases. we are working in tight cooperation with our machine automation customers to manage this difficult situation. roa revenues declined by 3%, impacted by both machine automation and robotics.
the robotics impact is a combination of a positive momentum in the non-automotive robotics segments, which however was offset by a lower deliveries from the outdoor systems business. the lower deliveries are a consequence of our earlier strategic decision to deselect systems business orders with low abb content to improve quality of revenue and drive profitability long term. this improved mix with robotics is already partly visible in the operational ebitda margin of ra, which increased by 160 basis points compared to last year despite the lack of comparable growth. the improvement also benefited from a higher share of service business and earlier implemented efficiency measures, which overall more than offset the adverse development in machine automation.
looking into q4, we expect deliveries, particularly in machine automation, to still be adversely impacted by component shortages. hence, we anticipate comparable revenue growth to be broadly in line with q3. and we expect the operational ebitda margin to sequentially decline, as it normally does between q3 and q4. moving on to slide 11 showing the group revenues and operational ebitda bridge.
as you see, the year-on-year improvement benefited from the absence of last year's charge related to the crusader project. a reduction of losses incurred in non-core businesses, as well as our organic development. the latter was supported by higher volumes, mix, and earlier implemented cost actions, while commodity prices increases after-hedging slightly outpaced price increases for the quarter. now, on slide 12, we return to my favorite slide on this deck, or the favorite topic.
in q3, we continued this year's strong cash performance with cash flow from operating activities of $1.1 billion, an improvement of about a 720 million from last year. a great achievement, driven by higher earnings, as well as significantly lower transformation and furnished pension impacts compared to last year. as you can see in the chart, our cash generation for the first nine months already exceeds the full-year cash generation in both 2019 and 2020 by approximately $400 million. and i'm confident that we can continue this positive momentum and make this a really good cash flow year also regarding free cash flow.
then, before i hand over to bjorn, let me just briefly come back to some of the near-term challenges mentioned today. we do not expect these to go away tomorrow, hence, we need to focus on how we best manage the situation of a continued tight supply chain. we will put emphasis on order scrutiny to make sure we can deliver and secure quality in the order backlog. we will build inventory where appropriate, and we will continue to work on redesigns and validate new suppliers.
raw material prices should be a near-term headwind and tangible for our product's businesses. our teams have done well so far in mitigating through active price management. and we will continue to be active on pricing. the strength value chain drives cost inflation in various areas.
i use here our freight and packaging expenses as an indicative example. we also see labor cost inflation in some regions, and also labor accessibility can be a challenge. we are in a good position in the sense of having production footprint close to sales. but even so, when components are scarce, we may have to shift between sites, which we normally would not do.
we have taken all these impacts into account to our best ability in the numbers discussed today. i also want to say that i think our business management teams are handling this tough situation really well with needed speed and accountability. and the fact that we have virtually no order cancellations indicates that the whole market is very, very tight. and on that note, i would like to hand back to bjorn.
bjorn rosengren -- chief financial officer
thank you, timo. ok. let's finish off with some thoughts on how we see the ending of the year. we expect the market to remain robust in the fourth quarter.
as you see in the summary of the segments, we expect marked improvements in most areas compared with last year. this said, we have talked a lot about the supply chain situation today. we saw it impacted us in the third quarter, and we do not think this will be a quick fix. so we anticipate comparable revenue growth into q4 to be broadly similar to what we saw in q3.
we expect the operational ebitda margin to decline sequentially from the 15.1% reported today, as it normally does. like i mentioned, i do not expect the low corporate costs to repeat. and q4 anyway, tends to be a quarter with the seasonally weaker margin. this means that we slightly adjust our full-year guidance to comparable revenues to be between 6 and 8%, slightly down from the previous indication of just below 10%.
we lead the margin guidance for the full-year impact. like i said earlier, we are not yet a run rate of 15%, but we are clearly making good progress. we have some more work to do internally. we need to make sure all divisions now take the responsibility that they have been handed, with full ownership of their businesses.
i'm very confident that we will deliver and then move beyond. and with that, i'll let ann-sofie takeover and guide us into the q&a.
ann-sofie nordh
great. thanks, bjorn. and with that, we will have for the q&a. [operator instructions].
i can see that we already have questions coming through. and i just would like to repeat myself from previous quarters, i kindly ask you to limit yourself to two questions, and we'll do our best to get through as many of you as possible. [commercial break] we will follow up straight away with james [inaudible] and it's the revenue challenges in 3q and 4q, perhaps a little bit tougher than some others have suggested. have you benchmarked your sourcing, and do you see areas where abb could strengthen the chain with triple or more sourcing and more localization?
bjorn rosengren -- chief financial officer
yes. i think that the strategy of abb is clear long before i started. and that is to be global but still local. meaning that we produce our product in the areas actually where we sell their products.
so china production for the chinese markets in china. u.s. is the same and europe. so we are quite local today.
of course, when it comes to semiconductors, this is of course a global issue which is not related to the way we source in abb. it's just a shortage. and this is affecting all companies that have digital products as abb has in this portfolio. we need to cope with that until the supply meets the demand.
and i know that the suppliers are working hard, and we can see improvement in certain suppliers while other one might be -- having some -- more problems. but i think it's a correct observation that going forward on the supply, i think we all learned that single sourcing is not the way to go. you need to have multiple sources where you can buy some of them close and some there may be in more cost-efficient countries. so, yes, i think our businesses are learning, but i still think the execution in this tough time is excellent from the businesses and i think here the decentralization has really helped.
timo you want to add a little bit there.
timo ihamuotila -- chief financial officer
yes. because this was -- yes. thanks. thanks for the question.
because this was a bit of a comparison question, so i just want to highlight that when you look at our order backlog has gone up from last year 2.1 billion to 16 billion, and we are really not seeing order cancellations. and, of course, if our situation would be like very different from other people's situations, we think that they would go elsewhere which is not happening. so in that sense we think that the quality of the order book is solid. we could have taken a bit more orders as bjorn said, and i think this bodes well then moving forward into 2022, 2023.
ann-sofie nordh
thank you. and we go back to a question from from the telephone line, and we ask you to open the line for daniela at goldman sachs, please.
daniela costa -- goldman sachs -- analyst
perfect. thank you. so i wanted to ask two things. one -- first, i don't think we've talked to today a lot yet about sort of the portfolio plans and the -- particularly how you're progressing on the processes for your recharging and trouble charging.
and also i think you were doing a review of process automation. so my first question would be regarding that. and then the second one, what i think you talked part of what i wanted to ask, but i feel just a final confirmation on. sounds like you're lower in guidance on 2021 on organic growth is just purely supply chain driven.
not really an underlying demand worry. shall we expect a full compensation off that into 2022, or you think that is still some risk that there some maybe some speculative orders on it or it might not be able to solve the situation on supply chains that timely in 2022 and demand could erode.
bjorn rosengren -- chief financial officer
yes. let me start with the demand situation and did -- and the orders are taking down some of the guidance. it's it's a clear supply chain thing. orders books is stronger than we could imagine and we expect that the strong orders situation will continue.
then comes of course the question, is the order book -- and also some of that for building inventory among our customer. we tried to scrutinize that as much as we can, and we are being very restrictive in booking orders that we believe would end up on the shelf. so put it from that. so, yes, i'm the -- the guy to take it down it's a pure pure production and supply things.
and, of course, having an order book over 16 billion, we will continue to deliver on that order book and or new orders that are coming in, of course, going forward. so we do not believe that there will be any lost business out of that. timo said that the quality of the order book is great. so that is from that.
let's then just take a first on process automation and i know there are some rumors about the review of that business, and it's of course clear. that's part of my job of learning more about the different businesses we have, and we have spent quite a lot of time understanding the strategies, looking at the potential going forward. and we are very convinced that process automation is part of our purpose, and we also believe that there is good potential to improve performance in many of these businesses going forward. so that is absolutely not on our agenda when it comes to process automation or any kind of divestment of that.
so it's part of abb and we'll continue at least in the near future to be part of that. and then on the other two businesses and turbo, we -- during q3 we completed the sales of the dodge and we expect to close it now during q4. fantastic year sales. i think good for dodge and good for abb and good for abb shareholders.
so we are very pleased with that. now we're working hard to to separate the turbo business and that is going well. and we are, at this moment, coming closer i think maybe in this quarter in the beginning or next we will have this prospect. we're still going a dual track, as we said from the beginning, mean as we are.
checking up if we have some industrial or financial buyers who were prepared to pay for for these assets in the right way. but our preferred way, as we said before, is to do a spin-off to the shareholders. but the final decision of that would probably be take place during first quarter. but separation is going and during next year we should see that finalization of that divestment.
on the immobility, what can i say. it's an enormous market. our operations are doing well. we see growth well over 100% quarter by quarter by quarter, and we think that this business have a tremendous future.
so what are we doing now. we are separating the business. we are looking for a new chairman, which a process is going on, and we are still waiting for a final decision on how to do it. but we do expect if plans goes as we want to to do this ipo during the first half of the year.
so things are moving well there, and we think this can be an interesting growth vehicle going forward. i think i caught those serve. was that ok, daniela?
daniela costa -- goldman sachs -- analyst
yes. that answer. thank you very much.
bjorn rosengren -- chief financial officer
thanks.
ann-sofie nordh
thank you. and we will take another question from the online option. and it -- we have a question -- a couple of questions here actually coming from guillermo at ubs. and if we start with the book to bill, it's expanding in lead times as well.
how is the backlog margin quality evolving.
bjorn rosengren -- chief financial officer
i'll give that to timo.
timo ihamuotila -- chief financial officer
yes. thanks, guillermo, for the question. so maybe i'll start with some facts going into q4. so when we look at what's our estimate on how much would be coming from the backlog going into q4, compared to what would be, in a way, a normal year, we are maybe sort of 8 to 9% higher.
so in that sense, if this supply stuff would start to ease, that will mean that our revenue would have some upside. but at our best of knowledge, we are of course where we are at the moment, but we have a stronger backlog going into q4 than we would normally have. then when you look at the backlog margin and this is actually a really great development because we follow, of course, the operational gross margin, we follow the order gross margin, and then the backlog gross margin. and both order gross margin, as well as backlog gross margin have been moving up.
and it's particularly evident in the robotics business also evident for example in b.a. so also from margin quality perspective, the backlog is moving to the right direction.
ann-sofie nordh
very good. and we'll follow up i think with another question for timo since it's your favorite topic of cash flow. how sustainable is the strong cash flow going into q4 and the beginning or 2022?
timo ihamuotila -- chief financial officer
ok. thanks for the question. so i think after two years of quite a bit of work on changing the cash dynamics of this company, 2019, 2020 where of course somewhat unusual regarding cash, we are now coming to what this company should be able to deliver on cash. and in that sense we are in a situation where if earnings improve, the cash flow, it will improve and we i think still have some work to do in networking capital.
so if you just look at this first nine months -- and i'll i'll go to the free cash flow directly because i know that's the sort of the interest out there. so we are at one point 9 billion of free cash flow now for the first nine months. last year, full year, was about a billion and we would expect to have a good cash quarter q4 as well, so let's see where it lands. but but i would hope to see us on this, let's say, 2.5, something like that as free cash flow for the full year, and if that happens, then of course we are in a very different situation for example on the dividend payout ratio and those kind of situations and we continue to have a strong balance sheet which we'll continue to invest in line with our capital allocation principles.
ann-sofie nordh
very good, and we'll open up the line from alex of the bank of america merrill lynch. can you hear us alex, since that seems to be the topic of the day.
alex virgo -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
i can, indeed. [inaudible] everybody hear us as well. thanks for taking the questions. good morning to you all.
and i guess i wanted to just touch a little bit more on china and perhaps less about the supply chain itself and more about power outages and the impact that the power supply situation is having on you. and i wonder whether i could push you, timo, for a guess or a estimate i should say is maybe a better way of putting it on the actual impact in your revenues in h2 from all of these sorts of things put together. would it be a sensible 3 to 400 basis points also which is simply just the difference between where we were, expecting things if the full year and the bottom end of your range. i just wanted to push you for a best guess, if i could please.
bjorn rosengren -- chief financial officer
thank you, alex. i can maybe start to question and maybe then timo can follow up on that part. i think, year to date, we have not had any effect because of power shortages in china. we have had a lot of call with tests we have in the past, which might have affected some what production levels, at least made it a little bit more complicated.
there might be some suppliers who have had some effect in the southern part of china, but so far, we wouldn't say that the power shortages have had any effect. going forward, i think that is a little bit premature to say if it what will or not. china is an important market is down for more than 15%, 16% of our revenues and we have of course a lot of production for that market. so it is important that china continues to develop.
the orders are -- they are very strong and continue to be doing demand in the market. and so far, our productions have been able to deliver in line with that.
timo ihamuotila -- chief financial officer
yes. maybe i'll just comment a little bit on this as well. so first of all, when you look at the china order growth, and then when you compared it to, for example, u.s. or germany, the dynamics are approximately as follows.
china is up, as bjorn said, 8%, 9% sort of about 20 coming from 1920 to 21, and then when you look at germany and u.s., it's pretty much down then up 30. so all of these markets are on this two-year period developing pretty much in a similar way. if you take the two-year stretch. and that shows that we really have a strong demand picture in our main markets and it's actually fairly similar when you take the corbett impact out.
and then when you look at china on the revenue side, in china we have -- i'll just give you one example of a situation where, for example, in drive products, very strong market in china, we have simply not been able to get all the product out. we have also managed the distribution channel very well and that is one of the reason why the revenue is now down. and when that correct itself we would expect to see a revenue pick up in line with the order or the demand picture.
ann-sofie nordh
is that answer your question, alex? i hope so.
alex virgo -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
as well as can be expected. thank you very much.
ann-sofie nordh
thank you. and we open up the line for joe at cowen and co. are you there, joe?
joe giordano -- cowen and company -- analyst
i'm here. can you hear me?
ann-sofie nordh
we can.
bjorn rosengren -- chief financial officer
we do sure can.
joe giordano -- cowen and company -- analyst
great. you mentioned customers emotions is not accepting delivery right now. can you just talk about the dynamics there? is that part of a larger project where the other pieces aren't available? like, how should we how should we think about why that's happening and how do you think that plays out into full view?
timo ihamuotila -- chief financial officer
was this -- this was in relation to the previous answer.
bjorn rosengren -- chief financial officer
i think it was motion. did you say motion or what did you --
timo ihamuotila -- chief financial officer
i just said drive products in china have had some component shortage issues on the semiconductor which impacted the china revenue.
bjorn rosengren -- chief financial officer
but i see --
joe giordano -- cowen and company -- analyst
yes. i thought i heard earlier this product that you that you guys -- your customers weren't taking, not that you weren't able to source -- that you weren't able to deliver. maybe i misheard that. is that true?
bjorn rosengren -- chief financial officer
yes. you are talking about the customer acceptance topic. again, this has nothing to do with the quality of the backlog. this is an issue in a couple of places where you would deliver into the project but somebody else is not delivering in time, and then the customer says, well you know maybe i could take that a little bit later.
so again, it's quite normal behavior in this kind of situation. doesn't mean at all that our backlog quality wouldn't be where it is, but we had some of these impacts as well during the quarter when you look at the revenue.
timo ihamuotila -- chief financial officer
and that's more related to project orders.
bjorn rosengren -- chief financial officer
exactly.
timo ihamuotila -- chief financial officer
i think that not so much in components.
joe giordano -- cowen and company -- analyst
right. that's -- ok. that's kind of what i thought. is there any -- how did your guys think about that that dynamic at work? you kind of similar to 3q as well, like the projects are still held up by others in some cases.
timo ihamuotila -- chief financial officer
well, we have taken as we said today all these impacts into account to our best ability, so this impact as well. and as i said we are going into q4 with a higher backlog conversion expected than we did last year. so if this starts to ease, there should be upside on the revenue.
joe giordano -- cowen and company -- analyst
that's fair. ok. last question. do you guys plan on -- or have you already started integrating the [inaudible] robotics into your own manufacturing facilities?
bjorn rosengren -- chief financial officer
yes. i can talk a little bit about that. yes. it was of course completed during the -- both the assigning as well as the closing of that acquisition, and it's being integrated i think for robotics, this is -- it's a perfect fit.
this is a good quality company with respected and good products and they have the ability to utilize the abb channel globally. and that is what we do. at the moment, we are also setting up production for these products in the chinese market. so we'll be able to support that market also.
but as you heard earlier, we have to quite ambitious plans for this business going forward and they're excited in robotics. and it's a great fit.
joe giordano -- cowen and company -- analyst
i know you use them internally, i assume as well.
bjorn rosengren -- chief financial officer
this is normally an apb. so we utilizing both our automation product and robotics and in more or less all our factories. so, yes, these agvs is part in many of these factors and going forward, they will be also using the -- this new abb [inaudible] products.
joe giordano -- cowen and company -- analyst
all right. thank you.
ann-sofie nordh
thank you, joe. and now let's see if we have martin from citi on the line.
martin wilkie -- citi -- analyst
oh, yes. good morning, it's martin from --
ann-sofie nordh
hi, martin.
martin wilkie -- citi -- analyst
a couple of questions for you. hi. i hope you can hear me ok. the first question was on the impact of [inaudible] prices on your demand.
[inaudible] question, i guess already on how [inaudible] impacts on the u.s. markets. but in previous cycle when energy prices have had spike, then some of your products have been more in demand because of efficiency and i guess [inaudible] to that cost of particular, i guess, motion and electrification. hasn't been any indication so far particularly in europe with power price adopts so much that we'll see a cool board of requests or efficiency related products.
i guess it's relatively early in this price spike. but just to understand a little bit about that. thank you.
bjorn rosengren -- chief financial officer
yes. i think it's difficult to say short term price spikes or long term need for electrifying many parts of the industry and the world. i think we have said from the beginning that we are well positioned when it comes to electrification in the market with our electrification product but also with our motion products. even in process automation we are helping many of the large customers to electrify.
i think one example was the movie which i of course like very much about e-mining. many of these industries need to go for being more sustainable and that's why they're going in for be electrified. i think this kind of happened every mine in the world, and i think abb is the right partner to help them to to drive this change. so, yes, we do believe that there will be demand for more electricity long term.
but on the other hand, this is there may be a short term spike and then maybe not so much.
timo ihamuotila -- chief financial officer
i was just going to comment on that. we reviewed actually in one of our business reviews. just a case like this where all the motors and drives would have been changed for this reason, but of course also because it drives better carbon footprint. so it is happening is it only because of the electricity price.
maybe not. but i would just say that if that continues, it will add to the demand picture as bjorn described.
martin wilkie -- citi -- analyst
as i mentioned one simple question. you mentioned the change already, but just to come back on the turbo business [inaudible] in the end market, you give the one area that has cost you about this quarter compared to previous conventional generation. just to clarify what you've seen there and also, would you view on the end market the change the timing of the potential exit in turbo. just to understand if those two things might be linked or not.
thank you.
bjorn rosengren -- chief financial officer
i think the exit of turbo is decided is just a timing issue and it will be the right and in what direction will we go if we go for for a spin-off or we go to a sale. so from that perspective, yes, turbo is -- i mean it's a resilient company from the beginning. we saw during covid that they managed to deliver a good margin even if there was somewhat lower than we're seeing today. their market has recovered one big market in this business is the cruising industry.
yes, they are improving services picking up on that part in their power generation. it's an other part where they sit on many of these gas engines around the world. demand for electricity is going up, so i am sure that has some effect. so, yes, the quality of the aftermarket which is 75% of that business is developing good.
so, yes, i think it's a good company i think it will be a good company standing by itself also.
timo ihamuotila -- chief financial officer
yes. and just to mention we have had very strong demand pick up in durban during during this quarter and it looks actually quite positive. so if you look at the orders revenue and also margin in turbo during q3, they are all moving to the right direction.
martin wilkie -- citi -- analyst
that's great. thank you very much.
bjorn rosengren -- chief financial officer
it's a it's a great business, but we do not feel that it is part of the abb purpose.
ann-sofie nordh
thank you. and we'll finish off with a question from andreas at j.p. morgan. is your line -- your line should be open, andreas, please.
andreas willi -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
yes. good morning, everybody. thank you very much. i've got two questions, please.
one on your earlier comment on process automation and the annual business review there. do you have spent quite some time with that business in the last few months. maybe you could share a little bit what you see as what needs to happen there, particularly as when we look at measurement and analytics which has been maybe a bit of a problem child in terms of where you see the measures, strategies that gets that business closer to where you want it to be and where peers are. the second question is on sourcing in discrete automation.
maybe you could elaborate a little bit more on that? you talked about the semiconductor issues. but we haven't -- obviously we'll see another report, but we haven't really heard [inaudible] or schneider complain as much about their discrete business into the quarter end compared to what you highlighted. maybe you could help us explain why that could be?
bjorn rosengren -- chief financial officer
yeah. i think that will be difficult to do when we haven't heard, heard yet. we didn't talk too much about that before we came out with the report. it is pretty clear that they are the one who is getting least supply of semiconductors.
and of course, they are fighting hard with suppliers to get them and to be able to supply the products. it is tough for them, of course, not being the largest in the market even if they are very strong in the machine automation segment, in the part and they just need to deal with that. and they spend quite a lot of time to sort out the issues and going forward, they will slowly pick this up and we will go forward and we will be able to supply the customers. but yes, it's a challenging period.
timo ihamuotila -- chief financial officer
and again, there are no order cancellations.
bjorn rosengren -- chief financial officer
yes. i mean, they have a very strong -- i mean, they work a lot with your oem customers, of course, as we're talking about machine builders, so they have a very strong and long relation with them. and so far no cancellation there. so they're coping it with it together and the machine supply is, of course, also having issues probably not only with us, but maybe with other components and products also, so understanding that.
if you talk a little bit about process automation, i like to talk about this subject. and as you know, from last year and being quite new in the company and i thought that process automation was actually delivering lower deliveries than many of our other business area. so for me it's of course important to understand the dynamic in this business and also the potential improvement where we can develop this business. so we've spent quite a lot of time during the last two quarters with this business.
and i think we feel that these are basically good businesses. we think that is the improvement when it comes to operational performance in some of these businesses. and i think these divisions are working hard and of course, i get very happy when i see a quarter where all the businesses are improving and delivering more than double-digit. and i think the potential here is quite good and we have put up strong targets and they have put up a good challenge to improve these performance as during the coming year.
so i think we have a lot of good stuff coming out from these businesses. on management and analytics. yes, it's correct. we talked about it last -- we had their management change in this.
we have a good management in place and they are dealing with some of the issues. i think it's a mixed bag here. you have the instrumentation part and you have the analytics part. it's like two businesses.
the analytic parts is very much related to climate change. the way to analyze these gases in different kind of business is to cope with a lot of the regulations that are actually enforced in the market. and this business is doing great. a lot of service, a lot of exciting products and solutions.
and i'm sure we'll talk more about that in during the capital market day. then on the instrumentation side, this is a little bit more me-too products, where we have a little bit more challenge in getting the full value out of this. on the other hand, i think we have a lot of new innovations, a lot of good stuff in that business. so we'll see how that will be developed going forward.
but we've seen a good improvement compared to last year, both in measurement and analytics, and and they were quite strong during this quarter. so i think there are upside also there going forward. so i think we should take it off the table, p.a., process automation is part of the abb purpose and it will continue to develop during the coming years.
andreas willi -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
thank you very much to you both.
bjorn rosengren -- chief financial officer
thank you, andreas.
ann-sofie nordh
thanks. and with that we round off this session. thank you very much for joining us today. we apologize for the sound challenges early or -- early on in the session, and we will meet again in about two quarters time to talk about that fourth quarter results.
but before that, we hope to see you at our capital markets day on the 7th of december either here in zurich or virtually behind the screens, so to speak. until then, take care. and thanks for today.

ann-sofie nordh
greetings to all, and welcome to the presentation of abb's q4 results. i am ann-sofie nordh, head of investor relations. and next to me here, i have our ceo, bjorn rosengren; and our cfo, timo ihamuotila. and like always, they will take you through the presentation, after which we open up for q&as.
but before we begin, i would just like to draw your attention to the information regarding the safe harbor notices and our use of non-gaap measures on slide 2 of the abb presentation. this conference call will include forward-looking statements, and these statements are based on the company's current expectations and certain assumptions and are therefore subject to certain risks and uncertainties. and with that, i will hand you over to bjorn and timo for you guys to talk through the slides. please, bjorn?
bjorn rosengren -- chief executive officer
thank you, ann-sofie, and a warm welcome from me as well. before we go into details of q4, let's take a look at the full year. and it was a good year for us when we made progress in virtually all aspects. financially, we increased the operational ebita by 37%, excluding fx.
and we improved the margins by 2 -- 320 basis points to 14.2%, which puts us on a level we haven't seen in recent history. this improvement was supported by higher volumes, strong pricing execution, and operational efficiency. we saw strong demand across most customer segments and regions. after a strong first half of the year, we experienced during the second half increased headwinds from raw materials, supply chain disruptions, and cost inflation.
but our business has managed to successfully offset these negative impacts, and we delivered a strong year and a clear path toward our 2023 targets. i'm even more happy about the cash flow, which increased by 78% to $3.3 billion, strengthening our balance sheet to a net cash position. this is an excellent achievement. besides good financial performance, we continue to execute our portfolio refinement in line with our purpose.
for example, we sold the mechanical power transmission business for $2.9 billion or more than 22 times ebita. this may be the highest price ever paid of mechanical business. this year, we also kicked off the systematic development of our 2030 sustainability agenda. with the updated governance and leveraging our performance management process, we are already driving progress across all strategic pillars.
the improving financial performance enabled us to propose a dividend of chf 0.82. this is up chf 0.02 from last year. our balance sheet is strong, and this dividend proposal still allows for financial headrooms to grow through acquisitions. we will also continue with our share buybacks, also in excess of the pg capital return program.
now let's shift focus from the full year and look at the q4 on slide 4. in q4, we saw high level of customer activity in virtually all segments. demand increased for our product businesses, as well as our project and service. orders increased by 21% and this despite that we booked a lower level of large orders compared to last year.
as you see in the chart, there are absolutely a level of $8.3 billion is the highest quarter since q4 2019. comparable revenues increased by 8%, a bit stronger than we initially expected as we managed to deliver some projects late in the quarter. that said, we could have delivered more if it had not been for the supply chain disruptions. this includes component shortages, as well as strained logistics and tightening labor markets.
in total, book-to-bill was 109%, resulting in an order backlog as high as $16.6 billion, up by 21% year over year. now let's take a quick look at the different regions on slide 5. excluding the impact from large orders, we saw a strong double-digit growth in all three regions. in americas, the important u.s.
market increased by 46%, supported by all business areas. in europe, most of the top 10 markets improved by strong double-digit growth rates. growth in italy was impacted by the high comparables from last year when a large order in process automation was booked. at amea, regions declined overall by 2%.
this drop is again related to large orders received last year. generally speaking, we saw positive development in several important countries, including an order growth of 14% in china. let's turn to slide 6 and our earnings outcome. we achieved a 20% increase in operational ebita.
and we improved the margins by 160 basis points to 13.1%, the strongest q4 margin reported since at least 2017. excluding the higher special charges last year, the margin improved by 80 basis points. this was driven by good step-up in pa and ra. electrification maintained its gross margin, but the operational ebita margin declined on mainly higher sales cost.
the margin decline in motion was mainly due to the divestment of the high-margin business, dodge. and with that, i hand over to timo to take us through the numbers in more details. so timo? 
timo ihamuotila -- chief financial officer
thank you, bjorn, and greetings to everyone also from my side. and as usual, let's start by taking a closer look at electrification, which continued to see strong demand across virtually all customer segments. momentum was particularly strong in e-mobility business where orders were up over 150%, but also areas like food and beverage, buildings, and renewables were clearly strong. in total, comparable orders increased by 20% to $3.6 billion, which actually is one of the highest levels on record for electrification.
looking at the different geographies, we saw strong double-digit growth in both americas and europe, while emea declined slightly, including a mid-single-digit decline in china on relatively high comparable from last year. comparable revenues improved by 4%, and this was mainly on the back of a strong pricing execution. volumes, on the other hand, continued to be hampered by supply chain disruptions, including some component shortages and also a tighter labor market. consequently, electrification enters 2022 with a record high order backlog of $5.5 billion to execute.
that said, we foresee the supply chain challenges to persist at least in the near term. taking a step back and looking through the covid turbulence of 2020, comparable orders and revenues are now up 16% and 8%, respectively, compared with q4 2019, a strong performance by el in this period and clearly above its historic growth trajectory. in the quarter, electrification faced significantly higher raw material costs compared with last year when favorable hedges were still in play. we were able to offset the higher input costs with strong pricing execution, but cost inflation due to the tight supply chain and higher sales costs resulted in an overall decline of 80 basis points in the operational ebita margin.
looking ahead into the first quarter, we expect a higher comparable revenue growth and margin to remain broadly similar compared with q4. let's move on to motion on slide 8. first of all, i just want to remind you about us closing the divestment of mechanical power transmission division, or dodge, as we call it, on november 1. this, of course, means that charge and numbers for motion include only one month of contribution from dodge, which we sold for $2.9 billion in cash.
the nonoperational gain of $2.2 billion is included in income from operations. the comparable order growth, which adjusts for structural impacts, like the divestment, increased by 29% and reflected strong demand across the customer segments and regions. orders grew double digit in both the short- and long-cycle product businesses, and service was up by 11%. as a headline number, the 70 basis points decline in operational ebita margin is surprising given that comparable revenues were up 9%.
the majority of the margin decline, meaning about 50 basis points, was actually due to the divestment of dodge, which had an above ba average profitability. the additional slight margin pressure was due to both divisional mix, as well as increased raw material and freight costs, which offset the positive impacts from higher revenues and efficiency measures. for the first quarter, we expect similar comparable revenue growth and the margin to remain broadly stable or slightly increased compared with q4. turning to slide 9 and process automation, where demand continued to recover across the process-related industries, including oil and gas and cruise, while the power generation segment remained stable.
it's worth pointing out that the flat headline order growth was impacted by a high comparable from last year. excluding large orders, meaning orders of more than $15 million in size, there was a significant double-digit improvement. revenues increased by 19% year on year with support from all divisions reflecting successful execution of the order backlog and a double-digit growth rate in services. component shortages have been manageable so far for pa, but may intensify a bit near term, whereby adding uncertainty to timing of converting orders to revenues.
it was excellent to see the margin recovery in process automation as the operational ebita margin improved from 6.8% to 13.7% with approximately 270 basis points of this improvement coming from the absence of last year's project charges. the profitability improvement was driven by higher volumes and benefits from earlier taking cost measures, however, slightly offset by mix due to a higher share of systems business. all pa divisions are making good progress and had over 11% operational ebita margins during the quarter. as part of the process to exit the turbocharging business, daniel bischofberger has been appointed as new divisional president as of 1st of march.
we aim to make the final decision on the way forward toward the end of the first quarter, although a spin-off at the moment looks like the most likely option. in q1, we expect comparable revenue growth to be lower than what we saw in q4. this will most likely also weigh on the sequential margin development. on slide 10, we turn to robotics & discrete automation, which had another quarter with high order intake, resulting in a year-on-year growth of 59%.
strength was broad-based across customer segments with continued stellar growth in general industry, which should support profitability going forward as the backlog is executed. for the full year of 2021, order intake in the general industry segment has been almost as high as the combined orders of the auto oems and auto tier 1 segments. another good example of how we are expanding in new attractive robotics areas is our strategic partnership with the start-up, sevensense, that we entered into in q4. this will enhance our new autonomous mobile robotics offering with artificial intelligence and 3d vision mapping technology, a very exciting field going forward.
despite the strong order intake, revenues remained broadly stable year on year as component shortages slowed the pace of customer deliveries in both divisions. the supply constraints in ra are primarily relating to semiconductor shortages. and you can clearly see the impact on our ability to convert orders into revenues when looking at the left and the middle on this slide. orders have outpaced revenues over the last three quarters, resulting in a record-high order backlog of $1.9 billion at the end of the year.
we remain confident about the quality of our order backlog, and revenue growth will improve once the supply chain imbalances ease. ra's operational ebita margin increased by 80 basis points year on year to 8.1% despite the lack of revenue growth. while the business area faced adverse impacts from increased freight and input costs, this was more than offset by the positive impacts from improved efficiency, as well as favorable mix due to a lower share of automotive system sales compared with last year. looking into q1, we expect comparable revenue decline to be similar to what we saw in q4, but we anticipate a slight sequential margin improvement.
moving on to slide 11, showing the group revenues and operational ebita bridge. as you can see, the comparable earnings improvement benefited from our positive organic development, as well as the absence of last year's charge related to the kusile project. the operational improvement was driven by the positive impact from higher volumes, positive price development, and increased efficiencies, which more than offset the adverse effects from cost inflation. the reduction of losses incurred in noncore business helped margin by 30 basis points, while acquisitions and divestments were slightly diluting on a group level, mainly due to the negative impact from the dodge divestment.
let's look at the cash flow on slide 12. i know bjorn highlighted it earlier, but i want to also mention that i am really, really pleased about the overall cash delivery for the year as we achieved cash flow from operating activities of $3.3 billion, which is up 78% from the prior year. volatility between quarters declined, a result of high focus on net working capital management. and it was great to see that even with 8% revenue growth, free cash flow conversion to net income was 108%.
looking at q4 in isolation, cash flow from operating activities amounted to $1 billion, supported by improved operational performance, but with a bit less contribution from reduction in trade working capital compared to last year. in q4, cash flow also reflects approximately $300 million of cash paid for income taxes related to the dodge transaction, while we had approximately a $200 million impact due to the kusile settlement and pension plan transfers in the same quarter last year. again, overall, a good year for cash flow from operating activities in continuing operations, and i expect a continued good performance broadly at a similar level also in 2022. let's finish off by taking a look at our return on capital employed where we also showed strong progress in 2021.
as you see on slide 13, roce improved to 14.9%, just shy of our target of 15% to 20%. the improvement was driven by both the higher operational ebita in combination with lower adjusted group effective tax rate. in fact, if you already now would exclude the negative impact on our capital employed related to our 19.9% ownership in hitachi energy, we would already be comfortably in our target range. the hitachi impact is only transitory in nature and will reverse after a sale of this investment.
clearly, improved return on capital employed is a good indicator that we are really improving abb's long-term performance. and with that, let me hand back to bjorn for some finishing slides.
bjorn rosengren -- chief executive officer
thank you, timo. on the next slide, we take a quick look at the expectations for q1. we expect the current high level of underlying market activity to remain sequentially stable. that said, there is some added near-term uncertainty in relation to revenues due to the supply chain disruptions, which we expect to persist near term.
in this environment, we expect the margin to remain broadly stable or slightly improved quarter on quarter. now let's finish this session by summarizing our focus areas for 2022. from what we see at this early stage, we expect a positive market momentum in 2022. and so far, we have seen a solid start of the year.
to support our long-term growth targets, it is time to ramp up the pace when it comes to acquisition. in line with the ambitions, i was pleased to see the e-mobility business increase their ownership in incharge energy to strengthen their position on the u.s. ev charging market. as i said before, our ambition is to make at least five acquisitions per year.
we will continue to drive the performance culture in all our businesses. this year, i expect a steady margin improvement toward the 2023 target of at least 15%. as we achieve this, we will continue our journey to deliver even more profitable growth. we will continue our ongoing alignment on the business portfolio.
in addition, we have the turbocharging business. although we have not yet made the final decision, a spin-off is looking likely. we will make a final decision by the end of q1. we aim to have the -- both the e-mobility and the turbocharging processes completed during the first half of this year.
it will be an exciting year, and i look forward to it with confidence. and with that, i'll let ann-sofie take over to guide us through the q&a. ann-sofie?
ann-sofie nordh
yes. thank you, bjorn. so let's now open up for q&a. [operator instructions] and i can see that we already now have a lot of questions coming through.
so -- and as usual, please limit yourselves to two questions, and then we'll do our best to do get through as many of the questions as possible. and we start with a question from the conference call, and i believe we should have ben uglow from morgan stanley on the line. ben, are you with us?
ben uglow -- morgan stanley -- analyst
i am. good morning, everyone, and thank you very much for taking the question. i hope everyone is well. so, two kind of areas.
one is just the, let's call it, the operating leverage within electrification and motion. in terms of the margin change, and i don't want to get too granular on bridges, but we're sort of down about 80 basis points on higher revenues in electrification, and on motion, 20 basis points underlying on higher revenues. in terms of what's driving that effect, and i realize this is very, very difficult, but timo, can you quantify how much of this is simply price/cost, right? how much of this is due to raw materials and not being able to get the price up fast enough? and how much of it could be due to other factors, whether it's supply chain, wages, or kind of more normal costs coming back? is this sort of over 50% price/cost? so can you sort of just give us an idea of what are the main drivers in that margin bridge?
bjorn rosengren -- chief executive officer
thank you, ben, for the question. i think i just start, and then i will maybe go to the -- some number crunching just in a minute. first, i'd say that pricing, this is really one of my favorite subjects. and both of these business areas, motion, as well as electrification, are really doing an amazing job on this side.
just to give you a little bit first on the -- because it's a little bit different topic when it comes to these two business areas. but starting up with the motion, i think motion has done an excellent job in compensating some of those. of course, we know increases that has come everything from wages to component prices and also semiconductors, of course. so the biggest difference here in the margin actually comes from divestment of the dodge.
that has an impact. and there is a little bit also, as you know, when it comes to motion, they have two different areas: it's the electric motors, and it is the drives business. electric motors are -- has a lower margin. so it's a little bit of a mix issue there.
so the electric motors grew a little bit more than the drives business did at this moment, which has some effect. so i think they managed from pricing actually to compensate the increases in inflation. on electrification, it's a little bit a different story because, as you know, electrification actually consists of two businesses. you have the fast-moving business like smart power, smart building installation product.
all of them have done an excellent job to quickly compensate for the prices. then we have the distribution solution, which is more the big project switch gear. and many of these orders were actually taken over a year ago and have been executed during the year. and many of them, this is both for utilities as maybe for a lot of process industries and the largest industries.
and here, the pricing is, of course, set at an early stage. and during the year, we've seen quite a dramatic increase in component, logistic, and all of this, and that has affected the margin here. i think now when we are more used to this inflation by the economy or that part, i think also the distribution solution are now being more active in adjusting the pricing in line with the other businesses. so it's a little bit of a mixed story.
if you go to the number crunching, maybe you can give a little bit more flavor.
timo ihamuotila -- chief financial officer
sure, happy to. thanks, ben, for the question. so maybe easiest is to look at this sequentially because, of course, the inflationary pressure has been coming in sequentially. so we actually had better pricing than q3.
so if you put it to numbers, we got over $200 million on price, and that well covered the cost from input cost in commodities and raw materials and that kind of stuff. but then we had additional costs coming from, for example, logistics and these kind of things, in gross margin, that was maybe in the area of $30 million. and then we actually, every year, have a bit higher fixed cost in q4, which we also had now as well. there was, in electrification, for example, a bit more sales cost.
i mean we have a really good year on top line and that kind of stuff. so that, i would put in the situation of normal. so i don't think there is any particular drama here. i think we have been able to do pricing well.
and as bjorn said, we have some businesses where it comes in with a bit of a lag, but we look that we will have a good ability to pricing going into 2022 as well. 
ben uglow -- morgan stanley -- analyst
understood. that's really helpful color. thank you. and then one quick follow-up.
timo, just on working capital, in terms of the moving parts, was there anything that stood out? it's always variable in the fourth quarter. but in your mind, was there anything that stood out that was significant in that movement this time?
timo ihamuotila -- chief financial officer
yeah. yeah, thanks for pointing that out. so this is, of course, not exactly a normal quarter. i mean, first of all, i want to say that we did a really, really good job in working capital overall.
our working capital to revenue ratio was 8.1%, so i haven't seen it that low. and then if you look at the components, we actually got about $100 million in receivables, and our overdues are lowest ever pretty much. so really, really good performance on the team on managing that. we got also about $200 million on payables.
but then when you look at inventory, and this is now delta compared to last year because last year, our inventory really decreased significantly at the end of the quarter, we didn't have a similar impact, and the delta impact on inventory is about 500. but again, as we have discussed, we have a solid backlog, and we expect that that inventory will be consumed when we execute the backlog.
ben uglow -- morgan stanley -- analyst
understood. very helpful. thank you very much. i will pass it on.
have a good day.
bjorn rosengren -- chief executive officer
thanks.
ann-sofie nordh
thanks, ben. and on the topic of backlog, we have a couple of questions coming through from daniela at goldman sachs through the online tool. and i start with one aimed at perhaps you, timo. and it says, how much of the order backlog do you expect delivered in 2022 and also your expectations for organic revenues in this year?
timo ihamuotila -- chief financial officer
yeah. so let's start with the backlog. actually, this is in our report. it's a little bit hidden there, but we would expect to deliver, provided we get the supply, of course, 75% of the backlog during 2022.
so that's basically the number. but of course, long cycle, short cycle will depend this year a little bit on the supply situation, which is maybe a good bridge to the revenue number answer. do you want to jump in there, bjorn? or you want me to --
bjorn rosengren -- chief executive officer
no, i can say on the revenue side, it is, of course, dependent on what we can see, maybe some small challenges in the beginning of the year, but it should ease up. so what we do expect, of course, for the year to be somewhat higher than our over cycle target during this year, of course. so we need to execute on the huge orders on hand, and that will be the focus during this year. 
timo ihamuotila -- chief financial officer
yeah, yeah. so i would just complement that answer by saying that if we get the supply both for the short cycle and executing the backlog, it could be a good revenue year. 
ann-sofie nordh
and to follow up from daniela here on this topic. on the order book -- or sorry, on the order intake, how much of the recent strong orders could potentially be due to double booking? bjorn, do you want to -- 
bjorn rosengren -- chief executive officer
i can mention that, of course, when your deliveries are a little bit down and you're not actually delivering in line with expectations in the market, which has been during the last quarter and maybe also during the third quarter, there might be some booking. i'm sure there are customers who are putting in orders to secure deliveries for the future. so that, i'm sure. but i think the good -- most important is that we see steady strong orders actually in all our three regions, and we see this order continue actually in the beginning of this year.
and we haven't seen any, actually, cancellation of any bookings, which gives us confidence that the quality of the orders are also good.
ann-sofie nordh
very good. and just to finish off here, a question on the ev, the e-mobility business. daniela says, ""we have seen strong decreases on the multiples in the market has been willing to pay for ev charging businesses in recent weeks. if this persists, would you consider delaying the ev listing? or is the timeline fully firmed up?""
bjorn rosengren -- chief executive officer
i mean, that could, of course, happen if the world goes kaput. but as it looks like today, we feel very comfortable about the agenda that we have today. the business is doing great. i think we had, last year, 150% growth, which if you're looking at the last five years, it's actually a cagr of 60%.
i don't think you see many businesses like that. i think it's even making profit, and it's a great business. and i think our advisors are saying that their viewpoint is that it will be a great interest for this. i also urge you, if you haven't booked up next week, you can actually find a link on our website.
we will have in-depth going through that business with the management and talk about the strategy and the future for that. i think it will be interesting, and i hope you have a chance to look in.
ann-sofie nordh
very good. and we take another question from the conference call from alex at bank of america merrill lynch. alex, your line should be open.
unknown speaker
yes. hopefully, it is. good morning to you all. nice to see you and hopefully that can be physically again soon.
thanks for taking the question. so a couple, if i may. the first, i wondered if, timo, you might provide us with some quantification as to what you feel you've missed in revenue terms in q4 as a function of supply chain constraints and assuming that, that will be a similar sort of magnitude in q1 by the comments that you've made so far? and then the follow-up was just on the comments you made there at the end about roce and the hitachi investment. am i right in thinking about a three-year lockup, and so presumably, that's sometime middle of next year? if you could just clarify that, that would be very helpful.
thank you.
timo ihamuotila -- chief financial officer
yeah. i'll start with the latter because you are correct, the put option works in a way that we have a put after three years. so it's mid '23 when we can execute the put, and that's how that works. so, yeah, that's correct.
so then on the revenue, maybe i'll use an example from robotics & discrete automation where the impact is the largest. so you saw we had kind of like 60% order growth and flat revenue. and the orders in that business have been now on $1.1 billion type of area, and the revenue has been sort of $800 million type of area. and not all of that, of course, could have come into the quarter, but that business could easily be closer to $1 billion type of a business in a quarter.
and that, of course, would have a significant accretion on the margin. that's the biggest, and then sort of you can assess between the orders and revenue on some of the other businesses. i think the impact has been probably smallest in pa and then somewhere in between in motion and electrification.
bjorn rosengren -- chief executive officer
maybe i'd just comment also that the order book is up 21% compared to last year, which is, of course, ok. and you have seen a book-to-bill ratio above one in the last four quarters. so you can imagine if we could deliver everything. 
ann-sofie nordh
very good. are you finished there, alex? or do you have other questions? just to --
unknown speaker
sorry. yes, i'll stop with my two. thank you very much. 
ann-sofie nordh
thank you for that. i appreciate it. and with that, we move to andreas willi. i think -- i hope your line is open.
andreas willi -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
yes. thank you, ann-sofie. good morning, everybody. my first question is on the supply chain.
what is your view on the reasons why abb seems to be more impacted than most peers on a like-for-like basis in terms of the constraints you're facing? and what changes can you do or are you doing to improve the resilience going forward? also, if you haven't quite seen the results from your peers yet, but in q3, that was already visible to some degree. that's my first question.
bjorn rosengren -- chief executive officer
yeah, maybe i can take that on. so maybe you know more than we know. but i think if you look at the abb product, it has a lot of semiconductors included both in the electrification business, in the robotics & discrete automation, and also in the motion product. i think we have similar problems as everyone else.
we're trying to get our share. all our businesses are working hard when it comes to semiconductors because i think that's the, overall, the biggest impact for us. i think we -- it's clear we've gone together. we have our team where we're coordinating all our activities with the suppliers.
we are redesigning products to get other type of more available semiconductors in, and i think they've done quite a good job. maybe you remember when we went into the quarter, we said we would have a 4% growth, and we managed to get 8%. and i think that's a full credit to the businesses that they really got themselves through this in the year. so 8% is actually better than we expected.
these will continue, at least in the beginning of the year, and then we will see it slowly go away, and we are pretty optimistic about the second half of the year when it comes to supply. last quarter, there was not only semiconductors that was material. plastics, steel and all these and shipments, the whole logistics chain was difficult. so there are many factors.
many of these have been solved, and we have seen an improvement actually during the quarter. so october was the worst, actually, month, and then we saw improvement in november and improvement in december. and i think that's been very good. so today, it's very much focused on semiconductors.
the other things, i think the businesses have managed well during the period.
andreas willi -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
thank you. and my follow-up is on china construction. i think you mentioned some weakness there. could you maybe elaborate on this? what are you seeing in the market, residential versus nonresidential and the outlook there for '22?
bjorn rosengren -- chief executive officer
yeah. if we look at china overall, we saw a 14% growth, and we should know that it's a very high comparable overall. so i think that is a strong achievement. but it's clear that it's the residential part which has taken the softest during the period, and you've seen stronger on the industrial side.
that will probably continue going into this year. but we should also know that the levels in china are at a very high level at the moment. then we have the whole covid situation where china has a zero vision, as we all know, which means that any kind of breakout, they are very aggressive in closing down factories and things. so there might be disruptions on that side, maybe a little bit too early.
we haven't seen it yet. we've been able to run our operations, and i think we have good development in china. but this is, of course, a potential risk for any company who has a big business in china.
andreas willi -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
thank you very much.
bjorn rosengren -- chief executive officer
thank you.
ann-sofie nordh
ok. thanks, andreas. just to follow up on the expectations and comment -- earlier comment on the revenue growth for 2022 here. timo, i believe it was you who answered it.
when you say 2022 above through-cycle target, do you refer to the 5% or the -- was it you? sorry. or the -- just the organic part -- 
timo ihamuotila -- chief financial officer
but i think we would have the same answer.
ann-sofie nordh
i hope so. 
bjorn rosengren -- chief executive officer
i hope so. no, i mean, timo, you can go ahead. that's fine.
timo ihamuotila -- chief financial officer
no, it's -- i think we are referring to above the 3% to 5% of organic growth because we're really talking about organic growth here on that answer, so yeah.
bjorn rosengren -- chief executive officer
and i mean it will be a lot of focus on executing order book also to get access growth going forward. so --
ann-sofie nordh
very good. we'll take the next question from the conference call. and joe, are you on the line?
unknown speaker
hi, everyone. can you hear me? 
ann-sofie nordh
yeah, we can. hi, joe.
unknown speaker
so would you expect to -- i know you expect to clear some of the backlog over the year, but would you expect book-to-bill to remain over one throughout the year?
bjorn rosengren -- chief executive officer
i mean that's a difficult question. to be honest, i think we have discussed the order expectations also with the board going forward. i think this is probably one of the most difficult areas today to see where things are going. i mean we've seen a very strong start of this year.
is that going to continue during the year? or is -- or will it weaken now? and so i think it's -- i wouldn't actually speculate in this. we will be able to handle both of these. the good stuff is that when you have a lot of orders on hand, you get a little bit more time to adjust yourself if things will be softer. but now we go full speed in all our operations, and it's about delivery, and we have plenty to deliver going forward.
unknown speaker
ok, fair enough. i know that's a tough one to answer.
bjorn rosengren -- chief executive officer
yeah, difficult.
unknown speaker
now in terms of capital deployment, you mentioned you'd like to do five deals a year. you're obviously sitting in a position with like a severely under-levered balance sheet once you get the cash in, particularly after turbo and when you look at all this. but if you -- when do you have to evaluate like a significantly higher buyback activity? or like at what point in the year do you have to kind of make a determination on something like that when it's appropriate?
bjorn rosengren -- chief executive officer
yeah. i mean i can -- timo can talk a little bit about our cash position and what we're expecting to do during the year, and maybe i can add something later.
timo ihamuotila -- chief financial officer
yeah. yeah, sure. so yes, thanks for the question. so if you look at our overall capital-allocation principles, we are actually quite pleased where we are.
so we have a really strong backlog, as we have discussed. we are investing behind the organic growth. i mean the board is proposing an increase in the dividend. and then as discussed, we are looking to execute five-or-so deals in m&a.
so we are putting capital in use there as well. of course, we want to do smart deals. i mean it's not like the tap is often we do whatever. we will continue exactly the same rigor on assessing the deals.
and then we also said in our release that we expect to continue the buybacks during 2022 also in excess of the power grids capital return. now the board will then make an assessment on this one going into the agm. but we, of course, with this, wanted to see now that we are looking to continue the buyback program also after the power grids money has been fully returned to shareholders.
unknown speaker
perfect, thank you.
ann-sofie nordh
thanks, joe. and we move on. martin wilkie, i think -- i hope your line is open. can you hear us?
martin wilkie -- citi -- analyst
yes, i can. thank you. good morning. it's martin from citi.
just the first question, just coming back to some of the constraints and shortages. i think you referred to you can redesign or change components and so forth in products, presumably also some of your component suppliers are adding capacity. can you give us any sort of examples as to when some of these shortages and bottlenecks might clear because of some of your own actions or actually by your suppliers? i guess we're all hoping that the world generally opens up in the second half. but i'm guessing there's some specific things that you've done that has alleviated it over the next couple of quarters.
bjorn rosengren -- chief executive officer
yeah. i think, first, we buy a huge amount of semiconductors into abb. and in certain application, i think that we've been very successful in the drives business to do some of that redesign, but also in other kind of businesses. but it varies a lot depending on how big the series are, how much you are selling of the products.
when you go into more the -- if you put into the switchgear, which is more related to large projects, there are more fewer numbers of certain semiconductors going in. and some of them in process industries have been evaluated during two, three-period to get acceptance. so there, they're actually a little bit more difficult. so it varies a lot.
but i don't think this is any bigger issue for us than anyone else. we've been dealing with it now for three months, for a quarter or even longer than that, and we will continue to deal with it. and i feel that we're slowly moving in the right direction. and as i said, as time goes on, i think we will be less dependent.
and i think our deliveries, of course, our revenues will be depending on, especially in the beginning of the year, how much of this order book we can get out. so --
martin wilkie -- citi -- analyst
yes, that's helpful. thank you very much.
bjorn rosengren -- chief executive officer
thanks.
ann-sofie nordh
thanks, martin. we'll take another question from the online option here from gael de-bray at deutsche bank. can we add some flavor on what we see in the oil and gas market and in the different areas there?
bjorn rosengren -- chief executive officer
yeah. i mean maybe you have seen that the process industries has had a good development during the quarter, and we see good -- both when it comes to actually the revenues but also orders. maybe the order doesn't look that impressive, but we are -- had huge orders in the q4 the year before in the lng market. so the comparables are quite good.
but we see increased activities in all the businesses that we have there, also in the oil and gas business, especially related to gas and chemicals, i would say. so we're quite optimistic that we've seen the development of the oil price. oil and gas prices have gone up dramatically, which, of course, increases the appetite for investments in that region. service business, which is -- if you look at pa, process automation, there is 50% -- approximately 50% of the revenues there.
we've seen very, very strong growth in service there. i think it was up 21%. so very strong service improvement, which is good, also supports the margin forward. so it gives a little bit an indication of what are the activities in this sector.
ann-sofie nordh
very good. and then we take the next question coming from the conference call. and we have phil buller from berenberg. can you hear us? 
phil buller -- berenberg bank -- analyst
yes, i can hear you.
ann-sofie nordh
very good.
phil buller -- berenberg bank -- analyst
yes, i can hear you. yeah, i was hoping just to probe a little more on the growth outlook in 2022, please. obviously, we don't have a specific guide. i hear the comments of above 3% to 5%, which suggests that a percent is just maybe a shade too high.
but i was wondering if you could comment on how much of the growth you are expecting in 2022 is actually going to be coming from price as opposed to volume. is it all price? or is there a good level of volume? and obviously, i'm asking because volume helps more from a fixed cost absorption standpoint than -- more than the passing on price. and i have a second question, but i'll cut.
bjorn rosengren -- chief executive officer
yeah, i can start with that. i mean it's quite clear that we expect to have a good growth in revenues during this year. i think you can imagine that. we see a strong market, but we also have big orders on hand, and we're going to execute that.
so what we are saying is that, of course, we do expect that we will exceed this over a cycle targets that we presented during the capital market day. i can only say that. and i said, how much more is probably related to some of the supplies and our possibility to execute this huge order book that we have.
phil buller -- berenberg bank -- analyst
sure, sure. i was more curious as to how much volume is going to be coming through within the number this year rather than the overall. but if you can't comment on that, that's fine. my second -- 
bjorn rosengren -- chief executive officer
no, i -- yes, that's fine.
phil buller -- berenberg bank -- analyst
and my second question is on a slightly different topic in relation to the e-mobility business and perhaps it's just front running what's going to be discussed on the website, i think you said next week. but you have this very nice investor day on topics like sustainable transport at the second half of last year and the importance of it for the whole abb. and obviously, e-mobility is a big part of that puzzle, but it's something that you're spinning out, which makes a lot of sense from a multiple standpoint. but i was wondering if you could comment on any of the [inaudible] for e-mobility being separately run and listed and what you're putting in place to ensure that the wider abb will still benefit from all those synergies that may otherwise not be there. 
bjorn rosengren -- chief executive officer
yeah. first, i think it's very important that the ipo that we are doing is only a part of that with at least 20%. so the whole e-mobility development will be consolidated into abb. we will, of course, also use the brand abb because it's a good way to because it's very exposed to all around the world outside.
so we think it's good. and i think abb is well known for electrification. so it fits very well. so i think the reason why we do it is that, as you've seen, our orders grew last year, 150%, and we have the cagr the last five years, about 60, which means it's a little bit a different kind of business than rest of abb, which means that we believe that the demand in the market need to be met.
and it's run a little bit more like a start-up business than it is than a mature business like rest of abb. so what we're doing, we have a new board in place. we have a new chairman, which is actually coming from this kind of tech industry. we will have a special board, and they will drive very strong focus as you have to do of any company that are starting up.
what's unique with our business is that even though we are the biggest and growing, among the fastest in the market, we are still profitable, which makes the business even more interesting in these times now for the ipo.
timo ihamuotila -- chief financial officer
yeah. can i, bjorn, make a quick comment on the synergies as well? so you mentioned the brand, but we are also very carefully considering kind of like the independence of the company. of course, they need to be able to invest behind their own business. but we are also offering them a platform in a smaller country sales, they can use el sales as a channel.
so big countries, own channels; smaller countries, up to them. and of course, this happens on sort of arm's length pricing and all that, but that's another area where we're really enabling them to grow fast at the same time. so we, hopefully, we really get the best of both worlds on the independence, but also getting the synergies.
phil buller -- berenberg bank -- analyst
great, thank you.
bjorn rosengren -- chief executive officer
thanks, phil.
ann-sofie nordh
thanks, phil. and we'll take another question from the conference call. guillermo from ubs, please?
unknown speaker
good morning. good morning, ann-sofie. good morning, bjorn and timo. thanks for taking my questions.
ann-sofie nordh
good morning.
bjorn rosengren -- chief executive officer
good morning.
unknown speaker
your plan is -- it goes basically on two questions. one is on electrification, and the other one is on robotics & discrete automation. but the first question, on electrification, your plant in xiamen in the fujian province, i think it was impacted in the third quarter by lockdowns relative to covid. and i was wondering whether during this quarter, the fourth quarter, you also had some kind of impacts on that plant in particular? and if so, when do you expect it to be fully operational? and i'll stop there and then ask the second question.
thank you.
bjorn rosengren -- chief executive officer
yeah. i think when it comes -- i talked a little bit at the beginning of that electrification. yes, it was a challenge in going into q3 in north america and with the labor market, big volumes, component shortage and all that and also on the inflation of commodities and components and so on. but i think they did a great job in actually working with the pricing.
they are, within abb, probably the most sophisticated machine when it comes to working with pricing. there are, though, two different areas. and i think the more the component business, the smart power and the smart building and installation product, that is moving on quite good and delivering what it should be doing. the challenge is more related to the switchgear, the bigger projects where we have longer lead times into.
i think that is now being addressed. and we are working with the pricing side there also to compensate some of those huge cost increases that have been done. so we feel pretty comfortable that we should see a good development of electrification going into this year also on margin.
unknown speaker
ok. but any lockdown impact in q4 versus q3 or just fully operational as it is? 
bjorn rosengren -- chief executive officer
no, we had -- we didn't have any lockdowns. so i think everything went good during this period. 
unknown speaker
and then the second question is on robotics & discrete automation, and i wanted to ask maybe for an update on the new plant business. i -- when do you expect it to be fully operational again? and any particular also revenue dynamics that we should be aware of going into 2022? thank you.
bjorn rosengren -- chief executive officer
yeah, thank you. it's clear that the robot & discrete automation is the two businesses who has been mostly impacted of the shortages of semiconductors. you can see that we are on the revenues not really getting out. you saw order growth of 60% and flat revenues.
that's pretty dramatic. and then you, of course, see all the cost inflation there. so that was effect. so that is a strong focus during the year.
and we are, of course, expecting a significantly improved both when it comes to volumes deliveries, as well as margin. you know very clear that i have said from the beginning, this is a business that should be about 15%, and we should see a good step in the right direction during this year.
ann-sofie nordh
and i believe, correct me if i'm wrong here, but also, i believe you also wanted to know about the new plant. am i right?
unknown speaker
yeah. 
bjorn rosengren -- chief executive officer
yeah, sorry. maybe you want to talk about it?
timo ihamuotila -- chief financial officer
i don't have anything new on the timeline of opening the plant.
bjorn rosengren -- chief executive officer
i think this year, we will actually inaugurate the plant. they have been working very hard during the last years here now, and it's getting ready. and we're really looking forward to this new facility because the growth in china is actually where we are growing fastest today in the world. and so it's important that we can meet that both with the right quality, technology and the growth capabilities there.
so we're excited about it. and hopefully, we will see china open up a little bit more so also some of us can tend to go there.
timo ihamuotila -- chief financial officer
yeah. well, for a long -- i just -- can i just mention something just that there is no misunderstanding. i mentioned this getting closer to the $1 billion quarterly revenue, we have capacity to get there, and this is really for longer term. so just to be clear, we have been on fairly low revenue levels.
this is not like we need a huge infra to get to those levels where we can execute a really nice margin in robotics & discrete and then we can build on from there.
bjorn rosengren -- chief executive officer
yeah, i mean the whole production is built on assembly. so i think you need to have the components and you put them together. so if we have the component, we can also deliver.
unknown speaker
thank you. but maybe if i may actually follow up a little bit on the plant. i was also looking for any -- from loading of cost, maybe on the opening on the ramp-up of production, if you have any guidance at this point or whether we're going to see any operating leverage hit on the back of basically a new plant opening before you get actually to that ramp-up in revenues, right?
bjorn rosengren -- chief executive officer
no, i think that it should not have any effects on the cost structure. 
timo ihamuotila -- chief financial officer
yeah, not a major driver.
bjorn rosengren -- chief executive officer
no, not really, i think. but i think it's important to see that the gross margin of all our businesses have improved very good during this year, which shows that we're keeping the cost under control, and we managed to actually to price and have a good margin on most of our businesses.
unknown speaker
thank you.
ann-sofie nordh
thank you. and we are up to the hour. so, we say thank you very much for joining us today. and again, just a quick reminder, as bjorn mentioned before, if you have the time to tune into the e-mobility session on the afternoon of the 10th, please do so.
thank you.
bjorn rosengren -- chief executive officer
thank you. 
timo ihamuotila -- chief financial officer
thank you.

ann-sofie nordh
greetings to you all, and welcome to the presentation of abb's first quarter results. most of you know me by now. i'm ann-sofie nordh, head of investor relations. and next to me here, i have our ceo, bjorn rosengren, and our cfo, timo ihamuotila.
like always, they will take you through the presentation, after which we'll open up for q&a. but before we begin, i would like to draw your attention to the information regarding safe harbor notices and our use of non-gaap measures on slide two of the abb presentation. this conference call will include forward-looking statements, and these statements are based on the company's current expectations and certain assumptions and are, therefore, subject to certain risks and uncertainties. and with that, i will hand you over to bjorn and timo to take you through our results.
bjorn rosengren -- chief executive officer
thank you, ann-sofie, and a warm welcome from me as well. i want to start off with a few highlights from the quarter. first, it was really good to see the customers remain very active. our orders reached $9.4 billion, the highest quarterly level in recent years.
these strong orders and the top line somewhat hampered by component shortages resulted in a book-to-bill of 1.35, and it was actually our fifth consecutive quarter with a positive book-to-bill. the margin of 14.3% was good. admittedly, it was supported by low corporate costs. but looking at the operations, we had three business areas which performed well.
then we had underperformance in robot and discrete automation. but i expect this to improve from hereon. that is, of course, assuming external challenges do not escalate. these are uncertain times with many moving factors.
inflation is at levels that we have not seen in many years. the terrible war in ukraine is weighing on all of our minds. we have global imbalances in the supply chain and now also the comprehensive covid lockdowns in china. these are -- challenges our businesses must deal with on a daily basis.
on the whole, we have managed well so far. then i want to mention that we have formed a new division in electrification. we have separated the service business to its own division to improve transparency and accountability to drive both growth and profitability. this was initiated by tarak, and morten will now follow through as he looks over the business area leadership as from this month.
on that topic, i'm pleased to see that both tarak and morten have come off to a running start in their new roles, and i look forward to them both driving performance to the next level. lastly, i'm pleased about the new buyback program. this was launched on the first of april and covers up to $3 billion. this means that we go beyond the promise to return at least $1.2 billion of the power grids proceeds.
now, let's look at the orders and revenues in more details on slide four. as mentioned, orders intake reached a record high level. it was driven by strong development across most of our customer segments and all regions. and we saw a strong double-digit growth in the short cycle, the process industry-related business, as well as in service.
we saw no real difference in the underlying market patterns toward the end of the quarter compared with in the beginning. it was strong throughout the whole period. revenues improved at a good pace of 7%, driven by positive volume growth, as well as good pricing execution. all business areas reported positive comparable revenue growth of between 9% to 11%, except for robotics and discrete automation, which is where the supply shortages of semiconductors was the most notable.
timo will talk more about that later in the business area comments. now, let's take a quick look at the different regions on slide five. again, we saw strong double-digit growth in all three regions. in the americas, the important u.s.
market increased by 46%, supported by all business areas. in europe, most of the top 10 markets showed strong growth rates. that said, on the slide, you see that germany improved by only 4%. this includes a de-booking in process automation.
outside of that, the underlying orders were very strong. the amea region improved overall by 24%. it was good to see continued strength in china, which improved by 26%, supported by all business areas. let's turn to slide six and the earnings outcome.
our gross margin was 32.7% in the quarter, which is a slight decline of 20 basis points from last year. this is primarily due to the divestment of the high-margin dodge business, but also due to a drop in robotics and discrete automation. cost inflation was broad challenge in the quarter with the biggest headwind in raw materials, but we managed to successfully offset this through price management and the impact from high volumes. in total, we saw a slight improvement of 10 to 20 basis points to the margin when adjusting for the lower-than-expected corporate costs and divestment of dodge.
overall, q1 was a solid start of the year. and with that, i hand over to timo to take us through the numbers in more details.
timo ihamuotila -- chief financial officer
thank you, bjorn, and greetings to everyone also from my side. you heard bjorn talking about a generally strong demand across the board. and as we go through the different business areas, this will be clearly evident. but let's start by looking at electrification.
here, we saw a very strong demand, driving orders to clearly above $4 billion with a comparable growth rate of 29%. with strength spread across all customer segments, we actually saw double-digit order growth in all of the divisions, including the newly formed service unit. orders in both europe and americas improved at a steep double-digit rate, and it was good to see that growth rates also turned back into positive territory in china at plus 9%. revenues in electrification were a bit back end-loaded during the quarter, and the comparable growth of 10% was yet again supported by a strong pricing execution.
volumes also contributed, but were somewhat impacted by supply chain disruptions, and this mostly relates to the largest division, distribution solutions, due to its large system sales. i hope to see a progressive easing of the component constraints. overall, it was yet another quarter with a book-to-bill ratio above one, and the backlog increased to a record high $6.5 billion. i'm sure you remember that in q1 last year, electrification took prompt actions on pricing in order to set off the oncoming headwind from higher raw material prices while still enjoying the benefits of low input costs due to hedges.
versus this tough comparable from last year, the operational ebita margin declined 80 basis points to 15.4%, mainly due to subdued performance in distribution solutions business, while the team has continued to do a great job on tightly managing their price lists. looking ahead into the second quarter, we expect similar growth rate as in q1 and somewhat of a sequential margin improvement. let's then move on to motion, which also had a very high order level. this is particularly impressive when you consider the relatively low contribution from large orders and the fact that this was the first full quarter without the dodge business.
the stellar comparable order growth of 32% was supported by high customer activity in all segments across all regions. like in previous quarters, it is probably fair to assume some positive impact from customers preordering in the current inflationary environment. that said, we have not seen order cancellations, neither did we see any slowdown in the strong customer activity toward the end of the quarter nor in the early days of april. comparable revenues improved by 9%, supported by both volumes and strong pricing execution.
the semiconductor shortages started to ease somewhat sequentially, not least due to the implemented product redesigns and the validation of alternative suppliers, job really well done by the motion's team. the margin in motion, a highlight of the quarter, increased by 30 basis points from last year to 17.4%. this means that on higher volumes and strong pricing activities, we more than offset the missing 90 basis points which the dodge business contributed to the same period last year, as well as cost inflation from raw materials and freight. for the second quarter, we expect comparable revenues to grow at least at a similar rate as in q1 and margin to remain broadly stable with q1.
we now turn to slide nine in process automation, where we continued to see strong demand across most of the customer segments, particularly in marine, as well as mining and metals. as a result, base orders continued to grow at a double-digit rate, while the total order growth reached 6%, weighted upon by the de-booking of approximately $190 million. higher-than-expected deliveries toward the end of the quarter resulted in comparable revenue growth of 11% for process automation. overall, the impact of semiconductor shortages was still somewhat less than anticipated, but we continue to expect these headwinds to increase as the year progresses.
and pa team continues, of course, to work hard to mitigate this risk. the operational ebita margin of pa was 13%, up 200 basis points from last year. the result benefited from the positive volume development and the result of efficiency measures implemented earlier. i'm really pleased to see the progress of the business area underlined by the fact that all five divisions are in double-digit margin territory.
peter and the team will give more color on how they are driving toward higher structured performance at their capital markets day in may. in q2, for pa, we expect a mid to high single-digit growth rate for comparable revenues and a similar operational ebita margin as in q1. on slide 10, we turn to robotics and discrete automation, the business area that is still hardest hit by the shortages in semiconductors. the demand environment continues to be very strong for ra and orders were up 60% on a comparable basis, driven by high customer activity in both divisions.
in robotics, both the auto segment, particularly driven by ev investment in china, as well as the non-auto segment, continued to be strong. at the same time, revenue generation continues to be adversely impacted by delayed customer deliveries caused by the semiconductor shortages. on a sequential basis, the supply situation deteriorated somewhat. this, in combination with the high orders, resulted in another increase in the order backlog to $2.5 billion.
although the supply chain should remain strained, we expect the first quarter to be the low point for robotics and discrete automation, assuming we do not see further deterioration of the china lockdown situation. overall, the decline in volumes triggered under-absorption of fixed cost in ra. adding to that, the impact from inflation of input costs and freight, the positive contribution from cost and price measures were more than offset. and in total, the operational ebita margin declined by 570 basis points to 6.7%.
looking into q2, we anticipate some effects on ra's operations from the covid-related lockdowns in the shanghai area. we expect the comparable revenue growth to remain negative, but the operational ebita margin to sequentially improve. and then, moving on to slide 11, showing the group revenues and operational ebita bridge. the year-on-year improvement mainly reflects the low corporate costs in the quarter, earlier mentioned by bjorn.
that said, when looking at the operations, i'm pleased to see that we successfully managed to offset cost inflation through the impact from higher volumes, strong outcome in pricing and earlier implemented cost actions. the reduction of losses incurred in noncore businesses helped margins by about 30 basis points, while acquisitions and divestments were 30 basis points diluting on a group level, mainly due to the negative impact from the dodge divestment. on slide 12, we move to the usual cash picture. and while cash flow tends to be seasonally softer in the first quarter, the negative $564 million from operating activities was a bit weaker than we had anticipated.
we had a higher-than-expected buildup of inventories to support a significant increase in order backlog. we see both our inventories, as well as receivables being of good quality. q1 cash flow also reflects a higher payout of employee incentives due to the strong financial performance in 2021 where delta to the covid year, 2020, is particularly large, as well as approximately $170 million of cash paid for income taxes related to the e-mobility and turbocharging separations. i'm sure you remember from our capital markets day that we still have expected impacts from two large legacy projects in non-core.
and during the second quarter, we expect to complete the full exit of one of our two main exposures left in our non-core business. this is likely to trigger a nonoperational charge of approximately $200 million in restructuring-related expenses, primarily relating to contract settlements, hence, there would also be a corresponding cash flow impact when paid. this is still not absolutely certain, but i wanted to call it out so that if it happens, it doesn't come as a surprise. as bjorn also said, we are still confident that we will achieve solid cash flow for the full year.
and before i hand over to bjorn, let me just update you on our active portfolio management actions. regarding our planned listing of e-mobility, we continue to aim for completion during the second quarter, assuming constructive market conditions, i.e., no change in the timeline. on the other hand, we have decided that we will not rush to make the final decision between a spin-off or a sale of turbocharging or accelleron, as it is now called. we still lean toward spin-off and listing on the swiss exchange, but now we are looking to make the final decision before the end of q2, as also bjorn mentioned at the agm.
so overall, despite the uncertain market environment, abb is moving to the right direction. we are growing in the right businesses, in line with our stability, profitability and growth strategy, and continued improvement in our backlog gross margin is testament to abb also improving long-term quality of revenues. and on that note, i would like to hand back to you, bjorn.
bjorn rosengren -- chief executive officer
thank you, timo. and i will end with some comments on the sustainability on slide 14 before i finish off with the q2 outlook. we published our sustainability report in march, and i'm pleased with the progress we made toward our long-term targets. the largest potential impact on climate change is through our products that we sell every day.
we estimate that our products sold last year supported our customers to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions by 11.5 megatons after the first year, which is a good start toward the target of at least 100-megaton reduction by 2030. it is not on this slide, but i also want to mention that we reduced our own co2 emissions by 39% compared to the 2019 baseline, a clear step toward ambition of carbon neutrality in 2030. we also made progress in the gender diversity with the share of women in senior management position increasing by about three percentage points to 16.3%. finally on this slide, i just want to mention that going forward, we will have a 20% weight of our esg metrics in our long-term incentive plan.
this is in addition to the metrics we already had incorporated in our short-term incentives. in my view, this signals just how embedded sustainability is in our operation and is part of everything we do. and lastly, on slide 15, we take a quick look at our expectations for q2. we foresee the current high level of underlying market activity to remain strong and support our order intake.
for revenues, i just noted that it tends to be seasonally stronger in the q2 compared with the q1. i expect that to be this case also this year. in this environment, we expect the margin to improve slightly quarter-on-quarter. this, of course, assumes that we do not see a significant escalation of lockdowns in china.
and with that, i'll let ann-sofie take over to guide us through the q&a.
ann-sofie nordh
thank you. and with that said, let's now open up for q&a. [operator instructions] and i can see that we already have a line of people who want to put questions through. [operator instructions] and with that said, we kick it off with alex from bank of america merrill lynch.
are you on the line, alex?
alex virgo -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
thanks, anne-sofie. so i wondered if you could talk in the first instance to the dynamics in china. obviously, lockdown is going to affect everything. you talked about it specifically for ra, but i guess if you could give us a little bit more color around the end markets and the divisions, that would be helpful.
and in particular, i would like to hear about el exposure and the residential construction market there too. and then, in follow-up, i wonder if you could just talk a little bit to this de-booking of an order in process. what is that? what happened there? why? and if you could just explain what the difference between that and the cancellation is, that would be really helpful. thank you.
bjorn rosengren -- chief executive officer
ok. maybe i'll start with the de-booking, so we take that one. yeah, that is another word for a company going bankrupt, put it that way. so it's a shipyard that went bankrupt, and we had to revert an order of $190 million, and no financial impact actually on our profit from that one.
let's talk a little bit about china. first, china had a very strong order intake, as you saw, 26% up during the quarter, which is exaggerated a little bit from the robotics. so robotics had a very, very strong orders in china, but a lot coming also from automotive e-mobility actually in china where we're taking some really great orders. if you look at china from abb perspective, we have three production hubs, i would say.
one is shanghai, which is mostly related to the robotics side, and we have xiamen, where it's more motion and electrification. and then, we also had beijing. what has happened now is the shutdown in shanghai, which, of course, affected our robot factory there, which has been closed for three weeks. we expect it to start opening up on monday.
that's the signals, but of course, it's a zero vision in china, which means that any kind of covid breakout in your factory would, of course, immediately shut down the factory. so it's a little bit uncertain, therefore. this is, of course, taken in consideration when we looked at our outlook for q2 as that has been part of it. and when we look at the different businesses, yes, it's correct that electrification was the business which is more or less flat compared to last year, while the other businesses showed good growth.
and i'm sure that is coming from certain -- from the residential part. we also -- just to say, we've seen also orders develop very well also during the second quarter, during the first two weeks, but that we will come back to later. china is a big market for us. we have 16,000 people.
it's about 16% of our turnover. so it's quite big for us. and so, far, it's now getting a little bit better in shanghai. but of course, if there will be shutdowns in any of our other regions, that will have impact during q2.
i think that's it. i think that's about it.
ann-sofie nordh
yeah, very good. and then, we'll take a question from the chat line here. and we have one from sebastian at rbc. it says -- and perhaps this is aimed for you, timo.
how can corporate costs be lower than expected? and what cost position did to price?
timo ihamuotila -- chief financial officer
yeah. that's, of course, a good question because we gave an $80 million estimate on corporate cost and came in at $32 million. there were two things that happened the latter part of the quarter, which we simply didn't know that were going to happen in q1, and that we have always said that this corporate cost line can be lumpy. so first of all, we had a real estate gain, which we didn't know that it was going to execute it exactly at this point in time.
and then, we also had a provision release in non-core in one of these areas, and that also impacted. those two were approximately $40 million delta. and then, we had kind of like real cost decrease in corporate cost maybe in the area of $5 million to $10 million. so that's the reason why we didn't see this coming going into the quarter fully.
ann-sofie nordh
great. thank you. and with that, we'll take the next question from the conference call. and do we have daniela costa from goldman sachs on the line?
daniela costa -- goldman sachs -- analyst
hi, good morning. thanks for taking my question. i wanted to ask on the free cash flow and on the guidance there that you still want to have a solid number this year. but it sounds like in the first half, also because of this exceptional $200 million, will be quite weak.
so do you still see that has possibly up year on year like your guidance for the p&l implies? or would we see this year a bit of a weaker than normal cash conversion overall? if you could give some comment on that. actually, following up on that, still staying on cash, on the working capital point, do you still have to do further restocking this year? or you think now working capital levels are where you would like them to be? that's my first. if i can ask a second one, i'll go after.
timo ihamuotila -- chief financial officer
ok. thanks, daniela. so when you go all the way to free cash flow, you are correct to point out that we have a couple of headwinds which were not there '21. and so, if we just assume all other things equal and a similar drop-through, we could also see a little bit lower free cash flow than '21, but we expect to have strong cash flow delivery.
and if you would take this, what you mentioned, a possible $200 million impact q2 out and correct for the bonuses, it should be a very, very strong cash year as we see it. and then, if we look at net working capital, we should now start to see move to the other direction. and i'm saying that simply because we still had a very low comparable order growth q1. we had 1% and then we grew 28%.
as you saw now for q2, the comparable is 24%. and then, we have more than 20% order growth comparables for the rest of the year. so in that sense, the book-to-bill should start to move now against, let's say, closer to one, which, of course, would be a more normal type of situation. so that should then lead to us releasing net working capital.
of course, this again assumes that nothing extraordinary doesn't happen on the external market like a full lockdown in china or something which would, of course, then impact our deliveries.
daniela costa -- goldman sachs -- analyst
understood. thank you. and just the second question was more general in terms of like what we are seeing regarding energy transition in europe and a lot of talks regarding lng capex picking up. i know you have some exposure there.
but can you remind us what they are and how significant if we do have a big wave of lng liquefaction and regasification capex? how could that flow through in terms of abb on growth and if that's material? thank you.
bjorn rosengren -- chief executive officer
yeah. first, i think we believe that, of course, trying to be less depending on russian gas, we think the transition toward more renewable energy sources in europe will accelerate. so we think that will have a positive effect on us. on the lng side, i mean that's more related to our marine business, which is the azipod, where there are a number of ships being built today in korea where we have azipods on them, and they are being done and they have been delivered already.
where those ships will end up in the end, i see that will be korea who will be dealing with that. so we have, on that part, a limited exposure for azipods going forward.
daniela costa -- goldman sachs -- analyst
so on the regasification and liquefaction plants sort of online, you wouldn't get exposure on process automation?
timo ihamuotila -- chief financial officer
well, i mean, if those things will need dcs and automation, as some of them most likely will. so i think overall, if you look at this, let's call it, energy reassuring, for lack of a better word, it should be a positive thing for abb because our exposure is more in europe on, for example, in oil and gas area and more in the u.s., especially in the shale side. so all of those should be, i would say, rather a positive.
bjorn rosengren -- chief executive officer
yeah, if europe will be buying from u.s. but of course, that will take a little bit time to build up the right terminals and to be able to start the export. but sure, it might drive more on the shale gas in the north america.
ann-sofie nordh
ok. thanks, daniela. and we'll take another question here from the chat line, and it's from christian at pareto, who is asking about the motivation and reasoning behind the leadership exchange in electrification and motion. and i guess that's for you, bjorn.
bjorn rosengren -- chief executive officer
yeah, i think that's -- yeah, i think this was a good move, i would say. we have two good leaders, both tarak, as well as morten. i think tarak has been sitting in that position for quite some time. and as you know me, i'm a firm believer that you should not be too long in a position.
it's important that when you lift stones, it should not be the dirt that you have put there yourself. so it is important. i think it's great to see morten putting his thoughts and his hands on the electrification with some fresh eyes. i think that would be good.
and i think also tarak, with his great knowledge about acquisitions and also implementing the non -- yes, more acquisitions into the business of motion. and you know that our motion business is actually very much focused on profitable growth, meaning that we do expect that we will see a number of acquisitions within this business going forward. so i think tarak can be a good support to that. i think so far, both of them have a lot of energy and very motivated in their new positions, and we are really looking forward to see what will come out of that.
ann-sofie nordh
and then we open up the line for martin at citi. if you're there, martin.
martin wilkie -- citi-- analyst
yeah. thank you. good morning. it's martin at citi.
the first question i had was on the demand backlog. i mean, your orders were strong across the board, but europe, still double-digit growth. and obviously, we're hearing lots of things about potential issues in germany to be -- or elsewhere. i mean, given the order strength in europe, i mean, how are you seeing your european customer base developing, both what you saw in the first quarter, but also what you're expecting for the next couple of quarters? so that's the first question.
bjorn rosengren -- chief executive officer
i mean, if you look at the orders during the quarter, we saw strong actually in all three regions, even though north america was the strongest one, which was over 40%, and europe, you see, over 20%, and that actually included the de-booking. so it's even stronger than that. and we saw 26% in china and over 20%. so overall, the demand is there.
for me, really, to see what is the underlying happening in the market, i think it's very interesting to look at the service market, which is quite a big part of us, over 30% of our business. and that was up 15% which, from an aftermarket, it shows very much strength and activity in the market. so yes, it's quite, overall, as you see in our different businesses, we see it strong in robotics and discrete automation, but we also see very, very strong electrification, as you saw more or less a record growth number for electrification and also strong in motion. and process automation, if you do about that de-booking, it's actually 15%.
so it's not bad. i mean, it's difficult to say how much of this, of course, is coming from longer lead times. there is a certain amount of that. but we look into this quarter start, and the demand continues on the same high level.
so it's difficult to see. but on long term, it's for -- until the end of the year, it may be a little bit too far away to make because of uncertainties in the market. but for the second quarter, i think we expect to have robust orders.
martin wilkie -- citi-- analyst
thank you. and if i have a second question, just on robotics. so obviously, there's a number of drivers here. so there's a big under-absorption.
but if you were to sort of ex out the under-absorption, i mean, are you able to pass through some of the cost inflation in the orders that you are delivering? so can we look at this as effectively just a capacity utilization drag that will hopefully normalize as we bottleneck these?
bjorn rosengren -- chief executive officer
yeah. i mean, first, the volumes for robotics is down 11%, 12%, which is quite dramatic, to be honest. and they have been struggling with the semiconductor supply. and it's a little bit tough for them because suddenly they get the commitment from some suppliers and then in the middle of the quarter, they get a de-commitment, which means that they are standing with half-built robots, which is, of course, driving both inventory and waiting for components.
so it becomes inefficiencies in the production. then the order book is quite long, which means from order to delivery, which means that when orders were taken, many of what's being delivered out today was taken for a price which was before the inflation started. and it can be difficult actually to negotiate up prices with customers when you're already committed to certain deliveries. but they are focusing on this.
and we do believe that we will have a better access to semiconductor during the second half of the year, and we also expect that the price increases will go through. so significant improvement in performance during the second, but it's expected from robotics.
martin wilkie -- citi-- analyst
great. that's very helpful. thank you.
ann-sofie nordh
thank you. and then, we have a question from the chat tool again, and it's from will mackie, and he wants to know about pricing. if we could please give an idea of the level of price contribution to the revenue growth for the group and a little bit by the pa. timo?
timo ihamuotila -- chief financial officer
yeah. thanks for the question. when you look at our bridge, that's actually a very easy math this time. so we have about $300 million is from pricing and about $100 million is from volume, roughly.
and that means that our pricing went up from about 3% impact to about 4% impact. so i think the teams have done a good job on that area. and we were actually this time able to more than offset the material -- raw material cost with pricing. and then, we, of course, had some other increases like in freight and all that, but it was, of course, an important contribution on us being up this 10, 20 basis points on comparable margin when you take out the corporate impact and also correct for dodge, as we also said earlier today.
ann-sofie nordh
ok. and then, we take a question from the conference call, and it comes from andreas willi at j.p. morgan.
andreas willi -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
yeah. good morning, everybody. thanks for the time. my first question is a bit of a follow-up on the earlier question on europe.
if you look at your exposure to energy-intensive industries in europe, chemicals, fertilizers, some of these downstream businesses, what do you expect here to happen between customers having to invest more in energy efficiency as a positive on one side, but potential risks from them just not being competitive and still producing at all, particularly if we get any gas rationing or something like that later in the year? how do you assess this in terms of upsides and downsides for particularly your process business, but also other businesses that sell into these customers whose competitiveness is maybe impaired for quite some time if europe has higher energy costs?
bjorn rosengren -- chief executive officer
yeah. i think it's relating a lot to pa at the moment. and there's two parts of pa. pa, 50% of the pa revenues is actually service and spare parts today.
and that is, of course, reflecting the activity out in these businesses. and it's a good profitable part of the business and normal quite agile from ups and down. and we're seeing here strong growth today of about 15%. it shows that a lot of the process industries are going.
when we look at the process industries, the different divisions, of course, it varies a lot. but in this transition toward newer energy types, we are, of course, very active. and we are supporting many of the company, both in becoming more energy efficient, but also in transition from oil and gas to renewables. so we are very active in many of these projects, not least in the nordic part, in green steel, it's in battery manufacturing, renewcell.
there's a lot of these companies that are really driving the transformation there, and abb has an active part. the other part which is important for us, we are looking at every project, and we have said that we are not prepared to take businesses with low margins. so we are looking at the quality of the businesses that we are going in where we have strong customer relation and they really value our offerings and the value that we can help these customers with. and that has really helped us to drive up the margin in our order book.
and we are quite excited actually about what is taking place in the pa. and we're having the capital markets day very soon in may for pa. so if you have a chance to look in and participate, that will give you some exciting part of the business and why we believe in this business going forward.
andreas willi -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
thank you. and the second question is just a clarification around the guidance. obviously, you spoke about potential further impact from china in terms of covid restrictions, which are not included in that sense. is this basically just lockdowns beyond what we have already seen now in april? so everything that we have seen in april is part of that when we look at your comments going forward, which imply your -- you mentioned, expect some easing on the supply chain from here despite the lockdowns that we're currently seeing.
bjorn rosengren -- chief executive officer
thank you, andreas. yeah, of course, we know china's zero vision, which means that a lot of things can happen. it's difficult to predict. but it, of course, includes what we have seen until today, and that is the shanghai area.
and you know we have three manufacturing hubs which are important, where shanghai is one of them. and we are expecting that's how -- but we've been promising an improvement from next week where we will be opening up the factory to drive. and if we don't end up in a big outbreak, we think -- we believe it's going to open more and more. in a couple of weeks, we would go for 100% capacity again.
but no one knows what's going to happen in china there. so we just want to say that if there will be a major lockdown in any of the other two big production hubs, of course, it will have an impact on the quarter. but so far, we don't know anything of them, that there is nothing today in -- that is turning in this direction.
andreas willi -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
and on the -- earlier in the year, you mentioned that you would expect all business areas in terms of profitability to improve this year. is that still the case with robotics? or is the second half improvement too late in that sense?
bjorn rosengren -- chief executive officer
no, absolutely. robotics, i've been very clear that robotics is a 15-plus business, and i'm still saying that. and if you remember last year, the first quarter, when we saw the volumes are coming up and they are pushing this part, we were up already in 12.5%. so the trend was very good.
and then, came all the supply chain issues and the volumes were going down, and they have been suffering on this. but i definitely believe that the underlying business is plus 15%. and we believe that we will see an improvement in this quarter and then definitely during the second half.
ann-sofie nordh
ok?
andreas willi -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
thank you very much.
ann-sofie nordh
yeah. thanks, andreas. and then, we move to ben at morgan stanley.
ben uglow -- morgan stanley -- analyst
oh, good morning, everyone. thank you for taking the question. so apologies for laboring the point, but to come back on robotics, what i was interested to understand is if we went back two years to the capital markets day in february 2020, sami and the divisional management outlined a fairly interesting program of measures that were going to be put in place for the division. at the time, i think the division was doing a 12% margin, and the goal still is 13% to 17%.
those measures were cost out, they were fixing execution issues and then, finally, pricing. and what i was hoping for was a sort of qualitative update of where we are in those three buckets. so if you look at robotics today and say where are we in the last two years, have we got the cost out? have we fixed all the execution? ex supply chain effects, where are we versus two years ago?
bjorn rosengren -- chief executive officer
yeah. let me talk a little bit about robotics. first, i think that we have a good offering, and i think we're adding a lot of value to our customers. and we also believe that the demand for these products is going to be strong going forward.
we're a strong believer that automation will be one of the driving forces going forward. also, the strategy that moving away from this low-margin system business in automotive, we strongly believe and focus on some of the more profitable segments like logistics and general industry and so on. and i think that actually reflects in the margin that we have in the order book. and i mean the demand, it's difficult to complain about that.
i think orders were up 60%. the frustration is, of course, that you will have customers that are being delayed in deliveries, and that is, of course, cumbersome for the division. when i look at the cost part, of course, when you -- they had the capital market day, when you met them, that was before this new environment with inflation that we are living in today. so of course, that old material has gone up.
and besides that, they have been buying semiconductors on the black market for prices which are totally outrageous. so yes, the costs have gone up dramatically in this part. they have also lifted prices a lot. but as i mentioned before, the orders books are quite long, which means that many of the orders that we are delivering out at the moment is, of course, taken before these price increases were implemented.
and difficult to renegotiate in the market today, and you know some of the end customers that are pretty tough from that perspective. so i'm a strong believer in robotics. i think this is one of our really growth divisions from going forward. and i'm also a strong believer that we will reach our 15% at 2023 as we have committed to.
so that is the direction. so i think they are doing a lot of good stuff in the division, but it's like a perfect storm. first, semiconductors, then shut down in china and then cost inflation. it's everything at the same time, and it is, of course, cumbersome to mitigate.
but yeah, it's a great business.
timo ihamuotila -- chief financial officer
and black market equals the secondary market.
ann-sofie nordh
thank you, timo.
bjorn rosengren -- chief executive officer
thank you, timo, for saving my face.
ann-sofie nordh
i was going to make that clarification also.
ben uglow -- morgan stanley -- analyst
duly noted for compliance. yeah, understood. and just one follow-up on robotics. that holds the execution side around switching the systems and all of that stuff or lowering the systems mix, should we say, from automotive.
is that a long way through beyond? are we a long way through that process?
bjorn rosengren -- chief executive officer
i think this system business, yes, we have -- we are not taking any of those orders, so that is out. still, of course, automotive, and especially electric vehicles, is a very growing segment at the moment. and during this quarter, we saw good orders from china, big orders on the electric vehicle side, where we actually have a pretty good market share. so there is a lot of investment being taken place, and we are a part of that.
so there are, of course, still automotive industries in our order book.
ben uglow -- morgan stanley -- analyst
understood. thank you. and then, one for timo, if i may. just on -- just to clarify, i think it was daniela's question around cash.
are you saying that the operating cash flow -- i think she was talking about free cash flow. but if i look at the operating cash flow, you were growing at -- or you were delivering $1 billion plus per quarter in the second half of last year. if -- ex the bonus effect and the $200 million restructuring charge, are we saying that you should be at or above that level going forward? is that fair?
timo ihamuotila -- chief financial officer
yes. ok. i was kind of --
bjorn rosengren -- chief executive officer
you answered last time, so why don't you continue, timo?
timo ihamuotila -- chief financial officer
yes. thank you, bjorn. so yes, that's what we are saying. of course, the visibility is not exactly super at the moment into that.
but what is really, really important is that our inventory is of good quality. and also our receivables are of good quality. our backlog is of good quality. actually, our receivable, if you look at -- late receivables days went actually down.
so in that sense, the quality improved. so this is really driven by the backlog. and then, we had a bit of an extra impact actually this quarter. i mentioned it in the remarks as well.
electrification had quite a bit of revenue fairly late in the quarter, which then sort of dropped the cash to the other side into q2. so with all we know at the moment, your postulation is correct, i.e., we should see that kind of operating cash flow.
ben uglow -- morgan stanley -- analyst
understood. and final question. within the cash flow, there is this $390 million of accrued liability. is the vast majority of that the -- is that explained by the, let's call it, the employee incentive accrual? or you also mentioned the tax effect.
that's not in the -- that's not in that --
timo ihamuotila -- chief financial officer
that is not in there. no, that is actually on the upper level of the cash flow statement. and of course, the impact is now -- this delta impact is bigger than ever because, first, we had quite low performance 2020 because that was the covid year. and i think it's a good practice for the company, we didn't change any of our targets even when the covid came, so that's when we had quite low payout.
and then, we had quite high payout, so of course, the delta became even bigger between cash flows '21 to '22 q1, q1.
ben uglow -- morgan stanley -- analyst
understood. brilliant. thank you very much.
ann-sofie nordh
thanks, ben. and then, we open up the line for mattias holmberg at dnb. if you are there, mattias.
mattias holmberg -- dnb markets -- analyst
thank you. bjorn, you don't seem to be very concerned about cost inflation and supply chain issues in light of, at least from my perspective, what seems to have been a worsening of the situation since you reported q4. so i'm curious here, when you reiterate the guidance for improved margins this year toward the 15% target, if you could help us, are you, say, more or less or equally confident in this ambition compared to when you set it in conjunction with q4? and also, if you can share any details on your reasoning here, it would be very helpful.
bjorn rosengren -- chief executive officer
yes. i mean, i'm not concerned about cost increases and inflation, that is not a correct statement because, of course, this is a situation we haven't seen in 30 years. and i've been in the business for 35 years, so it was a very long time ago, we had to deal with these issues. what i feel very confident about, what we have seen here during q1, is that the divisions have been very successful in offsetting some of these costs, increased costs, in price increases.
and that's, of course, only possible if there is a good value in what your deliveries are. so from that perspective, i think our divisions have a very well-working pricing strategy also going forward. i mean, you can always be a little bit more nervous in the beginning of an inflation. are we really handling this in the right way? but we spent quite a lot of time on that.
so i think we are handling this now in a good way. is that good for the general economy? of course, not. we don't want to be in an inflation world where maybe interest rates will go up and that might drive demand from medium to long term. so of course, there are these kinds of things that we are nervous of.
but my confidence is in abb's ability to offset higher costs.
timo ihamuotila -- chief financial officer
can i make an additional comment on here?
bjorn rosengren -- chief executive officer
yes, please.
timo ihamuotila -- chief financial officer
because i think an important part here is also we had a 7% revenue growth. we are expecting to have a, i'll call it, good revenue growth during the year as well, as we say today. and of course, we should then get also a drop-through through fixed cost leverage, which also happened during q1. so that's a little bit sort of pushing to the other direction here.
mattias holmberg -- dnb markets -- analyst
second question, just quickly, have you seen any impact or sort of demand increase from on-shoring or -- and if your customer is moving production, say, from china to europe or u.s. on the back of the issues we've seen in the past couple of months?
bjorn rosengren -- chief executive officer
i think just looking at our own operations and, of course we are looking to dual sourcing, making sure that we also have access to raw material, as well as a component from the region where actually the factories are operating, we had maybe historically a little bit more components coming from china in this area. and of course, that is a little bit of a risk factor. so that is, of course, changing. so i think in the same way as we are trying to offset these, other companies are also.
and maybe that's also part of some of the strong orders that we are seeing at the moment.
mattias holmberg -- dnb markets -- analyst
thank you so much.
ann-sofie nordh
thanks, mattias. and i think we'll have time to squeeze in one more question, and we'll see if gael from deutsche bank is on the line.
gael de-bray -- deutsche bank -- analyst
yeah. thanks very much, and good morning, everybody. i have two questions, please. the first one is actually a follow-up on andreas' earlier question.
in the current context of rising energy costs, have you noted any specific accelerated demand for electrification and growing coalitions for energy efficiency solutions in particular? that's question no. 1. question no. 2 is about the order dynamics.
i get that the de-booking in process automation is pretty exceptional. but do you see a growing risk of order cancellations possibly spreading to the other divisions and, in particular, at ra, given the widening gap between order growth and revenue growth there? i mean, what sort of feedback do you get from clients about the delayed deliveries? is there a risk basically that they could shift to other suppliers with better delivery times?
bjorn rosengren -- chief executive officer
let's start with the one with the de-booking side. the de-booking side, of course, coming from a customer, which has actually gone bankrupt. so it's not cancellation of them. we spend quite a lot of time in our reviews to go through order books and to make sure that we have a healthy order book.
and i think from our divisions and from our businesses, they have a strong belief in their order books. but that said, that there is probably some effects coming because of longer lead times, which means that they are moving some of the orders at an earlier stage. i think that's --
timo ihamuotila -- chief financial officer
can i add one more comment here, please?
bjorn rosengren -- chief executive officer
yeah, sure.
timo ihamuotila -- chief financial officer
so also, contractually now in this situation with higher backlog, we are actually -- where we take new orders, we are putting cancellation fees in place in many businesses. so we are clearly managing it in a way that the cancellation will, of course, become more difficult. i mean, if you look at where order book is up from last year, $4.1 billion, it's not a small number. so taking new orders, of course, the new orders have to be better quality and better certainty.
bjorn rosengren -- chief executive officer
so we're trying to be careful. and then, when you say that maybe they should not buy from someone else, but i mean, our situation is not unique. i think everyone today have the same delivery issue. so you can't even find another supplier who's prepared to give you an earlier supply today.
so your good customers are being supported, and that's how it goes. the future, of course, might be a little bit different, but this is the case at the moment. yes, on the energy price increase, yes, of course, when energy price is going up and oil and gas prices, that, of course, drive investments and operations in these areas. and of course, we are, in process automation, also dealing with these customers which are, of course, more optimistic about the future today than maybe a year ago.
so yes, we are gaining in process automation, both from the energy transformation toward renewables, energy efficiencies in these -- all our customers, but also some of the increased demand in these traditionally energy sources. so yes, i think that is probably the case.
gael de-bray -- deutsche bank -- analyst
and do you see the same dynamic within electrification?
bjorn rosengren -- chief executive officer
yeah. i mean, you saw the electrification --
gael de-bray -- deutsche bank -- analyst
or there would be demand for energy efficiency?
bjorn rosengren -- chief executive officer
i mean, you saw the electrification growth during the quarter, which was on a record level when -- that part. so yes, i'm sure that in this electrification, there is a lot of this transformation toward energy efficiencies and maybe also transforming to new energy sources. one of the areas where we've seen enormously high growth, which is, of course, a very small part of abb, that is the e-mobility where the orders are double as high as they were last year. so i mean that's huge growth numbers.
and that's the business we'll put on the stock market very soon.
gael de-bray -- deutsche bank -- analyst
thank you very much.
ann-sofie nordh
ok. thanks, gael. and thanks to you all for spending time with us today. and we hope you want to spend even more time with abb as we welcome you to the motion and pa cmds in helsinki on 17th, on 18th of may.
we hope to see you there. and if you haven't registered already, please do so. thank you.

ann-sofie nordh
greetings to all, and nice to connect again, as i bid you welcome to this presentation of abb's second quarter results. i'm ann-sofie nordh, head of investor relations. and i'm here with our ceo, bjorn rosengren; and our cfo, timo ihamuotila. we will walk you through the presentation before we open up for the q&a session.
but before we begin, i should mention the information regarding safe harbor notices and our use of non-gaap measures on slide 2 of the presentation. also, this call will include forward-looking statements which are based on the company's current expectations and certain assumptions and are, therefore, subject to certain risks and uncertainties. and with that said, i will hand over to bjorn and timo to take you through our results.
bjorn rosengren -- chief executive officer
thank you, ann-sofie, and a warm welcome from me as well. and let's start off by looking at a few highlights from the quarter. it was really good to see that demand remains on a high level despite the challenges from high inflation, covid-related lockdowns in china, and strained supply chain. our orders reached $8.8 billion, the second highest level in recent years and we saw a steady profile of demand throughout the quarter.
the pattern in q2 was similar to what we have seen recently, namely, strong orders paired with revenues hampered by component shortages. this time, we also had an added challenge from the lockdowns in china. and total book-to-bill was 1.21, and it was the sixth consecutive quarter when we build order backlog. then i want to highlight the margin of 15.5% in line with our group targets for 2023.
i'm very pleased about this. and it was backed by a good operational performance in three out of four business areas. where we need to improve is in robotics and discrete automation. just like in q1, this is the business area significantly impacted by semiconductor shortages, preventing outcome deliveries and it is primarily related to the robotics business.
and i was pleased to see momentum improved in the machine automation. they ended the quarter on a strong note. i would also mention that we had additional support from the corporate cost. these include 60 basis points from some specific positive items.
i will come back to that later. in total, i'm pleased we could improve from an already high level last year. cash flow came in higher than in the first quarter and we expect good momentum in the second half of the year. timo will talk more about that in a moment.
next, i want to mention the consequences of the devastating war in ukraine. we have taken the decision to exit the russian market. russia is a limited exposure to us and represents just over 1% of revenues last year. but still, we have started the process to wind down the remaining activities there.
these actions trigger a charge of $57 million in income from operations, of which $23 million will impact cash flow in q3. lately, we have already earlier announced that we will postpone the ipo of the e-mobility until markets are more constructive. when it comes to accelleron , we have decided to do the spin-off with the plans with listing in early october. timo, we will talk about the details but i want to say that i'm pleased we are moving ahead with this.
in my view, it allows for shareholders to realize the full value of accelleron while allowing abb to focus on core areas of electrification and automation. now let's look more closely at orders and revenues on slide 4. fx had an adverse impact, 7% on our reported orders and revenues. but let's focus on comparable growth which shows demand and what happened in the market.
all business areas increased orders at a double-digit growth rate. and in total, we were up 20% with a positive development in all major customer segments. we increased comparable revenues by 6% with the decline only in robotics and discrete automation. while the general supply eased slightly compared to q1, our revenues were still somewhat hampered.
robotics and discrete automation is clearly the business area suffering the most from the shortages of semiconductors. but the large distribution solution division in electrification was also impacted. from what we know now, we expect the supply of semiconductors to improve from here on. this quarter, the teams were also challenged by the lockdowns in shanghai.
we saw it have an immediate effect from the slowdown of local logistics and lockdowns were enforced in april. then we saw a gradual recovery as restrictions eased during the quarter. we estimate that the china lockdowns had about two percentage negative impact on our reported comparable revenue growth of 6%. in total, we increased our order backlog to the record level of $19.5 billion.
now let's take a quick look at the different regions, which all improved at the double-digit order rate. in the americas, the important u.s. market increased by 32%. in europe, most of our major markets showed strong growth rate with amea region, it was good to see china improve by 10% despite the lockdowns.
let's turn to slide 6 and our earnings outcome. our gross margin was 31.6% in the quarter, which is a decline of 210 basis points from last year. i think it is important to highlight that the main drivers of decline was mainly market-to-market losses on commodity derivates while the underlying operational impact was limited to 50 basis points and mainly related to the low volumes in their robotics & discrete automation. we increased their operational ebitda by 2%.
however, excluding the negative fx, it was actually up by 9%. it was good to see how the teams more than offset the cost inflation in commodities, freight, and labor, through the strong pricing execution. additionally, results were also supported by a slight increase in volumes and efficiency measures. you know that we aim for a margin of at least 50% in 2023 with q2 margins of 15.5%, we took another step toward that target.
but like i mentioned earlier, we had about 60 basis points support from what i would refer to as special items. that would be real estate sales and impact related to the exit of the large legacy project. excluding these and divestment of the dodge business, we saw a slight increase from last year, a good outcome in my view, given the challenges from the inflation, lockdowns in china, and top of the already strained supply chain. headwinds from the lockdown and semiconductor shortage should ease going forward.
i expect a good momentum during the second half of the year. and with that, i would like to hand over to timo.
timo ihamuotila -- chief financial officer
thank you, bjorn, and greetings to everyone also from my side. as usual, let's start by taking a closer look at electrification, where overall customer activity was strong across the segments, which resulted in comparable orders being up by 16%. the only area which showed some softness was residential buildings in china in line with what we also saw in q1. the demand pattern in electrification overall was strong also at the end of the quarter, so a fairly steady trend.
regarding different geographies and countries, china declined by 5%, seemingly related to some temporary weakness during the initial covid-related lockdowns. looking elsewhere, we saw the steepest growth in the americas at plus 30% and orders in europe continued to grow at a healthy 10% rate. just like in the previous quarter strong pricing was the main driver for comparable revenue growth, which was up by 10%. volumes continue to be hampered by supply chain disruptions mainly in distribution solutions, whose systems rely on high volume and high variety of components.
add to that, that our solutions feed into larger projects, and you realize that the value chain can become quite complex. the low volumes in this largest division resulted in under absorption of fixed costs, which more than offset earnings improvements in other divisions. the operational ebitda margin was 16.9%, down 50 basis points from last year, which benefited from favorable commodity hedges. this is a good achievement considering inflation and strained value chain.
looking ahead into the third quarter, we expect a clearly stronger growth rate for comparable revenues than the 10% we had in the second quarter, and somewhat of a sequentially higher operational ebitda margin. let's move onto motion on slide 8, where orders again came in at above $2 billion despite the headwinds from the stronger u.s. dollar. adjusting for the dodge divestment, comparable orders increased by 26%, reflecting a double-digit growth rate in base orders, as well as good contribution from large orders.
strong demand was noted in all customer segments and across all major regions. in revenues, motion improved by more muted 3% on a comparable basis. while the team continued to do an excellent job on pricing, volumes were hampered by the lockdowns in china, which slowed down local logistics and access to components. as a consequence, the order backlog continued to increase to a record high of $4.6 billion.
compared with last year, the operational ebitda margin declined by 130 basis points to 16.4%, roughly half of the decline stems from the divestment of the dodge business. the rest was primarily driven by under absorption of fixed costs due to the decline in volumes while the strong pricing execution approximately offset the negative impact from higher input costs. looking ahead into the third quarter, we expect a solid double-digit growth in comparable revenues and somewhat of a sequentially higher operational ebitda margin. turning to slide 9 and process automation where demand was strong across customer segments and regions.
as a result, comparable orders grew 25% with double-digit growth rates in all divisions admittedly from a fairly easy comparable. particular strength was noted in metals and mining, where customers are looking to invest in capacity outside russia, but also in the marine market. revenues increased by 7% with support from all divisions. the business area was able to mitigate the majority of the components shortages during the quarter.
some of these are still expected to continue as the year progresses. looking at the margin in process automation, which is clearly the highlight of this quarter. operational ebitda increased by 17% compared to last year, resulting in a margin of 14.3%, the highest level in four years. this improvement of 180 basis points was driven by good project execution, as well as efficiency measures.
it is great to see that the work toward sustainable performance improvement in pa is paying off, as peter and colleagues showed at the recent capital markets day. for the third quarter, we expect a similar comparable revenue growth sequentially, and operational ebitda margin at approximately last year's level. on slide 10, we turn to robotics and discrete automation and you recognize the pattern of high order intake and revenues significantly hampered by low delivery volumes. comparable orders increased by 23% with both divisions noting strong momentum with stable demand trends throughout the quarter.
customer activity increased in all segments with the highest order growth in automotive, where we continue to see a strong development in e-vehicle investments in china. as expected, the shutdown of the robotics factory in shanghai in april, and the consequential gradual ramp-up of production during may had a significant impact on customer deliveries in the second quarter. additionally, semiconductor shortages continue to adversely impact revenues, while selectively easing in some areas such as in machine automation. overall, ra's comparable revenue growth continued to be negative at minus 5%, resulting in a further increase of the order backlog to $2.7 billion.
ra's operational ebitda margin decreased by 330 basis points year on year to 8.2%, mainly driven by robotics as the missing volumes from the lockdown in china and cost inflation more than offset cost measures and positive impact from price. for the third quarter, we expect comparable revenue growth to leave the negative territory and move into a robust positive year-on-year improvement. on the back of strong revenue momentum, we expect a strong sequential upgrade of the operational ebitda margin. then moving to slide 11, showing the group revenues and operational ebitda bridge.
as you can see, the comparable earnings improvement benefited from our strong pricing execution, volumes, as well as operational efficiencies, which combined more than offset the adverse effects from cost inflation. the exit of our full train retrofit business incurred in noncore and helped operating margins by 20 basis points. acquisitions and divestments, i.e., mainly dodge, as well as the impact from changing fx were slightly diluting on the group level. now let's move to look at the cash flow on slide 12.
cash flow from our operating activities of $385 million was clearly higher than in q1, and i expect strong cash performance in the second half of the year. compared with last year, the operational performance was more or less on a similar level. however, the continued buildup of trade working capital mainly related to inventories weighed on the cash flow for the quarter. this buildup is, of course, aimed at supporting our strong order growth.
now bjorn mentioned earlier today that we had exited a legacy project. and i am sure you remember that i flagged this to you when we last met here, i.e. that we were looking to close the largest position of the total of up to $300 million exposure we have in our noncore legacy project. we were able to close this as expected in the second quarter, which resulted in a charge of approximately $200 million recorded below the line in income from operations.
this hit the q2 cash flow from operations by $25 million with about $140 million impacting primarily q3. i'm very pleased that we were able to do this. we have now ramped down the majority of our noncore business, a project started already in q4 2017. we still have about $100 million of exposure left as we have discussed earlier.
but as this is more of a legal dispute, timing here is very difficult to estimate. and still to complete the cash picture for the full year 2022, we continue to expect a solid cash performance. before i hand it over to bjorn, let me just briefly update you on our portfolio actions. bjorn briefly mentioned e-mobility earlier, so let's focus on our decision to spin off accelleron, our turbocharging business.
as announced only yesterday, we plan a listing on the six swiss exchange on 3rd of october. this means that the division will still be part of process automation for the full third quarter. the spin-off is subject to approval by abb's agm planned for 7th september, an invitation should go out shortly. provided that the spin-off is approved at the agm and the conditions precedent for it are met, abb will distribute to its shareholders on a pro-rata basis as a dividend in kind, one accelleron share for 20 abb shares held.
it is our strong belief that the spin-off will benefit both companies. accelleron will be able to concentrate exclusively on reaching its full potential in the large engine industry while we as abb group continue to simplify our portfolio and focus on our purpose of enabling a more sustainable and resource-efficient future with our technology leadership in electrification and automation. we have scheduled a capital markets day for 31st of august, focusing on accelleron in order for you to meet the management team and learn more about this exciting company, and the related transaction. and with that, i would like to hand it back over to bjorn.
bjorn rosengren -- chief executive officer
thank you, timo. i have a feeling you will ask me anyway so i might, as well mention it now, that the first few weeks of q3 seem to have come out on a strong note. of course, these are uncertain times and it remains to be seen how these high inflation impacts demand mid-term. as you know, there is talk about a downturn in the news.
we are prepared, all divisions do scenario planning, it is part of being a good manager in a decentralized organization. i always say to the guys, we should always be prepared and have these plans ready also in good times, then we can act swiftly if and when a market changes. i think the covid downturn is a good testament that we can act quickly and promptly. i feel we are a more resilient business now compared to in the past.
but importantly, our customers remain active on their high level all the way through q2. and lastly, on slide 15, we take a quick look at our expectations for q3. we anticipate double-digit comparable revenue growth and the operational ebitda margin to be sequentially improved, excluding the 60 basis points impact from special items in the second quarter. and with that, i'll let ann-sofie open the q&a.
ann-sofie nordh
yes, let's open up for the q&a now. [operator instructions] and i see that we already have questions coming through. and i would ask you kindly to please limit it to two questions per person, and we'll do our best to get through as many of you as possible. and with that said, we'll start with the first question and that will come from ben uglow at morgan stanley.
ben, your line should be open.
ben uglow -- morgan stanley -- analyst
good morning, ann-sofie, bjorn, and timo. hope everyone is well. my question is really for timo in terms of understanding just a little bit better the cash flow dynamics. i realize looking at everything on a three months basis is sort of slightly artificial in your company.
but if we look at the second quarter, the cash has come down 40-odd-percent. and when i look, what i'm curious to understand is within the different divisions, and also corporate in particular, and there are some big variations. so in terms of the biggest change in cash, it's actually coming from corporate, which is nearly a $500 million outflow. and what i wanted to know is, is that corporate line, is that to do with working capital and intersegment sales? is it to do with restructuring, or is it related, i think you've clarified a bit to the legacy items, the noncore project wind down? and then within the divisions, motion seems to be ok and the other divisions are not.
is that just the base effect in motion is coming off a low level or is there something different in the way that the divisions are managing their cash? so that's really my first question.
timo ihamuotila -- chief financial officer
ok, there's quite a bit there. thanks, ben. actually, that's a good catch for the quarter because while we did exit from the full train retrofit business, which we have spoken earlier about, there is actually business moving to motion from corporate and that's the biggest driver here on the delta. that's why the motion is up and corporate is down because when we move that project to a normal execution in motion, because the exit happens in a way that we exit all that full train retrofit part, and then motion will take the contract, which is actually our core business providing the key traction components for those trains.
and that causes this cash flow change between mainly corporate and motion. there are some other items probably there. there could be that last year, we have this atv impact and other things like that but it's really the main impact is this transaction between corporate and motion internally. but i think the important point in cash, in general, is that we are really expecting a strong recovery in cash, we are expecting cash to go up from q2 to q3 and then very strongly from q3 to q4.
ben uglow -- morgan stanley -- analyst
understood, thank you. one follow-up, i'm going to try and pin you down on that a little bit timo because we've talked in the past about $1 billion of cash from operations. and if i look at the last -- the second half of last year, that was the run rate and we're now down a $300 million. so, are you saying in principle, that there's no reason why we shouldn't be getting back to that $1 billion type of run rate in the second half of this year? is there any headwind that i'm missing?
timo ihamuotila -- chief financial officer
well, there is more volatility. but if i gave some numbers on this, and i can also talk about the free cash flow as well. but first of all, the biggest tie-up in cash is in inventory. and our inventory, if you just look at reported numbers from the balance sheet from a year ago, is up about 19%.
on the other hand, if you look at our order book, our order backlog is up 26%, at the same time, and out of that order backlog, we expect 56% to convert second half. so that's about $2.8 billion more conversion. and we also had a strong order build up in book and bill business during second quarter. so there is really a clear justification, why it also, from numbers perspective, should work out like that.
and that's why i'm saying that we expect a clearly stronger cash, q3, and then even stronger q4. i mean, if you look at history of abb, we have had even, you know, operating cash flow $1.71 billion, $1.8 billion earlier as well. so let's see what happens this year on that. and then if you look at free cash flow, i mean, last year, we had about $2.8 billion.
and there are some items here, which we have spoken about during the year. so we had the bonus impact, we have sj now or the full train retrofit impact about $150 million. we have also impact from atv. and then we have some other impacts from the separation cost and so forth and that's approximately $700 million.
so if i would have to put the number out there may be a bit short of $2 billion for the very solid cost performance expected for the year.
ben uglow -- morgan stanley -- analyst
that's very helpful. thank you. thank you very much. i'll move on.
ann-sofie nordh
moving on, in the sense that you have another question or we're moving on to the next question, i think.
ben uglow -- morgan stanley -- analyst
no, no, i was --
ann-sofie nordh
i think we'll move on to the next person. sorry, ben.
ben uglow -- morgan stanley -- analyst
i'll just shut up and let somebody else have a go. yeah.
ann-sofie nordh
very kind. so, we'll see if we have the line open for andy at j.p. morgan.
unknown speaker
hi, good morning, everyone. thanks for taking my questions. i wanted to start just a comment, or i guess, or add to the comments on prices. i guess if i like-we sort of mentioned strong pricing in each of the divisions as we went through.
i'm just interested in terms of how it's developed sequentially. and i guess if you feel you need to take more actions for the balance of the year, given that we're obviously still seeing some costs continue to increase?
bjorn rosengren -- chief executive officer
did i understand the question right here, i didn't hear very well, regarding pricing?
ann-sofie nordh
yes. yeah, compared sequentially, q2 compared to q1?
bjorn rosengren -- chief executive officer
yeah. ok. i think, the inflation has been now for a year, and i think our operations are fully up and dealing with these costs increases in the production all coming from the supply chain, but from commodities or energy and all of this. and i think overall, the group and the operations really manage this in a very good way.
so we're actually covering the cost increases, as we're doing today with pricing. if you're looking at the numbers, out of those 6% that you see probably 5% of those are coming from price increases and 1% on increased volumes. so -- and that shows a little bit of the constraints that we have been dealing with during the first quarter and the second quarter. and we really said that coming in, with the shutdown in china, especially in shanghai, a big factory was closed for five weeks in that and then the recovery coming after that.
going forward, it's of course difficult to say but we see commodity prices are actually coming down at the moment, which will have some type of relief. on the energy side, i think we've -- we all have been waiting to see what's going to happen with nord stream, and so on. and then, of course, there came some positive signals today, and we don't know what the high interest is going to have some effect. so our businesses are monitoring this all the time, we do expect that there will be inflation during the part.
but hopefully, we can say that there should be some kind of easing in the coming future. but i think we are well prepared, and the businesses are driving this value-based pricing, which has been implemented in 2020 and doing quite a good job.
unknown speaker
and if i can just follow up with a question on process automation, and you talked about metals, and mining and marine being particularly good, i'm interested, again, probably sequentially in terms of the development among your oil and gas customers, and whether you're seeing an increasing level of activity coming through on that side?
bjorn rosengren -- chief executive officer
yeah, i mean, you have seen that process automation has developed very good and i love to talk about this business because it's more i spend time with it is more i quite like it. we are of course in some of these large industries like in oil and gas and mining. but what is of course, important with both of these kinds of industries, that they are part of a transformation. and i think our contribution is really part of that, in the mining companies its automation and electrification, which is the big driving force.
in the oil and gas companies, which are today called energy companies, it is more investing the free cash into renewables and that is where we have a big contribution also. but we have seen higher oil prices during the first half of the year, which of course, have accelerated some activities within this area. so, i mean, you've seen the performance of process automation and going over 14% in performance, of course, we are extremely happy to see that they are focusing on good projects where we can add a lot of value to the customer, so good job from them.
unknown speaker
thank you.
ann-sofie nordh
ok. thanks, andy. and i'll get through here with a couple of questions from the web tool. and it comes from joe at cowen, he wants to know, he says backlog continues to expand as major economies may be moving to recessionary times, how do you view cancellation and push out risks? if we start there, bjorn, do you want to?
bjorn rosengren -- chief executive officer
ok, i can start a little bit there. yeah, maybe we are monitoring our orders on hand very carefully because as you know, our 21 divisions, they live and die by the orders that they have there. we have been also very careful in booking orders which feel uncomfortable with, so and so far there has been a strong demand in the market and you see in the book-to-bill ratio actually six quarter now with positive from that. and we are seeing the second half as you'll see in our expectation that we now will be releasing quite some good part of that order book during the coming quarters here.
so we're pretty optimistic. so far, no cancellations. and i think we feel also that there are a lot of these orders also which are-where you had cancellation fees also, which of course will secure the quality of the order book but so far so good.
ann-sofie nordh
ok, and here joe has another question here which perhaps is aimed to you timo, since you are pa outlook kind of guy. he says pa margins were strong, why are they expected to move down to quarter on quarter?
timo ihamuotila -- chief financial officer
yeah, thanks for the question. so there is some mixed impact and i think we actually called out strong project execution in q2. so, it's nothing else than a small change in mix so there is no drama there. as we said we expect to be approximately at last year's level on pa margin, which was a strong margin in itself.
bjorn rosengren -- chief executive officer
maybe i can also mention that, you know, in pa you have a big part of the business is service. and when you get larger volumes out which means that you're delivering out project, it has some pressure on the margin, which then is coming back with the service business that is coming after. that's it can have some small effects between different quarters. but i think the quality of the order book is quite good.
ann-sofie nordh
and then we'll go back to a question from the conference call. we have mattias from dnb. your line should be open, please.
unknown speaker
hi, everyone, and thanks for the time. i'm just trying to understand the q3 margin guidance a bit better where you say the sequential improvement is excluding the 60 basis points from special items. is that based on the 15.5%? because if i just take your operational ebitda divided by your sales, i get to 13.7, so i assume that you exclude the corporate items in the 15.5%. and so just trying to understand the dynamics here?
timo ihamuotila -- chief financial officer
yeah, yeah, we tried to be very clear, but thanks for the question anyhow. so, we are simply saying we were at 15.5%, take out the 60 basis points, which were called out you are at 14.9%. we are expecting to go up from there. and this is actually well in line what we said already going into the year because we said that this year, given the constraints we were expecting, go q1 up to q2 and then again up to q3.
so, our q1 was 14.3%. now we can say this reference point 14.9%. and we expect to go sequentially up from there for q3.
ann-sofie nordh
and if i may add to that mattias, the 15.7 you mentioned you probably get from dividing with the reported revenues, our margin calculation, it's actually made on operational revenues, which you find on page 6 in the financial documents. so that should put that straight.
timo ihamuotila -- chief financial officer
thanks, i didn't remember that.
unknown speaker
thank you for that clarification. a second one, if i may, just really quick? i was surprised when i read the comments, you talked about strong demand, basically, throughout the world, customer segments, divisions, geographies, and so on. so, i'm just curious, is there any area at all that you would highlight where you notice any signs of slowing at the moment?
bjorn rosengren -- chief executive officer
that is not strong, or that is right?
ann-sofie nordh
that is not softening.
bjorn rosengren -- chief executive officer
oh, softening, i mean, the only -- i mean, it's very clear. if you look at our segments where we're operating, it has been looking quite good all over the business. we have pointed out one segment and this, of course, commercial building is in or a building in china, which has been softening off, but that was to say, mostly in q1, so there is no change, actually from that.
ann-sofie nordh
thank you.
unknown speaker
thank you so much.
ann-sofie nordh
thanks, mattias. and then we'll take the next question from the conference call. and that, we should open up the line for gael at deutsche bank.
unknown speaker
thanks very much. good morning, everybody.
ann-sofie nordh
good morning.
unknown speaker
two questions, please. the first one is on, i guess, the strategy here -- from here. i mean, abb has been very shareholder friendly for a few years now with ongoing buybacks and now with the planned distribution of accelleron. so it's great obviously, but i think many investors would like to see you grow and develop the business a bit more actively.
so in particular, could you talk a bit about your m&a pipeline and the key areas of focus in the four divisions? so that's question number one. and question number two is about pa. could you give us some color on the contribution of the turbocharging business to pa this quarter? and perhaps give us an update on the target in margin range for process automation in the medium term, excluding accelleron? thanks very much.
bjorn rosengren -- chief executive officer
ok, i'll start up with the strategy question and i'll hand over to timo for what -- for the margin discussion in the pa. thank you, i think it's a very good and valid question. and i came into the company now two and a half years ago, and we set up the new strategy, we decentralized the company moving responsibility out very much focusing on getting the quality of the revenues to the right levels. and then we said, stability, profitability, and then growth.
and we, of course, follow every 21 divisions where we have and going in starting up here for two and a half years, i would say 30% of the businesses were in the growth mode. today, i would say we're closer to 70% of the businesses that are in growth mode. we also build up the -- what we call the purpose of abb. we don't want to be a conglomerate.
i want to be very, very clear on that. so we spent quite some time to find why do we keep the group together and of course, we built this up. and we said that the businesses that remain in abb and that we are going to develop further need to support our purpose. and that is, of course, helping our customers to become more sustainable by our electrification and automation business.
so, if you're not part of that, if you're not really to support it, it doesn't mean that you're not great businesses, because both dodge, as well as turbocharging, which is called accelleron today, are fantastic businesses. but we think that these businesses do deserve to be in an environment where there is full focus on them and to growing these businesses. why do we think that abb should focus on our purpose and developing the company? we are very much going into a growth phase going forward. and i'll be very clear to say that driving this growth, it's actually coming from our 21 divisions.
they need to strengthen their position, and they need to be number one or number two in their businesses. so, we have a pipeline maybe of 100 companies today that we are analyzing and looking where we can make some imbalance when it comes to m&a activities. so, i believe that this year, we will be at least five acquisitions of small to medium size. but we are also looking at, in different business area, the sizes, you know, the size, maybe of a division size, if it would support our business within automation or electrification.
we are looking at software companies, which have now come down a little bit in valuation, which, of course, makes them a little bit more attractive, but also in other technology that would strengthen abb forward. so i think it's a great question. and you will see going forward that we really want to grow abb in line with that purpose.
timo ihamuotila -- chief financial officer
ok, yeah. and then on the turbo question, we actually put a little press release out today on turbo and its performance on 21 and all that, but you can say that it has been varying between about 150 basis points to 200 basis points that impact on pa, so somewhere there. so if you would take a midpoint and go down from the 14.3%, maybe 12.5% plus minus, so something like that. and i think pa actually had a capital markets day, and they said on that capital markets day that they look to contribute well to abb's target of overall being over 50%.
so, of course, from that you would expect that gradually during the years, they would then move up from those kinds of numbers, but it's about 150-basis-point to 200-basis-point impact.
ann-sofie nordh
ok.
unknown speaker
ok, thanks. thanks very much.
ann-sofie nordh
thanks, gael. and we move on to the next question on the conference call. we open up the line for daniela at goldman sachs.
unknown speaker
hi, good morning. thanks for taking my questions. so first, i just wanted to check on robotics, given your commentary about things slowly improving on the supply chain. do you think you'll be able to be like at full optimal utilization this year or is it just next year? and once you do that, i think in the past, we had seen you with margins in some quarters north of 15%.
is that how we should think given how large the backlog actually is for delivery? is that doable near term? that's my main question. and then just a follow-up, i guess on the conversation that you were just having, one thing that you have for next year is the put option, i guess, too, on the remaining 20% of power grids. can you remind us how much value you could get from that? were there any adjustment mechanisms for how they performed since you've signed the sale agreement versus now sort of what type of cash inflow would we exactly expect next year from that? thank you.
bjorn rosengren -- chief executive officer
thank you, daniela. i'll start up with a robotics and then i hand over to timo regarding the dodge ownership there. i said from the beginning, the robot business that we have should be 15% business growing 10% per year. that's the type of business that we look upon that.
the challenge that they have had during the last quarters have been, of course, severe. and you've seen the volumes actually been low while the orders have actually increased. and now finally, we are seeing relief in the supply chain from semiconductors and we saw it already an improvement from discrete automation, the b&r business which actually delivered 13% during the quarter. i'm not allowed to say it but i sneak it out in this way.
i'm very happy that they came back in a good way. robotic business is now also seeing relief from the semiconductors and we will see a good improvement in deliveries during the second half and also improvement well over 10%, both during these quarters coming up there. next year, they have committed themselves to be in line with where they should be. so, let's see how that will be developed.
but finally, we are seeing improvements coming through in the robotics business.
timo ihamuotila -- chief financial officer
ok, yeah, and on the put option. so, this is mid-next year, and we have been talking about $1.5 billion type of number. now, we also said that there are some mechanisms in the system where it could vary a bit, but it shouldn't be too far from that. so, let's just put it that way.
unknown speaker
thank you very much.
ann-sofie nordh
thank you. ok. and we'll take another question from the conference call. and we open up the line for guillermo at ubs, please? guillermo, are you there?
unknown speaker
yeah, i'm here. good morning, everyone. good morning, ann-sofie, bjorn, and timo. i wanted to ask maybe a couple of questions.
one with regards to abb group overall, with supply chain bottlenecks resolved in semiconductors, are probably easing, obviously, the group will be able to unleash the backlog. and i wonder how operating leverage will react which is obviously in part embedded in your guidance and when would it normalize? and i also wonder whether there are any hiccups in terms of inventory levels, at your abb group or in the distribution channels that we should be aware of, i.e. basically any potential limits to the margins near term despite your improving guidance in the margin as we go into the second half? whether we will see basically any limits to that improvement, because of any potential hiccups coming from inventory levels at your company or at the distribution channels level? thank you.
bjorn rosengren -- chief executive officer
thank you, guillermo. i'll let timo answer on the margins on the order book, because for us, we, of course, are very much curious how that goes forward, so we measure that well. but let me talk a little bit on the supply chain of semiconductors. and i, you'll probably remember me saying going into this year that we have a number of really challenging quarters, q1 and q2, where we have a lot of discommitment from suppliers.
and we were -- i was actually quite nervous of really getting huge effect on the group. we managed to get this through and i think the business has done a fantastic job, even though we don't see any good volumes going through yet compared to last year. but we have now come to a situation where we have much better commitments from the suppliers. the reason for that i'm not fully sure about but of course, some of them have ramped up their volumes and their capacity, but probably also maybe on the consumer market that there are some lower demands in some of equipment there, which makes these companies be able to be better to deliver to industrial company from their part.
but during the next quarter, we do not see any severe challenges on the semiconductor, which will help us to get some of that huge order book we have out to the market. so and then you of course asked me how much of that is going to go through? i'm not going to go into that because it varies a lot between the different divisions that we have. but i see the guidance that timo gave before is that we should see an improvement in margin during q3 compared to what we see in this quarter.
timo ihamuotila -- chief financial officer
yeah. yeah, so maybe just on this drop through maybe on some puts and takes, because it's of course not an exact answer as a lot depends on also how our book-and-bill, how the short-term business develops. but bjorn was referring to the backlog gross margin. backlog gross margin continues to go up.
so, when we convert that will give us clearly some benefit. as i said, we are expecting to get about $2.8 billion, would we get all the supply exactly on time from the backlog during second half of the year. and then if we get on top of that a good book and bill business, then, of course, we should see a reasonable drop through.
unknown speaker
thank you. and maybe a second question then on electrification. i guess some of the base commodities and raw materials are now dropping significantly from the levels and so -- and i was wondering whether you still find it easy to increase price in these kinds of environment. and maybe also when should you see those declines in commodities and raw materials [inaudible] thank you.
bjorn rosengren -- chief executive officer
sure. sure. of course, we are seeing commodity prices coming downside. well, we of course, hedge some part of it that we will have somewhat delay in this dropping through in our businesses.
when we look at electrification, i mean, you've seen the dramatic improvement of financial performance in electrification, which we are extremely happy from. and i would say most of our divisions are doing a superb job here and really get it through. one of our divisions that we talked about a lot during the last quarter, as well is the ds, distribution solution, which is our switchgear business, this is a project business. and i think here, we have longer project where many of these contracts we're taking before and you will be delivering out.
and of course, they have had the toughest to get through price increases and to offset some of that, which has, of course, affected the margin quite dramatically. there is a lot of focusing on this going forward now during -- also during morten's leadership here, where we have separated the service business to get a good focus on that, but also looking into the low voltage business and the medium voltage business, which are a bit different there. and there are different scenarios, but it should be moving in the direction and focusing on getting the margins modules up also in that business. when it comes to inflation during second half, it's a little bit too early for us to say, where is it going, interest rates are going up, commodity prices are coming down.
so there are things that could affect the demand and also could have some effect on the inflation. but our businesses, they are close to the customers, they are of course measuring exactly what the cost increases are. and they know where they need to be to offset these costs and make sure that we get the value for the products that we are-and services that we're putting into the market. so we're pretty optimistic, but there could be some releases when it comes to inflation second half.
and of course, we all hope that because it's not good for no companies or not for the society with inflation, that is pretty clear.
timo ihamuotila -- chief financial officer
i think bjorn just to highlight what you also said earlier is that we are really doing this scenario planning now for different scenarios. because this is, of course, a business environment, which is a bit more difficult to read than at some other times. and the key point is that we have the scenarios and then you can react early when you see that you are moving to certain direction. so, you know, early what to do and all of our divisions or business areas are doing that.
so it's a very important tool for us for business management in general.
unknown speaker
thank you.
ann-sofie nordh
ok.
unknown speaker
i have a third one, but i will drop it online. thank you.
ann-sofie nordh
thanks. thanks, guillermo. i'll cut in with your question from -- there were a couple of questions actually from the online tool. it's from will mackie and his first question is how would you characterize demand trends and business outlook in china now that impact from lockdowns is declining?
bjorn rosengren -- chief executive officer
yeah, i mean, let's talk a little bit about china during the quarter that was. and we saw during the lockdown that that it had effects on the mood in china during this period. and then after five weeks lockdown, we saw the ease coming out but also the [inaudible] so what we call pmi index, the mood in the industry has actually come up to a positive side, which made the good ending in the quarter where we actually saw demand for 10% in china. china is of course difficult to see, the covid is not over yet.
there are small shutdowns in different areas more related to living areas than the industry overall. so we don't really know what is going to happen in china and it's also that residential building side which has been a little bit weak and how that will be affected going forward. it's maybe a little bit too early to say and we probably have to come back with that during next quarter. on the other hand, i said the first three weeks in the quarter or in the month have started out positively.
ann-sofie nordh
ok, and he has another question and we'll take that straightaway. within motion, could you please break down volume versus price impact on revenues? and how this may develop in q3? do you want to?
timo ihamuotila -- chief financial officer
yeah, i can take that so not as exact as bjorn was saying for the group. i mean in the group we had a 6% growth and that 1% to 5% and basically about 1% volume and then about 5% price. motion is in a similar situation, which then means that there was maybe a slightly negative volume in the majority of price because their comparable growth was 3%. so that's about how it is but we expect this to change quite significantly now, going into q3.
so we said that we expect double-digit revenue growth in motion. and another thing which was going on in motion is that there is a mix delta. because in china, we have way bigger drives portion of the mix than for example, in the other parts of the world. and of course, china was a bit lower on revenue and that impacted the overall mix.
and we would expect that to start to reverse again, also going into q3.
ann-sofie nordh
very good. and we'll take the next question from the conference call, please. we have alex from bank of america merrill lynch on the line, i hope. alex, are you there?
unknown speaker
i am indeed. thanks, ann-sofie. good morning, bjorn; good morning, timo.
bjorn rosengren -- chief executive officer
good morning.
unknown speaker
i guess same sort of question really on europe, i think that's probably the one where-the region where we're all most uncertain and unclear. and i just wondered if you could, in the context of what you talked about their bjorn on the first three weeks of the quarter, i'm thinking more about just how customers are reacting and responding in terms of their requests or interaction with you with respect to trying to plan for the next sort of six to 12 months. i guess you talked about your business areas have got a lot of preparations in place for a downturn. and i think that -- i think that's obviously a very good place to start.
but i'm thinking more just trying to understand what the customers are saying and acting on because i think in many respects, the imperative to invest in response to all of this to address energy inflation to address operational efficiency is even greater than it was six months ago. so, i'm just trying to understand what the context of those conversations is. i know it's a slightly generic question, but i'd be -- i'd like to hear your thoughts?
bjorn rosengren -- chief executive officer
interesting question, i'd be happy to elaborate a little bit from abb viewpoint, when it comes to europe. and first to say you saw good growth in during the quarter in europe demand in all the segments where we are operating. and i think it's important to -- if i look a little bit on europe from two points of views. one is, of course, the increases in inflation, as well as the energy crisis that is building up with costs that can have some short-term effects on demand, because people are spending more money in paying bills than actually investing in the future.
on the other hand, when it comes to europe, i think europe is very much committed to the transformation toward more renewables, meaning electrifying europe, but also to drive automation in this part. and i think from that perspective, with our purpose and the impact that we do among our customers, i think we are perfectly positioned to participate in this. so, there is a lot of things. i mean, i can only see in our own operations where we are transforming away from fossil fuels moving in more to renewables, and all the electrification that is taking place there is, of course, going to be strong driving force, if we're looking for the medium to long term.
and i do believe that abb is well positioned here and i think we can do a lot of contribution. so, the underlying demand, we believe, will continue to be strong in europe. and then of course, there can be some short-term hiccups, that is pretty clear, with inflation and so on. but hopefully, the central banks and the other ones can mitigate and we can get the inflation down.
and if we do that, i think we can get over to a little bit more normal environment than we have had during the last year, hopefully. anything you want to or would like to?
timo ihamuotila -- chief financial officer
no.
bjorn rosengren -- chief executive officer
so, i think that that's a little bit what we see from abb.
unknown speaker
ok, great. thanks, bjorn.
ann-sofie nordh
thanks, alex. and we'll -- if we try and keep it short. we'll finish off with one last question from the conference call. and we should have andre from credit suisse on the line.
unknown speaker
thank you very much for squeezing me in. i'll keep to one question. and i really wanted to ask about the kind of electrification and a push for energy efficiency, we hear quite a lot of that anecdotally obviously in the light of energy prices spiking up in europe and global efforts, but i wondered if that's something that you can confirm or deny from your electrification business perspective, being obviously global number two player and offer maybe any quantification of that? is there a kind of some of that sequential pickup in order sales or but also that specifically, and as anything you're doing to position yourself specifically for that trend of just supplying quick energy saving solutions to europe to counter the geopolitical threat?
bjorn rosengren -- chief executive officer
coming back to this, see electrification is based on trend not least in europe, and we can see from our business that there is really good orders coming into the electrification business are good. and one part of this is, of course, also ev charging, which is an important part of the transformation of the whole vehicle industry toward electrical vehicles and you've seen that within growth numbers over 100% of that business. so this is a really accelerating and of course, in relation to that, of course, it's a whole infrastructure behind electrification, which is becoming important. so yeah, we see it in our businesses, we are positioning ourselves and i think also, the divisions are doing a great job with both products and services, to position ourselves well when it comes.
electrification in europe, abb has a very strong position. if you look at different areas, i think china and europe are our two strongest holds while the u.s., we still could do better when it comes to being part. even though we made the big investments in the gis which has helped us to strengthen up there but we've still got ways to go in the u.s. to become really a number two player.
but i think we -- our divisions are well-positioned, they're doing a good job to both deliver power services, as well as financial performance.
ann-sofie nordh
thank you.

ann-sofie nordh

ann-sofie nordh
greetings to all, and nice to connect again, as i welcome you to the presentation of abb's third quarter results. i'm ann-sofie nordh, head of investor relations. and next to me here is our ceo, bjorn rosengren; and our cfo, timo ihamuotila. they will, as usual, take you through the presentation before we open up for the q&a session.
but before we begin, i should mention the information regarding safe harbor notices and our use of non-gaap measures on slide 2 of the presentation. also, this call will include forward-looking statements, which are based on the company's current expectations and certain assumptions and are, therefore, subject to certain risks and uncertainties. and with that said, i will hand over to bjorn and timo, later on, for their quarterly comments.

thank you, ann-sofie, and a warm welcome from me as well. i have to say, i'm very pleased with our performance this quarter. operation numbers show strength and verifies that abb is moving in the right direction, even faster than we originally had anticipated. you have probably already figured out that i'm very happy about the high margins of 16.6%.
it looks like we likely will reach our margin targets one year early. but i'm also pleased that we executed on our promises of portfolio management. in my view, today's result is a good indication that we are improving operational performance through our new way of working, accountability, transparency, and speed. to me, some proof points are our strong and broad price execution.
the record-high margin, we have made division-led acquisitions, we divested noncore operations, and we completed the spin-off of accelleron. in short, we are making abb a more focused and well-performing company with focus on being a technology leader in electrification and automation. that said, we still have a couple of matters that needs to be resolved. one such item is the legacy kusile project.
we now booked a provision related to this, which impacted eps performance in the quarter. we feel confident that there will not be any additional material provisions related to these matters. i will come back to this a little bit later. before we move on, i want to comment on e-mobility.
we have said that we want to list part of this company. and we remain committed to this. but given the high volatility in the capital markets, we do not see it happening this year. we follow the market development closely, and we'll come back when we feel circumstances are right.
now, let's look more closely at orders and revenues on slide 4. in our results, fx, especially the continued strengthening of the dollar, was a big negative swing factor of 9% to 10% when you compare our reported orders and revenues with the organic development. but looking beyond that, we had another strong growth quarter with comparable orders up 16%. we saw a stable to positive development in most customer segments.
easing of component constraints will shorten delivery lead times, which should trigger a normalizing of the order pattern. still, it was another strong quarter for orders. it was actually the seventh consecutive period with a book-to-bill ratio above 1. and our order backlog remains on the record high-level.
looking at the revenue chart on the slide, you see that this was one of the strongest quarters; comparable growth of 18% with a positive development in all business areas. this reflects a strong price contribution. but i was also pleased to finally see volumes released to a greater extent than in the previous quarters. deliveries were held by better availability of electrical components.
another positive was that our china business faced less business disruptions from covid lockdowns. now, let's take a quick look at the different regions. both americas and europe improved by 20% or more. they clearly outpaced the 4% growth in amea.
in americas, the important u.s. market increased by 29% on a strong development across most segments. in europe, orders increased in most of the major markets. in the amea region, china declined by 2%.
three of our businesses areas saw a lower orders in china with only motion in positive territory. let's turn to slide 6 and our earnings outcomes. gross margin is important, and i was pleased to see an improvement of 90 basis points to 33.5%. the high volumes clearly helped, but also very good price execution of close to 7% for the group.
we increased operational ebita by 16%. but the underlying improvement was even stronger. if we exclude the negative fx, earnings were actually up by 27%. i already mentioned the strong margin of 16.6%.
we achieved this through an impact from high volumes, good operational performance, and well-executed price management. we are clearly becoming more efficient. i mentioned the kusile project earlier. as a reminder, this is the legacy project dating back to 2015.
and we are now finally resolving the remaining matters of this topic. this triggered a nonoperational provision of $325 million in the quarter. so, on the back of this charge, despite our strong operational performance, eps declined from last year. we feel confident that there will be no -- not any more additional material provision related to these matters.
since the kusile case was reported, abb has spent considerable time and efforts, including launching a new code of conduct, educating employees, and implementing control system to prevent something similar to happen again. it is very important that our stakeholders feel confident in abb and our business. with that, i hand over to timo.
timo ihamuotila -- chief financial officer
thank you, bjorn, and greetings to everyone also from my side. first, i want to connect to bjorn's kusile comment. once this is resolved, i would say that besides the one noncore item of max 100 million of risk, which we have mentioned to you already before, we are now in normal course of business. fundamentally changing abb's risk profile has been a painful journey during past years.
now, we are pretty much done. we have a strong balance sheet. we have a net positive pension position. and we have not been doing abb business in a while, and it is not coming back.
so, we are in a good position going into 2023. ok, let's then look at the performance in the business areas, which actually all contributed to comparable growth, as well as earnings and margin improvement. starting with electrification, where we continue to see strong customer activity, which resulted in comparable orders being up 20%. looking at the total picture, we saw strength in all customer segments, and all regions improved at a double-digit rate.
if you take a slightly more granular look, we actually saw softness in some segments in china, which declined by 4%. in europe, germany stood out in the sense that orders declined. germany is a distribution-led market, and we saw distributors bringing inventories to what seems to be a normalized going-forward level. i should also mention that very strong comparable order growth in the u.s.
at 37%. it was good to see that pricing was a strong top line driver also in this quarter. but importantly, we now also saw volumes improving as a result of a generally strong market and easing of supply chain constraints. this helped momentum in customer deliveries, also in distribution solutions, which earlier has been hampered by semiconductor shortages.
in total, comparable revenues grew by 22%. but still, the order backlog increased to all-time high level of 6.8 billion as book-to-bill remained above 1. electrification operational ebita margin came in at a very strong 18%, the highest level in recent history. this was primarily driven by a good development in volumes and the continued strong price execution, which more than offset cost inflation.
the margin expansion of 210 basis points admittedly included approximately 50 basis points tailwind from a two-years-old insurance play. looking ahead into the fourth quarter, we expect double-digit growth in comparable revenues and the seasonal pattern to repeat, meaning a sequentially lower operational ebita margin. let's then move on to motion on slide 8. motion's orders again came in at around 2 billion, despite the headwind from the stronger dollar.
in addition to a strong underlying market, the 24% comparable growth was also driven by large orders, including the approximately 170 million in traction orders, a really good example on how we are supporting sustainable mobility in line with our purpose. our cutting-edge technology include high-efficient traction converters and motors that will power more than 300 new trains, reinforcing europe's railway network. looking at the revenue chart in the middle of this slide, you'll see a clear acceleration in comparable book growth to 23%. in addition to the continued solid pricing execution, we now saw volumes contribute to growth, helped by strong demand, improved supply chain, as well as a sequential recovery in customer deliveries in china as covid-related business disruptions eased.
the strong top-line development was also reflected in motion's operational ebita margin of 17.8% as higher volumes facilitated an improved fixed cost absorption. price increases continued to offset the negative impact from higher input costs, but also a slight negative product mix which was triggered by high deliveries of electrical motors. the margin increased by 40 basis points from last year, which is a strong outcome, also taking into account that this includes about 60 basis points dilution from the dodge divestment. looking ahead into the fourth quarter, motion is facing a challenging revenue comparable from last year.
hence, we anticipate a sequentially lower growth rate to comparable revenues. we expect the operational ebita margin to decline slightly, a q4 pattern you recognize from earlier years. turning then to slide 9 and process automation, for which the underlying market activity continued to be strong, particular strength was noted in end markets like gas, mining, and refining, while there was some signs of headwinds in the more energy-intense segment of the metals industry. services was up 12%.
pa's total comparable order growth of 3% was impacted by the timing of customers placing orders, particularly in the energy industries and marine and ports divisions. regionally, europe and the americas both saw high single-digit growth, while amea declined, as china orders were down 11% from a high comparable from last year. the sequential decline in the order backlog that you can see on this slide was mainly driven by fx movements. in constant currencies, the order backlog increased compared with the end of the second quarter, as the book-to-bill ratio remained above 1.
revenues grew 6% on a comparable basis with contribution from all five divisions. we did see a sequential easing of component shortages but are not totally out of the woods yet. looking at profitability, you can see that the operational ebita margin reached the highest level in recent history at 15.3%, expanding 160 basis points from last year. as a reminder, we have earlier mentioned to you that turbo has roughly 180 basis points profits positive impact on the pa margin.
higher volumes and mix were key drivers, but also some benefits from earlier taken efficiency measures. it is great to see that the team's conscious efforts to improve the gross margin in the order backlog is now being realized in revenues. the margin trajectory is clearly moving in the right direction. looking at the expectations for the fourth quarter, i note that pa had very high revenues in q4 last year.
and consequently, we anticipate a low or even slightly negative comparable revenue growth rate in q4 this year. we expect operational ebita margin to be similar to last year's reported level, even excluding the high-margin accelleron business. on slide 10, we turn to robotics & discrete automation, where overall customer activity remained at the high level. that said, the lower comparable order growth reflects customers returning to a more normal order pattern, as they seemingly anticipate the easing of supply chain constraints to shorten delivery lead times ahead.
in addition, there were some signs of customers taking slightly longer to place orders, but we still see a robust opportunity pipeline. looking at comparable revenues, it was good to see ra return to positive growth of 12% after having been held back by shortages of electrical components and covid-related lockdowns in china in recent quarters. while it is still no walk in the park, we would expect this improved supply situation to sustain and support deliveries from the backlog in both divisions. i'm also happy to say that the new robotics manufacturing site in shanghai is now fully operational, and volumes were transferred during the quarter.
similar to the other business areas, ra's profitability benefited from higher volumes and a positive price impact as the operational ebita margin increased by 170 basis points to 12.8%, underlined by both divisions in double-digit territory. for the fourth quarter, we expect an even stronger growth rate for comparable revenues than what we had in q3 supporting some sequential margin improvement. moving to slide 11, showing the group operational ebita bridge, as you can see, the comparable earnings improvement benefited from our strong pricing execution and the recovery in volumes, which more than offset the adverse effects from cost inflation. acquisitions and divestments, mainly dodge, as well as the impact from changing fx, were slightly diluting on a group level.
let's now look at our cash flow on slide 12. it was good to see our back-end loaded cash flow expectations for the year coming through, with the third quarter cash from operating activities in continuing operations at $793 million. compared with last year, the cash impact from better operational performance was, however, more than offset by negative movements in trade working capital. the reasons primarily being a higher buildup in inventories and less favorable change in trade receivables to support strong continued order intake and higher revenue levels.
in this quarter, we had a negative cash impact of about 125 million from the exit of one noncore legacy businesses as announced in q2. looking ahead, i want to remind you about couple of items, which will impact our future cash flows. first, bjorn mentioned earlier, the kusile provision of about 325 million. this is expected to impact our cash flow in the coming quarters as we finalize the settlement.
on a more positive note, we also received about $1.4 billion in cash flow from investing activities from the sale of the remaining stake in hitachi energy, as we expect to close the transaction now in q4. now, you have heard us talk about being more active on the m&a side. so, before i hand over to bjorn, let me briefly walk you through what we have done here. we are actually picking up the pace.
admittedly, they are small tickets, but this is natural, since smaller tends to be easier to find and close. the important thing is that our new processes work. through the implementation of the abb way, we have significantly change how we work with m&a. first, we have increased the analytical discipline for acquisitions.
then, as a consequence of the decentralized abb way operating model, we have transferred the responsibility to build the target pipeline to the divisions, i.e., close to the market. each division is different and has different investment needs to secure future growth. we firmly believe that this new setup will result in more focused and accurate growth activities. we simply think that doing many smaller deals is better for the buyer.
bjorn mentioned earlier division lead acquisitions in this quarter. motion announced their first two acquisitions in a long time. both the siemens' low-voltage nema motor business and the powertech converter acquisition will help respective divisions to further cement their leading market positions. and then looking at the gray dots on the right side of this slide, you can see that we have also driven minority investment through our divisional lenses.
both the incharge energy and numocity majority acquisitions made earlier this year are good examples that these minority investment can later also become acquisition targets. so, in summary, i feel we are on the right track to drive value creation also through inorganic growth. and with that, let me hand over to bjorn to some final comments.
bjorn rosengren -- chief executive officer
thank you, timo. and lastly, on slide 14, we take a quick look at the expectations for q4. we expect the low double-digit comparable revenue growth impacted by the high-level of revenues recorded last year. the operational ebita margin is typically lower in q4 compared with q3, and we expect this pattern to repeat also this year.
we have had good performance so far this year, and we are likely to achieve our margin targets already in 2022. we will leave the 2023 targets unchanged. and what we mean is that any normal market fluctuation should not prevent us from achieving our operational ebita margin of at least 15%. and with that, i will let ann-sofie start the q&a.
ann-sofie nordh
yes, let's open up for the q&a. and for those of you that have dialed in on the phone, you press star 14 to register to ask a question. and just as a reminder to secure the sound quality, please do remember to mute the webcast as your line is open for questions. if you instead want to put your question through by using the online tool in the webcast, please type your question in the field in the bottom right corner of the screen.
and i will then put your through -- will put your question through from here. i already see that we have a long queue for questions. and as we really want to try and get through as many of you as possible, i kindly ask you to, this time, limit you to one question per person. and with that said, i think we start off with a question from the conference call as we open up the line for martin at citi.
are you there, martin?
martin wilkie -- deutsche bank
yes, i'm here. thank you for taking the question. as i'm limited to one, perhaps, i could ask about the energy crisis impact. you've touched on a little bit in your opening remarks.
if we look at some of your end customers, they're obviously energy intense. when we look at your process automation, you talk about strong pipeline, even though the quarter itself, perhaps, not so much in the way of large orders. how are you seeing this impacting your customers? should we think that this is creating an opportunity for you that can support energy efficiency orders over the coming months, or even more of a concern that the impact of, perhaps, on capacity being scaled back in you and so forth could actually lead to demand disruption, if you like, in europe and therefore more of a negative? so, we're very interested to hear how europe [inaudible] that. thank you.
bjorn rosengren -- chief executive officer
yeah, thanks, martin for the question. maybe i'll take a crack at that. so, first of all, i just want to say that the energy intensity for abb itself is quite low. so, this is like, you know, half a point of our cost base.
so, this really comes from the customer side, as you mentioned. and i think this is really a bit of a dual situation. so, yes, we have some customers, as we mentioned today, like in the metals industry. so, if you think about something like aluminum smelters and that kind of stuff, so very energy intense.
and on these ones, we are seeing a little bit of slowdown. on the other hand, because our products are really driving energy efficiency on the market, we are seeing a lot of growth. i mean, in some big new areas, while i just mentioned that in middle east and africa, we had like 50% type of order growth driven by energy. and we are seeing this also in some parts of the u.s.
market and so forth. so, i don't think for us this is like a one answer. i think -- overall, i think we're pretty balanced on the situation. but we, of course, have to see how it plays out.
ann-sofie nordh
are we good with that, martin? i realize you have more questions, but i'd kindly ask you to get back in line, and, hopefully, we'll have time to come back to you for those. we move on to alex at bank of america merrill lynch. alex, please. your line should be open.
alexander virgo -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
thanks very much. good morning, everyone. yeah, one question. i wondered if you could talk a little bit about your pricing then.
you said 7% at the group level. i wondered if you could expand a little bit around regional differences or comment, perhaps, around where you find that that pricing is, i guess, coming up against any pushback or any indication of any deterioration, deceleration in that regard. thank you.
bjorn rosengren -- chief executive officer
thank you, alex. i can talk a little bit about the pricing. as you probably know, we put in a pricing strategy in each of our division already 2020. and pricing is not just lifting prices.
we work on value-based pricing concept, and we have implemented these strategies in all our divisions. of course, we are happy that we did it already then. so, when the inflation came, i think, more or less, all of our divisions was well prepared to handle that. and i think that has been done.
and as you can see, we have been able to offset many of the cost increases that we have had during the last years. of course, going forward, we see there are certain parts where we see inflation. we see some increases in cost, even though it's getting a little bit better, i must say. freights are going down.
some of the commodity prices are being more neutralized. on the other hand, energy prices are going up. and inflation is still there, as you see in some of the numbers. so, far i think the divisions, which is this is a division that have done that in a quite professional way.
going forward, i think that is actually dealt with all the divisions. so, some of them will be more impacted, some less, and they need to deal with it. so, i wouldn't say there's a general picture for all abb. we can say though, that u.s.
and europe had a bigger inflation than we've seen, for instance, in asia.
ann-sofie nordh
ok, very good. thank you. and now, we'll put through a question here that we received online. and it's from jonathan mounsey at exane bnp paribas.
he says, ""we are likely heading into a downturn next year. i would think that the efforts to decentralize over recent years will yield a very different set of behaviors within the group compared to previous slowdowns. in previous downturns, group management moved to announce companywide restructuring plans. if demand softens now, how will things be different this time?"" and i guess this is --
bjorn rosengren -- chief executive officer
i'd say, timo, maybe i should answer that question. of course, we have a strong confidence in our new operating model, the abb way, meaning we are moving the decision making to all our businesses. as you know, 99% of all our people are today working in our businesses. now, we are not planning any kind of corporate activities when it comes to the size of the company.
i think already our divisions have been since a half year back in working with different scenario planning, looking at different kind of softening of the market more heavily or just a little bit. and they have made their plans based on that. some divisions are more impacted, and some will be less impacted. and they will make these decisions in the businesses.
this is an operating model that works. and we feel comfortable about that going -- if we will go into softer times going forward.
ann-sofie nordh
and we open up for next question from the conference call which should be coming from gael, deutsche bank.
gael de bray -- deutsche bank -- analyst
thanks very much. good morning, everybody. can you hear me?
ann-sofie nordh
we can.
bjorn rosengren -- chief executive officer
we do.
gael de bray -- deutsche bank -- analyst
ok. that's great. thanks very much. i have a question on the order dynamics.
i mean, if i try and adjust for seasonality, it appears that organic orders were up sequentially, maybe by, you know, nearly 5%. so, it clearly defies my expectations of some sort of normalization. i mean, i heard you, you know, talking about this normalization in different industries. but it appears that in order segments, we've seen really nice positive development.
so, my question is, i mean, in which segments and in which regions in particular did you see the greatest positive developments, sequentially speaking? thank you.
bjorn rosengren -- chief executive officer
yeah, sequentially, i will start with this, and thanks for the question. we more look at this year on year. but i think if you look at our sequential development, we are, first of all, seeing very strong development in the u.s. we had a very strong u.s.
growth, close to 30%. and also, in some markets in southern europe, we have been a very, very strong development in places like italy, spain, so forth. also, u.k. was, this time, strong.
we have very strong growth in india, actually, already, two years in a row over 40% growth. so, these are some of the areas. but i also -- i mean, this is, of course, orders, i understand, not revenue. but we also were expecting a little bit of this happen going into the year that we would really have a strong performance in q3 when we sort of come out from some of the constraints.
so, these are some of the areas. and then as i mentioned earlier, we are seeing some strong opex demand on oil and gas. and we're also seeing strong demand in mining, industrial automation, or industrial electrification continues very strong. if you look at the trends in motion, in particular, we have now, i think, sequentially, twice over 20% growth.
so, these are some of the areas where it's coming through. the motion trend, i think, is really, really looking very strong, even if we had a bit more mix now on electric motors. but that seems to be continuing on a good trajectory.
gael de bray -- deutsche bank -- analyst
ok. thanks very much.
ann-sofie nordh
thank you and -- ok, thanks, gael. we take the next question from the conference call. and we open up the line for ben at morgan stanley.
ben uglow -- morgan stanley -- analyst
good morning. hope all is well, and thank you for taking the question. the -- really, it's for bjorn and it's more color, it's a local sense of what's going on in china. if we think about the order development during the quarter, which areas do you see is relatively strong? i'm assuming motion was the best.
but if you can just give us a feel for how -- you know, which were the relative areas of strength and weakness? and i guess, similarly, how did the kind of base orders trend throughout the quarter? so, things in -- were things accelerating in china during 3q? thank you.
bjorn rosengren -- chief executive officer
thank you, ben. if you look at china, you're seeing the orders in north america, you're seeing in europe, and somewhat weaker in asia. and china was down a couple of [inaudible]. these are, of course, mainly driven by the residential construction market, which is, as we all know, the weakest one.
we feel so much stronger on the industrial part of the businesses. it varies a little bit between our different businesses, where i think the one sticking out most positively is motion actually. we'd had a very strong position during the quarter. i mean, then if you look at on the robotics & discrete automation, as you know, robot -- china is our biggest robot market.
and it was down a little bit during the quarter. but at the same time, we should know that we have an order book, which is up 80% on that part. so, we are normalizing a little bit on the order side. i mean, going forward, we are not so nervous about china.
we think it is moving on. and we expect not to see any huge growth number but pretty steady going forward.
timo ihamuotila -- chief financial officer
yeah, maybe just comment on the base orders. they were actually very similar now this quarter. so, there is no big delta on the base orders. we had -- in germany, we had a bit of a delta because we have a lot -- had a large order.
but this dynamic was not there regarding china this time.
ben uglow -- morgan stanley -- analyst
ok. thank you very much. that's helpful. thanks.
ann-sofie nordh
ok, then -- thanks, ben. and then, we open up for a question from guillermo at ubs.
guillermo peigneux lojo -- ubs -- analyst
hi. good morning, everyone. thank you for taking my question.
ann-sofie nordh
good morning.
guillermo peigneux lojo -- ubs -- analyst
i guess, maybe i wanted to elaborate on the segments within electrification. i guess you gave very clear country and regional picture. but i was wondering whether you describe a little bit the growth patterns that you've seen in industrial infrastructure, non-resi, and residential, which i think was interesting. and then, similarly, you know, about cancellations, do you think that there is an increasing risk in cancellations coming from any other points of the backlog wherein [inaudible]? thank you.
timo ihamuotila -- chief financial officer
yeah, thanks, guillermo. maybe i'll at least start this one. so, first of all, on electrification, it's a broad-based strong demand. so, i would say, this china topic what bjorn was discussing is pretty much the only area where we are seeing a bit lower growth.
and as you saw, we had over 20% both order growth and revenue growth. so, it's really nice to see now the conversion coming in. and also actually, pretty much all the divisions are improving in performance. so, the fact that distribution solution is now both revenue and getting better margin, it's actually really good situation in the electrification.
now, then, if you go a little bit deeper into the market, in germany, we had 8% growth. base order growth was slightly negative. there, we are seeing a bit of impact in electrification in q3, but we're actually expecting the channel to normalize going into q4. and then, really, the other markets are looking quite strong.
and i think electrification in the u.s. was even more than the 30%, if i remember correctly. so, these are some of the dynamics on the really, really good performance in electrification. and we're, of course, super happy about that 18% margin there.
ann-sofie nordh
and we move on with a question for bjorn from the online tool. it comes from phil buller. and he says, ""bjorn, you're known for being a turnaround guy. and it looks like abb is now turned around.
is your work done here now? or is there more heavy lifting that you can see and wish to progress in the coming years?""
bjorn rosengren -- chief executive officer
ok, that's an interesting question. but let me start with saying that before i even joined abb, i always had huge respect for this company. i said, when i came in directly, this is a great company. it has a very strong foundation and we have good people.
i was a little bit baffled about the financial performance, why we couldn't, you know, deliver in line or better than our peers. so, that is an important part. i think we've taken a giant step on this side. and i think we are now coming up to the right levels.
and -- but of course, this is only a start of a long journey. and i believe that abb has much more potential than this to go forward. i'm having my time of the life. so, i will not -- i hope i don't have to leave the company at this stage.
i hope i can continue for a while more, while we're having here a good time. and the company is a great place to work for. so, big respect for abb.
ann-sofie nordh
and we'll take another question from the online tool. actually, it comes from two people but on the sort of along the similar lines with our intentions on how to spend the proceeds from the sale of the final 20% of power grids. how are you going to spend the cash, boys?
bjorn rosengren -- chief executive officer
well, you're sitting on it, timo. so, why don't you --
timo ihamuotila -- chief financial officer
ok, sure. we'll go for that. no change in our capital allocation principle, so we will continue to look to execute and all of these. we, of course, first and foremost, want to drive organic growth.
and then we are expecting to continue to pay sustained growing dividend per share, value adding acquisitions, we spoke about that a little bit more, how we do that on the divisional lens, and then finally also share buybacks. and we should have capacity, as we have discussed earlier, to continue on all of these areas. of course, in the end, it is always a board and agm decision regarding the share buybacks, but really no change there. we expect to end the year with a strong q4 cash flow and, of course, adding the [inaudible] money with a strong balance sheet.
ann-sofie nordh
very good. and we'll take the next question from james moore at redburn. james, your lines should be open.
james moore -- redburn partners -- analyst
good morning, everyone. hope you're well. could i come back to pricing, please? on revenue price impact, i guess from your peers that you might have been around 2% in pa and ra last quarter, maybe about 6 or mid single digit in electrification and motion last quarter. and i wondered whatever the numbers were, how that sort of developed in the third quarter, and how you expect that to develop into the fourth and into next year.
and to what degree average order prices are higher or lower than revenue prices?
timo ihamuotila -- chief financial officer
yeah, yeah. so, division now -- sorry, not -- division business area based price level, so, of course, we are not disclosing this likely. so, i can just refer, maybe, to the 7. so, i would say that our shorter cycle businesses were a little higher.
and then, as you say, pa and ra little lower. when we look at the dynamics, what is really, really good to see is that we are actually now covering with pricing all the costs in the gross margin and a little bit more. so, our cost increase from commodities has started to come down. also, the freight actually didn't have a big impact.
we have salary inflation on the factories. that's understandable. but the pricing was well covering that, and we had a nice drop-through if i remember on the abb level, 23% on the additional revenue. so, in that sense the equation is working quite well.
and then, how will this stick? of course, it's depending on the demand normalization, which we have been seeing. but i would say that in the shorter-cycle business experiences that it sticks sort of fairly well in this kind of situation, unless we've something totally drastic happened.
bjorn rosengren -- chief executive officer
i can say we also look at the gross margin in our order book, which is, of course, an important measurement --
timo ihamuotila -- chief financial officer
right. exactly.
bjorn rosengren -- chief executive officer
for the future. and we can of course, see that a good strengthening in this and we believe that the gross margin is of utmost important for any businesses to be able to develop. and that is the value, you -- actually you are pricing into your customer. so, if you're looking at our order book, it looks quite promising.
james moore -- redburn partners -- analyst
and if i may, if labor costs, labor inflation goes up, which it looks like it's going to, is that harder to pass on with pricing and requires productivity? or can you pass that on?
bjorn rosengren -- chief executive officer
i mean, we look at the total cost picture. there's a lot of factors. you know, it's from sub-suppliers, it's energy cost, it is freight, everything else that needs to be priced in, of course. and we have professional pricing department now in all our divisions.
and we do expect that they deal with all these kind of inflation, if it's material or if it's cost increases from labor.
james moore -- redburn partners -- analyst
thank you very much.

thanks, james. and we move to will mackie at kepler cheuvreux.
william mackie -- kepler cheuvreux -- analyst
hello, good morning. thank you for the time. the question relates to supply chains and balance sheet, primarily the $1.7 billion of inventory increase in the working capital year to date and the nearly $700 million of trade receivables. perhaps, you could talk to how you expect the working capital to normalize over the next 12 to 18 months and specifically in the fourth quarter, and how that may relate to -- how you see the evolution of the supply chain? thank you.
timo ihamuotila -- chief financial officer
yeah, thanks for the question, i was kind of expecting that that would come at some point. so, when we look at the inventory, first of all, of course, the most important thing is that the inventory is line with the growth we are seeing in the backlog. and when we look at that measure, i.e., inventory relation with inventory to the backlog, it has actually stayed pretty similar during the last two, three years. so, around 30% type of level when we look at it on constant currency.
and if you then look at our order backlog, we are actually expecting more conversion shorter term. so, as we are sitting here and standing and looking at our numbers, we expect about 50% conversion now from current backlog, 23. last year, we were expecting 45 conversions. so, it's actually kind of like coming closer.
and in that sense, we think that is well in line. and we would expect the conversion to start to happen now already in q4 when the demand picture in our expectation will start to normalize. now, let's see how that plays out. and then, we expect a strong cash year for 2023, given this continuing.
and i can't see any reason why abb's long-term net working capital to revenue would have moved to a higher level from where we have been historically. so, i would expect that number to come down now, q4, again, provided, we don't have some, let's call it surprise, additional order boost and then to continue to then further normalize 2023.
william mackie -- kepler cheuvreux -- analyst
thank you.
ann-sofie nordh
thank you. and we have one question from andy here at j.p. morgan. he says, ""can you comment on the attractiveness on the pipeline on smaller acquisitions, if that rules out larger deals? or are all large deals -- no, where are all deal sizes on the table?
bjorn rosengren -- chief executive officer
thank you. maybe i can talk a little bit about the acquisition side. i think we've been clear that we look at each of the division and we say stability and profitability to full growth. about 70% of our divisions are now in what we call growth mode.
and when we talked about growth, it's organic and acquisitions. so, we are seeing more and more deals taking place at the moment. and we expect this, of course, to accelerate. five to 10 per year is where we think is a reasonable level, of course, driven fully from the divisional side.
and they are doing it, of course, to strengthen their competitive situation in -- into the market. so, it can be technology or market share in certain areas. the size of these deals are quite small at this -- which is natural when it's driven by the divisions. but we could, of course, also see, i think, at this stage that abb now is coming in to stable and profitability phase, maybe somewhat bigger.
but i'm not saying that we are going to go into any corporate-driven, by business area-driven if there is, for instance, a smaller division size that could be added on to the business if it strengthen the business area overall. so, i think we have a pretty good control over this, and i think it's a good process at the moment. so, we will experience many small to medium size and maybe some little bit bigger.
ann-sofie nordh
and then, we'll take another question from the online tool, which says, ""does the full year '22 margin outlook for at least 15% exclude accelleron for full year?""
bjorn rosengren -- chief executive officer
yes, i can answer that one. it's very important when we say that if we will reach our target for this year about 50%, then we exclude the accelleron for the whole year. so, that is important. and you know that accelleron has approximately 0.2 percentage points impact on the group.
ann-sofie nordh
and then, we'll take another question from the conference call as we open up the line for joe at cowen. joe, are you with us?
joe giordano -- cowen and company -- analyst
i am. good morning.
ann-sofie nordh
good morning.
joe giordano -- cowen and company -- analyst
i still struggle with what i see in, like, larger-term macro kind of indicators with what companies are saying with short-cycle demand. i mean, when i look at orders, you're looking at things like ism. i mean, it's in contraction mode, yet companies seem to be talking very positively about short cycle. when you look at your own results here, how do you square that? do you feel that abb is significantly outperforming what your competitors are doing? does this feel like some sort of inevitable kind of one has to meet the other? or do you expect that, like, you can just continue to grow, while the -- while broader indicators suggest that the markets are going the other way?
bjorn rosengren -- chief executive officer
maybe talk a little bit about growth, and we talked not too much about the expectation going forward. but yeah, we have -- i mean that seven quarters with book-to-bill ratio, which is about 1. so, we've seen good growth and the last quarter on very high levels. of course, now, when also when revenues start coming out in the right way, we should see a normalization, i think, of the order pattern going forward.
this will be too early to say yet, but we look at different kind of scenarios, and we have to play with that. i think abb is keeping itself well up, you know, in relation to competitors. i don't think we are outperforming probably anyone. i think we have a good way to execute and operate and well-positioned when we look at the global trends.
so, we are where you should be, for where we should see growth in the coming years. and that is one of the reason also why we lifted the growth targets over a business cycles to 4% to 7% because we believe that we are in good markets. then short term, of course, there will be ups and downs in the market, has always been, and we need to deal with them. and the divisions need to deal with them in a professional way.
and we do believe that the operating model we have today will do that. so, so far, i mean, it's -- we haven't seen year on year in q3 any changes in the order or behavior, in the buying pattern. but, of course, we read the news, we see what's taking place in the world. they're not -- we of course expect that everybody else that, going forward, we ensure there's going to be some difference what we have seen during the last six to 12 months.
ann-sofie nordh
and unless i remember only, i'm a little bit -- we can tag on to the question of how has q4 started? because i don't think anyone has asked it yet. so, i'll might as well put the question to you.
bjorn rosengren -- chief executive officer
yeah, we continue to see growth, even though we expect a more normalized order pattern during the quarter.
ann-sofie nordh
right. thank you. and a question from simon at jefferies. it says, ""can you comment a bit on the end markets in discrete industries where you're seeing customers taking longer to place orders?""
bjorn rosengren -- chief executive officer
yeah, i mentioned that a little bit before. and that's very much related to the robot, robotics & discrete automation business. you also probably -- you know that these are the two divisions where we have had the biggest challenges when it comes to supply chains and semiconductors parts. so, we have, during the time, built up a huge order book.
so, that needs to be executed. so, we have thousands of robots, and we have a lot that determines that need to be executed during next quarter but also into next year. i mean, i can just mention that our order book here had from one year been 80% up. you can imagine this is, of course, not normal market trends.
so, there is of course, a lot of orders laying there, which was also placed because of our limited possibilities to deliver. so, of course, that needs to be delivered out. and then, we, of course, have to build on the market trends when it comes to automation in the market, which we believe are positive.
ann-sofie nordh
and we have actually one, i think, final question here coming through on electrification and the comments about normalization on distributor inventory levels. how much of a risk, if any, it is dynamic for demand in the next quarters, given that we say that it seems to be completed by the end of q3?
timo ihamuotila -- chief financial officer
why don't i just say that this comment was specific to germany and then maybe hand over to bjorn. yeah.
bjorn rosengren -- chief executive officer
this is -- of course, we've seen that effect in germany, especially in electrification, where most of the businesses that have been through our partners and the discussions with them. there is certain normalization of their inventory levels. talking to our electrification business, this is more or less completed now, and we do expect more a normal order pattern within that industry going forward. this is very specific for germany.
rest on the market, as you've seen on the electrification, it's -- besides china, we've seen, of course, very, very strong growth, not least in north america.
ann-sofie nordh
yes. and then, we actually have one quick last question from the conference call. it comes from daniela at goldman sachs. daniela, your line should be open.
daniela costa -- goldman sachs -- analyst
thank you very much. good morning. so, following up on the commentary regarding margins and growth going forward, i guess, looking from here to '25, you just said over 15% remains the target. but you seem to lean in the commentary in the call a bit more toward growth? is it fair to say when we think about earnings growth going forward, are there any places where there's significant margin improvement potential left or the opportunity is more the growth side?
bjorn rosengren -- chief executive officer
thank you, daniela. it's a good question. as i mentioned here is that our approach is cemented to stability, profitability for growth. and you've seen more and more division moving in, where they have what we call the growth mandate.
that doesn't mean that they're not driving their margins because they continue to improve this. and that is part of it. but, of course, they will also drive growth more stronger. and today, about 70% of our divisions have what we call the growth mandate.
but we still have a number of divisions that are not meeting their expectations for financial performance. and they are focusing, of course, to getting the levels to the right level before they really push these kind of businesses. of course, we are happy to be on the one year early with reaching the target. but for us, this is just an in-between target.
we believe that abb has the great potential. we will continue to drive that. and for us, it's important to stay above 50% despite different demands in the market, if it gets tougher or not. so, we need to make sure that the business has continued to develop and -- but also protect the margin in the downturns.
so, if it would be a tougher time next year, we do expect that they also should deliver on that. but we have no roof, so they will hopefully continue to improve.
daniela costa -- goldman sachs -- analyst
very clear. thank you.
ann-sofie nordh
thank you very much. thanks, daniela. and with that, we close this session. we thank you very much for joining us today, and we will see you in about a quarter's time.
bjorn rosengren -- chief executive officer
