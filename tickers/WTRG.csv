thank you. [operator instructions] our first question comes from julien dumoulin-smith with bank of america.
christopher franklin -- chairman and chief executive officer
hi, julien.
julien dumoulin-smith -- bank of america -- analyst
hi, good morning. hi, thanks so much chris and the whole team here. perhaps i wasn't going to start here, but in light of your commentary, i'd be curious i mean what do you think this strategically means for the gas ldc space, chris, i mean certainly your observations are not lost on us, but i'm curious if there are implications that -- obviously you all have been more on the acquisition side, but i'm curious if you could opine across the broader space?
christopher franklin -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes, i mean, listen, i think -- as i mentioned, we're in hyperbolic situation with the elections and the whole discussion. and so i think there's a lot of factors contributing currently a little low. and i mean, listen, there's an esg movement, we're part of it, to make the country and generally the world greener. but i really believe that natural gas plays a prominent role in that work and will for a very long time. and so i believe, julien, that once the -- once people get really grounded in the facts, i think we'll see some improvement.
now not all gas ldcs are the same and that's why i really wanted to spend time today differentiating the gas ldc that we purchased that sits over top of the marcellus shale region and has a low cost gas for a very long time versus some of the areas where people are passing legislation to prohibit new natural gas opportunities. pittsburgh, pennsylvania is very, very different. and as i said, very proud. so in total, i think you'll see a return recognition to the importance of natural gas as not only part of our energy independence in this country, but also as a prominent part of the greening. it has to be. we're not going to call, start a nuclear plant when it's not windy, it's not sunny up. you're going to depend on natural gas. so a very efficient way to heat a home. and so hopefully that gives you a little insight into how we're thinking about it.
julien dumoulin-smith -- bank of america -- analyst
okay, all right. fair enough. doesn't sound like too many strategic implications though as i hear from you. but i want to pivot at this point back to the other strategic actions you have pending already. with respect to delcora here, we understand you expect to close in 1q, but can you just walk through the timeline for clarity? i know you kind of alluded to that already and how we should think about the cadence of pulling on the equity?
christopher franklin -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes, well, let's think about this, first on the acquisition of delcora. so a lot of moving parts to that. there is a court date coming up, which is supposed to be this week, we're still hoping it's going to be next week, but we'll probably know that sometime later today. and then there is the option of public utility commission process that we'll wind through and we've got a pandemic over top which always delay things a little bit. so, i would say, we're not locking ourselves into the first quarter, but i would say, probably fair to think about march-april timeframe in terms of when we might get it done.
now for the equity, i'll pass over to dan here in a moment. remember, when we talked about our $300 million equity offering that wasn't all for delcora. that was for use of a lot of -- you see it -- as we went through this, we've got a lot of work going on with municipal acquisitions and pretty chunky sized acquisitions. and so as we continue to do that, we've said that we'll continue to need to pull down equity in order to finance these acquisitions. dan, do you have something to add on the equity portion?
daniel schuller -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
yes and maybe julien, what's kind of implied there is the timing of pulling down the equity. and i just wanted to reiterate our august timing was really driven by the fact that we wanted to make sure we were in a good position to close these transactions. we obviously wanted to price the stock at a strong price from a share price perspective and we wanted to avoid the volatility going into this election cycle and certainly we've seen that volatility play out, really kind of since the time that we did that equity forward. so we -- really we're quite pleased with the timing of the equity forward coming right off the last earnings call and put us in a position where when we need that equity for the transaction, we will issue those shares, we'll settle that forward and we'll get the proceeds we need to close the delcora transaction as well as other transactions.
and in the meantime, you don't -- since it is a forward, julien, those shares won't count in our denominator when we think about earnings per share unless there is material price movement. but without that, you don't count those shares.
julien dumoulin-smith -- bank of america -- analyst
yes.
daniel schuller -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
yes. we're quite pleased with it.
julien dumoulin-smith -- bank of america -- analyst
got it. sorry, if i can squeeze another one quickly in here, obviously i'm sure on the water side, especially with resi and large resi that looked like they're [phonetic] curbing some of the other impacts. can you just talk very quickly about the gas ldc side of the equation as we talk about coming into their impact on covid into the back half of the year?
daniel schuller -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
yes, it's a little early to tell and obviously we're coming out of q2, q3 that are low gas usage months. i would say, we didn't in those months see what we would call a meaningful impact that was due to covid. and as you know, weather and heating degree days drive gas usage more than anything else. and so we are confident as we go into this fall that we'll see usage correlated with the weather. and i would say from our conversations in western pennsylvania, we're not seeing significant load, meaning, manufacturing heating load, things like that, manufacturers offline that would really impact the consumption in a way other than it being weather driven.
julien dumoulin-smith -- bank of america -- analyst
excellent. thank you guys for the time.
daniel schuller -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
yes.

our next question will come from ryan connors with boenning & scattergood.
ryan connors -- boenning & scattergood -- analyst
thanks. good morning.
christopher franklin -- chairman and chief executive officer
hi, ryan.
ryan connors -- boenning & scattergood -- analyst
yes. good morning, guys. you've got -- it sounds seems like you've got a knack for timing this year i remember the dow was down about 4,000 points for the week at the analyst day. and then another interesting day to day to be active here. so anyway, my first question was just -- i appreciate the waterfall dan on the earnings and the revenue, it's very helpful. but it seems like the o&m expense came in pretty well above our model, and i think that might have been factored in a little shy of consensus as well. so i think based on what you've said that seems to be driven more by the peoples side, so at least for those like myself who are somewhat newer to the gas side, can you just kind of walk us through some of the moving parts there on the expense side for peoples?
daniel schuller -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
yes. and let me first comment that you're right in terms of where the expenses are that we've added that new expense from peoples. and frankly, we don't see that -- we've got no comparison to that expense in prior quarters. when you look at the regulated water segment and you'll see this in our segment reporting when the q [phonetic] comes out, you'll see if you look at the o&m line for the regulated water segment year-on-year. and you do the math, you'll see that that's down about 2.2%. so comfortable with where expenses are there.
on the peoples side, what we're doing here is we're really just kind of adding in the peoples expenses this year. and i'm not sure kind of the basis for your model relative to kind of what we're reporting for the first time. so maybe that's conversation we make sure we have it another kind of offline.
ryan connors -- boenning & scattergood -- analyst
sure, sure. okay. and a couple of other kind of big picture questions. one is any nawc had their big annual [indecipherable] last week virtual of course. and one of the things i was interesting is naruc was there -- on there talking about sort of more federal involvement in the water utility space whether it's things like encouraging so called water grid investment and things like a liheap for water? i'll let you -- it sounds great on the surface, but then again one of the great differentiators for water is that you are regulated closer to home. so i guess did you happen to hear those comments? and what's your reaction to that concept of greater federal [technical issues] is there as some of that stuff moves forward that you kind of get pulled in just to some kind of regulatory constructs that maybe ultimately counterproductive?
christopher franklin -- chairman and chief executive officer
well, let's use the example that you pointed out there of liheap. i do think ryan that as people become more and more aware that the cost to serve water is climbing given the massive capital expense that we've got to put forth. there is going to be a need for some customer assistance beyond what we've been able to provide in the way we're doing it in the past. so we are going to -- i think you know this, we are going to submit in this rate case, our next water rate case, universal service program for the first time. we'll be the first water utility in pennsylvania to do it. we're going to submit that.
but listen, when we look at what's happening at peoples, all in peoples provides about $27 million of assistance to their customers, and a lot of that comes from the federal government. there probably ought to be some consideration as water prices continue to climb as well. and i think it's tough to say that's going to come from the state, it should probably be provided in the same way that the gas utilities and the electric utility get their supplements. so i think there is some advantage to that as prices continue to climb. but i agree with you, i prefer not to get sucked into the red tape of the federal government for many other issues other than maybe customer assistance.
ryan connors -- boenning & scattergood -- analyst
okay. that's fair. and then my last one was just -- and you kind of alluded to it here, chris, about the rate case in pennsylvania. i mean you came into covid with a pretty light rate pipeline which is maybe lucky maybe good but sort of good timing because the optics have trying to go out for rates right now is not great. but we've got this k shaped recovery where there is a segment of the population that's going to be struggling for a while. how do you think about sort of the sequencing in base rate case activity? i mean is there the optics of that and the politics of that and i mean how does that affect the timing of what you ordinarily would be doing right now in terms of sizing up the various rate cases?
christopher franklin -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes, it's an important question and one that that we spent time considering all the aspects of. but i think when you think about as larger unit as the pennsylvania water utility is for the company, you really have to remain on the cadence given the continued capital spend and everything else. listen, i hope we have a vaccine out shortly here, and by the time, we're filing a rate case we're well into the national vaccination for covid-19. and of course, we'll continue to evaluate things as we get deeper into the spring. but suffice to say, it does -- the national issue of the pandemic does play here in pennsylvania and would impact how we think about a rate increase. i can't tell you at this point that there are plans to alter course, but it certainly will be in the consideration.
daniel schuller -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
and then, chris, i'd add to that. the universal service program proposal for that helps to address the people that are on that downward leg of that k shaped recovery, ryan that you mentioned.
ryan connors -- boenning & scattergood -- analyst
yes, ok. super, well, hi, thanks for your time.
daniel schuller -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
yes. thanks, ryan.

we'll take our next question from insoo kim with goldman sachs.
insoo kim -- goldman sachs -- analyst
good morning.
christopher franklin -- chairman and chief executive officer
good morning.
insoo kim -- goldman sachs -- analyst
first question is on the equity side. just on a hypothetical basis if the delcora transaction fails to close, how do you think about the amount of equity that you are expected to pull from the forward? do you still expect it to do the full amount or could it be something less?
christopher franklin -- chairman and chief executive officer
first, remember i'm going to kick it to dan here in a second, but let's remember that we have other transactions, insoo, that are pretty chunky here and a couple of others that we think we are on the precipice of announcing. we obviously we are hoping stay on course. but there are multiple uses for that equity. dan, why don't you jump in there.
daniel schuller -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
yes, i think you're exactly right, chris. i mean it was interesting commencing, i know you talked about lower makefield the size of that being $55 million and 11,000 connections. and a year or two ago on this call, we had thought that was a huge acquisition, right, and now we say kind of matter of fact. but we see a number of things that looks like that in terms of size or bigger that could help to absorb that equity. i mean i think, insoo, we'll continue to evaluate it as the -- as we've got, call it, nine, 10 months left on that -- it's ability to settle that forward. so we got a lot of time here for that delcora transaction to play out and for other things of scale that we're working on to play out as well. at this point, we certainly anticipate that we would physically settle that forward, but there are options to taking cash that are all partial cash settle as well.
insoo kim -- goldman sachs -- analyst
yes, makes sense. understood. and then just my other question is going back to the gas strategy, chris, i know you and i've spoken about that and the reasoning for the peoples gas acquisition, definitely appreciate the reasoning and the advantages that you -- that peoples has helping in the marcellus. but just going forward from a long-term strategic business mix perspective, are you still committed that future growth especially when it comes to m&a will happen only on the water side versus on the gas ldc side?
christopher franklin -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes. let me say that clearly and you and i've had this conversation before. we are not spending any time on the natural gas side for -- on -- for m&a. we're spending a heck of a lot of time growing the rate base by replacing pipe at peoples ramping up that program. so as we've said before that -- the rate base there is growing 8% to 10% a year. so it is fast growing without doing m&a and that's allowed us then to put all of our m&a focus on the water side and it's really yielding nice results. so you said it exactly right, we're not spending any time on the gas side for m&a. it's all on the water side.
insoo kim -- goldman sachs -- analyst
got it. thank you so much.
christopher franklin -- chairman and chief executive officer
you bet.

[operator instructions] we'll take our next question from durgesh chopra with evercore isi.
christopher franklin -- chairman and chief executive officer
hi, durgesh.
daniel schuller -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
good morning, durgesh.
durgesh chopra -- evercore isi -- analyst
both chris and dan, good morning and thank you for taking my question. can i just clarify really quickly, and chris appreciate the -- all the detail around gas. that's very helpful color and perspective from you. just can i go back to delcora and can you talk about procedurally what are the milestones that we should be watching out for toward the approval process? so it's the court order then the commission order. can you just talk about that?
christopher franklin -- chairman and chief executive officer
sure, sure. first the court hearing in what's called common pleas court, county court in pennsylvania. we expected that to be this week, but it had to be moved hopefully only a week out. and that the decision by the court there is, and i'm going to be, i'm not lawyer, so i'm going to be super-simple in how i describe it. the judge has to decide is there a valid and enforceable contract in place. and clearly, we believe there is and plenty of evidence of that, so we think that the court should look very favorably on our position there. so we expect that to be sometime next week and then we would expect probably, call it, 60 days maximum. the judge has actually been working pretty quickly in that case. so it might be sooner, but i would say, within 60 days, we would know what his decision is on that.
assuming he decides the way we think and it should go -- that makes it pretty easy to then continue to move on to then focus on the commission. so the commission proceedings next week are the evidentiary hearings for delcora. and so they will [phonetic] move through the process there and then we would expect the commission to wrap up some time in the march timeframe with their work and which would allow us to close, call it, late march, early february or early april -- probably april's the more appropriate timing.
durgesh chopra -- evercore isi -- analyst
got it. and if you in any event and i know you have very successful history in pennsylvania. but in an event that the judge here has an adverse ruling, is there a sort of forum for appeal and things like that?
christopher franklin -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes. of course you can go to the commonwealth court and appeal it. but i think -- well, you can never suppose what a judge might come up with. but it could be more nuanced -- because the second question is the contract between aqua and delcora or aqua and the county of delaware. and that's probably the more nuanced approach. and frankly, i'm not sure what matters to us. we know we have a signed contract and it's enforceable. and so we feel confident that whether it's through the county or directly with delcora, that contract is enforceable. so, i'll leave it there.
durgesh chopra -- evercore isi -- analyst
thanks for your color. yes no that's great. thank you. appreciate your granularity there. and then just going back to just any update on the catch-up provision of income taxes on peoples gas that is pending with the commission? just anything new there and when to expect a final decision?
daniel schuller -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
yes. as you recall, we filed that right about the time of the last earnings call. and then we had a pre-hearing conference with the alj in early october that really outlined the procedural schedule. and as i alluded in my remarks earlier that has us with evidentiary hearings right at the end of january. but whether there are hearings or whether we settle it, this still probably plays out until a final order sometime early in the second quarter of 2021. just as these things go, thi have a certain cadence in a timeframe and there are filed, there are reply briefs, there is rebuttal, there's surrebuttal all of these steps that just take time before the administrative law judge rightly proposed decision and it ultimately goes to the commission for the deliberation accretion over the quarter, if you will.
so i think we're kind of in a wait and see mode. obviously, we're going to wait through that, but i would remember durgesh too that don't think about this as increasing earnings in the near term. think about the way we proposed it, that what it really does in that sharing of the benefit between rate payers, customers and shareholders. but if it really does, it would help us to stay out of rates longer, help us to achieve the revenue requirement in the out years, think kind of '24, '25 rather than bringing earnings forward and having incremental earnings in the near term.
durgesh chopra -- evercore isi -- analyst
yep, that's great, dan. thank you.
daniel schuller -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
good.
durgesh chopra -- evercore isi -- analyst
good number, guys. thanks for the time.
daniel schuller -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
yes. thanks, durgesh.
christopher franklin -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes. thanks durgesh.
daniel schuller -- executive vice president, chief financial officer

we'll take one more question from jonathan reeder with wells fargo.
daniel schuller -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
hi, jonathan.
jonathan reeder -- wells fargo -- analyst
hi, thanks for taking my question guys. so chris i think you kind of alluded to a little bit, but i think the court had the hearings a few weeks ago focused on the creation and use of the trust by delcora. how did those go?
christopher franklin -- chairman and chief executive officer
well, i don't think there's decisions out yet on that -- i mean the arguments went well i think and obviously we're a third-party to that jonathan, as you know, right. the trust is really an issue between delcora and ultimately the county is -- we prefer not to see a trust, but. so we're a third-party, the judge's ruling haven't come across on that. so -- but on all of the procedural work that the judge has ruled on, it's all gone very well. we've been very pleased with every one of the rulings. so i would imagine that we would hear more on that trust going forward.
jonathan reeder -- wells fargo -- analyst
does the judge issued two separate rulings then like the trust one being 60 days potentially after that hearing date and then the one on the asset purchase agreement would come even later or will it be just one kind of a global ruling that he hands down?
christopher franklin -- chairman and chief executive officer
well, i think the judge is pushing -- the judge would like to see the settlement discuss obviously, he said that very publicly. and so -- and i would -- obviously i'm not going to comment on that. but i think you're thinking about it the right way. two separate decisions, one on the trust and one on the enforceability or the contract itself. and i think you're timeframes are probably about right. so but, listen, there's a lot of ways to come out of trust, it doesn't have to be called a trust, it could be a fund, it could be under the auspices of the county versus delcora. there is a lot of, in other words, it's not a -- that's not a go, no-go issue necessarily it may be the current form of the trust. and i hate to go down this road because we're getting into probably a more sensitive area, but i would not think about the trust issue as a deal killer in anyway.
jonathan reeder -- wells fargo -- analyst
okay. and so you -- do you think there is still a chance that it gets settled? the judge is incurring it like are there active discussions. i mean, i know you can't go into the details if there are, but is that still a potential pathway?
christopher franklin -- chairman and chief executive officer
i'm sorry. ask that one more time, jonathan.
jonathan reeder -- wells fargo -- analyst
i'm just -- i know you said the judge is encouraging the parties to settle or discussions. so should we assume that there are active discussions going on like is that a potential like a real pathway at this point even though we might be only a month or two away from a judge's ruling otherwise?
christopher franklin -- chairman and chief executive officer
listen, settlement is always a possibility, but i can't comment on the kind of settlement discussions.
jonathan reeder -- wells fargo -- analyst
okay. but they are occurring?
christopher franklin -- chairman and chief executive officer
i can't say, jonathan. i really -- unfortunately, i can't say.
jonathan reeder -- wells fargo -- analyst
okay. and then lastly, again regarding the settlement, but this time in repairs tax. you kind of sounded like you're optimistic about reaching a settlement before the june hearings, is that kind of based on the intervener testimony that you've seen or how should we be thinking about the prospects there?
daniel schuller -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
at this point, jonathan, we're really just working through the process and we've gotten reply briefs back from the various intervening parties and we're working through those and we'll obviously respond. so i think it's really just too early to give you any more color on it. as i said earlier, we're progressing through it and when i say wait -- we're going to wait and see in terms of how that timeline and how that time evolves here. but we're obviously going to do everything we can here to make the case for this proposal and this sharing of benefits between the customers and the shareholders in a way that's good for all parties and keeps us out of rates longer.
jonathan reeder -- wells fargo -- analyst
okay, yes. appreciate that. yes, good luck and looking forward to those announcements before the end of the year that you alluded to, chris, on the m&a side. thanks.
christopher franklin -- chairman and chief executive officer
great. good. you bet.
daniel schuller -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
thanks, jonathan. take care.

at the conclusion of the call, we will open it up for questions. with that, i will turn the call over to chris franklin.
christopher franklin -- chairman and chief executive officer
hi, thanks, brian, and good morning, everyone. hopefully, you got some sleep last night after a long election night. it's been nearly nine months now since we closed the transaction with peoples, and as many of you recall the same amount of time since we activated our business continuity plan to deal with the pandemic. i want to start today's call by letting you know that our company and its workforce are as strong as ever, and continue [phonetic] to be in all of our dedicated workforce and the accomplishments we've been able to achieve despite the challenges of 2020.
all right. let's talk a little bit about the integration of the peoples company. each of my direct reports whether he or she is from peoples or from aqua now have teams that include leaders and employees from both legacy organizations, leveraging the best thinking and approaches from both utilities. our functional leaders like hr, it, etc. now support both water and natural gas. our operations teams have really come together quite nicely in the spring to resolve the challenges associated with covid and they've also been working very closely ever since.
we're sharing best practices related to operations and construction, safety, just to name a few. and our engineers have been working together to accelerate the pipeline replacement program at peoples, which ultimately improve safety and reduces methane emissions. we're also leveraging our scale for the purchasing of vehicles, equipment and technology. we're building efficient backbone infrastructure, systems and applications to support both utilities and better serve our customers. and we're using our larger platform to attract a more diverse workforce. hopefully, that gives you a quick sense of our integration process. overall, it's really going well.
now we will address our stock price here for a moment. there are some micro and macro issues likely at play here. i want to point out that over the summer we entered into a forward agreement, you'll recall that to issue $300 million in equity, and it took some time for this equity offering to be understood in the market. all in all, i think you'd agree that the $300 million forward went very well. now on the macro level, i'll point out the obvious, we've been in the midst of one of the most contentious elections in our country's history and natural gas or at least fracing as part of the central themes. and finally, we continue to hear concern about the progress of our delcora transaction, all impacting the stock price.
so let's talk about a couple of these issues. i'll talk both about delcora for a second and then we'll talk a little bit about our view on natural gas. so first on delcora, we remain confident that we will close delcora in early 2021. the pandemic-related issues have pushed our core day that was due to happen today at least a week out, hopefully we'll know that probably this afternoon, but hopefully, it's only a week out.
we remain confident that the central question before the court, which is, is there a valid and enforceable contract between the parties? that's the key question. we hope that the results of our time in court will be a positive result for the company. we see this is a pretty straightforward question for the court. and we hope that we will get an answer from the court about 60 days or within 60 days following the hearing. either way, there is no expected impact on eps in 2021 from the delcora acquisition, we've been saying that for some time. i would guide against putting any pluses or minuses in your short-term model for delcora, but it will be accretive in coming years, but would not impact 2020 or 2021 earnings per share.
all right. let's turn to natural gas. first, i want to acknowledge that natural gas companies have traded off obviously more recently and some investors have even begun to speculate that the future of natural gas in the united states is in doubt. so i want to take a moment to make a couple of things really clear. number one, let's ground ourselves in the projections from the non-partisan us energy information administration. it's expected that natural gas consumption will remain nearly constant in the united states through at least 2050. the declines in nuclear and coal generation will obviously yield ground to renewables, but natural gas consumption is expected to remain constant. that's really important. i think a lot of people are missing that.
secondly, we've said this many times as well. peoples is situated over the marcellus shale region and all the natural gas we serve comes from local sources. and take away to that is that the plentiful and inexpensive natural gas will be available for a really long time in the pittsburgh, pennsylvania area. now if you've not spent time in pittsburgh, you might not know that pittsburghers are proud of their natural gas history and understand its importance not only to their local economy, but also to national energy independence.
next, our natural gas service territory is really in middle class america. so to switch home from natural gas to electric, solar or wind would cost in the range of $8,000 to switch and it would also mean paying higher monthly energy costs. i think it's fair to say, our customers are unlikely to switch. now if we aggregated all of the greenhouse gas from all of the residential natural gas consumption in the country, it will only equate to about 4% of the country's total greenhouse gas emissions. so minor in the scheme of things, and i think that sometimes gets lost in the discussion as well. i think those of you who know us well know that as aqua america, we were always an environmental leader. over many years, we've demonstrated our commitment to be responsible stewards of the environment. we specialize in rehabilitating underground infrastructure, and peoples gas is really no different than aqua america was before we were combined. we believe as the new owner of the business, we can modernize its infrastructure and apply industry best practices to aggressively reduce emissions and adopt advanced technologies. as essential utilities, we plan to set a credible and aggressive intermediate term emissions reduction target by early next year. we will continue to evaluate technologies and strategies to further reduce emissions in the longer term.
so, in summary, while the media may have you believe that natural gas will go away over the next decade or whatever they're saying today, that clearly does not line up with the objective reality of energy use in the united states. in fact, it's quite the opposite. i'll say this as clearly as i can. we are very pleased with our purchase of peoples. it's performing extremely well and we believe we have a long and successful future with peoples and aqua as essential.
now i'm really pleased to introduce our new leader of our natural gas business mike huwar. mike is our new president of the peoples gas company and joined us in august concurrent with the retirement of joe gregorini who was our longtime leader of the peoples operations over there. joe did a great job and we wish him well in his retirement. mike's a native of pittsburgh comes to us from columbia gas where he spent 34 years -- a 34-year career there and most recently was president and coo of colombia's pa and maryland operations. i'd ask mike to provide some of his early observations about peoples and to provide his perspective on the natural gas business in pennsylvania where 690,000 of our 740,000 customers reside. mike?
michael huwar -- president of peoples gas company
thanks, chris. it's really a pleasure to be with you today. as a native of pittsburgh, i must tell you that i have long respected the peoples gas company for its leadership in the community, and i'm absolutely thrilled to have the opportunity to lead the utility. although i joined peoples just three months ago, i've been in the natural gas business for a few years now and while there is always opportunity for improvement. i'm happy to tell you that i'm impressed with our management, our safety culture and our safety record at peoples. the team is well trained and maybe equally important. they're very committed to both employee and customer safety. in fact, peoples was honored by the american gas association in 2019, receiving an industry leader accident prevention award for achieving total days away, restricted or transfered which is the [phonetic] rate lower than the industry average. i found the depth of management to be remarkable.
if you count the years of service for my senior team alone, we have nearly 263 combined years of service in the natural gas industry. the team is well prepared to take the company to the next level, including the ramp up of our capital plan. in fact, we are preparing to invest nearly $1.4 billion of capital in the replacement of aging gas distribution infrastructure over the next three years. and over the next 15 years, we will replace nearly 2,700 miles of distribution facilities. anytime you combine two companies together, you have a melding of cultures and that's going to take care and efforts. my early observations of the combination of aqua and peoples as now essential indicate the cultures are very similar to spart [phonetic], which will make integration much easier. i've been pleased with the spirit of cooperation among the teams and the full integration of the management teams. i believe we are developing a strong combined culture that will provide a strong and resilient company.
peoples has always been a part of the fabric of the pittsburgh community. the company's visibility and community assistance has been particularly important during the pandemic. i should also mention that the customers have access to nearly 27 million in customer assistance through the use of programs like liheap, the low income heating energy assistance program and cap, the customer assistance programs, so that customers in need can find help in to paying their bills and remain safely in their homes.
natural gas is by far the most effective energy source to heat homes and businesses in colder climates. and let's remember that our ldc, or local distribution companies peoples has access to an abundant low-cost supply of natural gas, given our position directly above the magnificent marcellus utica supply basin. low cost commodity in this region have also presented peoples the opportunity to make investments and modernize our distribution system with limited impact to the total bill of our customers, all while enhancing safety and reliability.
as a native to southwestern pennsylvania, it's hard to underscore how much natural gas is a part of the fabric of this community. i see this as a region where business leaders, legislators, regulators and communities work together to protect our environment and keep our economy vibrant as well. while parts of the country mandate to move away from natural gas more quickly than others, for example, the west coast, peoples is located in a geography where i would expect natural gas to remain an essential part of the energy picture for generations to come.
taking a look at the slide here, i'd like to make a few points that further the discussion on the sustainability of natural gas. i won't make every point on the slide as you can read those on your own, but i believe natural gas will remain a vital part of the nation's long-term energy solution, as natural gas remains an affordable, abundant, safe and reliable solution to our energy needs.
united states is natural gas rich and has supply to fulfill the country's energy needs for the next century. as chris mentioned, eliminating the direct use of natural gas in homes and in businesses would be an expensive and impractical way to address greenhouse gas emissions. in fact, as the demand for natural gas has never been greater, it's estimated that one new customer connects their home to the natural gas distribution system every minute now providing service to 179 million americans or roughly half our country. conversions to alternatives are expensive and would result in an increase in households of nearly a $1,000 annually in their utility bills.
the reality is when you add up potential equipment conversion costs, higher operating costs, the impact of moving away from natural gas would be profound on every household. in addition to existing technologies, which have dramatically reduced emissions -- the emissions profile of the natural gas industry in recent years, there are opportunities for further improvements. for example, rng, renewable natural gas. this is a climate-neutral pipeline compatible, gas is still derived from biogenic or other renewable sources. the industry and our company are looking at opportunities to do more rng. today, as we said, peoples acquires over 1.5 billion cubic feet of renewable natural gas annually within its portfolio and we plan to do more.
in closing, i look forward to leading the peoples team and we believe we can do great things together as we look to continue to provide quality service to the communities that we serve.
with that, i'll hand the call back to you chris.
christopher franklin -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks, mike, and nice job. great to have you on the team. i would just leave you with one final thought on this topic before we move on, and that is, given our natural gas utility peoples, given its rate base growth that's positioned geographically and its access to gas among many other reasons, it should be thought of differently than many other gas ldcs across the country for regulatory reasons and everything else, and especially should be thought differently than natural gas utilities in core pacific regions or coastal -- some of these coastal communities.
all right. now let's take a look at the highlights for the quarter. we have invested already $607.6 million in infrastructure in the communities we serve during the first nine months of the year, of which $377 million was invested in our regulated water segment and $230.6 million was invested in our regulated natural gas segment. but still we want to point out that about $53 million was invested by peoples in the first quarter preclosing. so bottom line, we remain on track for record capital spending of $950 million in 2020.
now in the box, you also see that on a non-gaap basis, adjusted income per share decreased to $0.23 from $0.48 when compared to the same period last year. and dan is going to take you more detail on those financial results in just a moment. our municipal acquisition program remains strong with signed municipal transactions -- municipal agreements, i should say, totaling over $360 million in expected rate base and over 212,000 customers in customer equivalents.
we just recently closed the water and wastewater acquisition of rockwell utilities that's in illinois and announced the signing of lower makefield in bucks county, pennsylvania which was a $53 million acquisition with 11,000 wastewater customers. finally, in the last box, we're excited to point out that our latest esg report that was just published just a few weeks ago, and i'd encourage you take a look at it, you'll find it through our website, it's our new esg site, really, really strong esg, i would say.
and with that let's use that as a segue to the next slide here and talk a little bit about esg. sustainability has always been a core part of our corporate culture and it's been a personal priority of mine as well. since i became ceo in 2015, we've really made an esg priority. we started with board refreshment, our board is -- nine members. about third of those or exactly one-third of those are women and another two members are black. our diversity helps to facilitate better discussions and better outcomes, and i firmly believe that. as i mentioned, we've been ramping up our esg communications since last february. and even before the peoples transaction, our esg team published the first esg tear-sheet and dramatically enhanced our 2021 proxy last spring. since then, to ensure we provide transparent and comprehensive reporting on our work, we hired a full-time in-house esg manager. most recently, we issued a new and more detailed esg report, as i just mentioned, and a digital microsite format, really easy to navigate. our esg website will be the home of all of our future-related news and disclosures.
now on the water side, we made some important announcements earlier this year and we've talked about these. we said that by 2022, 60% of our energy will be sourced from renewable sources. we also said that we believe we stand-alone as a multistate water utility in our commitment to test every source of water in our eight states and treat any source that detects pfas above 13 parts per trillion. if you recall that the federal health advisory level is at 70 parts per trillion, so this is a sizable improvement from what the federal government provides us with their guideline. this is really a significant commitment.
now on the natural gas side, as i mentioned, in the first quarter of 2021, we'll announce an aggressive but achievable set of targets for emissions reduction. we want to do this before we reach the one-year mark of ownership, so looking at probably january timeframe. remember, we have significant pipe to replace at peoples and each length of pipe that we tighten up quantifiably reduces methane emissions. we play to report those reductions in our esg reports in the future. each mile of pipe replaced is expected to reduce fugitive methane emissions by the equivalent of 50 metric tons per year of co2. this is the same is taken [phonetic] 11 cars a year off the road for every mile of pipe. it's pretty important. let's not forget that while we -- while this effort reduces methane emissions, the pipe replacement program also contributes about 8% to 10% rate base growth annually over the 15 years.
and so with that, let me pass it over to dan for the financial results.
daniel schuller -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
thank you, chris. good morning, everyone. reviewing the financials for the quarter, we ended the third quarter with revenue of $348.6 million, up $105 million from $243.6 million last year. the natural gas business contributed $92.1 million of this revenue growth, while the remainder was the result of rate increases, volume and growth in the regulated water segment. we're also reporting adjusted revenue of $352.7 million, which excludes approximately $4.1 million of rate credits issued to water utility customers which were as a condition of the pennsylvania puc approval of the peoples acquisition.
o&m increased to $136.2 million, up from $82 million in the third quarter of last year. this was primarily a result of the addition of the natural gas operations and maintenance expenses, which we'll discuss further when we show the o&m waterfall.
net income was down year-over-year from $88.5 million to $55.7 million and gaap eps was down from $0.38 to $0.22. we're again providing adjusted income and adjusted income per share lines, which adjust for the transaction-related water rate credits that i mentioned. adjusted income was down $27 million to $58.6 million and adjusted income per share was down from $0.48 to $0.23. this result aligns with the adjusted income per share guidance of $1.53 to $1.58 for the full year.
next we'll discuss the details using the following waterfall slides, starting with revenue. as we walk through the $105 million revenue increase for the third quarter, you'll notice that the revenue related to our natural gas segment was the main driver, adding $92.1 million. increased volume, growth from our regulated water segment, rates and surcharges and other provided an additional $17 million toward the revenue increase which was offset by the $4.1 million of rate credits issued to water utility customers in the third quarter. the $3.9 million growth component is primarily due to the acquisition of wastewater systems. in the fourth quarter, we'll provide nearly $19 million of rate credits to natural gas customers to fully satisfy the rate concessions included in the pennsylvania regulatory approval.
given the nearly $10 million in incremental revenue from volume, let's discuss our third quarter water consumption on the next slide. we experienced a material overall positive impact due to volume during the third quarter. despite covid, year-over-year water usage was up 5.5%. with many customers working from home and favorable weather, residential usage was again very strong up over 10%, which offsets declines in most of our other segments. although commercial continued to be down, it rebounded significantly from the second quarter when you will recall that we were down about 16% versus last year.
as we've discussed previously, given the shutoff moratoria that states enacted when covid-19 emerged in march, we continue to closely monitor incremental increases in our bad debt expense and the timing of when these moratoria will be lifted. as you can see on the right, all of our states have lifted their moratoria with the exception of pennsylvania, where this is expected to occur in the next few days and new jersey where the more moratoria should be lifted in march of 2021.
as moratoria are lifted, we resume our regular delinquency procedures. during the quarter, we increased our bad debt reserves by $6.8 million across water and gas and identified potential regulatory asset filings for much of this as we expect to be able to seek recovery of covid-related increases in bad debt in several of our key states.
with that, let's move to the o&m waterfall. operations and maintenance expenses were $136.2 million for the third quarter compared to $82 million in the third quarter of 2019. the main driver was the $62.2 million addition of peoples' o&m. other contributing drivers including covid-related expenses for our water segment, including covid-related employee costs, growth and normal employee-related costs which were offset by other costs and the impact of last year's peoples acquisition-related expenses. the other bar that you see in the middle of page, includes overhead savings, a reduction in insurance reserves and a combination of beneficial one-time items this year and detrimental one-time items last year. for our regulated water segment, third quarter o&m expenses decreased 2.2% relative to last year.
next, we'll spend some time on the earnings per share waterfall. again, this presentation bridges between gaap and adjusted figures for both 2019 and 2020. gaap eps in the third quarter of 2019 was $0.38, but adding back the almost $0.10 from the dilutive effect of the equity offering and the peoples related transaction costs, brought us to $0.48 per share on an adjusted income basis for q3 last year. continuing on, volume, expenses, regulated water segment rates and surcharges and growth, together contributed almost $0.07 which were offset by $0.23 from the peoples contribution along with $0.086 from other items, such as increased depreciation, amortization and interest and decreased aqua pennsylvania repair benefit relative to last year, that then results in the $0.23 for the adjusted income per share for the third quarter of 2020.
now remember the $0.23 impact of peoples here includes the dilution from the share issuance, the financial performance of the gas business in this low usage quarter and other one-time impacts. finally, the decrease of $0.011 due to water rate credits utility customers in the third quarter brings us to gaap eps of $0.22 for q3 2020. as i mentioned earlier, the fourth quarter of 2020 will include additional rate credits of approximately $19 million to be issued to the natural gas utility customers.
let's look at rate activity on the next slide. in 2020 so far, we've completed rate cases or surcharges for our regulated water segment in illinois, indiana, north carolina, ohio, virginia and pennsylvania, totaling annualized revenue of $21 million. in our regulated natural gas segment, we completed surcharge filings in kentucky and pennsylvania with total annualized revenue of $1 million. in the coming months, we expect to receive new base rates or surcharges in new jersey, virginia and indiana for our regulated water segment. at this point in the year, we do not have any pending base rates or surcharges for our regulated natural gas segment.
our relatively limited rate-related activity remains on track despite covid and we continue to have regular virtual interactions with our regulators and our counterparties. as we announced in august, we filed a petition with the pennsylvania puc requesting accounting treatment for the approximately $380 million catch-up deduction for the tax repair eligible capital invested prior to essential's ownership of peoples.
proceeding has been assigned to an administrative law judge per the normal process and we're in the discovery phase of the proceeding. if needed, evidentiary hearings are scheduled at the end of january.
at this point, i'd like to turn the call back over to chris for an update on our municipal acquisition initiative.
christopher franklin -- chairman and chief executive officer
all right, dan. thanks. many of you are familiar with this slide. you've seen it before, which represents our acquisitions for the regulated water segment. so far this year, we've closed the campbell water system in ohio, east norriton, wastewater system in pennsylvania and rockwell utilities in illinois. we continue to advance the new garden, commons water and delcora transactions. and as i mentioned, we recently announced a signed agreement with lower makefield in bucks county, pennsylvania to acquire their wastewater assets for $53 million or about 11,000 customers. these signed agreements are expected to generate about $18 million of incremental annual earnings. we expect to execute asset purchase agreements on probably two or three other transactions by the end of the year, totaling over 10,000 edus or equivalent dwelling units and over $70 million of purchase price. so we're doing really well this year with our water-wastewater acquisitions.
i mentioned the status of the core earlier in the call. and so, i was going to suggest that i take questions in the -- in a moment rather than reiterate again but i wish we'd reiterate our confidence that we'll have a valid contract and then we'll close the transaction in early 2021.
now in addition to the signed municipal acquisitions that we just mentioned, we have a healthy pipeline of potential municipal deals. our pipeline includes acquisitions where opportunities are active, right. we have our active discussions with potential sellers. and as illustrated by the slide, we are actively pursuing acquisition opportunities totaling about 360,000 customers, so really strong pipeline at this point over our multiple states.
now before we wrap up our discussion on the strategy piece here, i should mention that we were part of a joint venture that owned a raw water pipeline. it was built to deliver water to the marcellus shale region. the pipe was originally built to reduce the trucking activity associated with bringing wells -- water to frac wells and some of you may recall that, but the venture was not as successful as it was envisioned to be. and as a result, it was written down when i became ceo. and now in october, just last month, we sold our interest in that joint venture. so that is now behind us.
just to wrap up with guidance here. we are updating our 2020 guidance. we believe the company's current position will allow us to deliver at the top end of our adjusted income range of $1.53 to $1.58 per share on a pro forma 2020. the rest of our guidance remains unchanged, and we expect to announce new annual guidance early in 2021. we plan to provide another three years of guidance as we have done previously.
and with that, let me open the line for questions.
",2020-Q3,WTRG,0.84,0.14140000000000003,
1.0,,":
operator
thank you. [operator instructions] the first question we have today is from insoo kim from goldman sachs. your line is open.
insoo kim -- goldman sachs -- analyst
hey, thank you.
chris franklin -- chairman and chief executive officer
hey, insoo.
insoo kim -- goldman sachs -- analyst
hey, good morning. it does seem like ages ago when we met in of new york for the last analyst day last year.
chris franklin -- chairman and chief executive officer
it's while.
insoo kim -- goldman sachs -- analyst
it definitely feels like a while. my first question is regarding texas. i know texas for your water business is about with 6% of rate base or sale of the total water rate base. but could you just give a little bit more detail on the type of costs that were incurred through the past couple of weeks and the regulatory process of recovery and all of that.
chris franklin -- chairman and chief executive officer
sure. yes. i think from the ability to recover, our operations team really did an exemplary job. and it was across the platform. we had people from our purchasing group, looking at where you can purse fuel and generators moving, we had the pallets of bottle water communities and equipment all brought in and teams brought in as well. so i thought the response was exemplary, given the circumstances of the closure of roads and the ice conditions and everything else. so feel very, very confident that we did a nice job there. now in terms of cost, i would not call the cost material costs. these things we did to recover will capture. we always do -- we're used to capturing these costs as a result of summer storms, typically hurricanes and others. so this is not unusual for us. and in terms of -- we shut down our delinquency on our customers in texas for a while so that they weren't getting phone calls about late bills, we'll turn that back on soon. we wouldn't expect a major impact there either. and so i don't expect there to be a material impact, but let me pass to dan here to get his opinion as well.
dan schuller -- chief financial officer
yes. i think, chris, you're right on. and then just to give you a sense of it, think of texas has about $4.5 million a month in revenue. so if we lose a few days there because customers are using less water, it's just not a material impact on the overall essential business. and as you started out and chris added, we are aggregating these costs, be they non-capitalized repair costs or overtime expenses or bottled water. and we'll look to recover them just like we have for hurricanes and so forth in the past.
chris franklin -- chairman and chief executive officer
just one last thing to add to that. the impact really wasn't about our system not being winterized all. it was really about lack of power. and so when the lines went down the cold snap, we did have some main breaks, but we didn't have major pump houses or wells go down.
dan schuller -- chief financial officer
yes. and maybe one thing to add to that, chris, too, as we think about powering those warehouses and such. and so we've got contracted power in place with is one of the major players for wholesale power that covers the majority of our systems in texas and then other systems just get power from local cooper authorities, but all under regulated rates. so when you see things on the news with very high electric bills, we've been insulated from those peak-type electric prices.
insoo kim -- goldman sachs -- analyst
got it. and if you're saying the costs weren't that material, i guess when we think about the 2021 guidance and the midpoint of that, you feel still able to weather this and meet that guidance?
chris franklin -- chairman and chief executive officer
that's correct.
dan schuller -- chief financial officer
yes.
insoo kim -- goldman sachs -- analyst
got it. just one more broader question then sticking to texas. just given -- i acknowledge, i think a lot of the issues that happened were because of the electrical outages. but do you think that out of all of this, does it present to you from your standpoint, an increased capex opportunity in this state or potentially just an increased focus on expanding our footprint there?
chris franklin -- chairman and chief executive officer
well, i think there's a key consideration. only the question when you have a series of community well systems throughout a state like we do in texas, north carolina, even virginia. the question is how many standby generators do you purchase and keep it the ready? we typically regionalize those, and then we move them to storm zones and position them well before storms and that sort of thing. but we don't have one per system. and i'm not sure that that's the prescription here either. but i think it's safe to say that we'll want to go and get more generators, there was that natural rub between a regulator saying, how much you're really going to spend for a generator that sits there, a huge percentage of its time and is never used. the regional approach seems like a good approach. but you have an event like this, you could certainly make an argument that we should own more generators. and so i think there are capital opportunities there, and we'll pursue those. and then the ongoing capital that we were spending even prior to the storm is i put in escada category, which is our ability to operate or sense when a well house is down out of power. where, in some cases that you remotely control it. but that was already work in progress. and so that will be capital that we'll be spending in addition.
insoo kim -- goldman sachs -- analyst
got it. thank you so much.
chris franklin -- chairman and chief executive officer
you bet.
operator
and next, we'll go to -- sorry, just one moment. and next, we'll go to ryan connors from boenning and scattergood. your line is open.
chris franklin -- chairman and chief executive officer
hey, ryan.
ryan connors -- boenning & scattergood -- analyst
good morning. thanks for taking my questions. i hadn't intended to ask about texas, but since you're on the topic, just bigger picture, there's a lot of talk about how this situation there is sort of indicative of a broader problem with the grid in terms of reliability, more renewables being less reliable and so forth. so, if you look at your states that are material to the earnings stream, do you have any other vulnerability any other states where something like that could happen that there might be an impact?
chris franklin -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes. it's a good question. i'm going to say, not that i'm aware of today. we're largely in pjm up here, not in ercot. but i think the -- if you think about this storm as a never before, then you say what else could happen, and it's a good time to revisit these things and say, ok, one of the once in 100 years or 500 year issues that we should be thinking about and be prepared for. but -- and that's my initial thoughts. dan, do you have something to add to that?
dan schuller -- chief financial officer
yes. and i think, ryan, ercot is a different market, right? it's an energy market. i believe tier thought is that when power was needed, someone would show up to deliver that power, but they didn't really regulate those power producers and the power producers who didn't have to weatherize or winterize their equipment, that led to problems. most of the power producers in ercot, who don't have to hold firm capacity on pipelines in order to ensure their ability to generate power. so pjm is very different in that regard, but we've got to have that pipeline capacity in order to bid into the market. so we do think it is different. and as you know, ercot really doesn't have the interconnect to allow power in to any degree from outside of ercot. so when they have a problem there, unfortunately, it's it gets entrenched, if you will.
ryan connors -- boenning & scattergood -- analyst
got it. got it. okay. now on delcora, i wanted to just wonder if you could drill down for us a little bit, chris, on your comments. you mentioned that one of the issues was the rate stabilization fund, is one of the issues that we sort of raised in that adverse proposed ruling. can you just let us know, just conceptually, what exactly they took issue with and how you're getting them on board and more comfortable there on that particular issue?
chris franklin -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes. i'm going to oversimplify it just for the call, but i'm happy to go into it in more detail. but a lot of it has to do with putting the credit on the bill, on the customer's bill, right? so the easiest way to do these things is to say, the customer used so much in volume and the base facility charge. that comes to a total, then subtract out the dollars that would come in and offset it from the trust. and then you have a net total. that, to us, was the simplest way to do it. i think because the rate stabilization is not in the tariff, technically, there are some of the advocates who believe that it should not be on the bill. and i think we're willing to concede that at this point. the -- listen, there's a lot of ways to skin the cat. we happen to think that, that was the most efficient way to do it. but certainly, there's other ways to give those trust dollars back to the customers. and so we've now proposed to remove it from the bill. and i think we've addressed the issue. we'll see.
ryan connors -- boenning & scattergood -- analyst
okay. i'm glad you oversimplified it because that's -- it's not as complex as i can take down. now on the -- one thing -- the last thing on the puc, with that decision looming now, what's going on with that fifth seat there? i mean it seems to me -- i know you don't have any inside baseball on that necessarily than anyone else. but seems like that's coming up on a year since that seat was vacated. that seems like a longer time than usual. is that the case? and i guess what's driving that? i assume maybe covid and so forth. but any color there on that open seat?
chris franklin -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes. i mean, listen, i'm an observer like everybody else. but the governor did send a name over. he's in the same name over twice and the republican center, the governor is democrat in pennsylvania, the republican senate that has to approve the puc commissioners is public and so the senate has decided not to approve that individual twice now. and so, it's a bit of a stalemate. and as you know, from -- ryan, i know how close you watch the commission here in pennsylvania; there have been plenty of votes that have been a two-two vote. and so it's a difficult situation. so i think and i know it's on the mind of the governor. and i also know that commissioner sweet, his seat is coming up in the next month here as well. so now we'll have potentially two seats. i haven't heard formally whether commissioner sweet is staying or whether he will retire. but we'll have to see how that develops. but then you have two names that need to come over to the senate. so i'd assume in all of that, ryan, there will be a deal between the republican senate and democratic governor.
ryan connors -- boenning & scattergood -- analyst
okay. yeah, we'll watch that one. and then lastly, if i could sneak one more in, dan. this is, i guess, for you more. but if you could help us gas novices out a little bit. obviously, you had purchased gas costs really ramped in the fourth quarter. i assume based on the weather, that's going to be another pretty big sequential ramp there. you've given the annual guidance, but can you help us out on the seasonality on that line, how to think about that as we move into the first quarter? it just seems like it really jumps all over the place.
dan schuller -- chief financial officer
yeah. i think for now, what we probably need to do is, kind of, point you back to what we had shown before in terms of the usage percentages, and we showed those, we showed those again at the analyst day, what's potentially used in each quarter and then the net income for the quarters, you go to the analyst day presentation, page 41, you'll see what we showed is really an approximate breakdown by quarters, and of course, these are ranges because there is that seasonality in gas usage and also to some degree on water usage. but at least it gives you a guide to help quarterize. so i think as i said at the analyst day too, we have the ability to -- over time, as we start to see the way this manifests itself in the financials, we'll all be able to refine what that quarterly mix of net income should look like. that slide that i mentioned, it's actually in the appendix for today's presentation as well.
ryan connors -- boenning & scattergood -- analyst
okay, good. thanks again guys.
dan schuller -- chief financial officer
yeah. thanks, ryan. take care.
operator
and next, we'll go to durgesh chopra from evercore isi. your line is open.
durgesh chopra -- evercore isi -- analyst
hey guys.
dan schuller -- chief financial officer
hey, good morning.
durgesh chopra -- evercore isi -- analyst
hey, good morning guys. thanks for taking my question. just one quick one. on the repair tax catch up filing, can you just remind us what was the original plan for pennsylvania rate base falling? was it late in this year?
dan schuller -- chief financial officer
yeah. so i guess, you're asking about the repair tax, the people's repair tax or the aqua pennsylvania rate case?
durgesh chopra -- evercore isi -- analyst
i'm sorry. so you mentioned -- yeah, i'm mixing, i guess that you -- you mentioned that the...
dan schuller -- chief financial officer
yeah, yeah. let me take you there. so that's really the catch-up deduction on the repair. and for peoples, for the png subsidiary, what we had originally proposed there was a splitting of that catch-up deduction with some of that going to the customer, with some of that coming to the shareholder. but what the piece to the shareholder would have done is it effectively would have just kept us out of rates longer. it was about adding to a stay out period, it wasn't ever about incremental earnings. so the outcome here, the conversations that we've had with the statutory advocates is really leading to a situation where a 100% of that catch-up deduction would go to the customers and over a five-year time period. and what that means is we would be backing for rates on a more normal cadence. so rather than stay out because we had some of that catch up, we would just come in sooner than that. but think about it as no impact on the guidance earnings because the guidance earnings are the 2021, 2022, 2023 and really shouldn't be any impact beyond there because we'll have new rates at some point.
durgesh chopra -- evercore isi -- analyst
understood, and thanks for clarifying that, and yes, i did have a green piece, because i was mixing the water rate case with that. so, thank you for clarifying that, essentially -- basically, you have the customer credit and on the gas side, you'll be going in for more regular rate increases. that's sort of -- that's the end result that it's approved.
dan schuller -- chief financial officer
yeah, we'll just go in sooner than we would have otherwise.
durgesh chopra -- evercore isi -- analyst
perfect. and then one last one real quick. any color on timing of the equity in the plan, the incremental equity will -- is this sort of more predicated on as you announce deals? or do you have a particular time plane within the next few years when you plan to do this?
dan schuller -- chief financial officer
yes. what we said on the last call is really we'd give more specificity there as we get closer to those issuances and we're not really at a point where we can do that today. as you think about that forward sale that we did last august, we would look to use that equity at the time that we do the delcora transaction. so we draw that down with a little bit of cushion before the transaction itself. and then on further issuances, we'll give you more details as things get closer.
durgesh chopra -- evercore isi -- analyst
all right. thanks, guys. much appreciate the update today.
dan schuller -- chief financial officer
thanks, durgesh. take care.

and next, we'll go to travis miller from morningstar. your line is open.
travis miller -- morningstar -- analyst
good morning.
dan schuller -- chief financial officer
hey, travis
chris franklin -- chairman and chief executive officer
hi, travis.
travis miller -- morningstar -- analyst
if i could, i wanted to go back to the texas thing and i think a little higher level, get your thoughts here. and it seems like whatever utility industry has some kind of big headline issues and that happens, it leads to industrywide policy changes and developments. and i was wondering if you kind of put a crystal ball here on and look into it, what type of water-related policy changes do you think might take place either in texas or even more broadly across the water industry?
chris franklin -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes. i would think that one of the outcomes is sort of, what i alluded to a little bit a bit ago, which is additional redundancy on power. what that -- what form that takes probably varies by company. as i mentioned, we have a system of small community wells across texas, where that's how we serve our customers in a large part, we have one surface treatment plant, but when you think about that versus the city of houston versus austin and the challenges that larger systems have in-place redundancy. and then as you think about pump stations throughout and for wastewater as well, i would think that power redundancy is going to be a big component. and that can be a cost item of a pretty good-sized cost item depending on what people have in place today. as you know, the challenges around winter weather just didn't appear to be as large of a risk in areas like texas as they did in the north where we've hardened ourselves to that kind of weather before. dan, you have any add to add that?
dan schuller -- chief financial officer
no, i think you're right on there, chris.
chris franklin -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes.
travis miller -- morningstar -- analyst
okay. and then on the gas side of it, kind of a similar thing. it appeared that the gas distribution utilities down there did quite a good job in terms of reliability and despite the pricing spikes, but pretty good on the reliability. do you think this perhaps changes some of the conversation that's been going on in terms of electrification of heating and maybe moves gas up a little bit in public perception.
dan schuller -- chief financial officer
well, certainly, what we saw there in texas, where about 17%, 18% of the power comes from wind power. when that wind power goes down, you need generation to come in to fill that gap and natural gas stepped in to fill that gap. but given that natural gas production facilities are reliant on power as well, when rolling blackouts started, they were impacted servicers couldn't get out to service wells, especially to deal with handling the produced water, so things started to freeze up. and that's what, kind of, created the issue for the natural gas companies. they too need to -- if we're going to -- if we're going to continue to have fairly dramatic weather, winterization matters for them, too. and of course, if you think about gas supplies like in the marcellus or the utica, these -- the whole natural gas supply chain is pretty well winterized to make sure that it's protected from those events.
chris franklin -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes. and when you think about conversions, we just don't see them in the areas where we serve conversions from natural gas to electric for heating. we just don't see it. i would assume that we wouldn't see it further here. fortunately, many of the customers, most of the customers we serve still on top of the marcellus shale region. so we're unique in that the local gas is right there. and obviously, we're heartened for winter time. winters have always been cold in pittsburgh and even in some areas of kentucky, west virginia, we serve as well. so i think that we're well-positioned not only to hold our customers but developers continue to put natural gas in new developments in the regions where we serve. so i don't see any movement in the areas we serve away from natural gas to electric.
dan schuller -- chief financial officer
absolutely, chris. in cold regions, there's no more efficient heating source than direct-fire natural gas.
travis miller -- morningstar -- analyst
sure. i appreciate that. thank you very much.

and next, we'll go to ryan greenwald from bank of america. your line is open.
ryan greenwald -- bank of america -- analyst
good morning guys.
dan schuller -- chief financial officer
hey ryan.
chris franklin -- chairman and chief executive officer
hey ryan.
ryan greenwald -- bank of america -- analyst
so, to clarify on the commentary around peoples gas and the catch-up component, under the terms of the settlement, you'd expect to file in 2023 for new rates in 2024?
dan schuller -- chief financial officer
i think about it. in that timeframe, i mean you'll see -- look for the settlement agreement when that comes out on march 11th, and it will give clarity around these things.
ryan greenwald -- bank of america -- analyst
got it. and then can you guys just kind of help frame how you're thinking about the covid impacts in 2021 here? and then maybe looking out a bit further, any thoughts around more structural shifts in low demand among classes and sustainability cost cuts?
chris franklin -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes. let me start and i'll kick it over to dan. first of all, like most utilities and probably most companies, we remain with the majority of our employees coming to work every day, servicing natural gas and water and wastewater customers. so, the majority of our people have never stopped working in the field. our two primary offices in pittsburgh, and in the philadelphia area, both remain largely skeleton crews. but we see a return to a rotation of work. hopefully coming in the next month or so, where we could get a third of our employees in a given time and rotate them through. so, i think from an employment standpoint, we're in pretty good place. now, our bad debt expense continues to be one that we're working through here. we obviously have receivables aging at a level we've not seen before. having said that, in most areas where we do business, we do have the ability to take a reg asset and see if we can get some recovery of those. and i do believe that once we're able, in every case, to get back to full collections mode, we will get payment from those who can afford to pay and will help provide help to those who can't. and i -- given the fact that we reserve on our accounts -- accounts receivables, i wouldn't expect to see a major issue there because that expense has already been taken as we go.
we also continue to collect any additional costs. for example, we have some retrofitting going on in our offices. so, we continue to collect those costs and aggregate those. i would not consider those to be material at this point. but nevertheless, they're -- as we prepare to bring people back into the office, we want to capture those costs. and dan, why don't you kick in from here?
dan schuller -- chief financial officer
yes. thanks chris. and ryan, i guess, as you think about where the consumption occurs and will we continue to see more people working from home and higher consumption there, i think, marginally, but i think lots are ready to return to work and sort of get back to normal and with that, you'll see that residential consumption will come down a little bit more toward normal. and commercial consumption will naturally pick up as people are in the business, in the workplace and using local businesses and such, you are our customers in that commercial category. so, i think this -- i think we kind of come back to a more normal picture of where the consumption occurs. if it's when that is, is first half of the year by, i think second half of the year, we start to see some return to normalcy once vaccinations are more widespread.
chris franklin -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes, what i'll add to that i'm involved with the large employers here in the philadelphia region and an anecdotally as we get together, we expect that probably 80% of employees will be back to their normal schedule, 20% will not. and that could be a rotational aspect of that 20%, but they do expect to see 80% back in the office.
ryan greenwald -- bank of america -- analyst
thanks chris. i'll leave it there. thanks guys.

[operator instructions] next, we'll go to jonathan reeder from wells fargo. your line is open.
dan schuller -- chief financial officer
hey jonathan.
chris franklin -- chairman and chief executive officer
hey jonathan.
jonathan reeder -- wells fargo -- analyst
how are you guys doing? a couple of clean up questions perhaps. so, how should we view the benefits to wtrg of the repairs tax settlement? or what was your motivation for reaching, if it doesn't help push out the timing of the next rate case as you guys proposed?
chris franklin -- chairman and chief executive officer
well, i think about it in this term, jonathan. listen, we are still in the midst of covid. regulators are doing their job and trying to hold utility costs down. and so it's in that atmosphere that we're in right now. and so i think as a pennsylvania regulator, they're thinking about what can come to the customer and not the shareholder at this point. i think that's happening across the country. and so i just put that as a backdrop, i mean, there's a whole lot of discussions that occurred in the context of that. as dan said, we can't talk a lot about a settlement that is not fully public or inked yet, i should say, approved yet by the alj and the puc. but i mean, think about it in that context.
jonathan reeder -- wells fargo -- analyst
okay. that makes sense. maybe a bit of a goodwill gesture though. so are you still trying to reach a settlement with delaware county on the delcora deal? or is that ship sale at this point?
chris franklin -- chairman and chief executive officer
it's a great question. i would love a settlement with delaware county. i would love a settlement with delaware county. i think they are spending millions -- millions of dollars of taxpayer money to fight a battle that ultimately, i don't believe that they can win. and so if there was a way to settle this, then i would like that. we -- i think now probably everybody is focused on the next couple of weeks to see what pennsylvania public utility commission does. so let's see how that decision comes out, and maybe there's an opportunity to get back to the table. but i'll speak for the essential team, we'd love to see a settlement.
jonathan reeder -- wells fargo -- analyst
okay. i could kind of segue into that with the papuc, do they have the option to extend the march 26th statutory deadline in order to, say, open the record and consider new evidence? or what exactly are the rules around their ability to consider these more recent developments with the alj concerns?
chris franklin -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes, yes. so there are several -- and kim joyce has outlined these. we had our board meetings the last two days. and so this is widely discussed inside. the commission has several options. one, obviously, is an approval. and remember, there's four commissioners. two would be, i'll call it, a stale mate, a 2-2 vote, which then it would say. three would be a denial. and four would be something like a remand where the commission could say,"" aqua essential has done more work on the issues raised by the alj. alj, you should reconsider the work and the evidence and sit back to the alj, and then the alj would send it back up to the commission again, which i think is a possibility as well. so those are probably the more likely options that the puc has in front of them.
jonathan reeder -- wells fargo -- analyst
okay. so if it is 2-2 is like what's the path for, then it does -- it's not approved, but it's not denied or?
chris franklin -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes. it could just sit for a while until the commission as another member or one of the members changes their mind. i am hopeful that, that's not the case, jonathan, but we'll see in the next couple of weeks.
jonathan reeder -- wells fargo -- analyst

good day, everyone, and welcome to the essential utilities, incorporated full year 2020 earnings call. today's call is being recorded. at this time, i would like to turn the conference over to brian dingerdissen. please go ahead, sir.
brian dingerdissen -- vice president, chief of staff & head of investor relations
thank you, christy. good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for essential utilities 2020 full year earnings call. i'm brian dingerdissen, vice president, chief of staff and head of investor relations. if you did not receive a copy of the press release, you can find it by visiting the investor relations section of our website. the slides that we will be referencing and the webcast of this event can also be found on our website. here is our forward-looking statement. as a reminder, some of the matters discussed during this call may include forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause the actual results to be materially different from any future results expressed or implied such forward-looking statements. please refer to our most recent 10-q, 10-k and other sec filings for a description of such risks and uncertainties. during the course of this call, reference may be made to certain non-gaap financial measures. a reconciliation of these non-gaap to gaap financial measures is included at the end of the presentation and also in the investor relations section of our website. after the formal presentation, we will open the call for questions.
here's our agenda for the call today. we'll start with chris franklin, our chairman and ceo, who will provide a company update on our successes in 2020, including our municipal acquisition program. next, dan schuller, our cfo, will discuss our fourth quarter and full year financial results. chris will then conclude the presentation with a review of our guidance. at the conclusion, we will open the call for questions. with that, i would like to turn the call over to chris franklin. thanks, brian, and good morning, everyone. thanks for joining us today. let me start with the discussion of the impact of this bitter-cold winter weather that so many of us experienced in february. and in terms of the impact on our operation, it's really been a tale of two cities. and start in texas. first, our hearts go out to those who were impacted and were living it for days without electric and water service, some frigid temperatures, particularly last week. water systems and wastewater systems are highly dependent on power to operate our pumps and our plants. so when the power went out in texas, many of our community well systems went down as well. in fact, at the peak of the winter weather, we had approximately two-thirds of our texas customers impacted, which is largely due to those rolling blackouts we heard or brownouts. as we -- as the power went down, and then we've restored and then we have to go back out again once the rolling ground now went through. we quickly activated our incident command system to marshal the necessary resources to bring service back to our customers as quickly as possible. we brought in teams from our other state operations to supplement the texas workforce. and they also brought with them supplies like bottle water, repair materials and equipment to supplement what we had in texas. we always think about it. but as our employees, were working to restore service to our customers they themselves were dealing with personal hardships resulting from the storm too. i'd like to thank those dedicated employees and contractors that worked around the clock to restore service to customers. while we still have some systems under boiled water advisories in texas, at this point, i'm proud to say that, we have nearly all service restored, only one system left impacted and we're working as quickly as we can to restore there as well. just to remind you that, we don't have natural gas customers in texas. and so there were no financial or operational impacts to our natural gas customers, which are in pennsylvania, kentucky and west virginia. now, i mentioned the impact of the weather was a tale of two cities. and despite the extreme cold temperatures here in the mid-atlantic, where the majority of our operations are, we had very good news this winter, particularly in pennsylvania, where we have been replacing water mains for nearly 30 years now. we really saw the benefit of that investment over the last few weeks and last few months even. it's impressive to see that even during a difficult winter we're seeing fairly low numbers of main breaks. as a result, we have fewer service disruptions and less overtime than we had in previous years. as you can see by the chart on the right here, there is real benefit to investing in infrastructure. all right. let's talk about some of the 2020 highlights. we invested about $900 million in infrastructure in the communities we serve during 2020, of which $53.5 million was invested by peoples in the first quarter before we own the company. this is once again a record amount of capital spending for our company. on a non-gaap basis, adjusted income per share was $1.58 for the year, up 7.5%. dan will take you through more details around that when we present the financial results. our municipal acquisition strategy remains strong with 6 signed municipal agreements pending closing, totaling $438 million in purchase price. and finally coupled with organic growth, the company increased its water and wastewater customer base by 2% and increased its rate base by 9.6%, ending the year with nearly 1.8 million customers and 8 billion in rate base across our regulated segments, very good year. all right. on the next slide here, you can see a more comprehensive summary of the execution of our 2020 objectives. these were the 3 primary themes we set for 2020. we've talked with you before about this. you saw in our investor event. and despite the challenges of 2020, we still delivered on all 3 of these objectives in one of the most historic years of our company. throughout the year, we adapted our new combined water and gas business to overcome the effects of a pandemic. and through the dedication and resiliency of our people, we remain focused on the mission of providing essential natural resources to our customers. as i mentioned, our commitment to infrastructure improvement drove us to executing a record investment, ensuring that our customers had safe and reliable service. now as we approach our 1-year anniversary of the closing of the peoples transaction, i'm pleased to report that we have successfully integrated our employees and customers and we will continue to work to adopt the best practices from both utilities across the platform. i feel confident that our team's integration experience and expertise will prove invaluable as we continue to acquire water utilities across our footprint and beyond. and here's a reminder of the municipal acquisitions we closed in 2020 for our regulated water segment. the 6 acquisitions include campbell water system. you've seen that one before in ohio; east norriton wastewater system in pennsylvania; rockwell utilities, that's water and wastewater in illinois; new garden, that's wastewater in pennsylvania; and a small one in north carolina called doug wood knowles. together, these acquisitions added over 12,000 customers and nearly $63 million in rate base. combined with organic growth, the company increased its customer base by over 20,500 customers in 2020. here on this slide, we updated it since our presentation at the guidance event, you can see that we now have 6 municipal acquisitions that have been signed and are pending closing. the addition of willistown township in pennsylvania, which we announced just last month, along with the other transaction will add close to 227,000 customers or customer equivalents when closed. it's important to think about this. based on the approximate rate base of $438 million, these signed agreements are expected to generate about $22 million of incremental annual income when they're fully earning. and these are great examples of our acquisition strategy at work, and we look forward to serving these communities and having them join the essential family. now delcora is never far from our minds, and i'm sure not from yours, when you think about aqua and essential. let's bring you up to date. you'll recall that we received a very favorable ruling in late december from the pennsylvania common please court judge in a lawsuit with delaware county. and subsequently, we county appealed that decision and in january, the puc administrative law judge recommended that the transaction will be denied for three reasons, right? the first reason was, we had some outstanding municipal interveners. second reason was, they felt that we didn't include a rate stabilization plan in our application. and the third one was the ongoing litigation with the county. so, since the alj issued the recommendation, we have made significant progress in trying to remedy these situations, these issues. and several municipal interveners have already withdrawn from the process. we've been in constructive conversations with the remaining municipal interveners. and we are hopeful and optimistic that they will also withdraw before the pennsylvania public utility commission rules on the case. we've also taken measures to address the argument, that we don't have a rate stabilization plan. and we feel good about the progress on that issue as well. now, pennsylvania puc is expected to render their decision at one of the two regularly scheduled public meetings in march. so we'll stay tuned. with that, dan, i'll turn it over to you.
dan schuller -- chief financial officer
thanks, chris, and good morning, everyone. before we go to the full year, let's start by taking a few minutes to review the fourth quarter highlights. we had revenues of $474 million, up $248 million from $226 million last year. the natural gas business contributed $240.6 million of that revenue increase. this figure includes the impact of $18.9 million in rate credits provided to natural gas utility customers as a condition of the pennsylvania puc approval of the peoples acquisition. and it also includes $92.8 million in purchased gas costs incurred in the quarter. o&m increased to $157.2 million, up from $85.3 million in the fourth quarter of last year. again, this was primarily a result of the addition of natural gas operations and maintenance expenses of $72.6 million. net income increased from $64.2 million to $102.7 million. and gaap eps was up from $0.28 to $0.40 as compared to the fourth quarter last year. adjusted income was up from $61.4 million to $116.2 million. and adjusted income per share increased from $0.34 to $0.46.
next, let's discuss the full year financial highlights. as chris noted earlier, 2020 was a very strong year, one we achieved or overachieved our financial objectives in light of the pandemic. we ended the year with over $1.46 billion in revenue, up 64.4% from $889.7 million last year. the natural gas business contributed approximately $521 million of this revenue growth. adjusted revenue for the year was $1.49 billion, which excludes approximately $23 million of rate credits issued to water and natural gas utility customers, as a condition of the pennsylvania puc approval of the peoples acquisition. o&m increased by 58.7% from $333.1 million to $528.6 million. this was primarily a result of the addition of the natural gas operations and maintenance expenses. we'll discuss that further, when we show the o&m waterfall. net income was up 26.9% year-over-year, from $224.5 million to $284.8 million. and gaap eps increased by 7.7% to $1.12. after adjusting for transaction-related expenses, rate credits issued to utility customers and adding the pro forma adjustment for the normalized first quarter gas results. adjusted income was up from $139.6 million -- sorry, it was up $139.6 million or 53%. and adjusted income per share was up 7.5% from $1.47 to $1.58, the top end of our $1.53 to $1.58 guidance range. as we noted in our guidance call, strong water usage contributed incremental earnings in 2020. it got us think about a normalized $1.56 or so, as a baseline for future earnings growth. next, let's walk through the details in the following waterfall slides, starting with revenue.
in 2020, revenues increased $573 million or 64.4% on a gaap basis, of which $520.9 million was related to our natural gas segment. this figure includes $165.7 million of gas costs and the impact of $18.9 million of rate credits to those natural gas customers. rates and surcharges, increased volume and growth from our regulated water segment provided an additional $59.8 million toward the revenue increase, which was then offset by $4.1 million of rate credits issued to the water utility customers. the $15.7 million increase due to volume reflects both water consumption and wastewater volumes. let's review water consumption on the next slide. we've been talking about consumption since covid started because, frankly, we didn't know exactly what to expect when we went into the situation last march. in the fourth quarter, overall usage was down 0.9%, however, we continue to see strong residential usage, which was up 2.7%, offsetting the declines in the other customer classes. as we review 2020 versus 2019 and consider the impact of covid-19 on our business, for the full year, we saw that residential water consumption increased close to 6% with more people working from home and with favorable weather. this increase more than offset the declines in the commercial and industrial customer classes, both declining about 6% versus prior year. so, overall, for the year, usage was up 0.8%.
next, let's talk a little about weather and gas usage for the peoples business. as a reminder, a heating degree day is a measurement designed to quantify the demand for energy needed to heat a building. it's a number of degrees that a day's average temperature is below 65 degrees fahrenheit. as you can see on the chart on the left, 2020 started out relatively warm with below normal heating degree days in january and february. the chart on the right shows how peoples residential gas consumption in pennsylvania was distributed throughout the year. and in 2020, about 78% of the gas was sold in the first and fourth quarters of the year, right, those cold seasons. this winter for peoples natural gas, year-to-date weather through february is projected to be 3.9% colder-than-normal, based on actual weather through february 21. this compares favorably to last year's mild winter, when year-to-date weather through february was 12% warmer than normal. but do recall that our 2020 adjusted income includes a normalized first quarter. really normalized for the first 75 days where we didn't own the business. next, let's move on to o&m expenses. look at the waterfall; you will see that the addition of peoples o&m of $199.9 million is the primary reason for the increase in o&m expenses for the year.
other contributing drivers include covid-related expenses for our water segment, including covid-related employee costs, growth and normal employee-related costs, which were then offset primarily by savings in other costs, which reflect a number of one-time items. next, we'll spend some time on the earnings per share waterfall. bridging between gaap and adjusted figures for 2019 and 2020, you will notice that gaap eps in 2019 was $1.04 by adding back the almost $0.44 from the peoples-related transaction costs and the dilutive effect of the equity offering, brought us to $1.47 per share on an adjusted income basis for 2019. continuing to the right, the peoples, including the full year pro forma adjustment added $0.21, followed by regulated water segment rates and surcharges expenses, volume and growth, which together contributed over $0.20. these were then offset by $0.31 from other items, such as increased depreciation, amortization and interest, as well as decreased aqua pennsylvania tax repair benefits relative to last year. so this then results in $1.58 for the adjusted income per share for 2020. continuing to the right, the $1.58 is then impacted negatively by almost $0.32 related to peoples full year pro forma adjustment, approximately $0.08 from peoples transaction costs and $0.06 for the rate credits we discussed previously, resulting in the $1.12 of earnings per share on a gaap basis that we mentioned right at the beginning.
before getting the call back to chris, i want to take a moment to provide an update on the peoples tax repair filing. recently, we reached a verbal settlement on the key issues with the parties in the case, and we'll file a settlement agreement on march 11. consistent with the party's positions, we'll give the tax repair benefits, the tax benefits related to catch-up adjustment back to our natural gas customers in the form of a credit over a five-year time frame. this outcome should not have an impact on earnings. rather than using a portion of the catch-up deduction to stay out longer as originally proposed, we're filing our next rate case on a more normal cadence. after review by the alj and the puc, we expect a puc order in the second quarter. however, there's no statutory time line for this proceeding. and being respectful of the process, this is really about as much detail as we can go into at this point. with that, i'd like to turn the call back over to chris to speak about our 2021 priorities and guidance.
chris franklin -- chairman and chief executive officer
the unflappable, dan schuller. i passed to you a slide earlier. i skipped over an important slide. well done. i won't go back to that slide, but it's in the deck. you've all seen it. other than to point out that we have a nice, strong pipeline, and we're in current discussions with systems that total over 375,000 customers. so we feel very, very good about the pipeline of acquisitions -- municipal acquisitions. and we still remain confident that the fact that we have fair market value in eight states where we do business will continue to be a main driver of that healthy pipeline. and so let me come back now to the proper slide. our 2021 priorities, so let's take a look at these priorities. they're very similar to what we saw in 2020. we intend to remain focused on integration, growth and operational excellence this year, 2021. i'd tell you that the emphasis on operational excellence and ensuring quality service is ingrained in our culture. and it's part of our history at essential. and so we'll work to instill those same values in our new colleagues that join us from each of the acquisitions that we do once they're integrated. we'll remain focused on our capital program that continuously improves our customer experience, and we'll continue to build on the strong esg initiatives that we announced earlier in the year. let's talk about guidance now. this slide is just a reminder of what we've shown you already. adjusted income is expected to be $1.64 to $1.69 per share. our capital plans include spending of about $1 billion on regulated infrastructure this year and nearly $3 billion in 2020 -- between now and 2023. about rate base growth is expected to be 6% to 7% for water, 8% to 10% for gas. customer growth is expected to be between 2% and 3% on average for our regulated water segment.
and lastly, we said achievable, i think you would agree, yet aggressive esg targets, including a 60% reduction in our greenhouse gas emissions by 2035, using 2019, as our baseline, and we'll continue to work to ensure that our water throughout our entire footprint, never exceeds 13 parts per trillion of pfas. and finally, as we approach our one-year anniversary as essential utilities, we're reminded that our 135-year old company has now been on the new york stock exchange for 50 years. our company remains strong and dedicated to our mission of providing essential natural resources to our water, wastewater and natural gas customers, and we believe we're well positioned to play a critical role in solving our country's infrastructure challenges while recognizing our responsibility to keep rates affordable and to be an industry leader in protecting the environment. so that concludes our formal remarks, and we are happy to take questions from here.

operator
thank you sir. [operator instructions] thank you. our first question comes from ryan connors with boeing and scattergood.
chris franklin -- chairman and chief executive officer
hey, ryan. good morning.
ryan connors -- boeing scattergood -- analyst
good morning. thanks for taking the time. i've got one, kind of p&l question for dan then, a big picture question for you chris. obviously, we're in an inflationary environment here that impacts materials and chemicals and labor and all of the above.
peers have called that out as a headwind, but you don't seem to be experiencing much of that. dan mentioned actually production cost down, on the water side. and that's your late in the rate cycle in pa anyway.
but can you just frame that for us a little bit dan, why you're not seeing that? and whether you anticipate any cost escalation going forward?
dan schuller -- - executive vice president, chief financial officer
yeah, ryan thanks. and obviously, we're on the lookout for it but we have not seen it yet. and we do have long-term agreements with providers of lots of our materials as well as chemicals.
so we expect that, we'll have a little bit of warning before we see increases some of those types of things. but obviously, we're aware of the commodity price increases in the market more broadly. and so, we're on a look forward here.
ryan connors -- boeing scattergood -- analyst
and as you're involved in rate matters, i mean do you -- i assume you have to make some more aggressive assumptions maybe in future test years and things like that. how do you think about that?
dan schuller -- - executive vice president, chief financial officer
yeah. i mean, we do that. as we go into a future test here, we are looking forward, as what we expect to see in terms of expenses for, specifically the operational expense right so chemicals and power and things like that. now power we've got long-term agreements in place.
chemicals that's done on a one-year basis, and usually as we go through our budgeting process as we look forward to that subsequent year, which is something we then use ultimately in a rate case filing in future test here, we are getting a read from our chemical providers in terms of what they expect to see as inflationary increases in that subsequent year. so we are -- we will be looking at that, as we go through this budgeting process now for 2022.
ryan connors -- boeing scattergood -- analyst
got it. okay. and then, my big picture question chris was, just talk about the municipal acquisition side.
just this past sunday, there was a very prominent front page above the fold story in the philadelphia acquirer, biggest newspaper in the state, basically suggesting that there's growing and more organized opposition element to sort of municipal asset sales in pennsylvania. i think you were quoted in that piece.
can you just kind of give us your -- sum-up, how you think about the issues raised there? and how you strategize against that if in fact there's any reality to that?
chris franklin -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. it was interesting. andy made the article, -- who were at the article they spend some time with us. i'm not sure he captured my sentiments as i think about them. one of the things i said to andy that i thought is, premise was somewhat flawed, in the sense that we had 10 deals signed or closed in last year.
and of those 10 if you look at them one-by-one there was only one that had opposition and that was -- that was in delcora. now you could add to that. we did step back from willistown, but we did that before it came to any kind of a referendum or a flight of some kind.
so the way we see it is the volume of transactions are increasing. and so proportionately, we see people voicing their opinions, in the same way. so yes, there's more in the market, more deals in the market. and there's some more opposition. but i wouldn't say that it's disproportionate, i would say, it's growing proportionately.
ryan connors -- boeing scattergood -- analyst
okay. that's fair. and then, lastly, it's good to see illinois picking up a bit on the m&a front another deal there, but i thought it was kind of unusual that you don't disclose there the name of this town or the system.
what's the story behind that? has that been disclosed locally? or is there some other reason why you're not disclosing that one?
chris franklin -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. it is unusual, ryan. and the reason that we're not is -- and we hope to announce it very soon here, but we're finalizing some other associated agreements there. and there are some sensitive things there that we just wanted to wind up before we make a formal announcement and make it public.
obviously, it's very good news and we do have an asset purchase agreement in place. so we want to let the investors know that we've made progress there but it will be a little bit of time before we can get some of the associated agreements signed. that's all.
ryan connors -- boeing scattergood -- analyst
sure. great. thanks for your time today.
chris franklin -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you.
dan schuller -- - executive vice president, chief financial officer
thanks, ryan. take care.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from durgesh chopra with evercore isi.
chris franklin -- chairman and chief executive officer
hey, durgesh
dan schuller -- - executive vice president, chief financial officer
hey, durgesh
durgesh chopra -- evercore isi -- analyst
hey, guys. thanks for taking my question. chris i must say the picture needs to be updated with facial here on the slides.
chris franklin -- chairman and chief executive officer
it's already gone. it's already gone durgesh.
durgesh chopra -- evercore isi -- analyst
i sat in to hear that, anyways that was my inappropriate earnings call comment. just -- i wanted to see -- so there's a back in forth like between the commission and lg and delcora. is there -- and you guys were -- if i remember this correctly targeting maybe year 2021 flows, it seems like that is going to get pushed. is there a target there of closing here maybe perhaps in the second half or early next year?
chris franklin -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes. i -- the guidance, i just kind of provided was that, if it winds through the courts, it could be at least another six months. now there's always a possibility of a settlement. we've said that all through for this process. but if it winds through the state court, it could be a while again. so we haven't provided an exact date. we have to see, the county has to file a formal brief will be probably in the coming days here. and then the -- that clock begins. so best estimate is probably -- unless a settlement would probably be sometime next year.
durgesh chopra -- evercore isi -- analyst
understood. and then just on the timing of the equity forwards august 10, did i hear that correctly? and is that sort of -- are you timing that in accordance with perhaps -- or what should we think of that?
dan schuller -- - executive vice president, chief financial officer
yes. so durgesh, the forward agreement way those work is they have a one-year life. so you've got one-year from when you price forward to actually settle that issue the shares and take the cash. so that expires on august 10, 2021 here. so we would expect that we would settle that in the days before the days or weeks before that. we don't need to settle it now but we expect we'd settle it close to that end date if you will.
chris franklin -- chairman and chief executive officer
and importantly, the dilution associated is already in the numbers for the rest of the year.
dan schuller -- - executive vice president, chief financial officer
correct, correct. so you'd see -- those shares would be in place from just simply put kind of the middle of august through year-end. that's already in the denominator when we think about our guidance range and the eps in that guidance range.
durgesh chopra -- evercore isi -- analyst
understood. okay. appreciate that. so settlement before or around august 10 but it's already incorporated in your 2021 guidance. perfect. maybe just one big picture question for you chris. so clearly, a private market if you, i'm sure you're following very closely the gas ldc multiples and gas asset transactions, right? clearly, there's a disconnect between the public equity market -- valuation market for these assets versus private. would you consider -- or how should we think about like a lot of your electric years have done some part ownership type deals in utilities among other things. is there an opportunity here for you to kind of put a valuation marker of these premier assets in the private market? how do you -- how do you guys thinking about that?
chris franklin -- chairman and chief executive officer
we are really happy with the acquisition of peoples. the integration has gone extremely well. it's in accordance with our expectations. and is operating even better. and so we are very happy with this combination. we see a long life together and we're going to stay the course. and i think through continued understanding among investors and the public in general that natural gas is here for a very long time. you estimated at least 36% of the energy mix for the next 30 years.
we're going to tighten up our system. we're going to operate as environmentally consciously as we can with dropping our footprint by 60% our greenhouse gas footprint by 60%. and we believe this is going to be a strong combination into the future. so we're going to stay the course.
dan schuller -- - executive vice president, chief financial officer
and i think, durgesh to add to that we would expect that, if we see private market transactions at that level. we start to see that disconnect -- you start to see those converge with public market valuations increasing to that level or toward as well.
durgesh chopra -- evercore isi -- analyst
understood. that makes sense guys. thanks for the time this morning. appreciate it.
dan schuller -- - executive vice president, chief financial officer
you bet.
chris franklin -- chairman and chief executive officer
take care.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from in insoo kim with goldman sachs.
chris franklin -- chairman and chief executive officer
hi, insoo.
insoo kim -- goldman sachs -- analyst
thank you. hey, good morning. first question, just on the timing of the equity forward and the h drive game on delcora and what that could mean from a closing standpoint, i appreciate the comments on 2021 and what's embedded. when you just look out to 2022 at this point with the recent updates, how much of a potential impact does this have this disconnect in timing and potential delays and just what are some of the offsets that you could do to maintain the five to seven.
dan schuller -- - executive vice president, chief financial officer
yes. i guess i'd say, it's a relatively small number of shares relative to our total number of shares today. so, that helps mitigate an impact. and as chris said, right, we've got six acquisitions coming down the pike here already signed in addition to delcora. and so -- and plus a very strong pipeline of additional opportunities beyond that. so, in our decision-making, we just believe it makes good sense to go ahead and do that settlement in august to take those shares to take -- to issue those shares to take the cash.
and then, as we go through, as i kind of alluded to, right, there's an annual planning process. we'll be incorporating these shares. obviously, they're in our five-year plan numbers already for 2022. they'll be in our budget for 2022 as we get to that. and we've got some -- as you know, you manage a business that's got a number of parts and pieces, and can manage it to drive earnings as much as you can and you work to offset any dilution you might have in the business. and we have these other acquisitions to close where we'll put capital to work.
chris franklin -- chairman and chief executive officer
i think also that, when you think about the increased equity, we are spending $1 billion a year. and so, that's a pretty good clip of capital and we're very mindful about our credit metrics, as dan said earlier. and so, these things, as dan said, it's a balance. so, all things in mind, i think it's very prudent to take down the equity here in august or just before.
and i think you about talking about the future. listen, we remain confident that we're going to close delcora. as dan said, we've got a couple of other things in the hopper. but i think we'll stand behind our guidance here.
dan schuller -- - executive vice president, chief financial officer
yes, completely agree.
insoo kim -- goldman sachs -- analyst
got it. second, just wondering, if there's any updated assessment of cost from the february event? i know we had discussed that in the fourth quarter call, but any color there? and if that impacts not that it would impact 2021 guidance but just giving overall magnitude?
dan schuller -- - executive vice president, chief financial officer
yes. so, not a big dollar spend there, about $0.5 million of cost that we look to establish laboratory asset on that kind of takes care of the revenue loss and the operating expenses to resolve the situation there. and then, looking forward from that event, when we did our root cause analysis and looked at the reason for systems being down, as we said in the last call, it's very much driven by electrical outages. so, electrical outages as opposed to freezing, without the outage, we would have continued to be successful in providing our customers with uninterrupted service.
there maybe an opportunity there to -- there certainly is an opportunity there and some of the systems do some hardening and make some investment. these aren't huge dollars. in texas, we're basically in compliance in terms of the number of generators we have, for the systems that we have and to invest in more generators, we really need to buy-in from the puc kind of in advance saying, we want to ensure that we can generate power if the power is out. but, when you look at a fairly large number of systems across texas, it's a big number to start putting in lots of generators. so, i don't think that puc will -- we'd let a do tremendous amount beyond what the puc allows at this point.
chris franklin -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes. we have less than 100,000 customers in texas, and it would cost us in the range of $41 million to put generators in all these facilities. i just don't see customers willing to pay that number. and i don't see the commission willing to sign up for that many. probably some place in between what we have meeting today's regulation. and maybe where the hardening that the commission requires for the future, there might be some opportunity to spend capital and harden the system, as dan said. but, we don't see spending at the level where everything would get its own generators. it's just -- i would call it cost prohibitive.
dan schuller -- - executive vice president, chief financial officer
yes. so, maybe a few million dollars, but not tens of millions of dollars.
chris franklin -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes.
insoo kim -- goldman sachs -- analyst
understood. thank you so much folks.
dan schuller -- - executive vice president, chief financial officer
yes. thank you, insoo.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from travis miller with morningstar.
dan schuller -- - executive vice president, chief financial officer
hey, travis. how are you?
chris franklin -- chairman and chief executive officer
hey, travis.
travis miller -- morningstar -- analyst
hi, everyone. wondering if you could give some more thoughts on kentucky and the legislation there. is that a place you've historically looked at acquisitions and just not been able to get to work or now with that legislation, is that a strategic area that you might look at more.
chris franklin -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes. that's a good question. we have not traditionally looked there, because we didn't have a base there. now, that we have a base, a utility base there, albeit it's a natural gas base. we do have a management team and a regulatory expertise there and an operational team, as i said, albeit natural gas. but it does give us a base of operations to look for utilities in kentucky.
and yes, i think the short answer is, we are interested in kentucky, particularly with that legislation. it's a great regulatory state otherwise. and we enjoy operating the gas utility there from an economic standpoint. so, i would look for us to be very active in kentucky. and yeah, i think the short answer is we are interested in kentucky, particularly with that legislation. it's a great regulatory state otherwise. and we enjoy operating the gas utility there from an economic standpoint. so i would look for us to be very active in kentucky going forward.
travis miller -- morningstar -- analyst
okay. great. and then at the national level as you think about the infrastructure move and some of the proposals there. do you think that's an opportunity more in terms of direct capex for you guys in your system? or does it possibly open the opportunity for more acquisitions as kind of these municipals face or look at potential for large investment needs or wants?
chris franklin -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. listen, my hope is that they would focus more of the infrastructure federal funding on infrastructure on things like separating sanitary and storm sewers, bridges roads that sort of thing, because i think that's really where you can't bring private capital as easily to bear. in water and wastewater, we like to think about the solution as bring low-cost capital to the game here, as well as local rate making. so that combination, i think about almost like a user fee rather than a federal bailout. so to the extent that, those federal dollars would flow for our use, i think that would be useful. to the extent that, it would flow to municipals and give them temporary band aids on some of their massive capital needs.
obviously, that is not as productive. but i really don't see it, having a major impact given the vast bucket of need and the relatively small dollars that are designated here for water and wastewater.
travis miller -- morningstar -- analyst
sure. okay. great. i really appreciate the thoughts.
chris franklin -- chairman and chief executive officer
you bet.
operator
thank you. [operator instructions] our next question comes from jonathan reeder with wells fargo.
chris franklin -- chairman and chief executive officer
hey, jonathan.
dan schuller -- - executive vice president, chief financial officer
hey, jonathan.
jonathan reeder -- wells fargo -- analyst
hey, good morning, chris and dan. dan, first for you did you say the repairs benefit is expected to be $0.18 to $0.20 of peoples for the full year? and is that consistent with the benefit realized in full year 2020 on a pro forma basis. for some reason, i thought you'd previously indicated it was going to be like $0.08 to $0.12.
dan schuller -- - executive vice president, chief financial officer
yeah. that -- so jonathan, i did say, $0.18 to $0.20 for 2021. so you're correct there. but if we think about last year, we didn't have a full year of capital. i do think you're right $0.08 to $0.12 is what we said, when we had the investor day in new york, right, before covid started. so i'd have checked, it's probably at the high end of that. but again, we didn't have the full year. we only had 16 days in the first quarter and then the subsequent three quarters. so less capital was invested that was repair eligible.
jonathan reeder -- wells fargo -- analyst
okay. so $0.08 to $0.12 was for 2020 and then having the full year capital gets you up to that $0.18 to $0.20 this year?
chris franklin -- chairman and chief executive officer
full year capital with this year's capital program. yes.
jonathan reeder -- wells fargo -- analyst
got you. okay. great. appreciate that. and then just to also clarify the comments around usage trends in q1, and kind of the full year guidance, if we're to assume call it normal weather for the remainder of the year in terms of both water and gas consumption. would that put you in the current guidance range? or does the strong q1 have you trending at or above the upper end?
dan schuller -- - executive vice president, chief financial officer
i would still say in the guidance range. i mean, i think at some point here right, we'll see more people return to the workplace, we'll start to see less residential usage, more commercial usage, but we may not be the beneficiaries of that commercial usage, right, if we're serving the suburbs and people go back in the city. so i think we kind of come back to what we call normal usage on covid basis on the water side. and then on the gas side, right, it's so weather dependent. i think the best you can do is sort of kind of normal weather through the remainder of the year. and of course, there's always variability around that. but i would say as i made -- as i said earlier, and then i think chris reiterated it i think that $1.64 to $1.69 guidance range for 2023 that remains intact. and continue to focus on that.
jonathan reeder -- wells fargo -- analyst
okay. awesome. and then maybe this is for you chris. when do you expect in terms of -- respond to your appeal of the alj day in the delcora docket. is there?
chris franklin -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes 30 days. may 20th is the public meeting that they need to respond by.
jonathan reeder -- wells fargo -- analyst
and if they -- i mean, if they kind of reiterate that, yeah, they didn't want those things stayed, and move forward. would you think then like the commissions prepared to act before i guess the appeal process plays out?
chris franklin -- chairman and chief executive officer
that's a question. i don't want to front-run the commissioners. it is a good question. and i think there's a diversity of views among the commissioners. so we'll have to -- let's see. we're trying to take these things one step at a time. so let's see what they do on may 20th, and then maybe give a better judgment from there.
jonathan reeder -- wells fargo -- analyst
okay. and then last, and i know you're limited as to what you can say in regards to the potential settlement. but do you feel any additional headway has been made in reaching a compromise since say your year end update in february?
chris franklin -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes. i mean all i can say is there's been discussions. i'll just say this and i've said this publicly so i'm so disappointed in the politics being played here. the delcora had to raise rates 10% at the end of last year. they'll probably have to raise them again 10% this year if this continues on. we committed in the transaction that we would only raise rates 3% a year. so already these customers are paying a lot more than they really need to.
and we continue to ask for -- through a right to know process how much the county is spending on legal fees and they're spending literally millions of dollars on this. and it's a sad commentary on politics over good economics. and so -- but jonathan we're committed to seeing this thing through. at the end of the day, we think that our contract as i said is valid and enforceable and we plan to take it to the end here.
jonathan reeder -- wells fargo -- analyst
okay. great. i appreciate those responses. yes. and good luck with delcora hopefully we get some movement there and you can get the deal done soon.
chris franklin -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes. thank you.
brian dingerdissen -- vice president, head of investor relations.
thanks, jonathan.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from verity mitchell with hsbc.
brian dingerdissen -- vice president, head of investor relations.
hi, verity
chris franklin -- chairman and chief executive officer
hi, verity
verity mitchell -- hsbc -- analyst
hi. good morning. i've got a more general question about your gas business. there's been a lot of focus on water. in one of your previous slide decks you've got a rate of mild for gas rehabilitation. so you've obviously got a step-up in this year and then kind of flat in 2022 and then another step-up in 2023. are you being conservative? or could you do your gas rehabilitation faster? and therefore spend more. some comment on that would be interesting. thank you.
chris franklin -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes. i think, i'll give a couple of opening thoughts and then let dan jump in to verity. so when you do a gas rehabilitation program the number one thing right is safety. and so depending on where that work is being completed? what it looks like? is it densely populated city of pittsburgh? is it out further in more rural areas?
clearly the complication in the city is difficult right? we're looking at a construction site just this week out there in pittsburgh and they were moving nine feet a day. that's what-how complicated city street is. however, out in the more rural area you can move much more quickly. and so the mix of projects is part of the element of what comes to bear here.
and as you can imagine what we've tried to do in our capital program is handle those more densely populated areas first and then move into the more rural areas. and so there's a lot of things to consider in that mix. we've estimated about 15 years in total and that will probably vary a little bit in terms of pace throughout that period. but dan do you think about it in any different way than that?
dan schuller -- - executive vice president, chief financial officer
no, i think you're right, chris. and when i'm looking at the same slide now verity that you're looking at and there is that step-up in terms of mileage. i believe that the -- what underlies that is a move to do more mileage outside the city where it is faster to move those miles. but also very -- the other -- there are a couple of other things to talk about here. one is we do file with the pennsylvania put a long-term infrastructure improvement plan that really outlines the number of miles we intend to replace year-after-year.
and you remember as part of the transaction we agreed to increase both the mileage and the dollars investing each year -- invested each year. so we've built that into our filed ltip program. so i note that there is that sort of plan in place for how we would do it. another constraint is obviously qualified labor to implement a capital program.
and so ramping up a capital program means we need both more crews from outside contractors who are well-qualified to do this, but also a fairly large number of internal resources as well because in the gas business we need internal resources to do the tie-ins and any live gas type of work where we're connecting to customer service lines. so there's a question of ramping up on the resource side as well to try to do this faster.
so i would say at this point we think that what we filed in the ltip and what we're planning to do is it's very much as stated on the slide that you're looking at we'll adhere with that for the time being.

good day, and welcome to the essential utilities q1 2021 earnings call. today's conference is being recorded.
at this time, i would like to turn the conference over to brian dingerdissen. sir, please go ahead.
brian dingerdissen -- vice president, head of investor relations.
thank you, katie. good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us for our first quarter 2021 earnings call. i am brian dingerdissen, vice president, head of investor relations.
and if you did not receive a copy of the press release, you can find it by visiting the investor relations section of our website. the slides that we will be referencing and the webcast of this event can also be found on our website.
as a reminder, some of the matters discussed during this call may include forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause the actual results to be materially different from any future results expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. please refer to our most recent 10-q, 10-k and other sec filings for a description of such risks and uncertainties.
during the course of this call, reference may be made to certain non-gaap financial measures. a reconciliation of these non-gaap to gaap financial measures is included at the end of the presentation and also posted on the company's website. after the presentation, we will open the call for questions.
here's our agenda for today. we'll start with chris franklin, our chairman and ceo, who will provide a company update. next dan schuller, our cfo, will discuss our financial results. chris will then conclude the presentation portion with an update on our municipal acquisition program and a review of our 2021 guidance. at the conclusion of the call, we will open it up for questions.
with that, i will now turn it over to chris franklin.
chris franklin -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks, brian and good morning, everyone. thanks for joining us. let's start out with a look at some of our first quarter highlights. the first quarter marked our one-year anniversary already as essential utilities and the one-year closing of peoples.we had a strong first quarter. and on a gaap basis earnings per share was $0.72 for the quarter up 19.6% and dan will get into the details of that in just a few moments.we invested approximately $178 million in infrastructure improvements through our systems and in the first quarter -- first three months of the year as compared to $172.2 million at the same time last year. our seven pending acquisitions totaling $450.5 million in purchase price really shows the strength of our municipal acquisition strategy.
also yesterday was our annual meeting of shareholders and i'm pleased to report that all items on the ballot were voted in accordance with management's recommendations. the meeting was also one of transition. our longtime board member and friend former, ceo nick debenedictis stepped down from the board to comply with the board's age policy. and wendy franks, who represented cppib since the acquisition of peoples was replaced by edwina kelly. wendy franks left cppib to take another position with a different firm. and we also then expect to add a well-qualified director in the coming months to bring the board back to nine members again.
as a reminder, our current eight member board has a strong diversity, which includes three women, two people of color and a board all of which have diverse cognitive and experiential backgrounds. i should also note that if you haven't had a chance to review our proxy, i encourage you to do so. we spent a lot of time and energy around that proxy. it's informative and very easy to read. all right.
i'm excited to announce it in march, we opened a brand-new state-of-the-art environmental laboratory on our bryn mawr campus here. the new lab is just one example of our commitment to operational excellence and our mission to protect the public health and ensure high-quality water.the new two-storey building will more than double the size of the previous lab which did great service over 70 years. this new lab though will allow us adapt to the dynamic regulatory environment that requires additional sampling and equipment necessary for drinking water and wastewater operations. it also has the capacity to accommodate the increasing needs as we add customers and systems through acquisition.
the lab employs a professional staff of 20, including microbiologists and chemists who perform about 300,000 tests on 30,000 water samples each year. these scientists use 50 different analytical methods for 240 different water quality parameters. it's a busy group. the lab is certified by the pennsylvania department of environmental protection and four other state environmental and health regulatory agencies.and as we've gone from measuring in parts per million what i was do in the business to now parts per trillion, a million-fold increase in detection levels, we feel confident that we will be able to deliver water that is safe and the wastewater we treat and return to our rivers, lakes and streams is pristine.
now as announced a year ago, we set a companywide standard of 13 parts per trillion to uniformly address the presence of the contaminants pfoa, pfos and pfna, which are all part of that pfos family of chemicals.as i think you're aware the epa's non-enforceable health advisory level for pfos and pfoa is still at 70 parts per trillion. and although an enforceable federal standard is still probably years away, our laboratory is one of two labs accredited and the only utility certified to test pfos in pennsylvania.our commitment to making the necessary capital investment where source water exceeds 13 parts per trillion is for the safety and health of our customers we serve. and our new lab is integral to this important work.
now in light of the esg guidance that we announced earlier this year, i'd like to highlight two solar field projects in illinois that are in the final stages of completion. you can see the pictures here. the manteno solar field project was completed and became operational at the end of february. this nearly one megawatt solar field will supply approximately 85% of the power needed to operate the wastewater plant. we estimate that the project will save between $20,000 and $25,000 annually in operating costs very good for the customers.
the danville solar plant project, spend eight acres and is anticipated to become operational in the second quarter of the year. this is a 2.1 megawatt solar field and will supply approximately 70% of the power needed to operate that water plant. and we estimate this project will save between $110,000 and $140,000 annually in operating costs. so in total now we have six solar fields across our footprint. it's projects like these that allow increased reliabilities with reliability and lower emissions, while also achieving cost savings. as we switch to renewable energy options throughout our footprint, we'll continue to improve the company's already aggressive target to reduce scope 1 and scope two emissions by 60% over the next 15 years.
with that let me hand it over to dan to talk about our financial results.
dan schuller -- - executive vice president, chief financial officer
thanks, chris and good morning, everyone. we ended the first quarter with revenues of $583.6 million, up about 128% from last year. you'll recall that the peoples transaction closed on march 16th last year. therefore, the primary driver of the increase was the addition of the natural gas business from the full quarter, which contributed $315.8 million of revenue growth.o&m increased $125.1 million in the first quarter, up from $106.6 million in the first quarter of last year. again, this was primarily a result of the addition of the natural gas business and we'll sell-out a little bit more when we talk about the o&m waterfall.
net income was up year-over-year from $51.8 million to $183.7 million and gaap eps increased from $0.20 to $0.72. adjusted income was up from $153.7 million to $183.7 million and adjusted income per share increased 19.6% from $0.60 to $0.72.as a reminder, adjusted income for the first quarter of last year excluded peoples-related transaction expenses and included a pro forma adjustment for the people's operating results for the period from january 1st to march 15th, 2020 thereby providing a basis for a full year run rate of operating results for 2020. and as a reminder to clarify, there were no adjustments for 2021 for this first quarter.
next, we'll walk through the details in the following waterfall slides starting with revenue. in the first quarter of 2021, revenues increased $328 million or 128.3% on a gaap basis. the primary driver being the $315.8 million related to the full period for our natural gas segment. this figure includes $132.2 million of purchased gas costs.rates and surcharges, primarily driven by the pennsylvania dsic organic and acquisition growth and increased volumes from our regulated water segment write an additional $12.2 million toward the revenue increase, which was slightly offset by other. the $2.3 million increase due to volume reflects both water consumption and wastewater volumes.
next let's look at our water consumption by customer class. since covid started, we've experienced increased usage and this trend continued in the first quarter. overall, usage was up 1.7%. and again, residential usage was strong for the quarter, up almost 5% offsetting the declines in the commercial and public customer classes. as you will recall, commercial water consumption has consistently been down since cover began.next, let's talk a little about weather and gas usage in our gas business or gas segment. you'll recall that weather has a very direct impact on gas consumption and associated revenues. so we closely monitor the heating degree days as an indicator.
as the left side of the slide shows, we had a somewhat warmer than normal first quarter in western pennsylvania with 2726 heating degree days compared to a 20-year average of 2845 heating degree days. this was however an improvement over the 2421 heating degree days in the first quarter of 2020 and just short of last year's pro forma of 2766.the chart on the right serves as a reminder of how residential natural gas consumption in pennsylvania was distributed throughout 2020, noting that more than 3/4 of the gas was sold first and fourth quarters of the year, with the largest portion being in the first quarter.
now, let's move on to operations and maintenance expenses. looking at the o&m waterfall, expenses increased by 17.3% from $106.6 million in q1 last year to $125.1 million this year. the primary reason for the increase in o&m expenses for the first quarter was the $42.9 million of additional o&m associated with peoples from the full quarter, offset by the impact of the peoples' transaction-related expenses of $25.4 million incurred last year.other contributing drivers include, employee-related costs, cover related expenses for our water segment and growth which were offset by savings in other costs and production costs. adjusting for growth, cover related bad debt and increased pension expenses, regulated water segment operations and maintenance increased in line with historical experience.
next, we're going to spend a few minutes on the earnings per share waterfall. this presentation bridges from the first quarter 2020 gaap eps to the first quarter of 2020 adjusted income per share and then to the first quarter 2021 gaap eps. you will note that gaap eps for q1, 2020 was $0.20, but adding back $0.08 of peoples-related transaction costs and almost $0.32 related to the pro forma adjustment for the peoples operating results for the period between january 1 and march 15, 2020, brought up to $0.60 per share on an adjusted income basis for q1, 2020.
continuing on to the right, the peoples contribution added $0.10, followed by regulated water segment rates and surcharges, expenses, volume and growth, which together contributed $0.0.045. these were offset by $0.03 from other items, which include increased depreciation, amortization and interest, resulting in gaap eps of $0.72 for the first quarter of 2021.the incremental $0.10 from peoples is primarily due to increased tax repair in this full three-month quarter, versus the 16-day first quarter that we had included last year. for the full year of 2021, tax repair of peoples will contribute $0.18 to $0.20, but it's attributed to the quarters based on profitability, so the high gas usage quarters will receive the most benefit.
given the strong results of the first quarter, we wanted to take a moment to remind everyone of how we think about net income by quarter as a water, wastewater and natural gas company. due to the lack of historical comparisons, the intent of this slide was to assist our investors in creating quarterly projections. we reported income per share on a gaap basis for q1 at $0.72, which falls above the midpoint of the range noted on the slide. but as we look forward to the second and third quarters, we'd like to reiterate that the natural falloff of gas consumption could push us lower in those ranges. and that our previously stated full year guidance range of $1.64 to $1.69 remains intact.
as we previously noted, our collective ability to quarterize our earnings will improve as we establish a track record of actual results, as a combined company.
moving on to rate activity and other regulatory matters. in 2021, so far, we've completed rate cases or surcharge filings for our regulated water segment in new jersey, north carolina, ohio, pennsylvania, illinois and indiana, with total annualized revenues of $13.5 million. in our regulated natural gas segment, we have completed rate cases or surcharge filings in pennsylvania and kentucky, with total annualized revenue of $1.1 million. in the coming months, we expect to receive new base rates in virginia for our regulated water segment. and at this point in the year, we do not have any pending base rates or surcharges for our regulated natural gas segment.
as we previously noted, we expect to file a rate case for aqua pennsylvania this year. that's now expected to occur sometime in the second half. also, i wanted to close loop on the discussion we had on the last call related to the peoples catch up deduction. the settlement that we reached with the statutory advocates was filed with the pennsylvania puc and was recommended to the commission by the administer of law judge. this matter was on the docket at the puc today with a recommendation to approve. and it was approved for zero without comment.
the settlement proposes another point, but the catch-up adjustment be provided to utility customers over a five- year period, and that peoples will file its next base rate case before the end of 2023. now, as you'd expect, we've been watching proposed tax legislation and gauging its potential impact on essential. for regulated utilities, the tax increase would look like reverse tcja and we'd expect a surcharge on customer bills or a regulatory asset to recover the increase.
interestingly, an increase in the tax rate would actually increase the repair benefit. and fortunately, it appears that the minimum tax on book income as currently discussed wouldn't apply to essential at this time. so, this is obviously something that's still developing, but i'd expect we'll have more to discuss on tax reform during our next earnings call.finally, let's spend a few minutes discussing our financing activities. as you know, last august the company announced an offering of 6.7 million shares of common stock by a forward equity sale agreement for $308 million. post settlement, the proceeds are expected to be used for general corporate purposes including the delcora acquisition and other water and wastewater acquisitions in our pipeline.
the forward sale agreement allows the company to settle the transaction between now and august 10, 2021. regardless of the timing of the delcora closing, we intend to fully settle the forward by delivering the 6.7 million shares and receiving the cash from our counterparties. we'd likely do that close to that end date of august 10.additionally, on march 4, the company priced $100 million of first mortgage bonds throughout ohio with a weighted average tenor of 20 years and a weighted average coupon of 2.86%. upon closing on april 15, the proceeds of these bonds were used for general corporate purposes.
on april 2019, the company completed a $400 million public debt offering of 10-year notes issued at 2.4%. the company used these proceeds to pay down short-term borrowings and credit lines.in both of these cases, we moved expeditiously to take advantage of attractive capital markets conditions. after years of falling rates and purposeful refinancings of hire rate debt, our weighted average interest rate for our long-term debt now stands at 3.62%. as of april 30, after considering the effect of these financing, the company had $1.1 billion of capacity to borrow on various credit facilities.
and with that, i'll hand it back over to chris.
chris franklin -- chairman and chief executive officer
great. thanks, dan. and let's switch our topics now to municipal acquisitions.
many of you i think are familiar with this slide as we previously announced six of these municipal acquisitions that have been signed and are pending closing. in april, we signed an asset purchase agreement for $12.5 million for a municipal system in illinois with approximately 4,000 equivalent dwelling units. now these seven transactions in total will add close to 231,000 customers or customer equivalents and approximately $450.5 million of rate base when closed. we also have one additional deal in which we have been selected as the winning bidder. we are working to sign an apa and hope to announce that as well in the near future here.
now let's take a moment to discuss delcora. you'll recall the county court has twice ruled that our asset purchase agreement with delcora is a valid and enforceable contract and has also ruled on the validity of the trust concept. so delaware county has appealed those decisions to state court. we know that the state court called commonwealth court in pennsylvania and we're awaiting a judge's decision. given the clarity of the rulings from the county court, we expect a positive decision in state court. absent a settlement this process typically takes about six months or more.
now let's talk about the regulatory process for delcora. since our last quarterly call, the pennsylvania public utility commissioners on march 30 vacated the administrative law judge's recommended decision and remanded the case back to the alj to reopen the record and conduct further proceedings based upon recent developments, including settlement agreements reached with all of the municipal interveners in the case. in its remand order, the commission indicated awareness of the county's appeal of the trial court's decision in favor of delcora. but then on april 16, the alj issued a stay order for the case pending a final and unappealable decision by the state commonwealth court.
we have since petitioned the commission to review the alj's order, as the alj order is very clearly inconsistent with the commission's remand directive. and we've asked the commission to clarify its direction to the administrative law judge for the remanded proceeding. all right. as these municipal transactions folks get larger like delcora, there is always going to be the possibility of litigation and politics that play a role. we remain focused and patient as we move through the process. we also remain convinced that our solution is best for the delcora and aqua customers and essential shareholders. we will see this to conclusion. all right. as we continue into 2021, we have a healthy pipeline of potential municipal opportunities. this table here includes acquisition opportunities where we are actively engaged in discussions with municipalities.
as illustrated on this slide, we are actively pursuing approximately 395,000 customers through acquisition. we continue to believe that fair market value legislation in the eight states where we have water utilities is the main driver of our strong pipeline of opportunities. also note that fair market value or similar legislation for water and wastewater acquisitions has been passed in the states in which we serve natural gas. west virginia approved a fair market value legislation in 2020. and last month, the kentucky governor signed house bill 465 into law which is similar legislation to fair market value. these favorable regulatory environments are providing their municipalities the opportunity to pursue private capital solutions and infrastructure needs and access to industry experience.
so in closing, i want to reaffirm our guidance for 2021. we expect earnings to be between $1.64 and $1.69 per share. and hopefully, the discussion dan led, about, how to best think about the quarters was helpful to you.our capital plans remain on track, as we anticipate spending approximately $1 billion on a regulated infrastructure this year and nearly $3 million -- $3 billion across our essential platform by 2023.
rate base growth is expected to be 6% to 7% for water and 8% to 10% for gas. and this does obviously does not include acquisitions in the water side. customer growth is expected to be between 2% and 3% on average, for our regulated water segment. and finally, our esg targets include a 60% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2035.
and with that, i'll conclude our formal remarks. and kate, if you want to open the line for questions, it would be great.

[operator instructions] and we will take our first question from ryan connors with boenning and scattergood.
ryan michael connors -- boenning and scattergood, inc. -- analyst
hi. good morning. thanks for taking my question. chris, i wanted to get your take on the noise out there on fair market value, fmv. obviously, there are some detractors, which include some of your peers, your smaller peers, it's pretty public debate going on there. so my question is twofold. number one, do you see any of that having any tangible impact legislatively or regulatory-wise in terms of any kind of a rollback of fmv? and then number two, more tactically on discrete deals, do you think that could complicate things if people sort of hold those peer arguments and comments in your face as you try to move deals forward.
christopher h. franklin -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
it's a good question. i think there is some noise from some of the smaller companies who maybe have less ability to use fair market value. having said that, there was a very interesting op-ed in today's one of the new jersey publications. happy to share that around. but it was authored by three former public utility commissioners, one from illinois, one from pennsylvania and one from new jersey, indicating how favorable they view fair market value and how they think it's been a nice step forward for the consolidation of an industry that is, as we all know, balkanized and very fragmented across the country.
so i think that although there are different views, i would say the prevailing thought among regulators and legislators for that matter, is a very positive view of fair market value. so i don't see any rollback either on the regulatory side or on the legislative side. i actually see picking up momentum as more and more municipals are looking for options to deal with their capital constraints and also the ongoing and probably growing environmental constraints.
ryan michael connors -- boenning and scattergood, inc. -- analyst
and what about the second part was just on -- so understood. you don't see any real impact legislatively or real tangibly on the regulatory side. but how could that or maybe not impact your individual deals? i mean is that something you're hearing that stuff come up as you try to move things forward? or is that sort ofnot on the radar of those constituencies in individual deals?
christopher h. franklin -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
yes. i haven't seen it come up in any of the discussions we've had. most people don't know that there might be an industry leader out there who's not in favor of a fair market value. so it hasn't come up in our discussions. and i think given what i mentioned before with corresponding very positive of edge and pieces out there. i think we could easily match some of the detractors with probably the more favorable and majority of the people who are saving favorable things in writing.
ryan michael connors -- boenning and scattergood, inc. -- analyst
understood. now my second one was just staying on the legislative side, the water quality accountability legislation in pennsylvania, sb 597. we had thought that maybe we would get some movement on that by now, but it looks like that's been pulled back and some of the municipal interest groups are out there sort of claiming victory on that, saying that they're lobbying had a desired effect and got that pulled. what's your response to that? is that still moving forward? should we see that move ahead this year, do you think?
christopher h. franklin -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
yes. i've seen no pullback. in fact, as you're probably aware, it was moved out of the senate committee. i think there's only one dissenting vote as it moved out of the senate committee. i think it will continue to be negotiated this one has enforcement provisions, right? and that's where it all comes down. what we're asking in the water quality accountability act in pennsylvania is unbelievably fair, right, create your replacement cycle, put cybersecurity plans in place. these are all things that even if they were never to sell their systems, these are things that people should expect of their water systems anywhere in the country, especially anywhere in this country. and so i think the municipals, as you mentioned, or some municipals, as you mentioned, ryan, we'll continue to oppose and try to negotiate this. but ultimately, this bill will be a difficult bill for them to stop. and i do think something moves through the legislature before the year is out.
ryan michael connors -- boenning and scattergood, inc. -- analyst
got it. very helpful. thanks for your time.

we'll take our next question from travis miller with morningstar.
travis miller -- morningstar inc. -- analyst
hi. wondering on the texas deal, i know it's small, but i wonder if you could elaborate a little bit on the process you went through? was it smooth? was it timely? any points of friction as you went through that thinking mostly about the first one under the fmv? any thoughts there and how that went?
christopher h. franklin -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
yes. i think it took one year. so i would call that relatively smooth in the scheme of things. as you know, the texas commission is distracted a bit at this point dealing with the events of last winter. and so i would say, relatively smooth process.
travis miller -- morningstar inc. -- analyst
okay. in terms of your pipeline, how much in texas is in your pipeline? or alternatively, how much opportunity do you see in texas given that this went smoothly and perhaps give support to doing more deals?
christopher h. franklin -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
yes. we don't typically break our pipeline down by state. but i will say that there are a number of opportunities, and i would suggest that even sizable opportunities in texas that we see and have on our radar there. so it's developing. so i'll concede that it's not galloping at this point. but certainly, there is competition in texas. but i think there's also opportunity that -- as you know, once you get one or two of the deals done, others start to take note, especially if the prices are considered to be fair, which i think this one was very fair. and travis, you should think about this, too, in texas, fair market value applies also to investor owned utilities, not just municipals. so it's an interesting twist to the legislation that we've seen in other states.
travis miller -- morningstar inc. -- analyst
okay. great. that's helpful.
operator
we'll take our next question from jonathan reeder with wells fargo.
jonathan garrett reeder -- wells fargo securities, llc -- analyst
hi. good morning. just wondering what the latest is on the pennsylvania commissioner appointments. i thought, last we spoke, you said that there might have been some sort of kind of two for one deal between the governor and the senate republican. anything more on that front?
christopher h. franklin -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
yes. i guess it would be more informal than anything. i guess what we know as a fact, right? there are four seated commissioners currently, commissioner sweet's term ended on april one this year. and then he's required to vacate the seat on october 1. so if nothing else changes between now and the first of october, which we don't anticipate the legislature doubling go back until the second week in september. so we would anticipate then on october 1, commissioner sweet would step down and then the commission would be two republicans, that's commissioner yanora and commissioner coleman and one democrat, the chairman.
and so you would be a 2:1 republican majority, which is really unheard of to be down to three commissioners and have a majority flip. and listen, this is informal now, the rest of this, but the debate appears to be framed around the regional greenhouse gas initiative, right, the regie. and the governor is intent on staying as a part of regie and the pennsylvania senate has said we're not going to appoint any new commissioners as long as that's the case. and so that's a bit of a stalemate, how that gets ends up being negotiated out. i don't know. but certainly, the chatter in the state capital is that we could end up finishing this year with that 2:1 republican majority. but time will tell.
jonathan garrett reeder -- wells fargo securities, llc -- analyst
okay. and if there is that 2:1, i mean do you think they're prepared to still act on your pending delcora application in some form or fashion, whether it's conditioned on the appellate court process or whatever.
christopher h. franklin -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
well, i can't say for certain what they're going to act on, but what i can say is they are empowered to continue to do the business of the commission. in other words, they don't need a full commission, ceded commission in order to continue to complete the business of the puc. so whatever comes before them, they do have the power to act on.
jonathan garrett reeder -- wells fargo securities, llc -- analyst
got it. any updated thoughts on the timing of the solution of the quarter deal?
christopher h. franklin -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
yes. i mean we're saying 2022 -- now, jonathan, the pennsylvania state court or commonwealth court, that just takes time as we grind through the process. and so i would think that, that would be the case. i mean, just a little bit of color on this. there is an election in delaware county, two of the ceded commissioners or counsel minute they call them in delaware county are up for election. one of them is not running again. he was the chairman, mr. zidek, and so he'll be replaced absolutely. and then there's another commissioner or counselman named madden who's also up.
so there could be a change in the makeup of delaware county council. there will absolutely be a makeup at least a change in one seat, maybe two when we come into january, and they're seated immediately in january. it's like january three or something. so we will see some changes there. might there be an opportunity with a new look and a new set of counsel people to find a settlement, you never know.
jonathan garrett reeder -- wells fargo securities, llc -- analyst
okay. but if the court has to fully play out, i mean it's somewhere in mid-2022 or kind of earlier in the year?
christopher h. franklin -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
it's really hard to put a gauge on how quickly commonwealth court will move. we said maybe in that six-month time frame. so could that be by midyear. i just i don't want anybody to put numbers on it because it's just hard to tell how quickly the court will move.
jonathan garrett reeder -- wells fargo securities, llc -- analyst
okay. got you. no, that's fair enough. and then dan, i think you said you haven't filed the pa water rate case. did you indicate how soon that's going to be filed? or like what kind of timing we should think of?
daniel j. schuller -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes. jonathan i think of that just in the coming weeks, it will be filed. that will be filed later this month, and which keeps us on that three-year cadence that we've talked about.

we'll take our next question from verity mitchell with hsbc.
verity mitchell -- hsbc -- analyst
good morning. i've just got two questions. one is about the gas customer count being stable for 2021. i mean, is that in line with your expectations? or if you want to give us a bit more color on that? and then the second question is, as i'm not local, if you want to give us a feel for what the weather has been like in july and august. because clearly, i wouldn't know from where i'm calling from. thank you.
daniel j. schuller -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes. so gas customer count will be relatively stable year-on-year. it's interesting, we tend to pick up a few customers with new connections, but we lose a few customers as well. so that business is pretty close to stable, whereas in several of the water states, we continue to add on the organic side, growth tends to be in pennsylvania, north carolina, texas, the places that you would imagine that there's building going on. in terms of the weather, i would say, kind of differs by part of the country, generally, it's been pretty nice, but we have seen spots with some more rain.
texas had kind of a rainy start of the summer, and it started in the kind of mid-july time frame to warm up, and we're seeing the hot weather again in texas. yes. we've had a bit of rain here in pennsylvania on and off. so kind of we're just getting the july numbers in here and kind of taking a look at it. but that's probably the color i can give at this point, chris, any further color on it.
christopher h. franklin -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
i think that's right, verity. and particularly in this area where we have a lot of water customers in pennsylvania. you want the summer to be dry, but not too dry that people give up on their grass. and so i think that's where we are right now. people continue to water. we're thinking it's looking pretty normal. but we'll see what the next couple of weeks bring there. they're predicting here in philadelphia on the morning news today that we could get our fifth heat wave of the season. i guess that's five days in the 90s coming up this week. so maybe we'll sell some water.
verity mitchell -- hsbc -- analyst
great. thank you.
christopher h. franklin -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
thanks, verity.

[operator instructions] we will take our next question from ben kallo with r.w. baird.
benjamin joseph kallo -- robert w. baird & co. inc. -- analyst
hi guys. i hope you're doing well. maybe just on the biz dev front, there was a flurry of military bases, and i haven't seen one, maybe i've missed it lately. can you talk to that? and i saw the texas announcement and i've seen some other movement there. could you just talk about the texas market and how appealing that is to you versus other stuff on your plate? thank you.
christopher h. franklin -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
yes. on the military front, as you know, we haven't played there. we've been largely focused on municipal market, which is very open in the state where we are. and i haven't seen much on military of late, although i do know that there are -- continue to be some opportunities moving forward. but we've not played there. so i guess then focusing on texas, listen, we're always high on texas. when you look at the population numbers alone in texas, you say, boy, the growth in population should then show some growth in housing starts and then, obviously, be more water sales and on and on.
we've been very active there. we've got a very active state team and very active in the legislative front, as you know, on the fair market value. and so we're optimistic about taxes, but i think we're at the opening stages for municipal. but as we just reminded everyone a minute ago, the new fair market value legislation in texas applies not only to municipals but also to investor owned. so the market is pretty wide open there, and it's a matter of continuing to till the soil and really opening that market now that we have the legislation that we need.
benjamin joseph kallo -- robert w. baird & co. inc. -- analyst
great. and then on the esg front, could you just talk about maybe if there is an interaction between your esg profile and your local utility commissions yet and how that works, how they look at that or if it hasn't evolved to that yet?
christopher h. franklin -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
sure. i think there are aspects of esg, call it, diversity, equity and inclusion, certainly greenhouse gas emissions environmental. they don't always call it esg, but certainly, the elements are there, and those are widely discussed as we talk with regulators. but i do think that the overall esg platform is here to stay, and i think it will continue to be a topic with not only investors but regulators. the interest level, as i said, though, seems to be forming up more around individual issues as opposed to the overall esg. i'll point to renewable natural gas and how if we were to go there, how those costs might be recovered. other utilities have already begun to test mechanisms, and we're watching those very carefully. so as we think about the environmental aspect of esg, i think that's where we form up for us, at least on the gas side.
daniel j. schuller -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
and then, chris, maybe the other place would just be customer assistance programs.
christopher h. franklin -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
yes. good point.
daniel j. schuller -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
something overlap there.
christopher h. franklin -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
yes. yes. and we're doing a lot of work around customer systems, particularly in pennsylvania right now.
benjamin joseph kallo -- robert w. baird & co. inc. -- analyst
okay. that's helpful guys. congrats on the quarter.

good day, and welcome to the essential utility, inc. second quarter 2021 earnings call. today's conference is being recorded. at this time, i would like to turn the conference over to mr. brian dingerdissen. please go ahead, sir.
brian dingerdissen -- vice president and chief of staff, investor relations, and communications
thank you, kathy. good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for essential utilities second quarter 2021 earnings call. i am brian dingerdissen, head of investor relations. if you did not receive a copy of the press release, you can find it by visiting the investor relations section of our website at essential.co. the slides that we will be referencing and the webcast of this event can also be found on our website. here is our forward-looking statement. as a reminder, some of the matters discussed during this call may include forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause the actual results to be materially different from any future results expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. please refer to our most recent 10-q, 10-k and other sec filings for description of such risks and uncertainties.
during the course of this call, reference may be made to certain non-gaap financial measures. a reconciliation of these non-gaap to gaap financial measures is included at the end of the presentation and also posted in the investor relations section of the website. after the presentation, we will open the call up for questions. here's our agenda for the call today. we'll start with chris franklin, our chairman and chief executive officer, who will discuss highlights and provide a company update. next, dan schuller, our chief financial officer, will discuss our financial results. chris will then provide an update on our municipal acquisition program and conclude the presentation portion before opening the call for questions. with that, i will turn the call over to chris franklin.
christopher h. franklin -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
thanks, brian, and good morning, everyone. thanks for joining us. let's start the call with a look at the second quarter highlights. we had another strong quarter with net income growth of 8.4%, dan is going to discuss that in detail in just a moment. we invested over $404 million in infrastructure improvements throughout all of our systems in the first half of the year as compared to $346.6 million in the second quarter of 2020. you might recall that in may, our long-term board member and former chief executive officer, nick benedictis stepped down, creating a vacancy on the board. then in july, the board appointed dave ciesinski to join the board of directors.
dave currently serves as president and chief executive officer and director of lancaster colony corporation, and serves as president of t. marzetti company, it's a food company based in ohio. at essential, they will serve on our audit and corporate governance committees, where he brings extensive experience, developing and implementing plans for growth and with a very successful leadership team. the addition of dave ciesinski, along with edwina kelly, who was appointed earlier in the year has brought our board back now to nine members. also last month, the board approved a 7% increase to the quarterly dividend, which is now nearly $0.27, marking three decades of dividend increases.
our municipal acquisition strategy remains strong as we announced the closing of our first fair market value transaction in texas, and we have seven pending acquisitions, totaling about $458.5 million in purchase price. and finally, we published our 2020 esg report that fully incorporates our natural gas segment, and i'll talk a little bit more of that about that in just a moment. the first -- the 7% dividend increase we announced in july marks the 31st increase in 30 years and the 76th consecutive year of quarterly dividend payments. we're very proud of that. following the increase, the annualized dividend rate will be just over $1.07 per share. we're really proud of only our commitment to providing safe and reliable access to natural resources for our customers, but also our long and consistent record of delivering shareholder value.
now you might recall that last october, we launched our new esg microsite, which included our 2019 results for our legacy water and wastewater operations. i'm excited to tell you today that we are launching our 2020 esg report on the microsite. we just published it in the last couple of days. and in the new report, gas operations are fully included for the first time. in fact, we provide the same level of depth for both our legacy water wastewater business and our natural gas business. we also share information at the enterprise level in the new report. now we didn't simply add gas operations to the report, we also included some new topics and some more extensive information on some of the topics that i know are important to many of you as investors. i think you'll find the esg microsite makes the experience even sharper, more dynamic and even more user-friendly.
so i hope you take a look at it. now this enhanced site covers our continued commitment to our mission despite our covid-19 challenges. it also covers our excellence in water quality, including our seven time outperformance of the average in the united states. it further discusses our 7% increase in diversity hiring year-over-year, along with more detailed workforce composition data as many companies are now doing. this progress on esg during a difficult year in 2020 helped us earn recognition as one of the 100 best corporate citizens in the russell 1000, again, something we're very proud of. while we're talking about esg, i want to update you on our progress on the esg commitments we announced at the start of the year.
we set a multiyear employee diversity target to reach 17% of our employees of color. currently, we're at 14% of our essential employees are people of color. we also set another multiyear target of 15% of our suppliers would be diverse. we've made strong progress since the beginning of the year. and in fact, we currently stand at about 9.6%. we've also achieved a 5% scope one and scope two emissions reduction. this is a strong start toward our ultimate goal -- well, our 2035 goal of a 60% reduction in greenhouse gas from a 2019 baseline. and achieving that target will put us more than halfway toward our ultimate goal of net 0 emissions.
we're confident that we have the programs and the plans in place to achieve our targets and look forward to continuing to share our progress with you over the coming years. we know that our commitment to environmental stewardship, sustainable business practices, employee safety and diversity and inclusion, customer experience and community engagement is also very important to our investors. and with that, let's talk about the second quarter financial results. dan?
daniel j. schuller -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes. thanks, chris. good morning, everyone. we ended the second quarter with revenues of $397 million, up about 3.3% from last year. our regulated water segment contributed $248.2 million, and our regulated natural gas segment contributed $141.6 million. o&m expenses remained relatively flat for the quarter, decreasing to $127.5 million in the second quarter, down from $128.6 million in the second quarter of last year. net income was up 8.42% year-over-year from $74.6 to $80.9 million, and gaap earnings per share increased by $0.03 from $0.29 to $0.32. next, we'll walk through the waterfall slide, starting with revenue. in the second quarter of 2021, revenues increased $12.6 million or 3.27% on a gaap basis.
you'll see that rates and surcharges were the largest contributors at $9.2 million, with the primary driver being the regulated water segment. increased volume and growth from our regulated water segment provided an additional $5.7 million toward the revenue increase, while the price of purchased gas added approximately $1.5 million and other added $1.2 million. these revenue increases were offset by decreased volume from the regulated natural gas segment of $4.9 million due to the warmer weather than last year. next, let's look at the water consumption by customer class. we had favorable conditions in the second quarter and water consumption increased in every state, except texas. in aggregate, water usage was up 4.2% in the second quarter.
however, it's worth noting that for the first time since covid started, residential usage declined. as you'll recall, commercial water consumption has consistently been down since covid began, but with many businesses reopening and customers returning to the workplace, commercial usage increased 20% for the quarter, and our other segments were favorable versus last year as well. when compared to the first six months of 2020, overall usage was up 3% in 2021 as almost all customer classes increased their usage year-over-year. operations and maintenance expenses were $127.5 million for the second quarter, down 0.85% compared to $128.6 million for the second quarter of 2020. employee-related costs were up $4.6 million for the quarter, which included $3.2 million of increased medical costs.
this increase was expected as many people delayed nonemergency medical visits during covid and then recently began to return to their healthcare providers. production costs and growth for the regulated water segment added another $2.2 million. however, these increases were offset by $4.3 million in other and $3.5 million in covid-19 costs when compared to q2 of 2020, resulting in the overall decline in o&m expenses. next, we will review the earnings per share waterfall. gaap eps for the second quarter increased by $0.03 from $0.29 in 2020 to $0.32. rates and surcharges added $0.025. volume and growth from our regulated water segment together contributed $0.015 and o&m added nearly $0.01.
these were offset by lower volume from our regulated natural gas segment of $0.014 and another $0.01 from other items, including depreciation, which brought us to gaap eps of $0.32 for 2020 for the second quarter of 2021. when we rolled out our formal guidance earlier this year, we provided relatively large ranges for a quarterly breakdown. for q2, we saw warm dry weather across much of our water service territory, resulting in stronger-than-expected water sales and more favorable than expected expenses, including o&m, tax and other, which led to the strong $0.32 of eps. this builds off of what was expected and largely reflected by many of you, to be a flat to down performance versus the same quarter last year, largely due to the way the people's repair benefit was reflected in our condensed year of ownership in 2020.
while i know most investors are not particularly focused on quarterly estimates and are instead more focused on annual earnings, we want to bring additional clarity to what we see for the third and fourth quarters of this year. it's not our intention to permanently provide quarterly guidance, we thought it might be helpful to provide some additional details this year. specifically, when you look at our year-to-date performance and add current consensus for q3 and q4, you might assume that we have a very big year for earnings. but keep in mind that there are expenses that are expected to come through during the second half, including expenses related to the peoples acquisition commitments, certain maintenance items and increased healthcare costs that will keep us within our full year guidance range.
additionally, there are an incremental 6.7 million shares from the august 2020 forward offering that we expect to settle next week, and those additional shares will impact the eps calculation. for clarity, we'll have those incremental shares for more than 4.5 months in the second half of the year. specifically for q3, the gas business does not generally make money. when you look at q3, you should expect something in the lower end of the 10% to 20% net income contribution range that we provided for the quarter. and for q4, the gas business then starts to generate meaningful revenue again as the heating season begins, but we'll be waiting on new water rates in pennsylvania and, therefore, would expect to result in the lower end of that range as well.
realigning these quarters and considering the expenses noted earlier, if we experienced normal weather, our full year results should be around the midpoint of the stated guidance range of $1.64 to $1.69. moving on to rate activity and other matters. so far in 2021, we've completed rate cases or surcharge filings for our regulated water segment in new jersey, north carolina, ohio, pennsylvania, illinois, indiana and virginia with total annualized revenue of $16.7 million. in our regulated natural gas segment, we've completed rate cases or surcharge filings in pennsylvania and kentucky, with total annualized revenues of $1.3 million. we currently have two base rate cases underway, one for delta gas in kentucky and one for aqua ohio.
importantly, we expect to file a rate case for aqua pennsylvania later in the month, in line with the three-year rate case cadence that we have outlined previously, and we will provide additional details related to that case once it is filed. and with that, i'll hand it back over to chris.
christopher h. franklin -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
thank you, dan. let's take a few minutes and review our municipal transaction activity. matt rhodes and his team, along with our state presidents and their teams have been busy at work on our growth projects. earlier this week, we announced the closing of the commons water in texas. you may recall this water system serves about 1,000 customers in the houston suburbs and, is our first fair market value acquisition in texas. we've signed -- we have seven signed asset purchase agreements pending closing, including the recent addition of an agreement to purchase. the wastewater -- i'm sorry, yes, the wastewater assets in the borough of shenandoah, pennsylvania for $12 million. the system serves approximately 3,000 customers.
these seven pending transactions plus the one closed transaction will add close to 234,000 customers or customer equivalents and approximately $462.5 million of rate base when closed. we remain confident that we will close the delcora transaction. i want to make that clear. this is one of the most frequent questions we get. while we continue to wait for the state court to decide on the case, we want to reiterate that we continue to have positive and productive conversations, both internally and externally. we remain focused on closing this transaction and continue to believe that we are the best solution for the operation of the delcora system, its customers and our investors.
i think it's also important to note and mention to you that our valid and enforceable contract with delcora includes a provision that makes the contract valid until 60 days after all litigation is concluded. i think that's an important factor to remember as we continue to pursue the closing of that transaction. now in addition to the signed municipal transactions mentioned on the previous slide, we have a healthy pipeline of potential municipal opportunities as we look at the second half of 2021 and beyond. this table includes acquisition opportunities where we are engaged in active discussions with municipalities. as the slide demonstrates, we are actively pursuing approximately 390,000 potential new customers.
we continue to believe that fair market value legislation and favorable regulatory environments provide municipalities with the ability to pursue solutions to their infrastructure needs and access industry experience and expertise through companies like ours. so i'll wrap up the call, at least the formal part of the call with a reaffirmation of our 2021 guidance. and despite the very strong first half of the year, as dan mentioned, we continue to expect earnings to be between $1.64 to $1.69 a share. our capital plans remain on track as we anticipate spending approximately $1 billion on regulated infrastructure this year. the final mix of this capital spending may be more weighted toward the regulated water segment.
we anticipate investing nearly $3 billion across the essential platform by 2023, driving rate base growth to be 6% to 7% in water and 8% to 10% for gas. customer growth is expected to be between 2% and 3% on average for our regulated water segment. and finally, we continue to make progress with our esg targets to ensure the strength of our company is not only measured by our financial performance, but also our commitment to the environmental stewardship, sustainable business practices, employee safety, diversity and inclusion, customer experience and community engagement. with that, i'll conclude my formal remarks and open the line for questions.

thank you. we'll take our first question from insoo kim with goldman sachs.
christopher franklin -- chairman and chief executive officer, essential utilities
hey, insoo.
insoo kim -- goldman sachs -- analyst
hey, thank you. good morning. first question related to ida. could you just tell us what the total costs associated with that was in terms of maybe capital and operating expense? and did any of the operating costs get deferred at all? or what we're seeing in the results, all reflecting the opex?
daniel schuller -- executive vice president, chief financial officer, essential utilities
yes. great question, insoo. so let me just walk through this. in terms of expense, the expenses and they are reflected in the results are $2.1 million, and we don't expect to have trailing expenses into the fourth quarter from ida. in terms of capital so far, about $1.7 million of capital, there will be future capital associated with that pickering plant that chris talked about earlier. and then the conservation-related consumption there, we estimate that to be about $2 million, but that's hard to pin down exactly
christopher franklin -- chairman and chief executive officer, essential utilities
and it's important to note that, as dan kind of alluded to, we have some questions to answer for ourselves at that plant and follow-on capital. one, obviously, we need to get the plant to a point where it produces the level of quality water that it did before. it's producing quality water, but we need to continue to increase its capacity. but the question is, do we rebuild on-site hire walls and waterproof doors, all that sort of thing? or do we move some of these things to higher ground on that same property should obviously be increased cost -- capital cost? so those are things that we're still wrestling with. and i think that's what dan is alluding to in terms of how we think about future capital.
daniel schuller -- executive vice president, chief financial officer, essential utilities
and just to address the other part of your question there, insoo. as i noted earlier in the kind of prepared remarks, we will seek insurance recovery, and we'll also seek recovery from -- through the regular regulatory process for those expenses that i mentioned.
insoo kim -- goldman sachs -- analyst
right. maybe just as a follow-up to this one. in terms of the treatment plans that were affected, are they all fully functioning? so when we think about just operating costs going forward and delivering the treated water we're kind of back to normal versus maybe in the next quarter or two still having to utilize the other plants that could maybe increase the cost profile a little bit?
christopher franklin -- chairman and chief executive officer, essential utilities
yes. i would say, for all intents and purposes, it's back to normal. we do have what we call it clear, well, this is where the finished water sits that was collapsed under that. so we can't store as much finished water there. but the plants themselves are operating well. we have some tweaks yet to do, but i would not expect the current situation to result in added expense.
daniel schuller -- executive vice president, chief financial officer, essential utilities
yes, agree.
insoo kim -- goldman sachs -- analyst
got it. my last question is on your growth rate. you reiterated the 5% to 7%. correct me if i'm wrong, but i think when we had prior discussions, when we just think about the longer term, maybe beyond that '21 to '23 period, i think you've mentioned that there could be potential incremental upside opportunities on a longer-term basis. so as we look forward to conclude this year and look at a new multiyear growth rate, any latest thoughts on achieving maybe something more robust given the potential outcomes in the pa rate case or delcora timing among others.
christopher franklin -- chairman and chief executive officer, essential utilities
yes. i think i'll reserve comment on -- as we give next year's guidance. we typically haven't gone out beyond that three-year window we provided. so why don't we chat about that when we come to our guidance call.
insoo kim -- goldman sachs -- analyst
got it. is that going to be early next year as typical, sometime in the january period?
christopher franklin -- chairman and chief executive officer, essential utilities
it will be early next year, it could be january -- january, february time frame. yes, we haven't locked down exactly the date. we also want to take a look at what's happening with some of the growth projects we're working on, so that we align that timing when we can maybe have some good news.
insoo kim -- goldman sachs -- analyst
thank you so much.
christopher franklin -- chairman and chief executive officer, essential utilities
you bet.
daniel schuller -- executive vice president, chief financial officer, essential utilities
thanks, insoo.

next question comes from ryan greenwald with bank of america.
christopher franklin -- chairman and chief executive officer, essential utilities
hey, ryan.
daniel schuller -- executive vice president, chief financial officer, essential utilities
hey, ryan.
ryan greenwald -- bank of america -- analyst
good morning, team. maybe to start, it seems like the epa is taking a bit more active role just in terms of pfas and emerging contaminants with the road map that they recently announced. any initial thoughts around how this is going to impact the municipal pipeline and acquisition opportunities?
christopher franklin -- chairman and chief executive officer, essential utilities
yes, it's a great question. i think generally and a lot of the specifics are yet to come from the epa, but especially as we talk about maximum contaminant levels and that sort of thing. i think we would -- we are generally of the opinion that the more stringent it becomes, the more difficult it is for smaller or midsized utilities who don't have our level of expertise to meet those compliance levels. and so it should put more utilities in a position where they're struggling and they're looking for solutions like we can bring. so again, generally, given there's no -- not a whole lot of specifics out there yet, i would say it would help in our municipal acquisition program.
ryan greenwald -- bank of america -- analyst
got it. fair enough. and then maybe on a similar note, just in terms of the infrastructure bill and the latest from the house here around reconciliation. any thoughts -- any updated thoughts in terms of how you guys are thinking about potential impact there?
christopher franklin -- chairman and chief executive officer, essential utilities
well, the way we think about this, in the scheme of the needs in water and wastewater across the country infrastructure that is, it's -- even though it seems like it's a decent size, when you consider the needs, particularly in larger cities and some of the needs around storm water, it's a drop in the bucket. and we don't see it as an impact to our growth plans. we hope that if we have access to -- or the utilities have access to low-cost money or no cost money, we would actively look at that as well to keep rates down for our customers. but generally, we don't see it having an impact on our acquisition program.
ryan greenwald -- bank of america -- analyst
got it. and then maybe just one more, if i may. in terms of the competitive landscape, dexter was pretty vocal around kind of expanded water efforts here with their latest update. anything in terms of what you guys are seeing as you go into the bids here in terms of changes to how competitive it is out there any states in particular where you're seeing more competition in tuck-in pursuits?
christopher franklin -- chairman and chief executive officer, essential utilities
well, we have seen nextera in a couple of situations in pennsylvania and in texas. certainly, we've seen their comments in the market. and frankly, we've been fairly welcoming to the electric utilities as they come into our space and bring more cloud to regulated water. and so listen, as we think about this privatization trend, the more that that occurs successfully, the better it is. we think about this as a pretty big market. we've certainly been successful in our market share and we think we can continue to do that.
as electrics enter the business, they've got to build their water expertise. so i think the offerings -- and remember that the -- despite their large customer base, existing customer base and rate base, they can't spread their water costs on their electric customers. so they've still got to confine any rate increases for acquisitions on those customers they have. so we bring, i think, a pretty competitive position in any time we're competing with electrics or those new entries to the market given our size, our scale ofcapabilities. so not too worried about it.
ryan greenwald -- bank of america -- analyst
great. i'll leave it there. thank you, guys.
christopher franklin -- chairman and chief executive officer, essential utilities
thank you.

our next question comes from travis miller with morningstar.
christopher franklin -- chairman and chief executive officer, essential utilities
hey, travis.
travis miller -- morningstar -- analyst
good morning. thank you. i was wondering as you look at perhaps your regulatory team, any other states you're seeing or even federal? but stick to the states where fair market value legislation or regulation is working its way through various sales of government?
christopher franklin -- chairman and chief executive officer, essential utilities
yes. i mean, i know it's taken -- we haven't in all of our states where we do business now. and so where some form of it, right, it's not always called fair market value. so we're really comfortable in the states where we are. i don't -- i can't tell you exactly where outside of our footprint, it may be moving through. but it seems to be taking hold in a lot of different places beyond our states as well.
travis miller -- morningstar -- analyst
okay. and then when you think about the capacity you guys have internally for doing acquisitions, water acquisitions, are you at -- give me a sense for how much capacity you have to do those acquisitions. when you think about -- currently, you talked about $500 million or so of rate base, even if you could take out delcora, somewhere in the $250 million or so pending deals. can you go much above that, just in terms of executing and closing the deals, soliciting more deals, stuff like that?
christopher franklin -- chairman and chief executive officer, essential utilities
yes. yes, i think we can. and here's why we have a combination of things we use for our workforce in the various states. so we have a state president and a state business development person in every state. both of whom have responsibility for growth. and then we supplement that with others, both inside the business and outside the business to help us accelerate growth. and those could be consultant. they could be former political people, that sort of thing to help us with these municipal acquisitions.
a lot of these acquisitions take a lot of time, as you know. i mean, i know there's around how long it's taken with delcora, in particular. but given the amount of time they take in terms of getting to apa and sometimes ultimately getting to closing, there's time to fill in around the edges to keep a lot of them in the air. and then in addition to those state teams i described, at eva matt rhodes, matt and his team here at headquarters, which helped facilitate that as well. and then now we've plugged some people in out in our western area at peoples. -- are notable people in that region to help us with some of the water projects as well. so i think we have deep capabilities to continue to build our municipal program.

our next question comes from ryan connors with boenning & scattergood.
christopher franklin -- chairman and chief executive officer, essential utilities
hey, ryan.
daniel schuller -- executive vice president, chief financial officer, essential utilities
good morning.
ryan connors -- boenning & scattergood -- analyst
hey, thanks for taking my questions. good morning. so a couple of big picture questions. first, i wanted to go back to the talk you had there with your first question regarding ida. and chris, you mentioned still sort of formulating your thoughts about whether to build back in kind or to build back with a more robust flood proofing and obviously, a lot of that will be dictated by what the commission thinks about rate recovery and things like that. so is there any early read or color? obviously, you probably had some discussions informal and otherwise. any idea how they're looking at things like that in terms of cost benefit? would they rather you spend the rate base and build against that rare flood? or would they just say, you guys seem to handle it pretty quick, got it back up and running pretty quick, let's just let it ride. what's their thinking?
christopher franklin -- chairman and chief executive officer, essential utilities
yes. i thought for a second there, you're going to ask me if i was going to build back better, ryan. you stayed away from that. yes, i think you raised an important question and one that we're spending a lot of time on. so we've done is we said, ok, what's the probability that a storm of this magnitude would hit our plan. and then what are the various improvements we could make to the plant. it's almost like i'll use a slang term here, a submarine door, right, on our doors to the plant. what could we do to reinforce that plant so that it wouldn't take on water at the same level again.
and then we're saying, ok, let's think about the probability of a storm like that and then the reinforcement we could do to keep it from getting the level of damage it did this time versus moving at least aspects of that plant to higher ground. we have a pretty good size property there. and then what are those costs? and then how do we think about that from a timing standpoint? in other words, could they be spread out over a period of years and therefore, cost impact be mitigated to customers?
so the questions you raised are good ones that we are grappling with ourselves. i don't have final solutions. but rest assured that, that will be a conversation with the regulators as well to make sure that we're all aligned and whatever we do, we get the proper regulatory treatment.
ryan connors -- boenning & scattergood -- analyst
yes. okay. okay. so still up in the air. now i wanted to actually probe your initial comment i thought was interesting in your prepared remarks about your investor relations survey and the comments you made about gas and m&a. i mean what scenario, if any, could you envision yourself diverging from that intention not to pursue m&a in gas? for example, the puc in pennsylvania or kentucky or west virgin, you were to tap you on the shoulder and say, look, we have a troubled asset here. can you help us out? those types of situations, is there any situation where you could envision yourself being receptive to something like that? or is it just sort of a real lack of white on that?
christopher franklin -- chairman and chief executive officer, essential utilities
yes. i think it's real black and white, ryan, at this point. i just think as a public company, and looking at the current multiples, it's just difficult to see a path where you'd want to add additional natural gas. that's not to say that we -- in any way are thinking less of our gas utility contribution. i mean, listen, this is a utility that the acquisition went well. it's exceeding all of our expectations and our targets we set for ourselves: safety, financial contribution, capital plan. it's exceeding all of our targets very, very nicely. and so it's a great -- it's a great addition to our company and operating extremely well. but hard to say that it would be good sense to add to that today. and so we are entirely focused on growing the water utility. and then our keen focus of our management team in pittsburgh and on the gas utility is focused on the things i talked about, replacing that pipe, making more secure, safe, reliable and environmentally sound. and so i think it's a solid strategy at this point on the gas side, but it's solely focused on the capital program in those aspects i just mentioned, we're not going to grow in gas through acquisition.
ryan connors -- boenning & scattergood -- analyst
got it. okay. and then my last on, quickly. you've been a good source of keeping us up to date on the pennsylvania sort of the soap opera with the commission and the vacancies there and some of the gamesmanship with the governor around appointments and things like that. can you just give us the latest on where that stands with the commissioners situation in pennsylvania?
christopher franklin -- chairman and chief executive officer, essential utilities
yes. and i guess the easiest way to say this is no change. so the commission remains at 3 members: two republicans and one democrat despite the fact that the governor is a democrat. so the chairman appointed by the governor is the only democrat on the commission. and then we would not expect, given the governor's continued strong position on the regional greenhouse gas initiative, regie, and the senate -- the state senate opposition to his position, frankly, that he could enter that position without their approval or consent. so the senate is not going to move on his appointments. and so we don't see any change in that unless the governor were to change this policy the senate says they're going to hold firm. so it could go through the whole year next year with the commission remaining in much of the status that it is today.
ryan connors -- boenning & scattergood -- analyst
okay. all right. that's helpful. thanks for your time today.
christopher franklin -- chairman and chief executive officer, essential utilities
you bet, ryan.
operator
and our next question comes from jonathan reeder with wells fargo.
christopher franklin -- chairman and chief executive officer, essential utilities
hey, jonathan.
daniel schuller -- executive vice president, chief financial officer, essential utilities
good morning, jonathan.
jonathan reeder -- wells fargo -- analyst
hey, good morning. hey, dan, how are you guys doing this morning?
daniel schuller -- executive vice president, chief financial officer, essential utilities
pretty well.
jonathan reeder -- wells fargo -- analyst
good. most of my questions have been answered. i got two left for you though. any word from the pennsylvania supreme court regarding whether it's going to take up the appeal of the lower cords order by the cwa.
christopher franklin -- chairman and chief executive officer, essential utilities
no word from the supreme court yet. it could take them a few months to give an answer on that, whether they decide to take it up or not.
jonathan reeder -- wells fargo -- analyst
okay. so it still could be a few months before we even hear if you're taking it up. and then if they do, you have another, what is it, is it nine months to a year for an order or --?
christopher franklin -- chairman and chief executive officer, essential utilities
i mean, yes, i think that's a fair estimate, hopefully not that long, but i think it would be fair to say it could be that long.
jonathan reeder -- wells fargo -- analyst
okay. great. and then i know you mentioned chester city council to move forward and signed the apa and they asked thaddeus kirk to give his blessing to it. what's kind of the process and time line for the receiver to act?
christopher franklin -- chairman and chief executive officer, essential utilities
yes. there's not a public time line for the receiver at this point. i think that's one of the things that the city is pressing for today is not necessarily -- the receiver has some important work to do. obviously, balancing the city's finances. but in the meantime, it is literally running out of money on the pensions. they're almost out of cash. and so it's very difficult to not do anything. so there are some impending let's just say, burning platforms that need to be addressed. so while the city is pressing the receiver, its next step would probably be to go to the commonwealth court that oversees the receiver and asks the receiver or the court for a defined time line. we understand that that's where they may go. but that's entirely up to the city and in terms of the next step.
jonathan reeder -- wells fargo -- analyst
okay. okay. yes. no, i thought i had read something about that pension issue and yes, they were just kind of a few months left. so i guess it would be your expectation that you could at least get something from the receiver prior to that. and then your bid has that upfront payment and that allows kind of chester to stay afloat.
christopher franklin -- chairman and chief executive officer, essential utilities
yes. yes, that's exactly right.
jonathan reeder -- wells fargo -- analyst
okay. well, good luck with that. looking forward to hear an update going forward.
christopher franklin -- chairman and chief executive officer, essential utilities
you bet. thank you.
daniel schuller -- executive vice president, chief financial officer, essential utilities
take care, jonathan.

[operator instructions] our next question comes from verity mitchell with hsbc.
christopher franklin -- chairman and chief executive officer, essential utilities
hey, verity.
verity mitchell -- hsbc -- analyst
morning, everybody, hi. i've got a question. i'm very interested in your opening remarks about rsg and capture from wastewater treatment plants. just quite a simple question, but i'm sure you'd like to unpack it a bit. is that -- would that be something that would be added to rate base if it was initiated? i mean, how does -- how do you recover the investment on capturing rsg from waterwall treatment plants?
christopher franklin -- chairman and chief executive officer, essential utilities
it's a great question. and i'm not sure we've fully come to terms with whether that's rate base or not. and i guess as you think about verity, let's step back one step first. most of our plants, and we have over 200 wastewater plants in the fleet now, but most of our plants are too small to consider an operation like this. so as we acquire a larger plant or as we build them -- i.e., delcora would be maybe an example -- are there opportunities to then create some energy? and i think when it comes down to whether it would be rate base or not, a lot of that question comes to what is the impact ultimately to the rate payer. and so as we think about -- there's a lot of moving parts to this, do we keep or sell any credits that we might gain and obviously, keeping the credit is good for our esg, selling the credit might be good for customers. so -- and i'm getting a little bit ahead of myself here because we don't even have a project like this yet. this is -- these are the things we're strongly considering as we start to acquire larger and larger facilities. but i think at the end of the story is probably more to come on this. and dan, i don't know if you have anything you want to comment in addition.
daniel schuller -- executive vice president, chief financial officer, essential utilities
no, not really. i mean, you can -- what we've seen in the past in certain situations, if someone has an anerobic digester, they generate rsg or are achieving their wastewater treatment plant, they would use that on site, potentially, that could be included in rate base, but there have been an offset in expense because there would be less in terms of purchased energy that would go to the customer. so that's another way to think about it. and sort of the next is here between the water wastewater business and the gas business, how that rsg is used or rng is used still to be determined here. but as chris said, verity, can think -- more to come on this one from us.
verity mitchell -- hsbc -- analyst
great. thanks.

operator
good day, and welcome to the essential utilities inc. q3 2021 earnings call. today's conference is being recorded. at this time, i would like to turn the conference over to brian dingerdissen. please go ahead, sir.
brian dingerdissen -- vice president, chief of staff, investor relations and communications, essential utilities
thank you, lauren. good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for essential utilities third quarter earnings call. i am brian dingerdissen, vice president and head of investor relations.
if you did not receive a copy of the press release, you can find it by visiting the investor relations section of our website at essential.co. the slides that we will be referencing and the webcast of this event can also be found on our website.
as a reminder, some of the matters discussed during this call may include forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause the actual results to be materially different from any future results expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. please refer to our most recent 10-q, 10-k and other sec filings for a description of such risks and uncertainties.
during the course of this call, reference may be made to certain non-gaap financial measures. a reconciliation of these non-gaap to gaap financial measures is included at the end of the presentation and also posted in the investor relations section of the company's website.
here's our agenda for the call today. we will start with chris franklin, our chairman and ceo, who will discuss the third quarter highlights and provide a company update. next, dan schuller, our cfo, will discuss our financial results. chris will then provide an update on our growth strategy, the municipal water and wastewater acquisition program and conclude the presentation portion before opening the call for questions.
with that, i will turn the call over to chris franklin.
christopher franklin -- chairman and chief executive officer, essential utilities
hey. thanks, brian, and good morning, everyone. thanks for joining us. let me start the call today with a thank you. thank you to many of you who took the time to participate in our recent investor perception study. we conduct that survey about every other year, and it helps us provide us with another perspective, an overall perspective, if you will, from investors which then supplements what we hear from all of you and our amount of about 300-plus meetings with investors throughout each year. we really appreciate the strong confidence that you expressed in management and in the work we're doing in that survey and especially around municipal acquisitions.
i do want to bring clarity though to one issue where there seems to be some ambiguity in the minds of at least a few investors about how we think about our work in natural gas. first, we're really proud of the work and the results our natural gas team is achieving. our careful study of the market indicates that natural gas, especially in our key service area of pittsburgh, pennsylvania, will be an important part of the energy mix for probably decades to come. and in less than 15 years, we will be at least 60% of the way toward our aspirational goal of net zero emissions.
so listen, we acknowledge the fact that natural gas utilities are currently achieving suboptimal trading multiples in the public markets; and this, despite the very high private market multiples achieved in recent natural gas company transactions. but with these things in mind, i want to be really crystal clear. growth through acquisition in natural gas is not in our strategy. our strategy in natural gas is to replace the nearly 3,000 miles of gas main to improve safety, reliability and the environment while generating the associated earnings per share.
we go one step further, our strategy is keenly focused on growing our water business through acquisition, and we have a very successful track record in doing this already. hopefully, you agree. i hope this clears any ambiguity that existed in the market around our growth strategy.
all right. with that, let's take a quick look at the third quarter highlights. the water and gas teams have been focused and working hard on infrastructure improvements. we are on pace to replace about 180 miles of water main this year and about 175 miles of gas main this year. on a combined basis, that's water and natural gas, we've invested about $676 million in infrastructure improvements throughout our systems in just the first nine months of this year as compared to about $608 million for the same period last year, and we remain on-track to spend about $1 billion in capital on infrastructure this year.
our heavy work on infrastructure improvements generated a busy year for our regulatory people as well. we had rate activity in two of our three natural gas states and seven out of our eight water states, including the filing of our pennsylvania water rate case back in august. and dan is going to give you a little bit more details on that in just a moment.
our municipal acquisition strategy remains strong as we announced the closing of the village of bourbonnais in illinois, and we added beaver falls, a wastewater system in pittsburgh to our growing list of pending acquisitions. in total, we've closed two acquisitions this year and have seven pending acquisitions. these nine acquisitions total over $500 million in purchase price.
i'm also pleased to announce that we were celebrated as a champion of board diversity by the forum for executive women. while we were also recognized for recently published esg report with multiple awards, our team did a really nice job. if you haven't had a chance to look at it, it's really worth the look. this is the third time we've received the champion of board diversity honor, which is awarded to the top public companies in our region with 30% or more women on their respective boards. really important work to us, and we're very proud of that.
we remain focused on reducing the company's carbon footprint. we've already made a significant progress toward our goal by replacing hundreds of miles of leak-prone gas pipe and by significantly increasing our use of renewable energy for our power needs.
you've heard this before, but our public commitment to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions by 60% before 2035 from a 2019 baseline has already produced a 5% reduction in the first year of our commitment. under our esg banner, we are evaluating initiatives in renewable natural gas, or rng; responsibly sourced gas or rsg and hydrogen. we currently procure rng from about six landfills and are looking for other opportunities to take rng, including into our distribution system for our utility customers.
we're also working with an engineering firm to evaluate rng facilities at some of our wastewater treatment plants, allowing synergies to be realized between our water and our gas businesses. as part of our increased focus on rng, we recently joined the rng coalition, which is an industry organization that advocates and educates for the sustainable development, deployment and utilization of rng.
and finally, we're having discussions with several potential partners regarding hydrogen pilots and hope to provide more details on a future earnings call as those concepts develop. i encourage all of you to review our again award-winning essential 2020 esg report, which highlights some of these environmental initiatives, along with several other initiatives.
all right. let's turn to a key operational challenge we faced, resulting from hurricane ida. just before labor day weekend, hurricane ida made its way through southeastern pennsylvania and poured nearly eight inches of rain in six hours on two of our key surface water treatment plants. to put that storm event in perspective, that's 20% of the annual rainfall we would normally expect in this region fell in six hours. this sustained and heavy rainfall in the pickering and perk creek watersheds resulted in flooding -- in record flooding in the philadelphia region, which made national news.
the picture you see here is an aerial view of our pickering west water treatment facility emerged from the storm. this is the largest plant in our fleet. at the height of the storm, we had to shut down the power and abandon this plant. if our team had stayed, they might have drowned in the eight feet of water that filled their offices. but immediately after the storm subsided, a cross-functional team of managers, employees and contractors worked around the clock to optimize our other plants because we need to bring water into this area, restore the damage plants and also communicate with our customers.
our ford county interconnected system allowed us to adjust our water distribution system to compensate for the loss of approximately 40% of our drinking water supply, which normally comes from the plant you see under water here. without the redundancy of our system, maintaining service to our customers would have been impossible and that's where our long-term planning really showed. we were pleased to maintain service for all of our customers with only a few isolated low-pressure issues.
now a storm like ida raises some important issues and questions for us and for other utilities for that matter. questions like, how would a smaller water utility respond to an event of this magnitude, especially a utility that does not have the level of resources or expertise that we have? another question is, will events like this cause even more smaller water and wastewater utility to consider exiting the business just because of the capital costs and other constraints that -- to overcome these type of issues? should we expect more extreme weather like this with climate change? a big question for all utilities. and finally, how much capital will we need to address issues like this one at our aqua and at other utilities across the country. these are important questions that we'll have to grapple with.
now on the next slide, i just want to point out the pictures here, you can see the damage and the team. and i'd be remiss if i didn't point out that it was the efforts of our workforce and their dedication to our customers that got our plants back online and allowed us to maintain service throughout that challenging time. i am really proud and honored to be part of such a resilient team. and to say they did a great job, would simply be an understatement.
we have a long list of lessons learned from this incident and are well into the planning necessary to overcome these challenges in the future.
all right. let's shift gears into the financials, and i'm going to pass the call along to dan. dan?
daniel schuller -- executive vice president, chief financial officer, essential utilities
thanks, chris, and good morning, everyone. before i move into our results, knowing the question is likely coming, please keep in mind that we have insurance to help mitigate impacts of a storm event like ida. and while not certain, we'll also seek to recover any storm-related costs not covered by insurance. that said, however, the results we'll describe next include the revenue impact of voluntary conservation efforts and the increased expenses associated with ida. furthermore, we'd expect any major changes in the pickering treatment plan configuration to be included in future capital plans.
let's start with the third quarter financial highlights. we ended the third quarter with revenues of $361.9 million, up about 3.8% from last year. our regulated water segment contributed $259.9 million and our regulated natural gas segment contributed $94.8 million. o&m expenses increased 2.3% to $139.4 million in the third quarter, up from $136.2 million in the third quarter of last year. net income was down year-over-year from $55.7 million to $50.5 million and gaap earnings per share decreased from $0.22 to $0.19.
next, we'll walk through the waterfall slides, starting with revenue. as we walk through the $13.2 million revenue increase in the third quarter of 2021, you'll notice the main drivers were purchased gas, adding $8.7 million and rates and surcharges contributing $8.2 million. q3 2020 rate credit growth from our regulated water segment and other provided an additional $6.9 million toward the revenue increase. these revenue increases were offset by decreased volume, resulting in a $9.6 million decline in our water segment and an approximately $1 million reduction in our gas segment.
as a result of the weather conditions, the return to post-covid normalcy and ida-related conservation in pennsylvania, we experienced water consumption reduction in seven of our eight water states.
i'd like to pause here for a moment and discuss the impact of the increase in natural gas prices. while heating degree days in the third quarter were down when compared to the same period in 2020, gas prices have significantly increased year-over-year as you've read in the news. due to increased gas commodity costs, we anticipate that our average customer bill for the 2021, 2022 winter heating season be approximately 25% higher than last winter. however, there's some important things to note.
prior to the recent run-up in gas commodity costs, the commodity itself only represented about 20% of the typical peoples customers build. even with these increased gas commodity costs, the anticipated 1,130 bill is far short of the record highs from 2008 when the average annual bill was approximately $1,800. also, we have approximately 47% of our winter gas needs already in storage, much of which was purchased at significantly lower prices than today's spot prices, which helps to dampen the impact of the commodity price increase.
and lastly, i'd point out that the people -- i'd point out that the prices that people pay for natural gas are consistently discounted compared to the nymex due to the basis differential that exists between nymex and the marcellus basin pricing. this is a real advantage of procuring and providing locally sourced natural gas.
with that, let's take a more detailed look at water consumption by customer class. we wanted to take the opportunity to update you on water usage trends as more of the population returns to pre-covid lifestyle. for the third quarter, water usage declined by 5.2% from last year, returning to the 2019 level of approximately 19 billion gallons. the continued trend of businesses reopening and our customers returning to their workplaces, along with weather impacts and conservation efforts in pennsylvania to hurricane ida resulted in a residential usage decrease of 8.1% and a commercial usage increase of 2.8% when compared to the same period in 2020.
as a reminder, historically, in the water business, we see a natural decline of about 1% annually as customers change out older appliances and fixtures.
operations and maintenance expenses were $139.4 million for the third quarter, up 2.3% compared to $136.2 million in the third quarter of 2020. the main driver was employee-related costs of $6.8 million for the quarter, which included $1.7 million of increased medical costs, plus pension expenses and normal employee expenses. similar to last quarter, the increase in medical expenses over 2020 was expected as many people that had delayed nonemergency medical visits have begun to catch up on physicals and other medical appointments. other items, including hurricane ida repair expenses added $3.8 million, and growth in production costs for the regulated water segment added another $1.9 million. however, these increases were offset by almost $9.4 million in covid-19 costs when compared to q3 2020. and you'll recall, though, that was really bad debt and some sort of onetime bonuses we did last year for nonmanagement employees.
we're starting to experience some inflation-related increases, specifically in the areas of fuel, chemicals and insurance and we're reflecting those in our 2022 budget. and next, we'll review the earnings per share waterfall.
gaap eps for the third quarter decreased by $0.03 from $0.22 in 2020 to $0.19 this year. as we mentioned on the last call, we expected this quarter to be at the lower end of the range we provided for q3 early in the year. rates and surcharges added $0.022. the q3 2020 rate credits contributed $0.011 and growth from our regulated water segment, another $0.04. these were offset by o&m of $0.028 and lower volume from both our regulated water segment and our regulated natural gas segment of $0.029 combined and another $0.05 from other items, which brought us to gaap eps of $0.19 for the third quarter of 2021. for the full year, presuming normal weather, our earnings per share results should be around the midpoint of our stated guidance range of $1.64 to $1.69.
moving on to rate activity and other matters. so far in 2021, we've completed rate cases or surcharges in seven of our eight water states with total annualized revenue of $31 million. in our regulated natural gas segment, we've completed rate case or surcharge filings in pennsylvania and kentucky, with total annualized revenue of $1.3 million. we currently have base rate cases underway for our regulated water segment subsidiaries in ohio and pennsylvania as well as for one of our regulated natural gas subsidiaries, the one in kentucky, known as delta natural gas.
as many of you know, we filed the rate case of our aqua pennsylvania subsidiary in august, in line with the three-year rate case cadence we had outlined previously. the primary driver of the rate case filing is the $1.1 billion in capital investments since the last case. these expenditures funded the replacement of more than 400 miles of aging water mains and associated valve services and hydrants throughout aqua pennsylvania, approximately 5,800 miles distribution system, plus wastewater treatment plant upgrades, pfas filters and our new pinar laboratory. these types of investments in the communities that we serve allow us to continue our long history of consistently providing safe drinking water to our customers and returning clean treated wastewater to the environment.
now one unique aspect of this filing is the request for the first water-focused universal services program in pennsylvania. we were asked to file this as part of our peoples acquisition settlement and we're looking forward to having a universal services program as an important way of helping our low-income water and wastewater customers. while we're often viewed as having a suburban customer base, in fact, approximately 10% of our water and wastewater customers here in pennsylvania are living below the federal poverty level.
in terms of the schedule, direct testimony is due on november 10 and evidentiary hearings are scheduled before the holidays. we anticipate having new rates effective in may of 2022.
and with that, i'll hand it back over to chris.
christopher franklin -- chairman and chief executive officer, essential utilities
great. thanks, dan. let's talk a little bit about our status of municipal transactions. and you can see on this slide that during the quarter, we announced the closing of the village of bourbonnais. this wastewater system serves about 6,500 customers in kankakee county, illinois. and then in october, we announced the signing of an asset purchase agreement with beaver falls, and this was a wastewater system in the pittsburgh area, which serves about 7,600 customer equivalents. and this one is important because it gives us a water foothold in western pennsylvania in addition to our already strong gas platform in that same area. so it's an important one for us.
now as of this call, we've signed seven asset purchase agreements, and they're all pending, which will add over 234,000 customers or customer equivalents and a total of 460 -- almost $468 million in purchase price. these seven pending transactions, plus the two closed transactions will add over 241,000 customers or customer equivalents again and a total of over $500 million in combined purchase price.
we remain confident that we will close the delcora transaction, the litigation with delaware county regarding the enforceability of our asset purchase agreement with delcora was heard by a three-judge panel in pennsylvania, the commonwealth court, back on october 18 of this year, just a couple of weeks ago. and a decision is expected in the first half of next year. we're also still hopeful that we can reach a settlement with the county, which would help accelerate the closing of this transaction. i'm sure i'll answer questions when you have them in a few moments.
in addition to the signed municipal transactions we just discussed, our pipeline of municipal opportunities remained healthy and strong. key contributors to the strength of our pipeline include fair market value legislation in all of our states, the fair regulatory environments where we operate now, and where we operate the strong offering of solutions we bring to municipalities, including low-cost capital, our expertise and long-term rate stability.
now this table includes acquisition opportunities where we are engaged in active discussions with municipalities. as the slide demonstrates, we are actively pursuing about 400,000 potential water and wastewater customers. so a very healthy pipeline.
many of you have asked about the chester water authority. it's in the news all the time. you'll recall that this is a water utility with about 44,000 customers that serves in two counties in southeastern pennsylvania, along with the city of chester.
on september 16, the pennsylvania commonwealth court ruled in a 5-2 decision that the city of chester is the rightful owner of the chester water authority. pending approval from the state appointed receiver, city is in a bankruptcy proceeding. but -- so the state appointed receiver, the city now plans to sign an asset purchase agreement with aqua to sell the asset. in fact, just after the court decision was released, the chester city council unanimously passed the public ordinance declaring aqua the winner of its request for proposal process and requesting that the receiver expeditiously provide approval to sell the chester water authority to aqua.
all right. let me wrap up the formal remarks today by reaffirming our 2021 guidance as we continue to expect earnings to be between $1.64 to $1.69 per share. our capital plan continues to remain on-track as we anticipate spending about $1 billion this year on regulated infrastructure and about $3 billion across our essential platform by 2023.
as we indicated last quarter, the final mix of our 2021 capital spending will be weighted toward the regulated water segment. customer growth is expected to be between 2% and 3%, and on average for our regulated water segment. and even as delcora transaction has been pushed out in time, we remain confident in our ability to achieve this 5% to 7% earnings growth over the three-year period ending in 2023. this is our current guidance period.
and finally, our commitment and our continued progress on environmental stewardship, sustainable business practices, employee safety, diversity and inclusion, customer experience, and community engagement allows us to demonstrate our leadership on esg-related issues in the industry.
and with that, let me conclude my formal remarks and turn it over to you, lauren, to open the call for questions. thank you.
