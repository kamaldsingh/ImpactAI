jimmy a. brock -- president and chief executive officer
thank you mitesh, and good morning everyone. i am pleased to announce, that this morning we reported a solid third quarter operating, and financial performance while continuing to make significant progress, on various fronts that, we believe will ultimately be value-accretive to our shareholders. despite the ongoing volatility, in the commodity and capital markets we made progress on all key fronts. our operations team turned in a record third quarter production as they were able to leverage our strong sales contract book which the marketing team has been building over several years. on the finance front we were very active in the open market repurchasing our debt, and equity securities, with the ultimate goal of reducing our cost of capital and accelerating shareholder value creation as we took advantage of the dislocations created in the marketplace. consistent with last quarter we continued to be rate of return-driven and deployed most of our capital toward buying back our debt and equity securities rather than toward any of our growth initiatives as we believe those remain the most under-weighed avenues of per share value. as a result during the quarter consol energy repurchased approximately 5% of the company's outstanding common shares in the open market for just over $23 million.
we also made, net payments of total debt of approximately $21.5 million during the quarter. now let me review, our third quarter operational performance in detail. our operation team delivered a record third quarter production overcoming several issues some of them were expected such as long-haul moves and minor vacations. while some were unexpected, such as an unusual amount of equipment breakdowns and a roof fall at one of our longwalls. our operation team deserves a lot of credit as it was able to manage through these events and deliver a record third quarter production of 6.5 million tons compared to 6.4 million tons in the year-ago period. productivity as measured by tons per employee hour was improved compared to the year-ago period. nonetheless our cash cost of production increased compared to the year-ago period due to a higher than normal level of repair and maintenance expenses associated with these issues. for its share ccr produced 1.62 million tons of coal during the third quarter of '19 compared to 1.5 million tons during the third quarter of '18. the consol marine terminal had a throughput volume of 2.4 million tons during the quarter compared to 2.7 million tons in the year-ago period. as reported earlier in the year the terminal successfully completed a major project during the quarter to replace its rotary dumper which is a critical piece of infrastructure and has been in service for more than 35 years.
our investment, in the new dumper has to ensure that the terminal, is well positioned to reliably serve the growing export markets for our coal. given the terms of our take-or-pay contract at the terminal our terminal revenues for the quarter were largely unchanged at $16.3 million compared to $16.1 million in the year-ago period while cash operating costs were improved by approximately $1.1 million. as previously announced cmt has a take-or-pay contract that yields approximately $15 million in quarterly terminal revenue through 2020. this is a very steady but strategically important business for us and one of the key drivers of our differentiated marketing strategy. with that, let me now provide an overview of the coal markets and an update on our sales performance and accomplishments. the commodity markets went under a lot of pressure during the first half of '19. however we are starting to see some improvements. on the export front after declining approximately 44% through june of 2019 api2 process started recovering and ended the third quarter approximately 22% higher versus the low point at the end of the second quarter. more importantly the forward curve is in contango. fourth quarter of 20 api2 prices now sit just below $70 a ton or approximately 18% higher compared to the near-month price. although the majority of our export coal doesn't price off the api2 we still have some volumes going into europe and it is a directional indicator of improving end markets for the seaborne thermal coal demand. another positive trend that we are seeing is the export market is in supply rationalization.
coal producers have started rationalizing production. several high cost, and unhedged coal producers in the u.s. have started cutting production and industry sources are calling for a steep decline in u.s. thermal coal exports. for instance dtc expects u.s. thermal coal exports to decline to 26 million tons in 2020 from 56 million tons in 2018 or a 54% decline. globally the situation is not much different. colombian coal exports are projected to fall by 9 million tons or 13% in 2019 versus 2018 levels. some producers are still maintaining significant amounts of production at below breakeven economics and could be the next to make production cuts. indonesia is a relevant example. according to wood mackenzie, 60% of indonesia's total bituminous seaborne export coals or approximately 72 million tons have negative operating margins at september price levels of $63 per ton. in the domestic markets trends are mixed. henry hub natural gas prices remained low during the quarter which weighed on power prices and impacted coal consumption. as a result overall stockpiles of coal at domestic utilities have continued to increase throughout the year. the interesting aspect here is that natural gas producers continue to struggle financially. as we enter the annual budget season we expect e&p producers to meaningfully reduce their projected 2020 capital spending. as such we are optimistic that prices could recover but are preparing ourselves for this depressed pricing environment to continue through 2020.
in summary, there is a lot of pain in the marketplace but we are starting to see some underlying improvements through supply rationalization and recovering export prices. as the industry goes through this curing process we expect to hold our ground. we anticipate that our strong contracted position in 2020 and solid balance sheet will allow us to navigate through this period of low pricing and preserve value for our shareholders. moving to our own marketing performance. we reported, that we increased our third quarter '19 sales volumes and total revenues by approximately 4% and 3% respectively compared to the third quarter of '18. our average revenue per ton declined by 1.3% primarily driven by 20% lower pjm west power prices which impacted our netback related contracts. our ability to achieve revenue growth even in a declining commodity price environment is a testament to our prudent contract and strategy that is based on derisking our revenue and production profiles while locking in attractive returns for our business. during the quarter we were also successful in landing on additional contracts for 2020 and 2021. let me now move on and provide an update on our growth efforts. over the last several quarters we have discussed our strategy to pursue growth opportunities.
let me summarize, the four major categories of these initiatives and how they fit into the context of our overall business strategy. i will lay out the broad framework and then david will discuss how some of these fit into our overall capital allocation process. if you refer to slide six. we expect to pursue growth in four different ways: first efficiency and continuous improvement. these are relatively small-dollar value projects that either raise our production capacity or lower our operating cost at existing operations. share automation and prep plant debottlenecking are some examples. second emerging technologies and alternative uses of coal. such projects, will involve a new technology or an innovative use of coal. by the way -- by their very nature they are r&d type projects involve a technical collaboration and have long gestational periods. we currently have several of these in the pipeline. our omnis project falls into this category. our initial spend on such projects is relatively modest but could grow significantly once certain milestones are achieved. given the high risk high-reward nature of these investments we take a portfolio approach and plan to make small investments in multiple projects. if one of them achieves its full potential it could be a home run.
third organic growth projects, and expansions of our core mining business. these projects are well aligned with our skill set carry low technological risk and are expected to become meaningful contributors when completed. they require a larger initial investment outlay relative to the previous two types of projects. itmann is a perfect example of this. and finally possible acquisitions or other strategic transactions. we regularly evaluate these types of potential transactions to find the dominant era. we haven't found one yet but we will continue to explore our options irrespective of which category the project falls in. our overall strategy is to focus on opportunities for high target rates of returns meaningful revenue potential long-term cash flow generation and the ability to grow the base investment over time.
with that, let me hand the call over to david.
david m. khani -- executive vice president, treasurer and chief financial officer
thanks jimmy, and good morning. i will, first go through some industry trends as it relates to financing and how they tie to our capital allocation process. i will then provide an update on our third quarter results and guidance. one of the trends that, we are seeing in the energy industry the declining access to capital. on slide seven you will notice that the e&p industry raised $81 billion in capital in 2014 and now is on pace to only raised $13 billion for 2019 suggesting an 84% decline. companies, are being forced to rely on internal funding sources. e&p companies have two near-term issues to deal with. first is their semiannual bank redeterminations on the revolvers and second is institutional or bank debt coming due. for the revolvers commercial banks are using as low as $5 per barrel for oil and $2 per mcf for henry hub natural gas prices to base their redeterminations. s&p global market estimates there's approximately $150 billion of debt coming due in the e&p space over, the next three years. we are watching initial capital spending budgets coming down meaningfully to pay down debt and prepare for the imminent refinancing wave. this is leading to a slowing of production and should raise the forward curve at some point. now let's discuss coal. we are also noticing a similar trend here as well. this trend is marked by a decline in commodity prices and a flurry of recent coal company bankruptcies making investors concerned.
we noticed, a similar trend in 2016 before access to the capital rebound in 2017, with the rebound in coal prices and improving earnings profile. why does all this matter? first from a coal industry standpoint this forces corporations to fund their projects with internally generated cash flow. it becomes harder to fund long duration and very capital-intensive projects. as existing mines to fleet and new investments become scarce supply will decline in created deficit. this deficit should provide fundamental support for coal prices. the cure for low prices is low prices. as jimmy discussed we are already seeing coal production cuts in columbia and in the u.s. and we expect to see them occur in indonesia at some point. second from a consol energy perspective this validates our strategy to continue to reduce our debt. as such s&p credit rating agency just reaffirmed our debt ratings last week. debt reduction is an important part of our capital allocation strategy and dictates the amount of risk that we want to carry on our balance sheet. since our listing in 2017 we have significantly reduced our net debt by approximately 20% and our term loans and our outstanding second lien notes by $210 million or 26%. we are committed to further deleveraging our balance sheet. as you all know we completed our debt refinancing in march of 2019 which lowered our interest rate and extended our maturities to 2023 and beyond. we will use this flexibility to continue to reduce our reliance on public debt markets.
we plan, to reduce our outstanding public debt by at least $25 million in the fourth quarter and release an additional $50 million in 2020. we will continue fine-tune these goals and will remain rate of return driven. in the fourth quarter-to-date we have already repurchased approximately $16 million of our second lien debt as our debt traded at a discount to par value. to put this in perspective we repurchased approximately $76 million of our second lien notes at an average price of $105 since we issued them in 2017. we're only able to redeem these notes on or after november 15 2021 at a coal price of $105.50. with our strong balance sheet solid contracted position, and our low maintenance capital we are in a position to generate free cash flow in all parts of the cycle. we can flex our capital spending up and down to generate a free cash flow outcome and do not have any large funding commitments in 2020. with our capital allocation strategy we have several avenues to improve revenue and returns. first repurchasing our debt and equity securities. we've historically focused approximately 84% of repurchasing activity on debt. with a significant discount that our debt is trading at currently we believe that our capital deployment mix will continue favor debt reduction. second is our gross initiatives. this is another key area of value creation for us and we began articulating earlier this year. jimmy just provided much more insight into our thought process and our four buckets of deployment.
these buckets, have various -- varying degrees of capital needs. the efficiency bucket has very high rates of return and directly impacts our existing operations through higher production and/or up lower operating costs. the technology bucket carries a higher risk but also very high rates of returns with big addressable markets that could be meaningful to our bottom line within two to five years. we fund these projects through small initial outlays of less than $5 million that can either piggyback other season capital or have government support associated with them to offset risk and accelerate commercial viability. the organic growth bucket will be projects that typically fall under our existing skill set. we would invest anywhere from $50 million to $100 million in such ventures but they will move the needle on ceix's per share values and cash flow contribution while diversifying our cash flow streams over time. finally our m&a bucket is still a work in progress for us. we haven't committed to anything here what we review and analyze many opportunities. in summary while we are focused on executing our base plan to navigate through this part of the cycle we are also working on ways to elevate revenue streams and returns through a thoughtful investment approach. while we invest in our portfolio of opportunities we fully anticipate continue to reduce our debt and opportunistically buy back equity since we expect to generate free cash flow.
with that, let me now recap the third quarter results and give an update on our 2019 guidance. we will review ceix first and then ccr. ceix reported net income attributable to ceix shareholders of $4.3 million or $0.16 per diluted share. ceix also reported adjusted ebitda of $82.4 million and organic free cash flow of $8.9 million. this compares to net income of attributable ceix shareholders of $5.7 million adjusted ebitda of $83 million and organic free cash flow of $11.4 million in the year-ago quarter. the decline in our earnings metrics compared to the year-ago period mostly the result of lower pjm west power prices higher cost and a higher tax rate. our fixed domestic and export contracts performed well in the quarter. during the quarter we generated $57.4 million of cash flow from operations and spent $48.5 million in capital expenditures resulting in $8.9 million of organic free cash flow. now let me update you on ccr. this morning ccr reported net income of $7 million adjusted ebitda of $20 million and distributable cash flow of $9.2 million.
this compares to $8.6 million $21.8 million and $10.7 million, respectively in the year-ago quarter. in the third quarter '19 ccr generated $20.4 million in net cash flow from operating activities. after accounting for $11.3 million in capital expenditures and $14.4 million in distribution payment our net debt increased by $6.2 million. this is typical for us during the third quarter which is normally our weakest quarter of the year. year-to-date we maintained a 1x distribution coverage. ccr finished the quarter with a net leverage ratio of 1.6x essentially flat from last quarter. now let me provide you with an outlook for 2019. as stated before our guidance philosophy continues to measure risk and capture a multitude of outcomes in our guidance ranges which protects us against unforeseen situations. we reaffirm our full year 2019 guidance based on our year-to-date results and expectations for the fourth quarter.
with that let me turn it back to jimmy to make some final comments.
jimmy a. brock -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, david. before we move onto the q&a session, let me provide some final thoughts about how we have been preparing for 2020. first, we have a strong contracted position which grew once again this quarter. we are constantly in touch with our customers and have a few more bids out there for 2020. we would like to be above a 90% contracted position by year-end which is typical for us. also remember that we are basing our contracted position statistics on achieving a near-record production run rate of 27 million tons at the pennsylvania mining complex. export markets are challenging right now. and there is a widespread fear among investors that all u.s. coal producers, will have to retreat significantly from the export markets resulting in significant ebitda decline. consol energy is not a swing producer in the export market. we have been in tough markets many times before and we have successfully navigated through each one. we refer to slide eight, and note 2016 as an example. it wasn't easy then and we don't expect it to be easy now. our terminal at baltimore our contract with esco our coal quality and our low-cost operations have provided us with a solid base contracting position of 7 million export tons in 2020 from which we can build a pulp. for example if we contract at the same 7 million tons into the export market for 2021 our contracted position in that year just to 62% assuming a 27 million ton run rate.
second, we have continued to invest in our minds through these cycles. and if the market conditions warranted. as it has always been our strategy we are prepared to run to the market demands in 2020. this would not only allow us to reduce our capital spending needs but also reduce our operating costs as we scale back on overtime maintenance costs and reduce the overall need for equipment repair. third slowing down gross spend. as we highlighted earlier we have various buckets for gross spending. as our debt and equity securities become more attractively priced the return expectations on new or even approved and existing project become higher. given the fact that most of our projects do not call for a significant capital commitment at any given time we have the optionality to extend the execution period or adjust the timing of the projects to prioritize other uses of cash. in summary we are committed to generating free cash flow in all parts of the commodity cycle. when times are challenging we will make choices and adjustments necessary to achieve our goals. we did that in 2016 and we are able to do it again if necessary.
regardless of the external challenges, facing the space our team's dedication to responsible operations remained unchanged. to that end we are pleased to announce our commitment to become a better coal supplier. better coal was established by a group of major coal buyers to promote the continuous improvement of sustainability performance in the coal supply chain. as a bare coal supplier we have recently participated in an independent assessment of our operations against the better coal code an internationally recognized standard of ethical social and environmental operating principles for the global coal mining industry. we are proud to be the only u.s. operator to have all active operations assessed against these standards. this effort complements our continued emphasis on esg and aligns with our principal core values of safety compliance and continuous improvement.
with that, let me hand the call back over to mitesh for instructions on the q&a.
mitesh thakkar -- director of finance and investor relations
thank you, jimmy. we'll, now move to the q&a session of the call. nick can you please provide the instruction to our callers.

[operator instructions] first question comes from lucas pipes b. riley fbr. go ahead, please.
lucas pipes -- b. riley fbr -- analyst
thank you very much and good morning, everybody.
jimmy a. brock -- president and chief executive officer
good morning, lucas.
david m. khani -- executive vice president, treasurer and chief financial officer
good morning, lucas.
lucas pipes -- b. riley fbr -- analyst
so i have a bigger picture question and it relates to the recent maria energy filing. and in cnx gas' 10-k it notes that it could be liable so that cnx gas. it could be liable for liabilities assumed by murray energy in connection with the disposition of certain mines to murray energy in 2013 in the event that both murray energy and consol energy unable to satisfy those liabilities. how do you think about potential liabilities for murray energy? would very much appreciate your thoughts on that situation?
jimmy a. brock -- president and chief executive officer
okay. well, we do not believe, that there's a valid basis for consolidated label for murray liabilities required from cnx. at the time of the murray transaction in december of 2013 the assets of consolidation coal company were profitable and we believe they still are. per murray's public filings murray's coact obligations are current as of the bankruptcy and murray will remain current on such obligations during the bankruptcy. so therefore that's about all we have on the liabilities. it's a complicated bankruptcy and we will stay tuned for whatever other developments there are.
lucas pipes -- b. riley fbr -- analyst
got it. and when you say the coact-related liabilities those would be the only ones at disposition? or could there be kind of other pockets of liabilities outside of coact-related?
jimmy a. brock -- president and chief executive officer
yes in the event of chapter 11 reorganization we do not believe there's any basis for consolidatable for the murray liabilities. there are other liabilities that was acquired there when we did the transaction but we believe that the assets of consolidation coal company and its subsidiaries should be reorganized in chapter 11.
lucas pipes -- b. riley fbr -- analyst
got it. that's helpful. thank thank you very much jimmy. and then second question is in regards to ceix and ccr. and i believe there's about a $163 million affiliate company credit agreement at the rate of about 3.75% kind of ceix being the lender. and given the cost of debt in the capital markets today for coal producers unfortunately including ceix would there be -- wouldn't there be an interest of ceix shareholders for this debt meaning ccr stead to ceix to be repaid as quickly as possible even if it means a lower distribution for some period of time?
david m. khani -- executive vice president, treasurer and chief financial officer
yes, and good question. and i would just say that lucas, if you noticed that when we created that intercompany loan we did that at the time of the spin. and we generated excess free cash flow above the distribution and we actually have been paying it down. we took that from $200 million down to $163 million or so. so we have actually been paying it down. and when we put the -- when we put that intercompany loan in place we had to go replace a much larger revolver with a smaller revolver and we actually put much tighter covenants in there as well. so there was a lot of a give and take when we created that piece of debt and company safety coming alone. so -- and i think what you're kind of also getting at is our distribution policy for ccr because obviously if we cut the distribution we would be able to pay down that debt. and i think what we will -- we look at that every quarter but we effectively look at the distribution on an annualized basis and we will continue to do that. and so -- but we do look at it every quarter. so right now we are at a 1x coverage. and so we did not feel like there was a need to cut the distribution this stuff.
jimmy a. brock -- president and chief executive officer
yes. and lucas we have responsibilities for ceix and ccr. and today's point we look at that on an annualized basis. but basically it comes down to a board decision. so we look at that every quarter whether or not we generated a coverage enough to pay distributions or on an annualized basis are we going to be at the one coverage mark and that pretty much drives our decisions.
lucas pipes -- b. riley fbr -- analyst
very, very helpful. and maybe, just one quick follow-up. if in the event that the distribution coverage ratio at ccr goes below 1x that's -- i mean that's where you kind of would draw the line and would reduce the distribution back to a 1x coverage or maybe more than that?
david m. khani -- executive vice president, treasurer and chief financial officer
so, i would say that's an important factor because we need to look at the sustainability of that distribution. but we also look at the level of leverage and liquidity inside the company too. so it's a multitude of factors. but i think one of the key ones is the coverage ratio.
lucas pipes -- b. riley fbr -- analyst
okay, really appreciate it. and thank you for that detail, and continue best of luck.
jimmy a. brock -- president and chief executive officer
thanks lucas.
david m. khani -- executive vice president, treasurer and chief financial officer
thanks lucas.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from mark levin seaport global. please go ahead.
mark levin -- seaport global -- analyst
thanks very much. so david i want to follow-up with a question that i asked you last quarter about how to think about 2020 revenue per ton? i think you mentioned that the degradation of the fall would not be material. and then i think you said not worse than five -- down 5%. i guess as you sit here 90 days later or roughly 90 days later. is that still the same way you see 2020 revenue per ton?
jimmy a. brock -- president and chief executive officer
mark this is jim. i'm going to take that. our expectations are that we are going to be within that 5%.
mark levin -- seaport global -- analyst
okay great. so still the way you kind of see the world. and jim since i have you so when you think about the export situation. i know you guys export a lot of coal into india and pet coke prices in india have come down materially. how does the change in pet coke pricing affect your outlook for napp exports to india in 2020?
jimmy a. brock -- president and chief executive officer
in general mark the market in india is very volatile at the current time. so we do market against somewhat against the pet coke numbers we do market against the api2 and api4 some as well. at the end of the day the brick hill business the cement business is all really basically negotiated. so while in the last few days we have seen a big drop in the pet coke price also in the last few days we have seen some business offered into the marketplace with netbacks slightly above 40%. so we are just going to go as the year goes we are in solid shape. we don't have to be in a hurry to book business today and we expect the volatility will come our way.
mark levin -- seaport global -- analyst
got it. now that makes sense. and then as you think about -- and maybe this is for jimmy or david itmann and how you think about itmann at this point? i know you have the ability to do it in sections and you have the ability to spread the capital out over time. i'm just wondering given the decline in met prices quarter-over-quarter. is there a point at which you would or a met price or u.s. olive oil met price that you would look at and say you know what need to kind of cool our heels? and how are you guys thinking about capex with related -- related to that project in 2020 and beyond?
jimmy a. brock -- president and chief executive officer
yes mark, you're right on point with all of those assumptions. so currently today we are continuing with the itmann project because we have -- we are doing those presplits. we're doing the construction work. we had already planned to put one section in there just to kind of make sure that the same is consistent with what our core data tells us. but you're absolutely right. we do have the ability to flex that capital spend. and today's point we try to stay with that capital allocation process that yields the highest rate of returns. so there could become a time for itmann that we see the market is staying kind of flat not where we want it to be that we would take that cash and put it toward something else that's creating a higher rate of return. but currently as we said today we are still on schedule. the itmann process -- project is going very well. we expect to have production sometime in q1 and the team is working hard there. so talent could be really good for us. we'll see what happens when we get ready to produce the coal there. but yes we do have the optionality to go full speed ahead or to pull back and wait for the market.
david m. khani -- executive vice president, treasurer and chief financial officer
just going to add that. because we don't put out large capital at one-time in any one thing that we do have that flexibility to be very rate of return driven and that's a key part of our ability to generate the highest rates of return, if it slight ...
mark levin -- seaport global -- analyst
and david, just to follow up on something. i think you said i just want to make sure i was clear on this. it sounded to me like you had said i may have not heard it correctly but you've already retired about $16 million of debt in the fourth quarter. and it also sounded to me like that and again correct me if i'm wrong but it sounded to me like that there will be -- continue to be a very strong emphasis on debt repurchases in 2020. i mean do you look at the rate of returns on the debt versus the equity? i mean do you feel like they're -- that there's a greater -- maybe leaning more toward debt than equity at this point? is that a fair representation or not necessarily?
david m. khani -- executive vice president, treasurer and chief financial officer
i think that's a fair, representation that because of where our debt is trading at and because of what we are seeing in the marketplace on the access to the capital markets. i think we feel it's more prudent. and that's why we will -- we look at this every quarter. we stress test our balance sheet with what we look out into the future and then we adjust accordingly. we look at our leverage we look at our liquidity and we always want to make sure we are staying ahead of the trends and not -- and again that's why we don't put a lot of capital out at one moment in time it gets stuck where we can't pivot when we need to pivot.
mark levin -- seaport global -- analyst
got it. and i'll sneak one more in. so just on northern app pricing to the extent that you wanted to put stuff to bid in 2020 and '21 in terms of what is available. when we see quoted prices from coal desk and places like that you can see numbers today that are sub or around $40. is that a real number? i mean do you feel like that if you went to go put tons to bed at 20 -- for 2020 or 2021 it would be around $40? or is that not necessarily right?
jimmy a. brock -- president and chief executive officer
well mark, let me answer it this way. we're in the middle of some negotiations. so i don't want to talk about pricing specifically. but i have dan's coal desk numbers here on my -- in front of me from yesterday. this profit was $40.10. this q '20 was $41.40, $22.60 for '21 and $44.55 for the ensuing year. i have business that we are working on right now that i expect we will do better than those numbers.
mark levin -- seaport global -- analyst
fantastic. good stuff jim. congrats on a good job these guys on the quarter. i appreciate it.
jimmy a. brock -- president and chief executive officer

our next question comes from daniel scott from clarkson. please go ahead.
daniel scott -- clarkson -- analyst
hi, thanks very much. good morning guys.
jimmy a. brock -- president and chief executive officer
good morning dan.
daniel scott -- clarkson -- analyst
you listed in the release comment about one of the longwalls in the second quarter and entered a new lower sulfur region of the reserves and that that was going to open up some new markets availability for you guys. can you talk about which markets that is? how long that lower sulfur production is expected to last? and i think you actually said it had improved mining conditions as well in the release. so is that actually going to be a downward pressure on costs?
david m. khani -- executive vice president, treasurer and chief financial officer
i'll take the first part, of it and then turn it over to jimmy. but as far as moving over into the lower sulfur area of the mine. we have -- we are successful there mining our first longwall panel now. and as far as the new markets and jimmy will talk a little more in detail about it. but our hope was that we could get more crossover metallurgical coal in that market. and the mining conditions to answer those. we're only in our first panel we have mined probably 1/3 of the panel but we are seeing improved conditions as far as the roof but it's too early to tell on how that entire district of that block is going to play out. but i can tell you the average software content for those reserves over there is shown in our models that it's around forecaster 2.3% to 2.4% soft.
jimmy a. brock -- president and chief executive officer
i mean, it should be that way for five or six years into the future. the first longwall ella fork had moved from the north to the eastern fields in early summer. the second one will move later this quarter. and when that happens with two longwalls running in relatively low sulfur on the fork and one running in relatively low sulfur at harvey. so what's that done for us? well first of all in q3 the quarter just passed we shipped 650000 tons of crossover met. that's the most we shipped in a quarter in a while. annualize that that's up to $2.6 million. and as you know for these last several years and including this year we have been in the $1.7 million to $1.8 million range. so we see a big benefit there. the other place dan is that we have customers both in the midwest and in the southeast that blend coal with capcos and/or with prb coals. and our low sulfur we think will give us a chance to get our low btu -- our high btus into this market to replace cap and/or prb. all right.
daniel scott -- clarkson -- analyst
that's good color. i'd say going into the quarter results that on the investor side there were some concerns that even though you're extremely well contracted this year and next that there might be some flavor of pushbacks or blend and extend or test for cancellation. and clearly by moving every ton of a record production quarter that seems to be not the case. but if you could just give a little more color on kind of how the existing contracts are holding up through the end of next year? and how the new business you contracted kind of blends in with that?
jimmy a. brock -- president and chief executive officer
well, first of all dan in your best and/or your worst years you have some customer pushback based upon maybe maintenance problems at their plant or something like that. and we have had some limited pushback but all of it basically isolated to one or two customers. so pushback has not been a big problem for us to date in 2019. going forward i mean we are really excited about some opportunities that we have right on the horizon. but let me just say that i've learned long ago until i have the signature on the contract i don't put that into the sold column. so we are working hard to get that done. i think there's a part of your question and i'm missing. was that everything?
daniel scott -- clarkson -- analyst
basically just the new business and how that's consistent with the behavior of the existing contracts. you expect it all to be kind of on schedule on time.
jimmy a. brock -- president and chief executive officer
i expect to have some new longer-term contracts that are on schedule on time yes.
daniel scott -- clarkson -- analyst
okay, great. and then last question for me. in the measured approach to growth slides i noticed in the m&a column which seems to be kind of the most distant at the moment given your debt and equity valuations. but under the column of diversifying its clicked at a yes. now just -- can you in the event you were to go into the m&a market? is that basically implying your -- it wouldn't be complementary high btu thermal coal it would be more met coal? or would be we talking outside coal mining? what's the kind of thought there?
david m. khani -- executive vice president, treasurer and chief financial officer
yes, the diversity play for us would be obviously organic first which is our itmann project that will get us some lowball coal that we could have in our portfolio. obviously we would look for more if we can get it at the right m&a project comes along would look at that. and then as i said some of that innovation and new technology some of those things are -- could be technology that's -- it's not necessarily outside of coal. it's part of r&d projects. and we can't talk a lot about those but we have a couple of those in the pipeline now as well.
jimmy a. brock -- president and chief executive officer
but i think the diversification might be like met and some other things i think is kind of what we are talking about. and i don't think you're going to see us go do something completely outside of our skill set.
daniel scott -- clarkson -- analyst
okay, it had a fun in that, okay. all right. thanks very much, guys.
operator
our next question comes from vincent anderson from stifel. go ahead.
vincent anderson -- stifel -- analyst
thanks. i guess i had a few more questions on murray energy but more on the opportunity side than the risk side. first is your impression that any of those assets were being run more to service debt than for rational economic reasons? second is any of their customer portfolio within your network and offers essential market share gains? and then finally of course relative to share repurchases at the moment m&a doesn't make a ton of sense. but is there anything in the asset base that if we were offered up for sale would have a nice strategic fit obviously beyond the mine be sold to them for a reason?
jimmy a. brock -- president and chief executive officer
well, first let me talk about murray energy. i can't really speak for murray energy on what they plan or what they plan to do. we know obviously that market space and those coal mines. so there are there's two sides of that. one is the river opportunities that mr. murray has that we do not compete in at all. and then the other one is some of the rail or direct ship coal that's coming in. and we will wait and evaluate that and see what happens there. but for us we would like to stick to our unique marketing strategy that we have had for the last decade that's boded very well for us. as far as picking up different coal mines or something in another basin. we look at all opportunities if they come and they look like they make sense. we do the valuation work on them. we look at them if we can make it accretive and something that we would want to add that strengthens our portfolio and is a revenue generator then obviously yes we would look at that.
vincent anderson -- stifel -- analyst
that's fair. so to turn it over to india maybe a little bit of a longer-term question but i believe they recently opened up their domestic markets for a 100% foreign ownership of coal mines. just based on your impression how attractive do you believe that market is for a global mining company to come in and try to increase productivity of the domestic coal industry? or do you think the problems that face producers like coal india go well beyond just the company's own internal issues hitting production targets?
jimmy a. brock -- president and chief executive officer
vincent i really can't comment on that. as far as what other coal companies may decide to do in terms of investing in india. i don't know the answer to that.
vincent anderson -- stifel -- analyst
okay fair enough. and then i guess what gives you a certain level of confidence that indonesia is a disciplined producer during this particular down cycle?
david m. khani -- executive vice president, treasurer and chief financial officer
i think vince i think at the end of the day all we are doing is looking at economics and saying that if economics don't warrant production over time. and sometimes it takes time to work its way through that you get -- eventually get economic rationality. i think that's kind of more of a point.
jimmy a. brock -- president and chief executive officer
and, i think the follow-up on what dave said there vincent. when you look at the international seaborne markets columbia is forecasted to be off $9 million this year; the u.s. $14 million; south africa $4 million to $5 million. that's $27 million out of the market and there's another $72 million underwater in indonesia. so we think prices have to ultimately respond. and as i said earlier about indonesia -- i mean as i said earlier about india we think the volatility will come our way.
vincent anderson -- stifel -- analyst
that's helpful. thanks.
jimmy a. brock -- president and chief executive officer
thanks.
operator
[operator instructions] our next question comes from matthew fields bank of america merrill lynch. go ahead.
matthew fields -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
hey, guys. i just wanted to ask a little bit of a policy question. governor of pennsylvania basically wants to get the state into the regional greenhouse gas initiative presumably put some more sort of costs on the state power plant. so that's a big state for you. can you just comment on kind of what the initial reaction is? and how you kind of plan to deal with those ramifications going forward?
jimmy a. brock -- president and chief executive officer
yes, that's a good question and a fair one. i would say at currently today it's a proposed regulation. it's not a regulation. but i'm sure there'll be a lot of political assumptions on both sides there. but really it's too early to tell. and the answer is not really simple. generally speaking reggie is not good for any fossil fuel whether it's coal or natural gas. it makes us less competitive versus the renewables which are already heavily subsidized. so we will do work on this. and it's too early to tell. as i said before it is proposed it's not a regulation. but if it goes to as proposed it certainly would not benefit any fossil fuel.
matthew fields -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
and, i know you're pretty heavily contracted especially compared to peers. are you does your big coal deliveries in pennsylvania to those kind of three key plants are those reflective of your overall contracted portfolio? are there less contracted more contracted? can you just give us a little color there?
jimmy a. brock -- president and chief executive officer
look they are reflective of our contracted portfolio. they are in the 2020 portfolio and in the 2021 portfolio as well.
matthew fields -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
okay, all right. and then just a little bit of detail. i just want to clarify so in the fourth quarter you bought back $16 million of second lien bonds? or you spent $16 million buying back bonds at a discount?
jimmy a. brock -- president and chief executive officer
we spent $16 million buying at a discount. so we have a higher face value that we bought back.
matthew fields -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
okay, great. and then you intend to spend $9 million more to buy back bonds at a discount?
jimmy a. brock -- president and chief executive officer
at least, i think it's -- again we are -- we are giving you a framework but we also tell you that we take advantage of dislocations. and so we just want to make sure people understand our focus is to reduce debt and take advantage of this market.
matthew fields -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
right. and i don't want to put words in your mouth but presumably with your bond prices at yielding 14% 15% that's predominantly going to be second lien repurchases?
jimmy a. brock -- president and chief executive officer
generally yes, that's correct. and remember we also have a sweep in the first quarter that we have to deal with as well.
matthew fields -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
thanks very much. i appreciate it.
jimmy a. brock -- president and chief executive officer
you are welcome.
david m. khani -- executive vice president, treasurer and chief financial officer
thank you.

our next question comes from nick jarmoszuk from stifel. please go ahead.
nick jarmoszuk -- stifel -- analyst
regarding the capital markets i think you guys have a good read as to the deteriorating conditions. so longer term can you talk about how you think about target capital structure the amount of term loans and bonds.
david m. khani -- executive vice president, treasurer and chief financial officer
yes, i think that's -- i'd just say we think about our cost of capital we think about who is actually supplying it. and we spent a bunch of time going and building up our access to capital in other areas. so i'd just say we have a whole process. we think about it you see how we went out and refinanced the timing of how we did it. and so i think it's always a moving picture right now when the commodity prices are low you obviously access to capital becomes a bigger issue. when commodity prices rally the access to capital changes. and so i think you just have to be very flexible and think about it and always continue to work on it so that you know where at moments in time if you ever needed to tap the capital markets you have access to it. so it's not a really simple answer that you gave us and it's a moving target over time.
nick jarmoszuk -- stifel -- analyst
okay. and a question on your contracted position this time last year you were at 90% for the following year and 44% two years out. can you talk about which part of the book is lagging whether it's domestic contracts or export contracts?
jimmy a. brock -- president and chief executive officer
i would just simply say that we are close in both areas and that's stay tuned. like i said earlier in the call i won't count something into solcom until we have the signature on the contract.
nick jarmoszuk -- stifel -- analyst
okay. and then regarding the financial distress of your napp competitor. are you seeing any changes in market conditions or opportunities as a result?
jimmy a. brock -- president and chief executive officer
i think that the marketplace has become a little bit more competitive as a result. but it's a little too early to say.
nick jarmoszuk -- stifel -- analyst
okay, that's all i had. thank you.

i would now like to turn the conference over to nathan tucker, manager of finance and investor relations. please go ahead.
nathan tucker -- manager of finance and investor relations
thank you, jason and good morning, everyone. welcome to consol energy and consol coal resources fourth quarter 2019 earnings conference call. any forward-looking statements or comments we make about future expectations are subject to some risks, which we have outlined in our press releases or in our sec filings. we do not undertake any obligations of updating any forward-looking statements for future events or otherwise.
we will also be discussing certain non-gaap financial measures, which are defined and reconciled to comparable gaap financial measures in our press releases and furnished to the sec on form 8-k. you can also find additional information on our website www.consolenergy.com and www.ccrlp.com.
with me today are jimmy brock, our chief executive officer; mitesh thakkar, our interim chief financial officer; and jim mccaffrey, our chief commercial officer. in his prepared remarks, jimmy will provide a recap of our key achievements during 2019 and specific insights on marketing and operations. mitesh will then provide an update on our liability management program, financial results, and 2020 guidance. and as closing comments, jimmy will then lay out our key priorities for 2020. after the prepared remarks, all three executives will participate in the q&a session. for additional information, we have posted a supplemental slide deck on our website in advance of today's call.
with that, let me turn it over to our ceo, jimmy brock.
jimmy a. brock -- chief executive officer and director
thank you, nate and good morning, everyone. 2019 was a very difficult year for our industry in general, as we continued to see degradation in commodity prices, which then translated into declining stock prices and deteriorated access to capital markets. although our financial securities were causing the whirlwind of broader coal industry malaise as well, we nonetheless achieved several goals that we laid out for our sales at the beginning of 2019.
we improved our safety performance, delivered near-record production and sales volumes at the pennsylvania mining complex, achieved another record ebitda year at our consol marine terminal, successfully refinanced our credit facilities and term loans, and significantly reduced our absolute level of debt. we also advanced our growth strategy by launching our itmann project and made investments geared toward alternative and lower emission uses of coal that we believe may provide high-margin revenue streams in the future.
let me now provide you with a brief recap of 2019 and how it positions us for success in 2020 and beyond. first, on the safety front, 2019 was significantly improved from 2018, as we further differentiated our performance from the industry average. on a year-over-year basis, we reduced the total recordable incident rate at the pmc by 45% and reduced our total number of exceptions by 41%. at the consol marine terminal, we had zero incidents and a 100% compliance record during 2019. however, despite a significant improvement in overall safety performance for the year, we cannot forget the tragic loss of one of our consol family members in 2019. the entire company continues to mourn his loss and our thoughts and prayers remain with this family and friends. we have taken significant measures to protect an accident of this nature from reoccurring in the future and safety remains our top core value. we continue to strive toward zero life-altering incidents.
second, both the pennsylvania mining complex and the consol marine terminal had very strong 2019 operational performances, especially when considering a difficult market backdrop. the pennsylvania mining complex produced 27.3 million tons, which is the second highest annual production in its history. this production level is largely unchanged from the record level set in 2018 despite the eia estimating that total u.s. coal production declined by 9% from 2018 to 2019. the consol marine terminal again set a new annual revenue record, marking the third consecutive record revenue year, while also continuing its outstanding safety performance. as such, our two core operations once again defied the broader market trend, which we believe is a result of our well capitalized asset base and the superior quality of our products.
now, let me review our q4 '19 operational performance in detail. our operations team finished the year with a solid production performance in the fourth quarter of 6.7 million tons, which was relatively flat compared to the year ago period of 6.8 million tons. in addition, the harvey mine again set an individual production record in 2019, surpassing and 5 million tons, marking the third consecutive record setting year. for q4 '19, productivity at the pennsylvania mining complex measured as tons per employee hour, improved by 6.7% compared to q4 '18. furthermore, our cash cost of production was slightly improved compared to q4 '18, mainly due to reduced maintenance and supply cost and cost related to contractors and other purchased services.
for its share of the pamc, ccr produced 1.68 million tons of coal during q4 '19, which was also relatively flat compared to the year ago quarter. the consol marine terminal had a throughput volume of 2.5 million tons during the quarter, compared to 2.7 million tons in the year ago period. given the terms of our take-or-pay contract at the terminal and despite a decline in shipments, our terminal revenues for the quarter were largely unchanged at $16.5 million compared to $16.9 million in the year ago quarter. cash operating costs were also in line at $4.9 million versus $5.2 million in the year ago quarter.
let me now provide an overview of the coal markets and an update on our sales performance and accomplishments. coal markets and producers had a tough 2019. however, there are some indications that provide hope for an improvement in the second half of 2020. first, on the export front, api2 spot prices remained under pressure in 2019 and ended the year 39% lower compared to year-end 2018. lng process weighed on coal demand internationally, especially in europe as a glut of new u.s. and australian projects came online in 2019. according to wood mackenzie, even while lng demand growth in asia-pacific region stalled, global lng supply grew approximately 9% in 2019, resulting in spot lng been sold at a discount in the europe. on a positive note, the recent decline in lng prices is expected to slow lng growth supply, particularly in '21 and beyond. according to wood mackenzie, new lng projects need approximately $7 per million btu to be economically viable. this anticipated correction in lng supply and demand dynamics is partially reflected in the api2 pricing, which remains in contango.
furthermore, we are also continuing to see strong demand for northern app coal in india's brick cem [phonetic] market, which does not price of api2 and is the most meaningful revenue driver for our export shipments. india imported over 7 million tons of northern app coal in 2019, and we expect this number to increase in the coming years.
in the domestic markets, natural gas prices remain under pressure and were down 19% in 2019 compared to 2018. this weighed on power prices and coal consumption. eia expects the average annual growth rate for domestic dry gas supply to slow considerably over the next five years compared to the 2015 through 2020 period. it is also worth noting that 2020 capex for marcellus and utica producers is expected to decrease approximately 20% compared to 2019, based on reported guidance so far. a consol-specific development in the domestic market continues to be the recently improved sulfur content of our coal. as we have mentioned in the past, we recently moved one of our longwalls to the low-sulfur area. the resulting quality has been well received in the domestic met market and has created a win-win for us and our customers.
we benefit by capturing additional market share in the domestic utility market and our customers receive high quality coal at a lower price. this allows them to dispatch at a lower cost and potentially consume more. supply rationalization is another positive trend we are continuing to see in the global coal market. low prices are starting to drive a supply response and several producers, including us, have responded with production cuts. according to dtc, there have been 17 million tons of total u.s. coal production cutbacks announced since the beginning of 2019, 13 million of which are on the thermal coal markets. dtc is also estimating that u.s. thermal coal exports will fall approximately 37% from the 2019 levels, which could put exports in the mid-20 million ton range.
we're also seeing a similar response internationally. colombia began scaling back production in late 2019 and now indonesia is following suit. indonesia set its coal production output target to 550 million tons in 2020, down from the 610 million tons in 2019. however, indonesian coal consumption is expected to rise by 17 million tons in 2020, which should have to tighten the market. on a net basis, this could potentially reduce seaborne supply from indonesia by 77 million tons.
finally, ihs markit reported that indian coal-fired power plants will be required to retrofit and use desulfurization technology for sox control by 2022. of the 203 gigawatts of installed coal-fired capacity in india, about 166 gigawatts have been identified for flue gas desulfurization installation. this is a potentially positive development for northern app and illinois basin producers, as it opens up the possibility of burning higher sulfur coals at these plants. we compare this to the wave of scrubber installations that occurred in the u.s. years ago, which led to a significant growth in demand for northern app and illinois basin coals over higher price compliance coals.
from a marketing perspective, we continue to maintain 100% of our existing customer base and to selectively expand by taking market share. during the quarter, we added approximately 4 million tons of new business for multi-year delivery. we are now approximately 95% contracted for 2020 and 43% contracted for 2021, assuming the midpoint of our coal sales volume guidance range.
let me now provide an update on our strategic growth and diversification efforts at consol energy. during 2019, we approved our itmann project, which falls in the organic growth bucket. we announced this morning that the itmann project economics have improved further. we are now anticipating a higher annual production run rate of approximately 900,000 tons at full production, while maintaining our current capex range. we were also successful in adjusting the timing of capital spend to fit our corporate level capital priorities, which mitesh will discuss shortly. more recently, we made several investments in our technology bucket, which are geared toward alternative uses of coal.
our investment in cfoam corp is one such example. it is a newly formed u.s.-based holding company, whose wholly owned subsidiary cfoam llc manufactures high-performance carbon foam products from coal. the cfoam product focuses on meeting demand for high-grade materials in the industrial, aerospace, military and commercial product markets with an expected total addressable market of over $15 billion annually.
we are also partnering with ohio university and other industry partners on a doe-funded project to develop coal plastic composites. these materials are geared toward the engineering composite decking and other building product markets, with an expected global addressable market of approximately $8 billion by 2023.
finally, our previously announced partnership with omnis bailey, llc continues to move forward. the goal there is to develop a refinery that will convert waste coal slurry into two products. a high-quality carbon product that can be used as fuel or as a feedstock for other high-value applications and a mineral matter product that has the potential to be used as a sole amendment in agriculture applications.
the investments we make in our technology bucket are small, but have the potential to contribute significantly to our bottom line over time.
with that, i will now turn the call over to mitesh to provide the financial updates.
mitesh thakkar -- interim chief financial officer
thank you, jimmy and good morning, everyone. let me start with an update on our liability management efforts in the context of our capital allocation strategy. i will then review our financial results for 2019 and introduce our 2020 guidance. over the past year, we have been very focused on improving the risk profile of our balance sheet. while commodity prices were volatile throughout 2019, we were laser focused on reducing our debt. this remains our top priority heading into 2020 and to achieve that goal, we have taken significant steps to reduce our capital spend and take advantage of the cost of capital arbitrage.
as you are already aware, we successfully reduced our interest expense, extended our maturities, improved our liquidity, and gained a lot of financial flexibility through our refinancing effort in early 2019. this was very timely as access to capital in the energy industry in general and coal in particular has steadily declined since then due to esg concerns. with those capital market constraints in mind, we are preparing ourselves to be able to have significantly lower level of absolute debt before our 2024 term loan b matures. we also recognize the tremendous opportunity we have to take advantage of the decline in the prices of our public debt and have been very active in the open market. in 2019, we repurchased $52.6 million of our second lien notes in the open market, which we are only able to redeem on or after november 15, 2021 at a coal price of $105.5.
in aggregate, during 2019, we made net payments of nearly $184 million toward total outstanding debt. we continue to have over $400 million of liquidity. on the capital spending front, we are now targeting a significant reduction in maintenance capital spending at the pennsylvania mining complex compared to 2019 levels as the mines are now very well capitalized from the strong commodity market periods of 2018 and 2019. on the growth front, we have also made the decision to take advantage of the flexibility that the itmann project offers and defer some capital spending.
there are several benefits of doing this. first, by slowing down the development pace, we can redeploy that capital toward debt reduction. for instance, our second lien notes currently offer an approximately 20% rate of return on a yield to worst basis and are trading at under $0.70 on a dollar with a more limited risk profile compared to development projects.
second, met coal prices are not very attractive and there are significant tariffs on u.s. origin coals into china, depressing the overall market. delaying itmann will allow us to take advantage of more favorable pricing in the longer term. however, if the market conditions were to improve meaningfully in the near term, we can quickly ramp up our development pace. as jimmy noted, itmann will now reach approximately 900,000 tons of annual production compared to 600,000 tons we announced earlier. so the project economics have actually improved. we have been very focused on managing our legacy liabilities since we became a separate public company in late 2017. heading into 2020, we expect our cash payments for employee legacy liabilities to be approximately $59 million, which is a reduction compared to 2019 level.
on the balance sheet front, after significant declines in our balance sheet legacy liabilities over last two years, our balances have increased very modestly. this is mostly due to declining discount rates, which were partially offset by the favorable claims experience and the passage of the secure act.
with that, let me now recap the fourth quarter and full-year 2019 results before moving on to our 2020 guidance. we will review ceix first, then ccr. ceix reported a solid fourth quarter with net income attributable to ceix shareholders of $13.9 million or $0.54 per diluted share, and adjusted ebitda of $92.1 million. this compares to $39.7 million, $1.41 per diluted share and $115.2 million, respectively in the year ago quarter. the decline in our earnings metrics compared to the year ago period is mostly the result of lower pjm west power prices and higher income tax expense, partially offset by improved cash operating cost.
our fixed price, domestic and export contracts performed well during the quarter. in 4q '19, we generated $21.4 million of cash flow from operations and spent $38.3 million in capital expenditures. as a result, ceix had an outflow of $16.9 million of organic free cash flow, which was impacted by $50.7 million adverse working capital change. this is mostly a function of $21.9 million increase in our trade receivable balance and $15.1 million impact due to the timing of income taxes paid in q4 '19.
in full-year 2019, we had $80.3 million in adverse working capital change. on the year, trade receivables increased by $44.1 million, coupled with $16.9 million impact due to the timing of income taxes paid in 2019, as well as $10.4 million discretionary 401(k) compensation payment in 2019, which resulted from our strong 2018 performance.
to put things in perspective, we had a $27.4 million benefit from working capital changes in 2018, which essentially reversed in 2019. the changes to the ar balance reflects the strength and weakness of commodity markets. one of our key priorities for 2020 is to improve our net working capital. for 2019, we reported adjusted ebitda of $405.9 million and capex of $169.7 million, which were both right around the midpoint of our guidance range. ceix finished the year with a net leverage ratio of 1.9 times for the bank method.
now, let me update you on ccr. this morning, ccr reported net income of $9 million, adjusted ebitda of $23.6 million and distributable cash flow of $12.7 million for the fourth quarter. this compares to $16.6 million, $29.4 million and $18.5 million respectively in the year ago quarter. for the full-year 2019, we reported adjusted ebitda of $99.4 million, which was slightly above the midpoint of our guidance range. furthermore, our full-year capex came in at $37.2 million, which was near the high-end of our capex range.
in q4 '19, ccr generated $13.6 million in net cash from operating activities, which included an $8.1 million outflow from changes in working capital. after accounting for $7.8 million in capital expenditures and $14.4 million in distribution payments, our net debt increased by $9.2 million. ccr finished the year with a net leverage ratio of 1.8 times. for the full-year 2019, ccr generated net cash from operating activities of $81.1 million, which includes a $14 million adverse change in working capital, mainly driven by $10.9 million increase in our trade receivable balance. ccr also incurred $37.2 million in capex, but nonetheless, maintained 1 times coverage ratio for the year.
now, let me provide you with our outlook for 2020. as stated before, our guidance philosophy continues to measure risk and capture a multitude of potential outcomes in the ranges we provide. for the pennsylvania mining complex, we are expecting our 2020 sales volume to be below our 2019 levels. as a reminder, during the last earnings call, we stated that we were prepared to run to the market in 2020 and that is what we are doing right now. the good news is we are approximately 95% contracted for the year and can flex up or down based on market conditions. as such, we are providing a 2020 coal sales volume range of 24.5 million tons to 26.5 million tons for ceix and 6.1 million tons to 6.6 million tons for ccr. the upper bound reflect our belief of a modest improvement in core markets in second half of '20, which will allow us to capture some spot market opportunities. the lower bound considers the risk of potential deferral and reduced ability to sell spot coal due to weak demand trends, including below-normal winter consumption of coal and sluggish international market.
to reflect the potential for continued weakness in our power price-linked volumes and contract deferrals, we currently expect our average revenue per ton to be in the $43 to $45 range. our guidance range for revenue also captures a scenario in which our power price-linked contract are sold at floor prices, which leaves some room for a potential upside.
we expect our 2020 cash cost of coal sold to be $30 per ton to $31.50 per ton. at the midpoint, we are expecting our cash cost to be relatively flat compared to 2019 despite the $0.60 per ton increase in black lung excise tax passed in december 2019. as is always the case, we constantly focus on ways to reduce our costs and improve efficiency. rolling it all up, we expect an adjusted ebitda of $295 million to $335 million for ceix and $67 million to $80 million for ccr.
also consistent with 2019 and due to the nature of the take-or-pay contract that runs for the full year of 2020, we expect the consol marine terminal adjusted ebitda to be in the $40 million to $45 million range for 2020. as jimmy mentioned earlier, we are reducing our capital expenditure needs for 2020 and are providing a guidance range of $125 million and $145 million for ceix and $25 million to $30 million for ccr. these ranges reflect reduced spending on equipment-related items and structures at the pamc. for ceix, it also reflects our adjustments to the timing of the itmann project capital spend.
with that, let me turn it back to jimmy to make some final comments.
jimmy a. brock -- chief executive officer and director
thank you, mitesh. before we move on to the q&a session, let me take this opportunity to lay out some of our priorities for 2020. first and foremost, our strategy has always prioritized a strong balance sheet and 2020 will be no different. we will continue to take advantage of the dislocations in the price of our debt securities to reduce our overall leverage as well as our interest expense. as mitesh previously mentioned, we are constantly evaluating all avenues of shareholder return through our strict capital allocation strategy.
in our past earnings calls, we have stated a willingness to slow down growth spending as our debt and equity securities become more attractively priced and that is exactly what we're doing now. this also highlights the importance of our growth strategy, which has involved taking a measured approach to growth and selecting projects that involve manageable levels of capital commitment and afford flexibility in the timing of the execution. this strategy allows us to adjust our capital deployment on an ongoing basis.
second, as you can see from our capital guidance range, we are always prepared to pull the necessary levers in a market downturn. we have reduced our capital spending requirements in 2020, due to our willingness to keep our minds well capitalized on strong markets. this gives us the ability to successfully weather market downturns. we proved the effectiveness of this strategy in 2016.
finally, we are approximately 95% contracted for 2020 at the midpoint of our sales volume guidance, which is above our stated target at our last earnings release. we also have 8 million export tons contracting for the year and through our terminal in baltimore, we can increase that position if market conditions warrant. as such, we have good revenue visibility for the year and can focus more heavily on strengthening our portfolio in 2021 and beyond.
as we continue to strengthen our esg efforts, we are pleased to announce the release of our annual sustainability report, our second as a stand-alone company. the report highlights our performance against sustainability goals that differentiate consol throughout the coal lifecycle. from extraction to utilization, we continue to deploy innovation technologies that increase operational efficiencies, reduce our carbon footprint and provide opportunities for diversification. as energy markets evolve, the need for low-cost, high-quality and sustainable coal operators will become more critical than ever. as a result of our operational and esg endeavors, consol is prepared to meet that need.
in summary, our key priorities for 2020 are to safely and compliantly produce our high-quality coal at the lowest possible cost, continue to improve our balance sheet through debt repayment, stay nimble and flexible so we are prepared to run to the market and return capital to shareholders in the most attractive form.
with that, i will hand the call back over to nate for further instructions.
nathan tucker -- manager of finance and investor relations
thank you, jimmy. we will now move to the q&a session of our call. jason, can you please provide the instructions to or callers?

[operator instructions] the first question comes from lucas pipes from b riley fbr. please go ahead.
lucas pipes -- b riley fbr -- analyst
hey, good morning, everyone.
jimmy a. brock -- chief executive officer and director
good morning, lucas.
mitesh thakkar -- interim chief financial officer
good morning.
lucas pipes -- b riley fbr -- analyst
so i have a longer term higher level and also somewhat maybe more difficult question. but, so you gave guidance this morning that points to another very strong year of free cash flow generation.
and with where the stock and the debt is trading, the market seems to express considerable doubt about kind of your long-term cash flow outlook. and so, i was hoping you could -- and i know you just gave 2020 guidance, but could you maybe share some perspective on the sustainability of kind of your big cash flow bucket. obviously, there are the operating cost, the capital cost.
where would you be pricing in the current environment? are there any major cash items we should consider from your legacy liabilities? would really appreciate your perspective on that and i think the market looks split book some more color on that point as well. i obviously think you're in a great position, but would really appreciate your long-term outlook. and then are there any other items on the cash side that you could maybe take off the table, such as the distribution at tcr? thank you very much.
jimmy a. brock -- chief executive officer and director
good morning, lucas. it's jimmy here. well, let's talk about some of our long term, and as you said, we don't give guidance past the year but for our cash flow and looking forward, we've said before on our earnings call that we are moving in a more favorable reserve block at enlow fork, which we think is going to lower our operating costs. so, we move out of some of those high subsidence areas and we moved -- reduced our footprint with sales that have put us over in the east reserves, which number one should be cheaper mining, it's a better quality of coal, the sulfur content is lower. so we think that will help the overall portfolio in the future as far as cash cost goes.
also on the capital front, we've said many times before, the complex is well capitalized and we have made continued capital investments when they need to be, but we still continue to believe that we can operate that with this maintenance of production for the foreseeable future somewhere between $4.50 and $5.00 a ton for maintenance capital.
and then when i look at other potential, as you heard us talk about that a little bit this morning that some of these is getting into other uses of coal that to bring in revenue, diversifies us a little bit away from coal-fired generation, and then, of course, pretty excited about our itmann project that will come online that will allow us to participate in a peer low-vol metallurgical coal mine or coal product. and we continue to look for ways to reduce costs.
so looking out in the long term, i think things will improve for us as we reduce our footprint and we continue to employ technology and innovation to help us on the cost front, as well as generating free cash flow and revenue.
jim mccaffrey -- chief commercial officer
let me add to that a little bit lucas. this is jim. jimmy talked about the sulfur on east panels of enlow fork. and what that sulfur is allowing us to do is we still have certain customers that blend our coal with either prb coal for cap coal. and we believe that we can increase -- well, we don't believe, we're certain that we can increase our share of northern app at those utilities in such a manner that we can price that coal more effectively and the customer also gets more effective cost. so, it's a win-win. and that's something that we see carrying out for the next several years and is a big part of our strategy.
now, when you look at the international, you heard the numbers that jimmy quoted about india, 166 gigs that need fgd installation and we're working with xcoal on helping to develop the technology and making sure that we have plants that are retrofitting their fgd so that that will allow the burning of high sulfur in northern app coal. we also see some advantageous opportunities in vietnam. we're working with our partner there and the dominican republic, we've talked about it in the past, there is a new power plant there that convert 2 million tons a year. it's really began burning last spring [indecipherable] worked out now and they are out for a significant rfp for a large portion of the plan. all the coal that's burned in that plant has included our bailey coal and our bailey coal now is going to get a chance to burn directly by itself. so we see that as an opportunity.
then when you look at today's market versus the long term, the tariff situation certainly added some confusion to the marketplace. i think that that confusion is now starting to diminish some although, of course, we have the coronavirus that's kind of ball up the works a little bit in the short term, but i think that we may have the opportunity to get some more met coal into china again, some crossover met coal, maybe ultimately [indecipherable] as well. so, i think that china is back on the table. and in miami recently, ernie gave the -- ernie thrasher gave the keynote speech and he said the chinese would need to take $18.5 billion in energy projects in 2020 and $34 billion in 2021. i haven't followed up with ernie in the last couple of weeks above that, but those are significant numbers. so, they also create additional opportunity.
so, i'm rather bullish on the market. we just did a situation today where the gas price is abnormally low and we just have not had any winter in -- and a significant portion of our customers, not all of them, a significant portion in our winter burners; winter is the key part of the year. thus the fact that we're losing a little bit of tons in the first quarter that we typically would have had and that resulted in us reducing the guidance a little bit. but in the long term, i think all those opportunities are still there and with our terminal baltimore and our partnership, i think we're perfectly positioned to take advantage of them.
lucas pipes -- b riley fbr -- analyst
that's super, super helpful. i appreciate all of your color. my follow-up is on the export side and jimmy and jim, there is considerable confusion with how the current market affect your netback pricing. i think the analyst community has been anchored historically on the api2. api2 is very weak, but when you look at some of the market indexes over in india, south africa, new castle, they're considerably stronger. how should we think about your pricing in today's world? i think would be really helpful to have you walk through us and maybe everybody can be reset on how to model this correctly. thank you.
jim mccaffrey -- chief commercial officer
well, the api2 has been the standard bearer for quite some time. but there is less and less coal going into europe and obviously more coal going into southeast asia, india, egypt and other countries where the api2 just does not perhaps applies as done in the past. so recently at the conference in miami, there was quite a bit of discussion about replacing api2 or moving api2 to the back burner, because it just doesn't apply all over the world.
api4 is basically not being used very much by anybody, it's an index. i think generally speaking, people think that the south africans manipulate that number and therefore we don't find it a good number. we certainly pay attention to the pet coke number going into india. and certainly the fright numbers from the u.s. are significant. pet coke is traveling to india from both the east coast of the u.s. in the gulf coast area. the east coast has a deeper berth. so it's less expensive freight to -- from the east coast to india. so, i mean, that's basically, i think, the state of things today. i think they will develop a little bit more as we go forward, but i think the api2 is going to be fading into the sunset.
lucas pipes -- b riley fbr -- analyst
thank you for that. and maybe just one follow-up, because it is important for me and i think the investor base to really get a sense for how economical this export business is in today's market? what are some of the numbers you would put around it? if api2 is less important, is it maybe 30% of your export volumes that are still priced off at may be $20 million [phonetic], $50 million [phonetic]? and really -- it's really a modeling question, how should we model this business in today's world?
jim mccaffrey -- chief commercial officer
well, i guess, i have to think about that a little bit lucas. but if i look like last year, we shipped almost 8 million tons overseas, $3.5 million of that -- almost 4 million went to india. and india is negotiated pricing or priced off the pet coke price. we did have some coal into europe last year, 1.5 million tons or so. let me think about that and get back to you on that, lucas, because in terms of modeling, i just haven't thought it through.
lucas pipes -- b riley fbr -- analyst
okay. okay. great. well, i appreciate all the color and best of luck. thank you.
operator
the next question comes from mark levin from benchmark. please go ahead.
mark levin -- the benchmark company llc -- analyst
okay, great, thanks guys for the time this morning. first question, 2021, it looks like you put some tons to bed at 2021. can you give us some color about how many tons you contracted for 2021 and the sort of zip code -- the pricing zip code?
jim mccaffrey -- chief commercial officer
yes, mark, we can. we have a little bit over 11 million tons sold, 5.5 million of those are in fixed domestic priced pretty much at market. we have 5.3 million tons of netback, our large netback contract going forward. and today just 200,000 tons of export. so, we're not guiding on price for those tons yet, but i think you can assume that the fixed domestic is at or slightly above the current market.
mark levin -- the benchmark company llc -- analyst
okay, got it. by that, you mean, just sort of using the kind of forward curve for nap that [speech overlap].
jim mccaffrey -- chief commercial officer
yeah, yeah. coal desk or someone like that, yeah.
mark levin -- the benchmark company llc -- analyst
got it, got it. okay. second modeling question, in the past, you guys have given price sensitivity or revenue per ton sensitivity to pjm west power prices. do you guys have one for this year?
jim mccaffrey -- chief commercial officer
i do have one for this year, mark, and if you don't mind, i'd like to talk about a little bit because we're sitting here with no winter and very low gas prices, and i would say that we're disappointed with the netback power pricing so far this year. but i would also say that this market -- this contract was designed to be in market, and unfortunately, it is.
to just to give you some clarity, we have a base price that we have said is approximately our total cost line and we begin to get a share benefit from the customer when pjm west prices are above -- around $24.40 [phonetic]. and then the $1 change in pjm prices adds up to about $0.20 across our entire portfolio. so, when i look this year, the contract based upon is designed pretty much gives us the best pricing for the winter, next best pricing for the summer and then obviously, the shoulder month should give you the lowest pricing. but january has been a very low month and in 2019, as the gas price fell and the power price fell, prices slipped too.
so, we're looking at the gas curve going forward and it does get back over $2 in july. it is in contango and we do anticipate that we will get some better market share as the year goes on. we have basically forecasted for this earnings call, we have forecasted the netback prices at the floor. so, it can't get any worse than what we reported this morning. and i do think there is opportunity for it to improve.
mark levin -- the benchmark company llc -- analyst
got it. no, that's very helpful. and then back on the domestic market, in terms of your volume guidance for this year, contract bias and deferrals and maybe emphasizing deferrals, how much deferrals have you guys seen from utilities at this gas environment? how much is baked into guidance? and then is this year going to look worse than the -- from a deferral or do you expect it to look worse from a deferral perspective than it did the last time gas prices went below too?
jim mccaffrey -- chief commercial officer
well, so far, we've had one or two customers that have had more than just a little bit of push back. so the rest of the customer portfolio is performing so far and there may be one or two customers that are a train or so behind, but all in all, they're performing. we have one significant customer that could not perform and we did a buyout of those tons, 0.5 million tons already this year, and we were well paid for the buyout. so, we just need to resell those tons at a higher price, which i don't think will be a problem as the year goes on.
mark levin -- the benchmark company llc -- analyst
got it. and my last and final question on the coal act. i get a lot of incoming questions, you have gotten a lot of incoming questions in the past about potential liabilities surrounding the coal act and your competitor's bankruptcy. any comments or thoughts that you can provide as to how you guys are approaching that situation? i know it's a sensitive one, but just because it is on the floor with many investors, i thought i would throw it out there.
jimmy a. brock -- chief executive officer and director
yeah, mark, it is a sensitive question. and, of course, we can't speculate or answer legal questions from the murray bankruptcy. but what we believe on the coal act liabilities is murray's coal act obligations were current as of the bankruptcy and we understand that murray has remained current on such obligations till the bankruptcy. so we believe there is no basis for that to change and that it is not necessary for murray to modify its coal act liabilities acquired from cnx in order to successfully reorganize this business.
now, as i stated before, it is a large and complex bankruptcy, but that's about all we can say at this time. we haven't had any claims and we have the obligations are current as we understand it. but we are monitoring that and staying with it but that's about all we can say about it today.
mark levin -- the benchmark company llc -- analyst
great. i really appreciate it. thank you guys very much for the time.
jimmy a. brock -- chief executive officer and director
thanks, mark.
operator
the next question comes from daniel scott from clarksons. please go ahead.
jimmy a. brock -- chief executive officer and director
good morning, dan.
daniel scott -- clarksons platou securities -- analyst
thanks, guys. good morning, how are you?
jimmy a. brock -- chief executive officer and director
good.
daniel scott -- clarksons platou securities -- analyst
so when we look at the guidance for this year, the volumes being down. how are you planning on achieving those lower volumes? is it -- are you going to keep all your longwalls running all year and just do it via shifts or is there contemplating taking one longwall off based on market conditions? just kind of walk me through that, if you could.
jimmy a. brock -- chief executive officer and director
well, unfortunately, dan, we have experience at this. we went through this in 2015 and 2016. so the exercise here will be to run our operations at the lowest possible cost, which generates the highest free cash margins. so that could be run in four longwalls, it could be run in all five at a reduced schedule and a lot of it will depend on the quality specs that we need to make and what this marketing team tells us that we need to run.
so we have a very good team there. more than likely starting out of the gate will run at some sort of reduced schedule at all three coal mines and then we will continue to monitor that as we go forward. but like i said, we do hope there is going to be a turnaround in the second half of the year that will provide us an opportunity to have upside to these numbers that we've guided to this morning. but as far as the operating schedule, it will be one that meets the specifications and allows us to run at the lowest possible cost.
mitesh thakkar -- interim chief financial officer
also, dan, i'll just add that typically our first quarter is very strong, but for this year, we have first half, which is loaded with unusual number of longwall moves. so the production is going to be low from an operational standpoint in the first half and if we are expecting a second half recovery, i think from a longwall move perspective, we'll be positioned really well to capture if the market recovers. so from an operational cadence standpoint, i think, first half is going to be a little bit weaker from an operational standpoint anyway.
jimmy a. brock -- chief executive officer and director
yeah. and i mean just to follow-up a little bit on that. we just completed one of our longwall moves at harvey. and we have three to four more, it could be four in the second quarter. so, then that will allow us to only have one longwall move in the second half whereas two depending upon timing of where that one moves to.
daniel scott -- clarksons platou securities -- analyst
great. that's actually very helpful. and then when i look at the realized price guidance for this year, by my math at the midpoint, it looks like it's down close to 7% versus 2019's realized prices. and i think, up until this quarter, we talked more about being in the neighborhood of 5% down. with additional tons you put to bed to get to 82% to 95% book this year, i assume that's all domestic and the combination of that plus that maybe a more conservative outlook around the callers is that what's driving that slightly higher decline in realizations?
jim mccaffrey -- chief commercial officer
dan, it's all of the netback pricing.
daniel scott -- clarksons platou securities -- analyst
okay.
mitesh thakkar -- interim chief financial officer
so when we provided that less than 5%, we were using the forward step on the netback prices, which you know now, is we are using the floor price. so, i think that's the biggest driver.
jim mccaffrey -- chief commercial officer
yes.
daniel scott -- clarksons platou securities -- analyst
okay. perfect. and then last, on the itmann ramp, as you guys slow the ramp down to conserve cash and potentially buy back some debt, what does that mean for -- i see it's going to be a higher run rate once it's at full capacity. when is that going to be based on roughly the market stand and this 150, 160 [phonetic] range for benchmark goal?
jimmy a. brock -- chief executive officer and director
well, what we've said, currently that it would take a year to year-and-a-half to ramp that up to full production. so that could push us into 2021, somewhere middle of 2021, if we get all three of those units up and running, now, what we'll do there this first right out of the gate, which were pretty much ready here sometime this month will be to go in and do the exploratory mine that i talked about before, make sure the coal is same as what our core data shows, make sure the quality is there, make sure -- look at the roof control and everything else and run that one unit just one shift a day as we're waiting for the market to respond. then obviously, we'll go ahead to second unit, we have to develop out to do that and then we'd have to develop out more to add the third unit. but i would say, mid-2021, we could be up to that full range of guidance based on what we know today.
daniel scott -- clarksons platou securities -- analyst
perfect. thanks very much guys. appreciate it.
jimmy a. brock -- chief executive officer and director
thank you, dan.

the next question comes from nick jarmoszuk from stifel. please go ahead.
nick jarmoszuk -- stifel -- analyst
hi, good morning.
jimmy a. brock -- chief executive officer and director
good morning, nick.
nick jarmoszuk -- stifel -- analyst
on the 2020 capex, could you give us a split between maintenance from the math that you guys are anticipating on it?
mitesh thakkar -- interim chief financial officer
sure. so at the pennsylvania mining complex, we are around $4 a ton mark on maintenance capex. i think -- and the rest of it is efficiency and a little bit of itmann capex.
nick jarmoszuk -- stifel -- analyst
okay. and then on the relationship that they have with xcoal, they were mentioned earlier in the call as well. you guys are working with them to develop the indian markets with the scrubbers on. can you talk about the relationship you have with them? how you think about the take-or-pay on the terminal, and then the export tonnage that they're looking to maintain?
jimmy a. brock -- chief executive officer and director
yeah, thanks. our relationship with xcoal is very solid. it's a good one. we like the take-or-pay contract that we have with the terminal. it certainly gives us some steady revenue that we know is there. and secondly, ernie has people in almost every sales corner in the world. so we feel like we get opportunities. he brings those to us and we talk through strategy and where we'd want to move it. it also helps with the total market of the global market for coals and i would tell you to this point, he has been able to deliver and we've went to some of our customers with him to visit. he has a very good visibility of what's going on globally, and we're satisfied with where we are today with the contract and jim probably can add some more color to that. but so far, we're very pleased with our xcoal contract.
nick jarmoszuk -- stifel -- analyst
[indecipherable].
jim mccaffrey -- chief commercial officer
i think that pretty much covers it.
mitesh thakkar -- interim chief financial officer
nick, is that background noise on your side?
nick jarmoszuk -- stifel -- analyst
it probably is, yeah. [indecipherable] quieter. with the export contracts, when do you anticipate discussing with them the renewal or extension and when could we expect some news coming to the market on it?
jimmy a. brock -- chief executive officer and director
we currently have a contract through 2020 -- through the full year of 2020. i would think somewhere second half of 2020 is when we have a little better understanding of where the markets are playing out that we would start negotiating the following year, even years out contract.
nick jarmoszuk -- stifel -- analyst
okay. and then on ccr, is there any thought to changing the distribution policies start paying down the intercompany note?
jimmy a. brock -- chief executive officer and director
well, for ccr, we look at all those things. and as i've said many times before, we look at ccr on an annualized basis. we do understand that quarters can be lumpiness. we do understand that there is other things, but basically what it comes down to ccr is uses of free cash flow generated. so there's different things to look at. at the end of the day, it comes down to a board decision to whether or not we pay those distributions or not. for an example, in 2019, we had some quarters that were under one, we had some quarters that were slightly over one. and at the end of the day, we looked at the cash, we committed to our unitholders, if we generate a one coverage ratio, we would pay those distributions. that's exactly what we did.
going forward, it's the same exercise. we'll take a look at that, make a recommendation to the board, and then they will decide whether or not we pay distributions or not.
nick jarmoszuk -- stifel -- analyst
okay. and then working capital was a use in 2019. how should we think about that for 2020?
mitesh thakkar -- interim chief financial officer
yeah. so nick, if you think about it, the working capital changes were mostly driven by about, let's say, of the $80 million, $44 million were due to trade receivables and that is typically what you see depending on where you are in the market cycle. for instance in 2018, we had a positive working capital adjustment from trade receivables of about $43.9 million. so essentially we gave all that back in 2019 and depending on where the market was.
couple of other smaller things. there were some income tax-related payments in 2019, which were from a strong year in 2018 and so was another $10 million payment on discretionary 401(k) match. we don't anticipate those two -- of that magnitude. 401(k) match is definitely not happening for 2020 for 2019 year and then income taxes might -- the impact might be not as much as what we saw in 2019.
trade receivables, we -- one of our focus area has been to collect on those trade receivables faster, so that's what we are focused on 2020. so, if anything, i'm inclined to say that there will be a positive benefit from those aspects in 2020.
nick jarmoszuk -- stifel -- analyst
okay. and then last question, i believe you have a cash flow sweep in the first quarter, can you let us know what that number is going to be?
mitesh thakkar -- interim chief financial officer
i think given the amount of second lien debt that we have bought in 2019, i don't think we are going to have any free cash flow sweep for the term loan b.
nick jarmoszuk -- stifel -- analyst
that all i had. thank you.
operator
[operator instructions] the next question comes from matthew fields from bank of america. please go ahead.
matthew fields -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
hey, everybody. thanks for the disclosure on the bond repurchases in 4q. have you ever -- have you purchased any more bonds --second lien bonds in the first quarter to-date?
mitesh thakkar -- interim chief financial officer
so, matt, our approach to bond repurchase as you are following the bond markets, you know our bonds are very volatile, so we try not to do anything significant in any given week. we do bits and pieces, and you're right, we did buy some bonds earlier in this year. so 2020, i think we have done probably high-single digits of bond repurchases, but we will continue to do that. i think our game plan remains the same like we can't predict where the market is going. so we are just going to dollar-cost average it and in a way it works -- it has worked out in our favor over last three to six months, because the prices have been coming down.
matthew fields -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
yeah. so given that, now your bonds right today are kind of in the mid-60s [phonetic], which is 21%, 22% yield. so given the attractiveness sort of now versus during the -- over the course of last year, do you think that bond repurchases will be more aggressive in 2020? [speech overlap] zero risk plus 20% irr in that investment?
mitesh thakkar -- interim chief financial officer
i would not say more aggressive, i would continue to maintain measured approach to it. we will continue to participate in the marketplace. but as you noticed that we have elevated the priority of that capital return project to above itmann. so, you can imagine how strongly we feel about that.
jimmy a. brock -- chief executive officer and director
yeah. currently, where it sits today, it ranks pretty high among our capital allocation returns.
matthew fields -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
okay, great. and then kind of wanted to follow up on next question on the ccr distribution. don't have the q yet or the k, i guess, for that yet, but through the nine months, ccr's basically been borrowing on that intercompany loan to pay this distribution and i know that you get the chunk of that distribution, but how sustainable is that practice and shouldn't -- should that really continue?
mitesh thakkar -- interim chief financial officer
so we -- again like jimmy said, we will look at it on a quarterly basis with an annual outlook in mind. and again it's too early to tell market conditions could change, but generally speaking, i think the way we think about things is whether ccr has generated enough distribution or expect to generate enough distribution in the year and sometimes things could change and i think you'll have to stay tuned for that till our april decision.
matthew fields -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
okay, that's it for me. thanks, guys.

jimmy a. brock -- chief executive officer and director
thank you, nate, and good morning everyone. as we all know, these are unprecedented times we're navigating through. thus far, 2020 has been very challenging for our industry and the world. we have seen significant declines in energy demand and have faced many uncertainties; first, due to warmer than normal winter, and most recently due to the economic slowdown brought on by the covid-19 pandemic.
the widespread government-imposed shutdown of businesses has resulted in reduced electricity demand, both domestically and abroad, which has weighed on our customers' ability to burn coal. before i go any further, let me be clear, ensuring the safety, health and well-being of our employees and their loved ones is paramount. the world has changed significantly in the last few months and all of us have to adapt to this new reality. i am proud of the consol team and the way they responded to this pandemic. we also know that being classified as an essential business comes with a lot of responsibility and pride. our frontline employees, who mine the coal that ensures an uninterrupted power supply during this time of need, embraced the challenge. we have adopted enhanced sanitizing and social distancing measures at our operations, and implementing staggered shifts at our mine sites. our corporate employees continued to support our operations very effectively, while coordinating and collaborating remotely to support government efforts to restrict the spread of the disease. i am very thankful to the entire consol team, as they continue to excel in these challenging times. we will continue to monitor the risk posed by the covid-19 pandemic, and we'll take any additional steps that we deem necessary to keep our employees, their families, and their communities safe.
before i dive into operation and marketing details, let me now provide a brief recap of the quarter. despite the significant demand decline, we achieved several important goals during the first quarter. on the safety front, we delivered a very strong safety performance with our harvey mine, bailey preparation plant, consol marine terminal and itmann project each had zero recordable incidents.
on the operations and marketing fronts, even while we faced several headwinds and reduced demand from our customers, our strong contracted position and operational flexibility softened the impacts of these declining market conditions. we drew upon the tremendous partnerships we have with our customers and continued to identify creative solutions to help navigate this extremely challenging situation.
on the financial front, we completed a number of transactions during the quarter, which reduced our outstanding debt and improved liquidity and enhanced our financial flexibility. mitesh will discuss these in more detail shortly.
now, let me review our first quarter operation performance. coal production at the pennsylvania mining complex decreased to 6 million tons in q1 of 2020 compared to 6.8 million tons in the year ago quarter. the decline was mainly due to the aforementioned reduction in customer demand and a corresponding reduction in operating days as we sell to match production with demand. for its share of the pennsylvania mining complex, ccr produced 1.5 million tons of coal during q1 of '20 compared to 1.7 million tons in the year ago quarter.
on the cost front, our average cash cost of coal sold per ton was $32.41 in q1 of '20 compared to $29.71 in q1 of '19. that per ton increase was largely driven by the decline in the production volumes and higher subsidence-related costs at our enlow fork mine. the consol marine terminal had a throughput volume of 3.4 million tons during the quarter compared to 4 million tons in the year ago period. given the terms of our take-or-pay contract at the terminal and despite a decline in shipment, our terminal revenues for the quarter were only modestly impaired at $16.5 million compared to $17.8 million in the year ago quarter. however, cash operating costs were slightly improved at $5.2 million versus $5.6 million in the year ago period.
i am pleased to announce that our itmann project mined its first cut of coal and shipped product to a third-party processor in early april. we remain very excited about this project. and even though we've slowed down the pace, we've been successful in proceeding with development mining at a controlled level of net expenditures. this gives us the flexibility to ramp up the project back up at our discretion in the future when market conditions warrant.
let me now provide an overview of the coal markets and an update on our sales performance and accomplishments. this was a challenging quarter for coal markets to say the least. coal demand was first impacted due to a mild winter and low natural gas prices, and then was impacted as a result of the government-imposed shutdowns of non-essential businesses.
on the power price front, average pjm west day-ahead power prices were 33% lower in q1 of '20 compared to q1 of '19 and more than 50% below the q1 '18 levels, which helps to illustrate the severity of the decline. for the most part, our power price-linked contracts were yielding realizations at their contractual floors. henry hub natural gas price averaged $1.90 per mmbtu during the quarter, which was down 35% compared to q1 of '19. these low natural gas prices, amid a significant overall demand decline, resulted in substantial coal to gas switching in the u.s., which in turn led to increased coal inventories for our customers. this all translated into reduced demand for our coal and let us to complete several contract buyouts in the quarter as we sell to help our customers manage their inventory levels. these contract buyouts involved in negotiations of early terminations of several customer contracts in exchange for payment of certain fees to us during the first quarter of 2020, which contributed $10.8 million to our miscellaneous other income.
on the export front, international thermal coal prices have been in decline since the start of 2019 due to a pullback in global lng prices and now due to the global covid-19-related shutdowns. however, as a result of this unprecedented demand decline and low prices, we believe that the global supply rationalization will be forced upon the energy industry. as you can see on slide 7 of the supplemental slide deck that we posted to our websites this morning, wood mackenzie estimates that at current spot prices, 36% of seaborne coal supply is at high risk of curtailment. the majority of this is thermal coal with estimates of 440 million tons of harvest production globally. we believe this could have to tighten the market as we move forward.
from a marketing perspective, we continue to maintain 100% of our existing customer base and continue to find opportunities to selectively grow and capture market share in the export markets. we announced this morning that our customer, xcoal, recently won a contract to supply 1.8 million tons of coal to the puna punta catalina power plant in the dominican republic. to fulfill that contract, xcoal increased the volume of tons to be acquired under a supply contract with us. in aggregate, we are now contracted for 10 plus million export tons in 2020. while we do not like the prices that we're seeing in the current market, we will generate cash margins on these new tons, and will hopefully gain a long-term end user for our coal. while we are mostly contracted for 2020, we have some more work to do for our volumes in 2021 and beyond. despite our strong contracted position, we do face significant uncertainties given the unpredictable nature of the covid-19 pandemic and the resulting economic slowdown. as always, we will work together with our customers to help them manage their contractual obligations that we both have.
with that, i will now turn the call over to mitesh to provide the financial update.
mitesh thakkar -- interim chief financial officer
thank you, jimmy, and good morning everyone. let me start with an update on our liability management efforts in the context of our capital allocation strategy. i will then review our financial results for 1q '20 and touch upon our cost management efforts and 2020 outlook. as we stated on our last earnings call, our top priority heading into 2020 was to remain laser-focused on improving the risk profile of our balance sheet by reducing our outstanding debt and creating long-term value for our ceix shareholders and ccr unitholders. i'm pleased to inform you that we believe we have gotten off to a good start in 1q '20. for ceix, we retired $53 million worth of our outstanding debt in the first quarter of 2020. most meaningfully, we spent less than $26 million to repurchase approximately $43 million of our second lien debt as it continued to trade at a significant discount to its par value. to put that number in perspective, we repurchased approximately $53 million of our second lien debt in the entire year of 2019. these discounted second lien repurchases provided a high rate of return and were extremely accretive to our equity holders. as we have stated in the past, our goal is to have a significantly lower level of absolute debt before our 2024 term loan b matures and this debt reduction during the first quarter was another big step toward that goal.
we recognize that our financial securities are very volatile, and as a result, we intend to spread our purchases out over time and take advantage of dollar-cost average. we also recognize that liquidity is very important during these uncertain times. in spite of deploying a significant amount of capital buying back our debt, we still ended the quarter with a cash balance and liquidity that were in line with the beginning of the first quarter.
to achieve this, we completed multiple transactions during the quarter to provide additional sources of low-cost capital and to improve financial flexibility, despite a decline in organic free cash flow versus the prior year period. first, we closed the finance lease transaction on a set of longwall shields, which provided net cash proceeds of $16.3 million at an interest rate of approximately 5.6%. second, we secured a commitment to provide an additional $20 million for future equipment financing needs. finally, we successfully amended and extended the term of our accounts receivable securitization program, extending the maturity to march 2023 from august 2021, while keeping the size of the facility unchanged.
last quarter, we also indicated that improving our net accounts receivable outstanding was one of our priorities for 2020. during the first quarter, we had some success on that front as well. our trade accounts receivable have declined to $113 million at the close of march 31, 2020 from $132 million at the close of december 31, 2019. while current market conditions are acting as a headwind in this process, we believe we will continue to make slow and steady progress toward normalizing our accounts receivable conversion cycle.
let me now discuss ccr. on april 24, ccr announced that its board of directors has made the decision to temporarily suspend its cash distribution to all unitholders. while painful, we believe this was a necessary step for several reasons. first, the uncertainty created by the covid-19 pandemic-related demand decline resulted in significant earnings decline for ccr. we started seeing it in the first quarter, and we expect it to continue through at least the second quarter and potentially the rest of the year. accordingly, we believe it is prudent to manage our cash flows, leverage ratios, and liquidity to ensure the maximum financial flexibility possible. this distribution suspension helps ccr conserve approximately $14 million of cash every quarter. on the trade receivables front, ccr, like ceix had similar success and ended the quarter with $28 million in trade receivables, compared to $33 million at the beginning of the quarter.
with that, let me now recap our first quarter 2020 results. we'll review ceix first, and then ccr. ceix reported first quarter 2020 net income attributable to ceix shareholders of $2.4 million or $0.09 per diluted share compared to $14.4 million or $0.52 per diluted share in 1q '19. ceix also reported 1q '20 adjusted ebitda of $62.9 million, an organic free cash flow of $24.2 million, which compared to $118.5 million and $48 million respectively in the year ago quarter. the decline in our earnings metrics compared to the year ago period is mostly the result of lower pjm power prices and coal export prices and the reduction in volumes that jimmy previously discussed.
in 1q '20, we generated $51.4 million of cash flow from operations and spent $27.2 million in capital expenditures. as a result, ceix generated $24.2 million in organic free cash flow. our cash flow from operations included a modest working capital improvement of $2.1 million.
now, let me update you on ccr. this morning, ccr reported net income of $0.2 million, adjusted ebitda of $14.4 million and distributable cash flow of $3.5 million for the first quarter. this compares to $15.2 million, $28.2 million, and $17.3 million respectively in the year ago quarter. in 1q '20, ccr generated $16.8 million in net cash from operating activities, which includes $4.5 million improvement in working capital. after accounting for $5.2 million in capital expenditures, $14.4 million in distribution payments, and proceeds from the shield lease financing transactions, we were able to hold our outstanding debt and the intercompany loan with ceix flat compared to year-end 2019. nonetheless, due to the reduction in the trailing 12-month ebitda, ccr finished the quarter with a net leverage ratio of 2.2 times.
now, let me move on to providing some color on what we expect for the remainder of 2020. we typically provide you with quantitative guidance around our sales, revenue, cost, and ebitda expectations. however, given the difficulty in forecasting the duration and the uncertainty of the covid-19 pandemic and the resulting economic slowdown and energy demand decline, our 2020 guidance remains suspended for the quarter. as we gain more visibility around demand recovery, we expect to resume some quantitative guidance. in the meantime, let me provide some color that could help analysts and investors from a modeling standpoint.
on the production side, the mines are ready to run, but we will remain sales driven. even though we have 25 million plus tons contracted for 2020, the timing of shipments and the magnitude of contract buyouts will dictate the ultimate sales and production volumes. this is very painful for us. however, we recognize our customers are suffering as well, and we are working with them to ensure that we support each other. from our side, the compromise could involve deferring some volumes and extending some payment terms. from the customer side, it could mean buying out contracts or adding additional volumes in the future. as a result of this constantly evolving landscape, we have currently idled some of our longwalls and expect frequent changes to our second quarter operating schedule.
the management team also took significant steps to reduce the overall cost structure of the business in order to help offset the recent demand decline brought on by the covid-19 pandemic. first, we adjusted our operating schedule to reduce output to better align our production with customer demand, including making the decision in mid-april to temporarily idle our higher cost enlow fork mine. second, we embarked on several cost reduction initiatives that in aggregate could help us achieve approximately $100 million in cash preservation in 2020 compared to 2019. these include: number one, $8 million to $10 million in cash sg&a savings by canceling annual merit increases, suspended planned hiring, and cash incentive compensation; number two, $45 million to $50 million in capital expenditure reductions, mostly due to reduction in maintenance capital expenditure at the pennsylvania mining complex; number three, $7 million to $10 million in cash interest expense savings at ceix due to debt extinguishment; number four, $30 million to $40 million cash savings due to reduced income taxes and payroll tax deferrals; number five, $5.6 million on a consolidated level and $14.4 million at the ccr level, every quarter, the distribution suspension stays in place. these cash preservation initiatives will provide us with the flexibility to opportunistically take advantage of the decline in the prices of our outstanding public debt. finally, the board members of ceix have also agreed to temporarily defer the cash compensation to support the cash preservation efforts of the company.
lastly, from a market perspective, although the covid-19-driven economic slowdown has significantly reduced global energy demand, we are already beginning to see supply responses. first, with the oil pricing and supply reductions arising from the new opec plus deal, wood mackenzie is now estimating that total non-opec supply may decline by as much as 4 million barrels per day, 3 million of which would come from the continental u.s., particularly in the permian basin. that's important, because a significant oil supply reduction in the permian also means a significant reduction in associated gas production. furthermore, lower oil and natural gas prices are negatively affecting the financials of e&p companies and forcing a reduction in the size of their capital budgets. industry observers are now estimating that e&p capital expenditures will decline by as much as 40% to 45% in 2020. as a result of this reduced investment base, industry experts are now projecting natural gas prices to rise about $3 per mmbtu in 2021, which we believe will make coal more attractive to our power plant customers. in fact, ihs markit now expects that u.s. coal consumption could return to 2019 levels in 2021. this translates into approximately 125 million tons in demand recovery, due to an increase in natural gas prices driving gas to coal switching in 2021.
in the coal industry, domestic supply rationalization was already happening in 2019, and we expect that to accelerate in 2020. internationally, as jimmy mentioned, 36% of global seaborne suppliers at risk of curtailments at current pricing levels. putting it all together, these developments could bode very well for us, as we begin filling out the remainder of our 2021 contract book in the coming months.
with that, let me turn it back to jimmy to make some final comments.
jimmy a. brock -- chief executive officer and director
thank you, mitesh. before we move on to the q&a session, let me take this opportunity to lay out some of our priorities for the remainder of 2020 and address some of the uncertainty we are facing in the current economic climate. first and foremost, i want to commend our employees for their dedication, hard work, and willingness to adapt in these unprecedented times. we have adjusted procedures and protocols in order to keep everyone safe and prevent any unnecessary exposure to the coronavirus. we've enhanced cleaning and disinfecting practices at the mines, both on the surface and underground. we've also implemented additional social distancing measures, staggered shifts, reduced elevator capacities, and mandatory temperature checks at all mine entrance locations. our corporate staff has been working remotely for well over a month now. i couldn't be proud of our employees and their willingness to embrace these adjustments without hesitation. i want to thank them for continuing to place safety above all else.
for 2020, while we navigate this ever changing landscape due to the uncertainties surrounding the covid-19 pandemic, our main strategy of prioritizing strong balance sheet will remain, as we seek to delever, reduce our interest expense and continue to take advantage of the dislocations and the prices of our debt securities. the reason our capital allocation strategy has been so effective is its consistency.
our priorities remain constant, despite any fluctuations in commodity markets. by consistently targeting the highest rate of return projects, we are always reevaluating and willing to pivot in a new direction as the world around us changes. we've proved this with our willingness to delay our itmann growth project to prioritize the guaranteed high rate of returns associated with our second lien repurchases. mitesh and his team will continue to remain laser-focused on bolstering liquidity, improving financial flexibility, and reducing our overall debt. jim mccaffrey and his team will continue to work closely with our customers to manage their shipments and inventory levels, and eric and his team will continue to manage their cost structure and operating schedules to best align them with demand and preserve margins.
additionally, we are pulling multiple levers to preserve cash flow in this economic downturn. we have been able to reduce our capital spending requirements in 2020, thanks to our willingness to keep our mines well capitalized in strong markets. we are working on reducing our operating cost structure at the mines through delaying discretionary spending and adjusting our operating schedules according to demand. we have also implemented significant cost saving measures at the corporate level as well. finally, although there is a lot of uncertainty in the marketplace and nothing is guaranteed, we are currently 98% contracted for 2020, assuming a 26 million ton run rate. we have also contracted more than 10 million export tons in 2020, after xcoal increased the volume of tons to be acquired under a supply contract with us.
in summary, our key priorities for the remainder of 2020 are: one, to ensure the health and safety of our workforce, their families and the communities in which we operate amid the ongoing covid-19 pandemic; two, to safely and compliantly produce our high-quality coal at the lowest possible cost; three, to continue to work with our customers to ensure that the long-term nature of our relationships continue as we navigate this storm together; and fourth, to continue to improve our balance sheet and bolster our liquidity.
before i turn the call over, i want to touch on one last point. as you may have seen, we are continuing to work through the very complicated and complex murray energy bankruptcy. as we have stated before, we will vigorously defend our rights, our employees, the communities in which we live and work and our stakeholders in these proceedings. however, we cannot comment on any ongoing litigation matters associated with these proceedings, and we will not be fielding any questions on the topic today.
with that, i will hand the call back over to nate for further instructions.
nathan tucker -- manager of finance and investor relations
thank you, jimmy. we will now move to the q&a session of our call. eric, can you please provide the instruction to our callers?
",":
operator
thank you. we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [operator instructions] our first question today will come from mark levin with the benchmark company. please proceed with your question.
mark levin -- the benchmark company -- analyst
thanks very much and appreciate all the color. i guess the first question is actually for mitesh. mitesh, you're reeling off all of those numbers in terms of sg&a savings and capex reduction. is that relative to your 2019 actual or relative to the now suspended guidance? just trying to benchmark how much we should adjust our model for those numbers?
mitesh thakkar -- interim chief financial officer
sure. thank you, mark. i think those are all relative to 2019 actuals.
mark levin -- the benchmark company -- analyst
okay, fair enough. very helpful. and then second question relates to the export business. so, i guess, you guys are shooting to sell about 10 million tons or have 10 million tons under contract. i guess, what's the risk to that number? and then maybe more specifically, you guys ship a lot of tons to india, if you can maybe talk about what the environment is like in india with the lockdown and how much of a risk that would present?
james j. mccaffrey -- senior vice president of coal marketing
hi, mark. it's jim, how are you?
mark levin -- the benchmark company -- analyst
i'm doing well. thank you, jim.
james j. mccaffrey -- senior vice president of coal marketing
i'm going to do my best to answer your questions, but please keep in mind that visibility is not very clear and we're reforecasting cost. but in india, as you know, they have a lockdown. a lot of the people left their working areas to go to their home bases again. the lockdown is supposed to be totally lifted by may 18. we expect businesses to get back going in gear. but a lot of demand destruction has taken place in india as well and the three large west coast terminals are all relatively full with approximately 18 million tons. we still expect demand to be very strong in india. when we look at our first quarter, we had shipped about 1.7 million tons to india, which was about 28% of our total sales and that's up from previous years.
so, our sales are up some, and we continue to expect demand. but as this -- as the shutdown ends, we're moving into monsoon season. so as we exit monsoon, we expect to see some return in volume.
mark levin -- the benchmark company -- analyst
okay. and then jim maybe kind of 2021, i think you guys mentioned, you've got 40% some odd contracted in 2021, i realize netback contracts can change things and shifting tons from '20 to '21 can change things, but as it stands right now, and you look at what's contracted for next year, 2021, should we anticipate a big price per ton reduction, a modest one, flat? i mean how would one think about approximating what the 2021 book could look like, maybe just assuming normal weather?
james j. mccaffrey -- senior vice president of coal marketing
well, mark, we're in negotiations for business for 2021 right now. so, i don't want to discuss price too much, but in general, i think the published forwards are way too low and unsustainable. you see where we're at today. i think we can maintain level or improve. mitesh talked about the gas situation changing, we think that'll be a big benefit to our netback tons. so, i would think we can hold the course or improve.
jimmy a. brock -- chief executive officer and director
and one big factor on that mark will be how quick these businesses get back opened and the demand starts to increase because that's what we all need, that will help price and if natural gas prices end up north of $3 an mmbtu, as many are predicting, that should help the price as well. but, there is some work to do as far as the inventories and there's a lot of uncertainty right now. so, we'll have to see how all of that goes in the future.
mark levin -- the benchmark company -- analyst
yeah. that makes sense. and my last question, as you think about -- or maybe this is for mitesh, if you think about kind of debt pay down versus maintaining a certain amount of liquidity, how do you tow that balance? is there a liquidity target that you have sort of a minimum level? obviously, you've been active in repurchasing debt, but i was just trying to figure out how to calibrate, what you're comfortable with in terms of maintaining minimum amount of liquidity?
mitesh thakkar -- interim chief financial officer
sure. mark, i think as you pointed out, it's a balance, right? and that's why we mentioned earlier in the call that we are not going to be super aggressive on anything. we are going to make sure that at all the times, we have adequate amount of liquidity. i think i'm comfortable where our liquidity sits today. now, if the market conditions improve and we start seeing businesses open up, i think we could potentially deploy some more cash. but i think we'll have to make sure that at all times we have significant amount of liquidities. we are also looking at other sources of financing, one of which we have executed in the first quarter. so, if there are opportunities like that where essentially you are borrowing low-cost capital and taking advantage of market dislocations and retiring high-cost capital, we'll look at those opportunities as well. so, i think free cash flow generation -- the good thing is the business generates free cash flow, and as long as that continues, we can deploy some amount of cash, taking advantage of market dislocations.
mark levin -- the benchmark company -- analyst
great. fantastic. thanks for the time this morning.
jimmy a. brock -- chief executive officer and director
thanks, mark.
james j. mccaffrey -- senior vice president of coal marketing
thanks, mark.
operator
our next question comes from lucas pipes of b. riley fbr. please proceed with your question.
lucas pipes -- b. riley fbr -- analyst
hey, good morning everyone, and i hope you all are doing well and staying safe. i wanted to kind of follow up a little bit on that last question from mark. in terms of the potential for things to get worse, just, i understand that, it seems to be improving natural gas prices are up and such, but like, within the coal markets, of course, there are a lot of inventory. so, if things don't kind of come back here over the next three months, six months, nine months and the market stays over-supplied, what should we expect from you in terms of being able to respond to this market environment, both from an operational, as well as from a kind of cash liquidity perspective? thank you.
jimmy a. brock -- chief executive officer and director
well, from an operational standpoint, lucas, we've always said that we will run to the market and that's currently what we're doing today. so, it used to be a weekly thing. now, it's a daily thing that we actually sit down and look at what our forecast are for the day, for the week and then we adjust accordingly, as one of our strong suits with the pennsylvania mining complex is the optionality we have with the complex to whereas we can run one longwall or we can run five longwalls, but it will be dependent upon what the market.
good news for us is we don't have ground storage, so we don't have a lot of inventory to work through, and as long as we stay in communication with our tier 1 railroads, then, we can move that coal out. so, it's a matter of what coal shipments that we have for that week and what's the quality that will pretty much determine which longwall we need to run and then it's all about cost, it's about managing cash and running the lowest cost operation you can. so, from an operation standpoint, we'll continue to look at ways to take out cost, and then we'll run to whatever the market requirements are for that week or that day.
mitesh thakkar -- interim chief financial officer
on the financial side, lucas, like i was talking to mark's question -- i was answering mark's question, i think we would like to remain flexibility. the good thing is we refinanced our debt last year, so we don't have any immediate maturities. i think we got -- we got an attractive interest rate here. so, the way i would think about it is, without compromising liquidity, as long as we are able to carry out some of the transactions, and as you can see, our board is supportive of the strategy as well as they approved an increase in authorization, will allow us to be opportunistic in the marketplace.
james j. mccaffrey -- senior vice president of coal marketing
and then on the market side, lucas, some of our customers have flexibility built to their contract and we expect that most of those will fully use their flexibility that they're allowed, but at some point, they can't move all of their tons into 2021. so they have to take and burn tons in '20 or they have to buy a side of the tons. in the first quarter, we have already stated that we had 10.8 million tons of buyouts -- $10.8 million of buyouts, which represents about 550,000 tons. so, we would much prefer to mine, ship and burn those tons, than we would just get a buyout. but it does give us the ability to continue to bring cash into the business.
lucas pipes -- b. riley fbr -- analyst
yeah, that's very helpful. i appreciate all the color there. a follow-up on just kind of cash management and balance sheet management, great to see that increased authorization from the board on the debt repurchase side, and i wondered if you could maybe speak to the cadence of potential additional buybacks, obviously, a great way to delever the balance sheet here, what the market is doing. thank you.
mitesh thakkar -- interim chief financial officer
i think, lucas, it is hard in this market to give you like the exact numbers on how we are going to execute that. again, like i said, it depends on where the market is and how much cash is coming in the door. i mean, if jim mccaffrey brings in more cash in the door, you will see that pace increase, and we'll make sure that we don't compromise liquidity in this market. so, i think the board authorization is for two years, as it sits today, an additional two years. but, as you have seen in the past that if we are executing it faster, we have added to that authorization, if need be. but, like i said, it's hard to give you a very accurate cadence without knowing what the market has in store for us next week, next month.
james j. mccaffrey -- senior vice president of coal marketing
yeah, i think simply put, lucas, our capital allocation process, we'll stay with that. we have the flexibility to repurchase shares or pay back debt and it will always be on the highest rate of return.
lucas pipes -- b. riley fbr -- analyst
that's very helpful, gentlemen. and i really appreciate the color and [indecipherable] best of luck.
jimmy a. brock -- chief executive officer and director
thank you, lucas.

[operator instructions] our next question comes from michael dudas of the vertical research partners. please proceed with your question.
michael dudas -- vertical research partners -- analyst
good morning, gentlemen.
jimmy a. brock -- chief executive officer and director
good morning, mike.
michael dudas -- vertical research partners -- analyst
first question, just clarification on the xcoal announcement relative to the tonnage to the dominican republic, that 1.8 million tons, that's all going to be sourced by you guys, and is that for this year? is that on an annual basis or spread out? how does that work through?
james j. mccaffrey -- senior vice president of coal marketing
we expect it all to be sourced from us. the 1.8 million is really 1.8 million metric, mike. we weren't totally clear on that, and it will be done in three, four-month trimesters, starting in may. so, it's really per year, starting in may.
michael dudas -- vertical research partners -- analyst
okay. terrific. that's helpful. secondly, the amount of customer buyout you saw in the quarter -- just to get a sense of how do you think things are going to trough as we start to end the lockdowns and recover and see load factors improve, do you sense that your existing customer base will keep that pace of buyouts because of the lockdown or will that maybe start to subside, as things get back to normal? and as you're talking to your customers, i know you're looking daily and weekly on your nominations, any insight from them? any sense of where that flows respective of where gas price or power price might be?
jimmy a. brock -- chief executive officer and director
as far as the pace of buyouts, mike, we will have some buyouts in the second quarter. we certainly hope that's the peak. as i said earlier, our intent is not to have our customers buy out, our intent is to deliver and have the product burned. in terms of -- in terms of gas, i think our customers are just starting to feel their way through that now, as more and more reports come out about the loss of auxiliary gas and the fact that it looks like the gas curves are getting stronger for the end of the year and for 2021.
so, i can't say that we've had a lot of -- a lot of dialog on that. we've had some. it's something that we're working on very high right now. we're talking to our customers on a weekly basis, sometimes more often, and we are working on things for 2021.
michael dudas -- vertical research partners -- analyst
i appreciate that jimmy. and jim, my final question would be on this -- moving this topic further. looking at competitive environment, domestic coal producers, some large ones, as you know are in some difficult financial positions. are customers more concerned about that? do you get a sense there could be potential for share gains? and how significant do you think the production response certainly is probably going to be ahead of when demand picks up for gas and certainly coal? it seems pretty dull at the eastern coal fields, and can that certainly help, as you kind of time [phonetic] in your export layers and your layers into 2021 and beyond? thank you.
james j. mccaffrey -- senior vice president of coal marketing
well, for us mike, mitesh said this in his remarks, i mean, our mines are ready to go. they're fully capitalized, they're fully developed. to ramp up production, we don't have to go in there and do anything special whereas someone that might be in bankruptcy or someone had to work hard just to hold cash together may have sacrificed some development speed, may have sacrificed some spending that needed to be done on really needed maintenance. so, we find we're in position to move quickly as the market improves and that's what we intend to do. i've read a lot of studies, there's a lot of debate about where coal is going to be this year and next year, but some people think that we could have anywhere from 125 million tons to 170 million tons recovery in 2021, and we'll be ready for it. i'm not sure the whole industry will be.
michael dudas -- vertical research partners -- analyst
i agree, jim, thanks for your thoughts gentlemen. good luck.

our next question will come from matthew fields of bank of america. please proceed with your question.
matthew fields -- bank of america -- analyst
hey everyone. just...
jimmy a. brock -- chief executive officer and director
hey, matt.
matthew fields -- bank of america -- analyst
couple of more housekeeping follow ups from me. have you purchased any more second lien bonds in the 40 some odd days since march 31?
mitesh thakkar -- interim chief financial officer
we have not yet. and just to remind everyone that we do have a restriction on our second lien, which is tied to our leverage ratio. so right now, we are not buying our second lien debt.
matthew fields -- bank of america -- analyst
okay, thank you. and then the capex guidance, i think you said that it was -- the reductions -- i think -- correct me if i'm wrong, $45 million to $50 million lower capex, but that's from a 2019 level, so is that like $120 million to $125 million guidance for 2020 now?
mitesh thakkar -- interim chief financial officer
again, we are not providing guidance, so i will not give you the range. but, i think you are in the neighborhood. and remember, this is a constant work in progress. so, we are looking at everything, so think of just that initial steps.
matthew fields -- bank of america -- analyst
okay. and then, you mentioned that the enlow fork mine was sort of the higher cost mine in your comments that you decided to idle. can you give us an idea of sort of the cost -- the cash cost per ton for enlow fork compared to your other two in the pamc?
mitesh thakkar -- interim chief financial officer
so, matt, we don't talk about our individual mines, but in terms of cost structure, i think we run pamc as a complex. but, as you know, enlow fork is going through a high subsidence here. it started in 2019 and we have often talked about this on the call that because of subsidence that caused us a little bit skewed in this year, and that is the primary reason where unless we figure out a way to lower the cost structure at enlow or the market demand recovers, i think we'll be very careful on how that mine is brought back online.
jimmy a. brock -- chief executive officer and director
yeah. and just to add to that a little bit matthew, enlow fork, you've heard us talk about it many times before, the geological conditions they have and this is primarily up in the north. enlow fork will be moved into our new eastern reserves and will be out of that high subsidence area up there. we only lack two short panels and will be moved out of there in next year in 2021.
so, we expect the cost to more normalize to our other operations in the mining complex, but we have to get out of the north side before we'll get over there. and that's the reason for the higher cost. i mean, they have the same operating mentality and equipment, it's just some of the conditions they have, haven't allowed them to be very cost effective there.
mitesh thakkar -- interim chief financial officer
and also add that this is also shipment driven, right? like so, if we get back to our normal pace of shipments, the idea is not here to say that enlow fork doesn't make money in the current environment at our current contracted price, it is when the shipments fall off, you automatically scale back production. and when you're scaling back production, you're scaling back at your higher cost mines. this is not saying that enlow fork cannot make money at our current prices. it's just our shipment level is temporarily low because of covid-19-related demand decline.
matthew fields -- bank of america -- analyst
okay, i understand. thanks for all the help and clarifications on that.
mitesh thakkar -- interim chief financial officer
yeah.
operator
[operator instructions] our next question will come from nick jarmoszuk with stifel. please proceed with your question.
nick jarmoszuk -- stifel -- analyst
hi, good morning. a question on the ccr/ceix relationship. has there been any discussion regarding ccr addressing the principal due to ceix?
mitesh thakkar -- interim chief financial officer
repeat that question, nick.
nick jarmoszuk -- stifel -- analyst
i am basically wondering, is ccr going to be chipping away at the principal due to ceix?
mitesh thakkar -- interim chief financial officer
i think generally speaking, ccr, as you saw, the leverage ratio ticked up and because of the market uncertainty, we suspended the distribution. to the extent any cash that doesn't get distributed and ccr generates that cash, i think it is prudent for ccr to pay down the debt that will save some interest expense for ccr.
nick jarmoszuk -- stifel -- analyst
okay. a question for you on the natural gas price. so, you're talking about $3 or $3 outlook for '21 could increase coal burn. now, how do you think about what's the magic number that guys need to start seeing some gas to coal switching for your customers? is it $3 or is it a little higher, a little lower [speech overlap]?
james j. mccaffrey -- senior vice president of coal marketing
first of all, any increase in the gas price helps to improve our burn and our netback pricing mines. we've said before that our netback price has its base price that is equivalent to around $25 in the pjm. above that, we get an energy market adjustment, and then energy market adjustment adds up to $0.20 across the entire portfolio for every dollar of improvement in the pjm. now, we're looking at the forwards today and the forwards are taking a big jump in july to above $25 and they're showing growth to about $30 by the end of the year. so, we think that that's going to make a better second half for the netback deals and for next year. but, any improvement in the gas market, benefits.
nick, i would say that we find most of our customers model their plus or minus on gas around $2.50 to $2.75. so, i think that's a good number to model at.
nick jarmoszuk -- stifel -- analyst
okay. all right. and then last question, just regarding the xcoal contracts that are coming up at the end of this year, can you just -- any updates regarding the discussions there?
james j. mccaffrey -- senior vice president of coal marketing
there is discussions.
jimmy a. brock -- chief executive officer and director
yeah. that contract runs through december this year and we have started some light discussions on that. we expect to get heavy into that a little bit later in the year when we get some sort of certainly coming back to us, once we get out of this pandemic situation.
nick jarmoszuk -- stifel -- analyst

good day, and welcome to the ceix and ccr second quarter 2020 earnings conference call. [operator instructions]
i'd now like to turn the conference over to nathan tucker, manager finance & investor relations. please go ahead.
nathan tucker -- manager-finance and investor relations
thank you, cole, and good morning, everyone. welcome to consol energy and consol coal resources second quarter 2020 earnings conference call.
any forward-looking statements or comments we make about future expectations are subject to some risks, which we have outlined in our press releases and in our sec filings, and are considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934. we do not undertake any obligations of updating any forward-looking statements for future events or otherwise. we will also be discussing certain non-gaap financial measures, which are defined and reconciled to comparable gaap financial measures in our press releases and furnished to the sec on form 8-k. you can also find additional information regarding the companies on our websites www.consolenergy.com and www.ccrlp.com.
on the call with me today are jimmy brock, our chief executive officer; mitesh thakkar, our chief financial officer; and jim mccaffrey, our chief commercial officer. in his prepared remarks, jimmy will provide a recap of our second quarter 2020 performance, specific insights on marketing and operations and an update on our ongoing response to the covid-19 pandemic. mitesh will then discuss our liability management program, financial results, cash preservation efforts and outlook for the remainder of 2020. after the prepared remarks, there will be a q&a session, in which all three executives will participate.
with that, let me turn the call over to our ceo, jimmy brock.
jimmy a. brock -- chief executive officer and director
thank you, nate, and good morning, everyone. to this point, 2020 has been extremely challenging year for us, our industry and the u.s. and global economies. we first dealt with the weak demand early in the year due to warmer than normal winter, then the covid-19 pandemic hit us all, with most economies across the world essentially grinding to a halt to try to stop the spread of this disease. this led to an unprecedented destruction in energy demand, specifically in the second quarter of 2020. from a demand perspective, q2 '20 was the worst quarter that i've seen in my 40 plus year career and the most challenging market conditions we've experienced in the 30 plus year history of the pennsylvania mining complex.
the widespread government imposed shutdowns caused by the covid-19 pandemic created an unprecedented decline in energy demand, both domestically and abroad. in response, we idled our enlow fork mine early in the second quarter, ran our bailey mine on an as needed basis and went into cash preservation mode. i'm proud of our operations and corporate teams responding as we quickly pivoted and pulled back on discretionary spending in an effort to protect our liquidity.
the finance team moved early to secure an amendment to our credit agreement that essentially provides us with eight quarters of covenant relaxation. we'll also preserve full access to our $400 million revolving credit facility. to be able to secure this amendment in a challenging market was extremely impressive. we also want to thank our banking partners and investors for their overwhelming support and belief in us and our business.
as always, we continue to place the safety of our employees and their loved ones above all else. we announced last quarter that we adopted enhanced sanitation and social distancing measures at our operations and implemented staggered shifts, reduced elevator capacities and mandatory temperature checks at all mine entrance locations across our pennsylvania mining complex. we continue to approve upon these practices every day. and we are proud of the biding from the entire consol team and their dedication to safety. we will continue to monitor the risk posed by the covid-19 pandemic, and we'll take any additional steps that we deem necessary to keep our employees, their families and the communities safe.
before i dive into operational marketing details, let me now provide a brief recap of the quarter. despite the significant demand decline, we achieved several important goals during the second quarter. on the safety front, we delivered a very strong performance as our bailey mine, bailey preparation plant, consol marine terminal and itmann project each had zero recordable incidents.
on the operation and marketing fronts, we faced significant headwinds from reduced customer demand. however, we were able to leverage our operational flexibility to help soften the impact of these declining market conditions. we worked with our customers throughout the quarter to identify solutions to help navigate this extremely challenging situation. these solutions included partial contract buyouts, and in some cases, new future business. on the financial front, as i've test upon already, we completed a timely credit amendment. additionally, our finance team continue to focus on cost reduction and liquidity conservation, which resulted in limited cash burn despite a significant decline in shipment volumes compared to q2 of '19.
now let me provide our second quarter operational performance. coal production at the pennsylvania mining complex decreased to 2.4 million tons in q2 of '20 compared to 7.2 million tons in the year ago quarter. the decline was due to a significant reduction in customer demand as most global economies shut down due to the covid-19 pandemic. we also ran at a significantly reduced operating capacity, seeking to mass production with demand. for its share of the pennsylvania mining complex, ccr produced 600,000 tons of coal during q2 of '20 compared to 1.8 million tons in the year ago quarter.
on the cost front, our average cash cost of coal sold per ton was $25.90 in q2 of '20 compared to $31.07 in q2 of '19 as our operations team was successful in keeping tight control over cash expenditures in the quarter. the adjustments we made to operations allowed us to reduce our overall average cash cost of coal sold per ton on a producing assets and to partially mitigate the financial impact of the reduced production volume. the improvement was primarily driven by lower mine maintenance and supply cost, contractors and purchased service cost and subsidence expense.
the consol marine terminal had a throughput volume of 1.6 million tons during the quarter compared to 3.7 million tons in the year ago period. despite a decline in shipments, our terminal revenues for the quarter were only modestly impaired at $15.9 million compared to $16.7 million in the year ago quarter. however, cash operating costs were improved at $3.8 million versus $5 million in the year ago period as the terminal employees also successfully limited their cash expenditures in q2 of '20.
let me now provide an overview of the coal markets and an update on our sales performance and accomplishments. there is no sugar coating how difficult the second quarter of 2020 was from a demand perspective. after a tough start to the year where coal demand was impacted by mild winter weather and low natural gas prices, we were then hit with the widespread government imposed shutdowns of non-essential businesses due to covid-19 pandemic. on a year-to-date basis, these shutdowns peaked in the second quarter as most global economies essentially shut down for multiple months to curve the spread of the coronavirus. this resulted in an unprecedented decline in energy demand as an increase in residential energy consumption couldn't nearly replace the decrease in the industrial demand.
on the power price front, average pjm west day-ahead power prices were 28% lower in q2 of '20 compared to q2 of '19. additionally, henry hub natural gas spot prices averaged $1.70 per mmbtu during the quarter, which was down 34% compared to q2 of '19. these lower natural gas prices and the overall demand decline resulted in a substantial reduction in coal burn in the u.s., which led to increased coal inventories for our customers.
similar to the first quarter of 2020, this translated into reduced demand for our coal and led us to complete several contract buyouts in the second quarter as we solve to help our customers manage their inventory levels. we leveraged our strongest contracted position in the quarter to negotiate these buyouts, which involved the early termination of a portion of several customer contracts in exchange for payment of certain fees to us during the second quarter and contributed $30.1 million to our miscellaneous other income. these substantial buyouts were key to happen us limit our operating cash burn in the quarter.
on a positive note, the eia is estimating a significant domestic supply response in 2020 and projects a 29% decline in u.s. coal production versus 2019. additionally, low natural gas and crude oil prices have led to reduced activity in capital expenditures for e&p companies. ihs markit reports that active u.s. gas rig stood at 76 in early july, down from 174 a year ago and down from more than 200 active rigs in january of 2019. as a result, several industry observers now expect natural gas prices to rise above $3 per mmbtu in 2021 as gas production declines due to the lack of capital spending. this is leading to forecast of an additional 100 to 125 million tons of incremental domestic coal burn in 2021. finally, we believe that lack of investment across the coal space will limit the coal industry's ability to quickly ramp back up to meet this demand. this could be very advantageous situation for us as we prioritize keeping our mines as well capitalized in strong markets, which gives us the ability to scale up very quickly.
on the export front, we began the year with the intent to ship 9 million to 10 million tons export in 2020. through the first quarter, we were on pace to accomplish that with 2.4 million tons shipped. however, in the second quarter, we shipped roughly 800,000 tons. this was entirely caused by the worldwide economic shutdown created by the covid-19 pandemic. it is important to note that these tons were not replaced by other tons or other fields. they were lost due to unprecedented demand destruction. as global demand begins to recover and india's retail season restarts as monsoon season comes to an end, demand for our product remained strong. we have started receiving inquiries again, and we expect steady recovery for the second remainder of the year.
from a marketing perspective, it is encouraging to see that demand for our coal has steadily improved month-over-month since may, which was the lowest point of demand for our coal this year. this recent demand improvement has allowed us to restart one longwall at our enlow fork mine after it was idled most of the second quarter. we continued to maintain 100% of our existing customer base and have begun to see improvement from a contracting perspective beyond 2020.
we announced this morning that during the second quarter of 2020, we successfully contracted 4.3 million tons for the 2021 through 2024 period. we are now 49% contracted for 2021, assuming a 26 million ton run rate and not including any potential 2020 deferrals. we are also fully contracted for 2020, but we understand the significant uncertainties that will exist in the marketplace. we will remain flexible and we'll continue to work closely with our customers to manage our respective contractual obligations.
with that, i will now turn the call over to mitesh to provide the financial update.
mitesh thakkar -- interim chief financial officer
thank you, jimmy, and good morning, everyone. let me start by providing an update on our liability management program and credit facility amendment. i will then review our financial results for 2q '20 and touch upon our cash preservation efforts and second half 2020 outlook.
as we have stated all year, our top priority for 2020 was to remain laser-focused on improving the risk profile of our balance sheet by reducing our outstanding debt and creating long-term value for our ceix shareholders and ccr unitholders. in the near-term, we also realized how important liquidity is during these uncertain times. since the beginning of 2020, we have taken several steps to reduce our outstanding debt and capture the arbitrage that exist between different financing costs while maintaining strong liquidity.
let me now summarize some of our key liability management initiatives since the beginning of the year. in the first quarter, we significantly reduced spending on our itmann project, which deferred $25 million of capex. we then diverted that spending toward buying back approximately $43 million of our second-lien notes at a significant discount to par value, which helped reduce our leverage and reduced annual interest expense by nearly $5 million.
in the second quarter, we suspended ccr's cash distribution to all unitholders, which resulted in annual cash conservation of approximately $22 million for ceix and approximately $58 million for ccr. due to our willingness to keep the mines well capitalized in strong markets, as we did in 2018 and 2019, we are now able to reduce capital spending at the pennsylvania mining complex to $75 million this year and approximately 50% decline from 2019 levels.
on the financing front, we raised approximately $29 million of capital through a sale leaseback and multiple finance leases in the first half of 2020. and last but not the least, we proactively worked with our banking partners and term loan b investors to amend our credit facility early in the second quarter, which effectively provided us with eight quarters of covenant relaxation, while also providing continued access to our $400 million revolving credit facility.
we also added additional flexibility to repurchase our outstanding second-lien notes without a leverage test. during this unprecedented demand decline brought on by the covid-19 pandemic, keeping full access to our revolving credit facility cannot be understated. i thank our bank group for working with us as we navigate these challenging market conditions.
additionally, our credit amendment also included amending the affiliate loan facility between ccr and ceix, which in turn also provides ccr with eight quarters of covenant relaxation and continued access to its $275 million intercompany loan with consol energy. given the uncertainty in the marketplace, continued access to liquidity and financial flexibility will be paramount for both companies moving forward.
although the amended credit agreement also allows us to repurchase up to $25 million of our second-lien notes without a leverage test, we did not execute any buybacks in the second quarter. given the uncertainty created by global economic shutdowns, we decided to preserve our cash. however, we still retired $14 million of our outstanding debt in the second quarter of 2020 through required amortizations.
in the quarter, we made repayments of $7.2 million, $6.3 million and $700,000 on our asset-backed financing arrangements term loan a and term loan b respectively. our goal is to have significantly lower level of debt before our 2024 term loan b matures, and we will continue to strive toward that goal.
with that, let me now recap our second quarter 2020 results. we'll review ceix first then ccr. ceix reported a second quarter 2020 net loss attributable to ceix shareholders of $18 million or $0.69 per diluted share compared to net income of $43.3 million or $1.56 per diluted share in 2q '19. ceix also reported 2q '20 adjusted ebitda of $34.2 million and organic free cash flow of negative $24 million, which compares to $112.9 million and $34.8 million respectively in the year ago quarter. the significant decline in our earnings metrics compared to the year ago period is the result of the unprecedented demand decline we experienced in the second quarter.
in 2q '20, we used $4.7 million of net cash flow on operations and spent $19.3 million on capital expenditures. as a result, ceix ended the second quarter with negative $24 million of organic free cash flow. our cash flow from operations included a working capital use of $19 million due to significant decline in our accounts payable balance and a $10 million semi-annual interest payment on our second-lien notes. we ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $33 million, down from $78 million at the end of the quarter.
notable cash outflows during the quarter included approximately $19 million in cash interest payments, approximately $14 million in mandatory debt payments and approximately $8 million in transaction costs related to the recently discussed amendment to our credit agreement. we also incurred $31.8 million in cash idle costs in 2q '20. however, our $30.1 million in contract buyouts essentially offset this expense. after accounting for these items, we had a net cash burn of approximately $4 million in the quarter. this also accounts for all capital expenditures and working capital adjustments as well as the remainder of the operating cash flow.
while the quarter was ultimately disappointing from a shipment and cash flow generation standpoint, it was encouraging to see the response of the team and its ability to manage and preserve cash when times were tough. at the time -- at the end of the quarter, we were in full compliance with our credit covenants and currently maintained full access to our revolving credit facility.
now let me update you on ccr. this morning, ccr reported a net loss of $7.9 million, adjusted ebitda of $6 million and distributable cash flow of negative $4.7 million for the second quarter. this compares to net income of $14.4 million, adjusted ebitda of $27.6 million and distributable cash flow of $16.8 million respectively in the year ago quarter. in 2q '20, ccr generated $6.5 million in net cash from operating activities, which included a $2.8 million improvement in working capital. after accounting for $4.1 million in capital expenditures and $1.6 million in finance lease payments, we are able to modestly reduce our outstanding debt on the intercompany loan with ceix by $1 million in the second quarter. nonetheless, due to the continued reduction in the trailing 12-month ebitda, ccr finished the quarter with a net leverage ratio of 2.9 times.
now let me move on to providing some color on what we expect for the remainder of 2020. given the difficulty in forecasting the duration, severity of the covid-19 pandemic and the resulting economic slowdown and energy demand decline, our 2020 guidance remains suspended at this time. however, let me provide some qualitative guidance and comments on how the third quarter is progressing.
on the operational front, you may have noted that for much of the second quarter enlow fork was idled and the bailey mine ran sporadically. we are pleased to announce that one longwall at the enlow fork mine resumed the operation in july. also, one longwall at the bailey mine and one longwall at the harvey mine ran consistently in july. this allowed us to ship more coal in july than we shipped in may and june combined.
earlier this month, we also restarted our fourth longwall, which is the second longwall at the bailey mine. we expect august to be significantly improved compared to july, even though we have two longwall move scheduled for the month. it seems like shipments are now returning to more normalized levels, but a lot of uncertainty still exists. with covid infections still rising domestically and globally, we remained cautious and we'll continue to remain market-driven. staying focused on cost containment and managing liquidity will be our top priorities.
on our last earnings call, we laid out some targets, which call for nearly $100 million in cash savings. these targets included sg&a, cash interest and tax-related spending as well as nearly $50 million reduction in capital expenditures versus 2019 figures. we have made good progress on these fronts. and we believe we can achieve an additional $25 million reduction in capital expenditures compared to 2019 levels. as we prioritize cash preservation, we also expect a $13 million reduction in cash sg&a expense, which is above the $8 million to $10 million target we laid out last quarter.
let me now provide some additional color on our liquidity position. we ended the quarter with $346 million of liquidity. the reduction in liquidity compared to the first quarter was driven by reduced cash on the balance sheet and an $8 million reduction in availability under our securitization facility. as you can imagine, availability under our securitization facility is a function of qualifying accounts receivable outstanding, and in this case, was based on the receivables outstanding at the end of may, which was a very low shipment month. we anticipate that august will be a significantly higher shipment month compared to may. and that the availability under the securitization facility will also increase, acting as a tailwind for liquidity at the end of 3q '20.
another potential source of liquidity and cash flow for ceix and ccr could come from certain transactional opportunities. we are currently pursuing several such opportunities that could bring in significant additional cash flow and ebitda contribution during the second half of 2020. given the nature of these ongoing negotiations, we will not be able to disclose any additional information about these opportunities at this time. stay tuned.
with that, let me turn it back to jimmy to make some final comments.
jimmy a. brock -- chief executive officer and director
thank you, mitesh. before we move on to the q&a session, let me take this opportunity to layout some of our priorities for the remainder of 2020 and address our plans for navigating the uncertainty we are facing in the current economic climate. first and foremost, safety will remain our top focus and we will continue to adhere to our adjusted procedures and protocols in order to keep everyone safe and prevent any unnecessary exposure to covid-19. we will continue to focus on implementing our enhanced cleaning and disinfecting practices at our mines, both on the surface and underground. our corporate staff has proven its ability to work remotely very effectively. i continue to be impressed by our employees and their willingness to embrace these adjustments. i thank them for continuing to place safety above all else.
for 2020, our major focus of strengthening our balance sheet and bolstering our liquidity will be paramount as we navigate these uncertain times. in order to maximize our liquidity and ensure compliance with our covenants, we will take an all hands on deck approach and we will remain laser-focused on managing the things that are within our control. this involves adjusting our cost structure and operating schedules to best align them with demand and preserve margins. working closely with our customers to manage shipment and inventory levels as well as contractual obligations. maintain an operational flexibility and limiting any discretionary spending. we will continue to pull as many levers as possible to strengthen our balance sheet and preserve cash flow. also, if we begin to see sustained demand and as market conditions warrant, we expect to revert to our strategy of opportunistically taking advantage of the significant discount in the process of our debt securities. all of these things are within our control, and we believe we have the tools necessary to manage our way through this market.
finally, we have begun to see improved demand beyond 2020 and are currently 49% contracted for 2021, assuming a 26 million ton run rate and not including any potential 2020 deferrals. we are also fully contracted for 2020, but we will remain nimble and willing to work closely with our customers as we weather this storm together.
in summary, our key priorities for the remainder of 2020 are; first, to ensure the health and safety of our workforce, their families and the communities in which we operate amid the ongoing covid-19 pandemic. secondly, to safely and compliantly produce our high quality coal at the lowest possible cost. third, to continue to prioritize our liquidity through cash preservations and controlling the things that are within our control. fourth, to continue to improve our balance sheet and manage our liquidity. and finally, to work with our customers to ensure that the long-term nature of our relationships continue as we navigate this pandemic together.
one final item before we move on to the question-and-answer portion of today's call. as disclosed in our 10-q filing this morning, it is with mixed emotions that i announce that my good friend and colleague, jimmy mccaffrey is retiring. jim's contributions to the success of consol energy over the last 40 plus years have been remarkable and significant. while i'm certainly thrilled for jim and his family, i will miss his experience and wisdom.
with that, i will now turn the call over to jim for a few comments.
james j. mccaffrey -- senior vice president of coal marketing
thank you, jimmy, and good morning, everyone. after nearly 44 remarkable years with consol energy and this great industry, i have elected to retire october 1, 2020. this decision does not come lightly. i had plans to retire on two previous dates, but both times jimmy encouraged me to stay. as many of you know, back in 2015, i was diagnosed with parkinson's disease. that time, jimmy and i agreed that if my health faltered, i could move on. i am not running away from this market or this company, but i feel myself slowing down, and others see this too. so it's time. and we have a succession plan in place that allows me this opportunity.
in fact, i have great confidence in the future of consol. therefore, i feel it best to leave the marketing and sales to bob braithwaite and dan carro [phonetic] who are extremely talented and capable. i also consider this combination to be the very best in the business, along with our experienced marketing team. i still expect to spend some time around the business. and so i still hope to see my many friends in the coal community. i am fortunate that these friends include coworkers, analysts, investors and bankers, suppliers and vendors, transportation partners, our great customers, and yes, even competitors.
i want to thank jimmy and all of the women and men at consol energy for a great career and even a better life. and finally, i want to thank the american coal miner, particularly those in our pennsylvania mining complex. these men and women have been the true heroes of my life and should be celebrated as the american heroes that they truly are. god bless you all. i hope to see you further on up the road.
jimmy a. brock -- chief executive officer and director
thank you, jim, and congratulations to you and your family. we will now move to the q&a session of our call. cole, could you please provide the instruction to our callers?

operator
absolutely. [operator instructions] and our first question today will come from lucas pipes with b. riley, fbr. please go ahead.
lucas pipes -- b riley fbr -- analyst
hey, good morning, everyone. in particular, jim, i will be missing you on these conference calls and your insights throughout the year. congratulations.
james j. mccaffrey -- senior vice president of coal marketing
well, thanks.
lucas pipes -- b riley fbr -- analyst
[indecipherable] and jim, maybe kind of turning to the markets first, kind of what's your sense for the appetite? there were some comments along those lines in the prepared remarks. but when you think about sales book today and where it stands for 2021, what needs to happen to make sure that all things are put to bed? and then i have a few follow-ups there. thank you.
james j. mccaffrey -- senior vice president of coal marketing
well, first of all, as we've stated in our remarks, june was certainly better than may and july is better than june, and we anticipate that august will be better than july. the weather that we've had, the good summer weather, the slow increase in the gas price has benefited most of our customers, all of our customers. and so we're seeing a much better burn, much better capacity factors today than we saw just a few months ago. so that's encouraging
as jimmy said, in the 49% that we have sold for 2021, we don't have any carryover in that number. we're anticipating that our domestic customers are going to take all of their shipments or at least the vast lion's share. now again, there is a lot of uncertainty due to the covid situation, but that's our view today. and on the international front, we see inquiries picking up. from the time we took this company on the road, we said that we had the capability of pivoting from the export market to the domestic market and back again, better, more cost effectively and more efficiently than anybody else in the business, and that has not changed. but what changed in the second quarter was there was no place to pivot to. there was just no place to go. international markets just kind of sank. and we're starting to see those rebound now. we're seeing activity in india. we think that as the year moves on or into next year, we will see some opportunity in europe again and in southeast asia. so we're seeing that. we're fully contracted for the rest of the year, but our clarity is not perfect in terms of those international marketplaces just yet. but we think as we get into the third quarter and get to the next call, we'll be able to provide a lot more clarity than we can today. but i'm encouraged by the last several weeks and the last month in the marketplace.
lucas pipes -- b riley fbr -- analyst
i appreciate that color. and you mentioned you're fully committed for the second half. would you be able to share a number in terms of tons of coal committed? and if there is any pricing around that i would certainly appreciate that as well? but most importantly, i'm kind of looking for your committed volumes for the second half of the year. i could imagine that they are quite elevated kind of given what has been happening in the first half of the year?
james j. mccaffrey -- senior vice president of coal marketing
well, i learned a long time ago, i don't belong into prediction business, and this year is tougher to predict than ever. but setting the buyouts aside, we had 25 million tons contracted for this year, that has not changed. and we expect to get the value out of our contracts and we expect to deliver the value that our customers expect from their contracts. so that's what we're looking at, lucas.
lucas pipes -- b riley fbr -- analyst
i appreciate that. thank you. and then i have a question for mitesh and maybe the broader team as well. but on the transactional opportunities, i appreciate you don't want to kind of get too much into the deeps, but could you provide a rough zipcode in terms of dollar amount you're looking for, kind of either on a single transaction, the aggregate. any just kind of ballpark would be really helpful? thank you.
mitesh thakkar -- interim chief financial officer
lucas, like i said, like there are multiple opportunities, it's not one or two. so it's hard for me to predict. i mean, all of them could execute, some could happen in second half, some could happen in first half of next year. so it's hard to put a timeline and schedule around it. but i think it's fair to say these are meaningful opportunities and not just for lack of a better word, small amounts we are talking about here.
lucas pipes -- b riley fbr -- analyst
and then where would you put the threshold of meaningful? tens of millions? hundreds of millions?
mitesh thakkar -- interim chief financial officer
i think you could say tens of millions. and the one good thing about it, lucas, is these opportunities that are out there fit well within our strategy, doesn't really affect the core part of our business. and we believe that moving forward, it's a very high likelihood at least half of these will happen. and that's about all we can say at this point.
lucas pipes -- b riley fbr -- analyst
very helpful. i appreciate that information very much. and jim, again, congratulations. i will miss you. and to everyone, best of luck. thank you.
james j. mccaffrey -- senior vice president of coal marketing
thanks, lucas.
jimmy a. brock -- chief executive officer and director
thanks, lucas.
operator
and our next question will come from mark levin with benchmark company. please go ahead.
mark levin -- the benchmark company -- analyst
okay, great. yeah, first things first. jim, congratulations. we're going to miss you very much. i hope you enjoy retirement. and can't tell you how much i've enjoyed getting to know you over the years, and wish you all the best.
james j. mccaffrey -- senior vice president of coal marketing
that's very kind of you, mark. thanks.
mark levin -- the benchmark company -- analyst
absolutely. and i know the sales team is in good hands with bob and dan. i'm sure you've trained them very well. let me move first to a question for mitesh, if i can. mitesh, are you confident -- i know you lowered the capex guidance again, and i know there are a lot of different moving pieces. but do you feel at this point you guys will be able to generate at least breakeven organic free cash flow in the second half of the year?
mitesh thakkar -- interim chief financial officer
mark, like jim said, like there are a lot of moving parts with respect to shipments and everything else. but yes, it is possible that we are going to have free cash flow in the back half of the year. but again, everything depends on the shipments. but as we sit today and the looking glass that we have, although it's not as clear, but i think that's definitely what we are shooting for the year.
mark levin -- the benchmark company -- analyst
okay, great. and related to that point, and maybe this is for jimmy. if you're comfortable, what were you -- if you just kind of take me to the july or the august kind of production run rates, would you be comfortable may be sharing what those annualized to? i'm just trying to get a feel for -- obviously, it doesn't look like you'll hit 25 million tons this year. but just trying to figure out like what the operations are running at on an annualized basis to get a feel for kind of how far along you guys are post the trough?
jimmy a. brock -- chief executive officer and director
yeah. mark, i would say it's kind of hard even for us to annualize the numbers today, but it is encouraging, as jimmy mccaffrey stated earlier. we did restart our fourth longwall this morning. and as we move forward, if we continue to get these inquiries and we see some of the inventory levels coming down, obviously with the borrowing capacity of what has spent the last two months, we are very hopeful that we can get back to somewhat of a normal run rate in the second half of the year.
now there lot of uncertainties that are still part of that. one is our export is a big piece of our business. so what happens there with the covid-19 situation and others is a big part of it. but we are encouraged that moving forward, we will be able to get back to somewhat of a normal operations that we've had. and we certainly like to see the natural gas prices moving higher that should help even further going into 2021. but for the second half of this year, as mitesh said in his remarks, it's very hard to give a whole lot of quantitative guidance just due to all the uncertainties that are there.
mark levin -- the benchmark company -- analyst
that makes sense. maybe i'll ask a qualitative question then. obviously, natural gas prices have moved a lot higher, and if you look at kind of the calendar '21 prices, they're even higher than that and we've clearly seen a lot of that production go lower. i guess, that's the good news. on the bad side, i guess, there's still a lot of inventory still sitting on the ground, maybe record inventory. if the present dynamic were to continue, meaning gas prices where they are right now or getting better as the contracts kind of move into the future and production kind of stays where it is and if the weather is normal, i realized three major issues there. but how long do you think it would take to get the market back to some sense of supply demand balance if you had to venture a guess from what you see?
jimmy a. brock -- chief executive officer and director
my best guess at this time if i were trying to give you a straight answer, which i will, mark, is somewhere between three months to six months. i think if you look at our domestic customers that are here, they are somewhat getting back to normal faster than we anticipated, that's because of the weather and the burn, obviously. but i would think it's probably going to be three months to six months before we see those inventory numbers level out to the number that we feel comfortable forecasting going forward.
mark levin -- the benchmark company -- analyst
yeah, that's great help. and then last and final question for mitesh just so i think i heard it correctly, but i just want to make sure. did you mentioned in your remarks, mitesh, sg&a going forward kind of at the $8 million to $10 million level? did i hear that right?
mitesh thakkar -- interim chief financial officer
no. i think what i suggested -- well, actually, that was a remark i made in comparison to last year that earlier we forecasted $8 million to $10 million decline, now we are forecasting $13 million decline. so on a quasi basis, i think, mark, you are still in the zipcode, but it's in a different way than i positioned.
mark levin -- the benchmark company -- analyst
got it. i got it. perfect. great. thank you for the clarification. and absolute best of luck, particularly, jim.
james j. mccaffrey -- senior vice president of coal marketing
thanks, mark.
jimmy a. brock -- chief executive officer and director
thanks, mark.
operator
and our next question will come from matthew fields with bank of america. please go ahead.
matthew fields -- bank of america -- analyst
hey everyone, and best of luck in retirement, jim.
james j. mccaffrey -- senior vice president of coal marketing
thank you, matt.
matthew fields -- bank of america -- analyst
i wanted to ask about bonding requirements, first of all. some of your peers have sort of mentioned discussions with insurance companies heading into the third quarter, requiring some increased collateralization. have you had similar discussions about that into august?
mitesh thakkar -- interim chief financial officer
are you talking -- you are talking about surety bonds, right?
matthew fields -- bank of america -- analyst
yeah.
mitesh thakkar -- interim chief financial officer
yeah. so i think you might have noticed, for the quarter, we did not see any increase in the bonding requirements. i mean, we did have calls with a lot of our surety providers even while we were going through the amendment of the credit facility and stuff like that. generally, everybody is comfortable. we are not seeing any significant increase there. you have somewhere -- you could see for different reasons somebody needing more collateral, somebody giving up some collateral. so we are seeing some natural churn, but not any significant increase.
matthew fields -- bank of america -- analyst
okay. thanks for that. that's helpful. and then on the transactional opportunities, it sounds like you're saying sort of a lot in the tens of millions. nothing like any kind of major sale leasebacks of your interest [speech overlap] like cmt or something like that?
mitesh thakkar -- interim chief financial officer
no. these are more like asset sales right of ways. we own a lot of land. there are some land transactional opportunities, those kind of stuff.
matthew fields -- bank of america -- analyst
okay. is a sale or a sale leaseback of consol marine terminal, at least on the discussion block, is that you're producing $40 million ebitda, at least now. obviously, we'll see what the future holds, but that's a pretty valuable asset that could use -- reduce a lot of [speech overlap].
mitesh thakkar -- interim chief financial officer
so it is not part of the opportunities that we were talking about. but we are a public company and we are open for business, like we look at everything possible. and if there is an opportunity there, we'll definitely consider it.
jimmy a. brock -- chief executive officer and director
yeah. and i'll add to that. it's a business strategy move. we've had several inquiries about the baltimore terminal that we have evaluated over time. but keep in mind, that's also a critical piece of our business as well. so it would have to be something very attractive for both of us and we still would have to have a way to use that terminal in our business going forward.
matthew fields -- bank of america -- analyst
okay. that's fair. and then lastly, just a follow-up on the new credit agreement. just i want to make sure i'm reading it right. it seems like you don't have any more capacity this year for second-lien repurchases, but you refreshed $25 million on january 1, '21. is that the right way to think about it, because you're not under two times net leverage?
mitesh thakkar -- interim chief financial officer
i think the $25 million refers to -- the way it was structured is, we had a share repurchase bucket of $25 million, which is annual. we have not used any of that this year. and what we did is we created an ability to buy back our second-lien through that share repurchase bucket. the share repurchase is subject to leverage test, but the second-lien is not. so we can do second-lien buyback through that bucket.
matthew fields -- bank of america -- analyst
okay, all right. and that's a one-time as opposed to the 25 annual bucket?
mitesh thakkar -- interim chief financial officer
no, it's an annual bucket. it's an annual bucket. so it refreshes every year.
matthew fields -- bank of america -- analyst
got it. all right, that's what i thought. okay. thanks very much, and good luck in the back half year.
mitesh thakkar -- interim chief financial officer
thank you, matthew.
jimmy a. brock -- chief executive officer and director
thanks, matthew.
operator
[operator instructions] and our next question will come from nick jarmoszuk with stifel. please go ahead.
nick jarmoszuk -- stifel -- analyst
hi. thanks for taking the questions. the first one with the 2021 contract book. directionally, can you give us a sense for whether pricing was up or down or flat on a like-for-like basis?
james j. mccaffrey -- senior vice president of coal marketing
you know we're in the middle of several negotiations. so from a competitive point of view, i don't really want to discuss price, but i will say this, if you look at the published markets, coal desk and evolution primarily, the tons we've booked are better than the published markets have advertised.
nick jarmoszuk -- stifel -- analyst
okay, all right. and then for 2021 capex, how can we think about that relative to the 2020 spend?
mitesh thakkar -- interim chief financial officer
obviously, we don't have a 2021 guidance out there for capex, but it is depending on how the market conditions play out. i think we are going to be market-driven, like we obviously deferred a lot of the capex, particularly on the growth side this year. and if the market turns out to be one where we are able to go back and do some growth capex here, that will probably move the needle. i think on the maintenance side, this year we are demonstrating our ability to run at a very low level of maintenance capex. we have done that in the past. and again, nick, we will have to see how balance of 2020 plays out to give you a better color. but we can continue to run on the maintenance capex if we need to.
jimmy a. brock -- chief executive officer and director
and one thing i will add -- that i'll add to that, nick, is we said many times before that we are well capitalized in the pennsylvania mining complex. we are -- and that we would -- our capital spend would be tied to the demand and how we run, operate the coal mines. that has certainly been the case as the volume pulls back, even in years past, you've seen us adjust our capital spend to come back. and the one benefit i'll say that you get from that moving forward is we learn from every one of these exercises. so we like to think that our capital stays around $4 a ton moving forward. and the team has done a really good job of balancing them, we think we can do it moving forward.
nick jarmoszuk -- stifel -- analyst
yeah. and then final question just on the xcoal contracts and the discussions there. is there any update you can provide?
james j. mccaffrey -- senior vice president of coal marketing
well, let me say this. we have booked some tons for the second half both with xcoal and with some third-party players. all those tons have been booked on a spot basis, but by no means, we're willing to give up on the xcoal contract for this year or in the future. so we expect to get our value out of the contract that xcoal expects to deliver it. and we should have more clarity about that as we get into the next quarter.
nick jarmoszuk -- stifel -- analyst
yeah.
jimmy a. brock -- chief executive officer and director
nick, was your question more on 2021?
nick jarmoszuk -- stifel -- analyst
well, you've got the volume contract with xcoal and then the terminal contract as well. so that's what i was asking about.
jimmy a. brock -- chief executive officer and director
like are you asking about renewable -- renewal or are you asking about the existing contract?
nick jarmoszuk -- stifel -- analyst
renewal.
jimmy a. brock -- chief executive officer and director
okay.
james j. mccaffrey -- senior vice president of coal marketing
as far as renewal, both those discussions have kind of meshed together, nick. but we will be continuing to talk to xcoal. one thing we will be paying attention to is if we want to keep the same concentration level that we've had in the past. so again, stay tuned.
nick jarmoszuk -- stifel -- analyst
okay. thank you.
operator
and our next question will come from michael dudas with vertical research. please go ahead.
michael dudas -- vertical research -- analyst
good morning, everybody, and jim, godspeed.
james j. mccaffrey -- senior vice president of coal marketing
thank you, mike.
michael dudas -- vertical research -- analyst
for jimmy or jim, could you just maybe update us on as your customer base for your coal, your thoughts, trends what you're hearing about, plant closures, load factors looking in maybe two years, three years out, do you still have a pretty secure visibility on your ability to serve those types of customers? and are some of those customers looking at what's going on from the supplier sector of the side, certainly wanting you -- after we get through this uncertainty in demand, wanting to get more aggressive with partnering with you as we get out the other side of this?
jimmy a. brock -- chief executive officer and director
well, i would say to start, we are certainly concerned with the closure of power plants, particularly the ones have been accelerate. but when you go back to our original strategy that we want to serve these core must-run power plants, we still feel very good about the relationship with those customers, we've been able to ship to them. and we believe that if we can have a normal summer followed by normal winter, maybe even followed by normal summer after that and we can get these gas prices back up to acceptable levels then we think we're going to remain a part of that energy mix. and we feel pretty good about where we are there with these customers. but with that said, it's one thing -- that's why the export market is very important to us as well. but we continue to believe that we're going to be able to provide a low cost steel and be a part of the energy mix going forward.
james j. mccaffrey -- senior vice president of coal marketing
let me just add on to that briefly, mike. we announced this morning that we booked 4.3 million tons in the second quarter for 2021 and those 4.3 million tons extended from '20 to '24. so obviously, we have booked some term business there. we're deeply in conversations with a couple of other key customers about term business. there is a lot of uncertainty in the marketplace, but i'm relatively optimistic that we will find a way to get those done and they will be beneficial to both us and the customer.
michael dudas -- vertical research -- analyst
i appreciate that. just my follow-up would be, your updated thoughts on itmann, pace of where you are obviously with the slowing down opportunity from a spending side. the market that you see any visibility, i mean, we're all looking for visibility, but as you think about the plans on itmann, is it 12 months delayed? is it a market-driven delayed? just how that's going to fit in as we kind of emerge through this?
jimmy a. brock -- chief executive officer and director
well, itmann is a project that you know we're really excited about. it's going to be the best quality around when it comes to lowball metallurgical coal. however, we do have a capital allocation process, and we have followed that. so the highest rate of return on our investment right now is probably our debt securities. so we have deferred or literally stopped most of the spending on the itmann project. now we are continuing with a very, very low cost exploratory mine. and as i called it before, it's very low volume tons, one crew, one shift a day that's working there now. but we will not be spending a lot of money on itmann moving forward until we have a better idea of where the market is and timing of what we need to continue that project.
mitesh thakkar -- interim chief financial officer
and just so you know, it's not really a question around itmann's economics, it's more of a capital allocation question for us. i think it's a great project. it's just where your cash gets the most bang for its buck.
michael dudas -- vertical research -- analyst
yeah, i just wanted to get that confirmation. gentlemen, thanks so much, and best of luck, jim.
james j. mccaffrey -- senior vice president of coal marketing
thanks, mike. i appreciate it.

2020-Q3,CCR,2020-11-07 20:00:00,"prepared remarks:
operator
good day and welcome to the ceix and ccr third quarter 2020 earnings conference call. [operator instructions] please note this event is being recorded. i would like now to turn the conference over to nathan tucker, director of finance and investor relations. please go ahead.
nathan tucker -- director, finance and investor relations
thank you, matt, and good morning, everyone. welcome to consol energy and consol coal resources third quarter 2020 earnings conference call. any forward-looking statements or comments we make about future expectations are subject to some risks, which we've outlined in our press releases and in our sec filings and are considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934. we do not undertake any obligations of updating any forward-looking statements for future events or otherwise.
we will also be discussing certain non-gaap financial measures, which are defined and reconciled to comparable gaap financial measures in our press releases and furnished to the sec on form 8-k. you can also find additional information regarding the companies on our websites www.consolenergy.com and www.ccrlp.com. we also posted a supplemental slide deck to both of our websites prior to this call, which we may reference this morning.
on the call with me today are jimmy brock, our chief executive officer; mitesh thakkar, our chief financial officer; dan connell, our senior vice president of strategy; and bob braithwaite, our vice president of marketing and sales. in his prepared remarks, jimmy will provide a recap of our third quarter 2020 performance and specific insights on marketing and operations. mitesh will then discuss our liability management program and details of our recently completed transactions, financial results and preliminary expectations for 2021. after the prepared remarks, there will be a q&a session in which dan and bob will be available to participate as well.
with that, let me turn it over to our ceo, jimmy brock.
jimmy a. brock -- chief executive officer and director
thank you, nate, and good morning, everyone. before i jump into the operational and marketing details, let me provide a brief high level recap of the third quarter. we achieved several important milestones during the quarter. on the safety front, we delivered a very strong performance as our enlow fork mine, bailey preparation plant, consol marine terminal and itmann project, each had zero recordable incidents. additionally, our total recordable incident rate improved significantly by 60% in q3 of '20 versus q3 of '19 and continued to remain well below the national average for our industry. managing risk from covid-19 remains a priority at our operations. we continue to execute our enhanced sanitization, social distancing and several other precautionary measures at our operations.
the entire consol team takes these measures very seriously and places safety at the forefront of everything we do. on the operations and marketing fronts. after facing significant headwinds from the reduced customer demand in the second quarter, we experienced a steady pickup in demand in q3 of '20, driven by higher natural gas prices and hot summer weather. as such, we ran four of our five longwalls for most of the quarter after ramping up our fourth wall in early august. we saw steady improvement in the demand for our coal throughout the third quarter compared to the second quarter. we expect to see further improvements in the fourth quarter as forward gas prices remained healthy and most countries across the globe are reopening and many of our customers saw their stockpile levels reduced by the relatively strong summer burn.
on the financial front, we continue to remain laser-focused on deleveraging our balance sheet and improving our liquidity. to achieve that, we completed multiple transactions during the quarter that not only boost income in the second half of '20 but also improve our liquidity and financial flexibility. we also recently announced our transaction to simplify our corporate structure by merging ccr into consol energy and have one public company moving forward. as mitesh will discuss, we believe having one public company will also improve our credit metrics. our finance and operations teams continue to focus on reducing discretionary spending as they manage through the pandemic related downturn. now, let me review our third quarter operational performance. coal production at the pennsylvania mining complex came in at 4.5 million tons in q3 of '20 compared to 6.5 million tons in the year ago quarter.
the decline was due to a reduction in customer demand compared to the prior year period, as we continue to deal with the lingering effects of the covid-19 pandemic. however, it is worth noting that our production in q3 of '20 was nearly double what we produced and sold in q2 of '20. demand has steadily increased since the end of the second quarter and as i mentioned earlier this allowed us to restart our fourth longwall in early august. for its share of the pennsylvania mining complex, ccr produced 1.1 million tons of coal during q3 of '20 compared to 1.6 million tons in the year ago quarter. on the cost front, our average cash cost of coal sold per ton was $28.64 in q3 of '20 compared to $32.78 in q3 of '19 as our operations team was successful in keeping tight control over cash expenditures in the quarter.
this performance is particularly noteworthy when you consider that we had three longwall moves in august and september, which typically increased cost. the adjustments we made to our operations allowed us to reduce our overall average cash cost of coal sold per ton on our producing assets and to partially mitigate the financial impact of the reduced production volume. the improvement was primarily driven by lower mine maintenance and supply costs, contractors and purchase service cost and project expenses. compared to the second quarter, our mine [indecipherable] cash cost declined to $4 million from $32 million as all three mines were in production in the second half of the third quarter. the consol marine terminal had a throughput volume of 2 million tons during the quarter compared to 2.4 million tons in the year ago period.
despite a decline in shipments, our terminal revenues for the quarter were actually improved at $17 million compared to $16.3 million in the year ago quarter. additionally, cash operating costs were improved at $4.8 million versus $6.3 million in the year ago period as the terminal employees continued to successfully limit their cash expenditures in q3 of '20. i will now provide an overview of coal markets and an update on our sales performance and accomplishments. from a market perspective, demand trends turned positive in the third quarter of 2020. after a difficult start to the year with mild winter weather, low natural gas prices and an extremely challenging second quarter with widespread economic shutdowns due to the covid-19 pandemic, overall demand for our products improved in the third quarter from its low point in may.
hot summer weather and higher natural gas prices put coal in the money for many of our customers and we were able to ramp up a fourth longwall in the quarter. according to the eia, coal share and generation fleet improved to 23% in august from 15% at its low in april, even with the overall electricity generation increasing by 45%. this means that not only did the overall pie expand but coal took a bigger slice of the pie. on the power price front average pjm west day-ahead power prices were 13% lower in q3 of '20 compared to q3 of '19. however, on a positive note, the year-over-year decline was far less in the third quarter than it was in q2 of '20, which was down roughly 28% compared to q2 of '19. henry hub natural gas spot prices followed a similar trend averaging $2 per million btu during the quarter or a 16% decline compared to q3 of '19, which was improved from the 34% year-over-year decrease seen in the second quarter of 2020.
natural gas prices started a significant upward trend in august, which has continued this fall. we saw multiple days at the end of october in which henry hub spot prices averaged over $3 per million btu. you have to go all the way back to march of 2019 to find spot prices above the $3 mark. while these are just a few data points, the recent trend is very encouraging. these higher natural gas prices have led to overall demand improvement and resulted in an increase in coal burn in the u.s., which also led to decreased coal inventories for most of our customers. on the domestic front, we continue to follow the coal and natural gas market trends very closely. first, low natural gas and crude oil prices earlier this year, led to reduce capital expenditures and activities for e&p companies. as a result, the number of active u.s. gas rigs continue to trend downward.
ihs markit reports that active u.s. gas rig count stood at 74 as of october 2, a reduction of 70 rigs versus the same time period in 2019. this is leading to forecast of $3 plus natural gas prices for the entire calendar 2021 strip, which in turn is leading the eia to project a 21% increase in domestic coal burn in 2021, nearly reversing the decline we've seen from 2019 to 2020. this improved coal burn is expected to help drive demand for 100 million tons of additional u.s. coal production in 2021. we expect these factors will continue to improve coal's competitiveness as we close out 2020 and head into 2021 and will be an advantage as we work to lock in future volumes. we firmly believe the lack of investment across the coal space will limit the coal industry's ability to quickly ramp back up to meet this demand.
this could be a very advantageous situation for us as we've prioritized keeping our minds well capitalized in strong markets, which gives us the ability to scale up. on the export front, seaborne thermal coal markets were slower to recover than the domestic market due to the reduced global lng prices and the continued impacts of the covid-19 pandemic. however, we are seeing positive trends here as well. we are seeing that pickup in inquiries and activity in india as its economy begins to recover from the covid-19 related shutdowns. while api2 prompt month prices were down 12% in the third quarter of 2020 compared to the year-ago period they had nevertheless increased by nearly 50% as of early october compared to the year-to-date trough marked in late may and are at their highest levels since october of 2019.
due to supply constraints, we are seeing pet coke prices from the u.s. gulf increase by over 30% during the quarter, which is pushing buyers specifically our cement plants across the globe to look at alternative fuels. additionally lng prices into japan and korea are currently at an 11-month high, as of mid october of 2020. from a marketing perspective, it is encouraging to see that demand for our coal has fairly improved since reaching its low point in may. we continue to maintain 100% of our existing customer base and continue to see improvement from a contracting perspective beyond 2020. as of september 30, we are 13.2 million tons contracted in 2021. however, we are in the middle of domestic rfp season and we expect to secure meaningful volumes in the coming months.
with that, i will now turn the call over to mitesh to provide the financial update.
mitesh thakkar -- chief financial officer
thank you, jimmy, and good morning everyone. let me start by providing an update on our liability management program and color on our recently completed transactional opportunities. i will then review our 3q '20 financial results and outlook for 4q and 2021. our financial priorities for 2020 have been to maintain strong liquidity, reducing outstanding debt and improve the risk profile of our balance sheet in order to create long-term value for our shareholders. it starts with maintaining full access to our revolving credit facility, while we execute our other strategic and financial objectives. management has initiated several actions this year aimed at ensuring the success of this strategy, despite a significant reduction in coal demand brought on by the covid-19 pandemic.
first, throughout the year, we have reduced discretionary spending. this included reducing pmc capex up to 50% compared to 2019 levels and deferring the majority of our growth capex at the itmann metallurgical coal mine and allocating those dollars to debt reduction. we initiated cost reduction efforts and realigned our operations to better match output with demand. second, in the second quarter of 2020, we suspended ccr's cash distribution to all unit holders, which resulted in annual cash conservation of approximately $22 million at ceix level and approximately $58 million at ccr level. third, we moved early to amend our credit agreement, which provided us with eight quarters of covenant relaxation, while also providing continued access to our $400 million revolving credit facility.
we also added additional flexibility to repurchase our outstanding second-lien notes without a leverage test. fourth, we have been strategic in our approach to buying back our second-lien debt and capturing the arbitrage as the notes have traded well below par. after suspending the program in 2q '20 to conserve liquidity, we bought back $2 million of our second-lien notes in the third quarter. year-to-date, we have deployed $26 million of capital to retire approximately $45 million face amount of our second-lien notes at a significant discount to par value, which reduced our leverage and reduced annual interest expense by $5 million. we continue to deploy additional capital toward our second-lien debt buyback in the month of october as well. in the second half of 2020, we completed multiple transactions that boosted liquidity and improved financial flexibility.
in aggregate, ceix and ccr expect to record $60 million to $70 million and $9 million to $10 million respectively in miscellaneous income and gain on sale of assets in the second half of 2020. to that extent, in the third quarter of 2020, ceix recorded $26 million in income and gains related to these items and expects to record an additional $34 million to $44 million in the fourth quarter of 2020. ccr expects to record its $9 million to $10 million portion in fourth quarter of 2020. from a cash flow perspective, ceix received approximately $9 million in cash in 3q '20 and anticipates receiving approximately $15 million to $20 million in cash during 4q '20 and $20 million to $25 million in cash during 2q '21. the remainder is expected to be collected in the second half of '21 and beyond. for its share, ccr anticipates receiving approximately $4 million in cash during 4q '20 and approximately $6 million in cash during 2q '21.
finally, ceix recently signed a merger agreement with ccr to acquire all outstanding common units of ccr that ceix does not already own in an all-stock transaction. this is an extremely important transaction for both entities for a multitude of reasons. as jimmy mentioned, it simplifies our corporate structure, which streamlines financial reporting and creates additional transparency for our investors and analysts. on the financial side, we expect to see an immediate improvement in our credit metrics, enhanced access to capital and long-term benefits for our equity holders. pro forma for this transaction, ceix's third quarter 2020 bank ebitda will improve by approximately $46 million, resulting in 0.6 turn improvement in our net leverage ratio. more importantly, we expect this deal to accelerate our ability to initiate capital returns under our covenants, which are currently restricted given the leverage ratio test of 2.0 times.
we also expect this transaction to generate approximately $3 million in annual synergies. to summarize, we believe this deal unlocks significant value for all our stakeholders through improved financial flexibility and transparency. despite an extremely challenging year from a demand perspective in the midst of an ongoing pandemic, i'm extremely proud of the accomplishments of our team as they continue to identify ways to improve our financial flexibility and liquidity. we believe that these actions have put us in a much stronger position to take advantage of the potential market recovery in 2021 as indicated by the current gas forwards. with that, let me now recap our third quarter results. we will review ceix first, then ccr. ceix reported third quarter 2020 attributable net loss of $7.2 million or $0.28 per diluted share compared to net income of $4.3 million or $0.16 per diluted share in 3q '19.
on a positive note, ceix reported 3q '20 adjusted ebitda of $68.3 million and organic free cash flow of minus $3.8 million, which marks a significant improvement from 2q '20 levels as our operations began to recover from the pandemic-driven demand decline. more importantly, ceix generated approximately $4.3 million of free cash flow in 3q '20 if you consider cash received from asset sales. it is worth noting that on average our mines only ran at approximately 63% capacity utilization during the third quarter. this highlights the cash generation capability of our assets when they run at 95-plus-percent capacity utilization, as they have done in the last two years. we ended the third quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $22 million, a modest reduction from $33 million at the end of second quarter.
of the $11 million reduction in cash, we used approximately $15 million toward debt repayment. at the end of 3q '20, we were in full compliance with our credit covenants and maintained full access to our $400 million revolving credit facility with no borrowings outstanding. now, let me update you on ccr. this morning, ccr reported a net loss of $5.5 million, adjusted ebitda of $9.4 million and distributable cash flow of negative $1.6 million for third quarter. this compares to net income of $7 million, adjusted ebitda of $20 million and distributable cash flow of $9.2 million in the year ago quarter. in 3q '20, ccr generated $10.8 million in net cash from operating activities, which included a $4 million improvement in working capital. after accounting for $3.9 million in capital expenditure and $1.6 million in finance lease payments, we were able to reduce our outstanding debt on the intercompany loan with ceix by $4.9 million in the third quarter.
nonetheless, due to the continued reduction in the trailing 12-month ebitda, ccr finished the quarter with a net leverage ratio of 3.4 times. now, let me provide some preliminary color on what we expect heading into 2021. on the operational front, we expect production to improve significantly in fourth quarter of '20 compared to third quarter '20, absent any more covid-related shutdowns. shipments have been returning to more normal levels despite the uncertainty that still exists. we have seen an improvement in inquiries in the domestic market on the back of rising natural gas prices and we secured 500,000 tons during the third quarter for delivery in fourth quarter 2020 as inventory levels at most of our customer plants are at or below normal levels for this time of the year.
exports demand is improving as well, specifically into india where the economy is reopening. staying focused on cost containment and managing liquidity while opportunistically taking advantage of the arbitrage and the price of our publicly traded debt will be our top priorities. as we look into 2021, we currently expect a rebound in coal burn and demand for coal. jimmy walked through the main drivers, but let me reiterate that the tightness in the supply of natural gas is driving up pricing in the spot market and forward strip. this should improve the competitiveness of our product and we have seen a willingness from utilities to engage in discussions for long-term contracts.
we will continue to focus on the things we can control and ensure we are ready to fully capitalize on any additional improvements in the marketplace. we currently have a 2021 contracted position of 13.2 million tons at an expected price of approximately $43 per ton, assuming an average power price in pjm west of $29.83 per megawatt hour, consistent with the current forward strip. from a balance sheet leverage perspective, we expect third quarter 2020 to mark the peak leverage and expect further improvement in coming quarters.
with that, let me turn it back to jimmy to make some final comments.
jimmy a. brock -- chief executive officer and director
thank you, mitesh. before we move on to the q&a session, let me take this opportunity to provide an update on some of our other business development initiatives that we have been working on and a recap of our accomplishments year-to-date. we continue to progress with development mining at our itmann mine project where we are operating a single section one-shift-per-day at minimal cost. and we continue to be encouraged by what we see in terms of coal quality and same conditions. we maintain the capability to ramp up this project, consistent with our capital allocation process when market conditions warrant, providing a solid pathway for organic growth and diversification.
we also are seeing meaningful progress on our technology-driven growth initiatives. omnis is well under way with construction of its first commercial module in our bailey preparation plant, which will convert a portion of our thickener underflow waste stream into salable carbon and mineral matter products. that first module is on track to be operational next year. we've seen positive r&d breakthroughs in the coal-to-products work that we are doing with cfoam, ohio university and engineered profiles as well. and last but not least, we received news in late october that the u.s. department of energy has selected our coal first project to proceed into the next phase of development. this project is evaluating the possibility of constructing an advanced coal-based power plant of the future in the vicinity of our pennsylvania mining complex.
the plant would be designed to utilize highly efficient pressurized fluidized bed combustion technology to fire waste coal from our mining operations and would be equipped with biomass coal firing and carbon dioxide capture and storage to achieve net neutral or negative carbon dioxide emissions. under the newly selected project, we'll be working on a detailed front-end engineering and design study during the next 2.5 years with approximately 80% of the funding provided by the doe with a go-no-go decision point after that.
we are still obviously in early stages of this endeavor, but we believe it provides an exciting opportunity for us to help define the future of our industry. i am extremely proud of the resolve of our entire team. from the onset of this pandemic, we decided we weren't going to sit back and simply react. we focused on taking tangible steps to position ourselves to benefit from the eventual recovery.
while each step was important, our most recent accomplishment is the one i'm most excited about, which is our announced merger agreement with ccr. we believe this merger will set us up for success in the future as we navigate the continued uncertainty in the market and head into what is shaping up to be an improved 2021. this merger creates one entity that is stronger and more flexible than the two separate entities we have today. we believe this transaction is beneficial to all stakeholders of ceix and ccr. this agreement simplifies consol's corporate structure and is expected to increase ceix public float and trading liquidity as well as enhance its access to capital markets.
all of these of crucial for success, given the headwinds our sector faces. we believe the completion of this transaction couldn't have come at a better time and this consolidated company can take full advantage of a potential market recovery heading into 2021. we truly believe that we are stronger together than we are apart and this is the right thing to do for both entities. we expect that we will receive the required approvals needed from both ceix stockholders and ccr unit holders.
lastly, let me provide a brief update on our negotiations during the murray bankruptcy. as we have stated before, we cannot comment on ongoing litigation, but we can provide an update that we have entered into a settlement with the murray debtors. this settlement addressed all open matters between consol and murray in the bankruptcy along with assuring murray's cooperation is consistent with historical practices with respect to each party's payment obligations related to workers' compensation and black lung claims. the settlement provides value to consol through the sale and transfer of certain other assets between the parties. we refer you to our 10-q for the impact of such settlement on our financial statements. with that, i will hand the call back over to nate for further instructions.
nathan tucker -- director, finance and investor relations
thank you, jimmy. we can now move to the q&a session of our call. matt, can you provide the instruction to our callers please.

operator
[operator instructions] our first question comes from mark levin with the benchmark company. please go ahead.
mark levin -- the benchmark company -- analyst
great, thanks very much. appreciate you taking my questions. the first one is more of a modeling one and then i'll go big picture, but when you look at the fourth quarter versus the third quarter, maybe you can comment on longwall move, how you think production will look relative on a sequential basis, cost etc. just kind of thinking about what 4q looks v 3q.
jimmy a. brock -- chief executive officer and director
okay, mark, q4 as we said earlier in our statement here, we think q4 is going to be significantly better than q3 we are running all four longwalls now and we do not have any longwall moves in q4. we are well prepared to ramp up if we need to and as we've always said, we run to market conditions. as far as the cost goes, we don't have longwall moves. we think that q4, our goal is to stay sub-30 of cash costs and we think we could even see some improvements in that here in q4.
mark levin -- the benchmark company -- analyst
that's very, very good news. let me, let me shift a little bit to murray and i know there is some discussion of it in the q, but maybe you can and i know you don't want to get into too many specifics and you may be -- you may not be able to even if you want to, but maybe you can just provide at least a little bit of color as to how to think about the financial impact to consol specifically in 2021 and beyond.
jimmy a. brock -- chief executive officer and director
yeah, i can't disclose, mark, the individual settlements, but you can look in our q and you can kind of do the math and come out close to answering your own question there.
mark levin -- the benchmark company -- analyst
okay, fair enough. let me switch a little bit to aros and surety bond providers and that fund discussion. that is an issue, obviously it's been coming up a lot more as it relates to us coal companies, maybe you could provide some background in terms of how you guys are positioned vis-a-vis surety bond -- third-party surety bond providers and some guideposts in terms of how to think about what a worst-case scenario might look like if cash collateral calls started to come through the door?
mitesh thakkar -- chief financial officer
yeah, mark. i'll take that. this is the mitesh here. so, as you know, the surety and insurance markets have been increasingly challenging and particularly for coal companies, we have heard it with other companies as well. during the third quarter, we issued about $17 million of letters of credit to our surety providers. we keep an open and transparent dialog with our surety providers and have been successful in minimizing large impacts on our overall liquidity.
i think the key to providing comfort for our surety providers is to make sure that we are doing necessary work that needs to be done and making sure they understand that we have access to liquidity. the business has started to turn around as you can see from our numbers and we anticipate that that's going to help us in these conversations as well. we anticipate some more letters of credits here in the fourth quarter around the same number that we had in the third quarter and it's an active process. we continue to have an active dialog here with our surety providers.
mark levin -- the benchmark company -- analyst
and my final question has to do with liquidity. so against that backdrop, mitesh and jimmy, what is the appropriate amount of liquidity that you think it makes sense for you guys to have in this kind of in this kind of environment. i mean how do you or how will you manage sort of what that minimum liquidity number is versus maybe going into the open market and buying back second lien?
mitesh thakkar -- chief financial officer
so i think the answer is different depending on where you are on the market cycle, right. like when your mines are not running like what we had in the second quarter you noticed that we suspended our buyback program completely. that's when you are actually conserving liquidity. our mines generate a consistent free cash flow when they are running. so i think that gives us a lot of comfort but you always have to plan for it. i feel comfortable in terms of the access that we have to our revolving credit facility.
we don't anticipate borrowing on our revolving credit facility on a consistent basis to run our operation. that is that as a source of liquidity for us and that has been our game plan since day one. to the extent as things have started to improve, i think i mentioned on my last call or the one before that going back into the market to buy back our second lien will be not only contingent on how much cash we have on hand, but also on how the market has been unfolding. so to the extent that jimmy said on the call earlier that fourth quarter is looking really strong and we have a very good indication for 2021.
i think that gives us a lot of comfort to start going back into the market and buy our second lien, but you would notice that just like in the past, we are going to be market-driven, we are going to make sure that we stay in compliance with our covenants and we are going to make sure that we have adequate liquidity that we need. so we are going to be very -- we are not going to buy a lot of debt at one time and we are going to do a piecemeal on a monthly, weekly basis rather than doing a large tender offer or something like that.
mark levin -- the benchmark company -- analyst
that's perfect. thanks guys, i appreciate the time.
mitesh thakkar -- chief financial officer
thanks, mark.
operator
our next question comes from matthew fields with bank of america. please go ahead.
matthew fields -- bank of america -- analyst
hey, everyone. few things for me. first of all, i appreciate the color mitesh on the sort of cash proceeds from these asset sales and the schedule. i just want to go over that because you went over it kind of fast. $9 million in 3q, you say you expect $15 million to $20 million in 4q, $20 million to $25 million was it 2q '21 and then the rest beyond that?
mitesh thakkar -- chief financial officer
yeah, q2 '21 and the rest is beyond that.
matthew fields -- bank of america -- analyst
okay, so that's $15 million to $25 million in like the second half of '21.
mitesh thakkar -- chief financial officer
not second half of '21, it could be beyond that as well and the actual proceeds might be higher, matt, than that $15 million to $20 million that is leftover per your calculation because we discount that value back when we are booking income.
matthew fields -- bank of america -- analyst
okay and then do you have a timetable for that other -- that last piece?
mitesh thakkar -- chief financial officer
i would say starting second half of 2021, it's not material in any given period. so it's going to be spread out a little bit over years.
matthew fields -- bank of america -- analyst
okay, great. thank you. and then i think, mark asked about lcs and you said you're -- it's tough to answer because it's a constant negotiation, but you increased lcs i think $11 million in the quarter held against that revolver. have you had to increase lcs in the fourth --
mitesh thakkar -- chief financial officer
yeah, sorry, go ahead.
matthew fields -- bank of america -- analyst
yeah, i think in $17 million between the revolver and the ar facility.
mitesh thakkar -- chief financial officer
correct.
matthew fields -- bank of america -- analyst
have you had to increase lcs post anymore collateral in october?
mitesh thakkar -- chief financial officer
i said we are expecting around the same number of increase in the fourth quarter as well.
matthew fields -- bank of america -- analyst
okay. so another $17 million of collateral post that [phonetic].
mitesh thakkar -- chief financial officer
and what gives me a little bit more comfort is we have had dialog with most of our surety. so i feel good about where we are and like i said, you know when the business starts doing well and the results start pouring in, i think it gives our surety companies a lot more comfort too that the company has started generating cash.
matthew fields -- bank of america -- analyst
and then you think do you have any line of sight on when you perhaps might get to release some of that collateral?
mitesh thakkar -- chief financial officer
a couple of things we are working on, but too soon to announce anything right now, but we are working on a few things. also remember, we do have access capacity on some of our surety providers. so if we need to move things things around, we can move things around.
matthew fields -- bank of america -- analyst
okay, that's helpful. and then i think you may just mentioned this in passing, but did you buy back more second lien bonds in october?
mitesh thakkar -- chief financial officer
we did i'd say -- i don't have the exact number in front of me, but should be in the high single-digit million dollars.
matthew fields -- bank of america -- analyst
okay and that roughly the market price?
mitesh thakkar -- chief financial officer
well, yeah, whenever we bought -- we bought it in open market. so whatever the price was then, but i did notice that our second lien debt has traded up over last month or so. so the blended average could be lower than what the current market price is.
matthew fields -- bank of america -- analyst
okay and then i know you sort of are more comfortable buying back bonds when you're mines are kind of more operating fulsomely like they might be in the fourth quarter. ultimately, like what's the, you have plenty of liquidity, what's the gating factor on buying back more second liens. is it the liquidity of the bond issue itself, you don't want to raise the price 5 points by going in for $10 million or what's kind of the gating factor there to buying more?
mitesh thakkar -- chief financial officer
so, liquidity is definitely a concern, but also remember like what i said before that i don't want to do significant deployment of capital at this time. mines are running great. we have a good visibility how fourth quarter looks like and potentially beyond that too, but i can't forget the fact that we just had a record covid cases in us a couple of days ago. like, you have to keep these things in mind and be cognizant of how things are playing out around the world. i hope it doesn't happen, but things could shut down again and you don't want to be in a situation that you deployed all your bullets at one go.
matthew fields -- bank of america -- analyst
that's a fair point. and then lastly from me, of the 13.2 million tons contracted for '21, are any of those in the export market?
robert braithwaite -- vice president marketing and sales
hi matt, this is bob. we have very little contract in the export market next year at this time. we did mention we do have some carryover volume that we're working with customers. the majority of that carryover volume is the volume that we currently have under contract with our partner -- export partner xcoal. we continually work with them. in the first quarter, jim mccaffrey mentioned that we were on pace for our 10 million ton goal, 10 million tons of exports this year and then we had to shut down across the globe.
so that has been -- we have seen some pick up here in the third quarter and into the fourth and we're working with xcoal to ensure that those volumes move, but i will tell you in that 13.2 million, zero tons of those -- i shouldn't say -- i should say zero of those xcoal carryover tons are in that number. so you know we're starting to get a little bit more clear picture here going forward on the export market and we'll continue to work with xcoal to get those volumes shipped that we have under contract. so basically the majority of those volumes next year, the 13.2 million are domestic.
matthew fields -- bank of america -- analyst
okay, that's very helpful. thanks very much, guys and good luck next quarter.
jimmy a. brock -- chief executive officer and director
thanks, matt.
mitesh thakkar -- chief financial officer
thank you.

[operator instructions] our next question comes from lucas pipes with b riley. please go ahead.
lucas pipes -- b riley -- analyst
hey, good morning everyone.
jimmy a. brock -- chief executive officer and director
hi, lucas.
mitesh thakkar -- chief financial officer
hey, lucas.
lucas pipes -- b riley -- analyst
i wanted to follow-up on your presentation from a few weeks ago, you got a lot of questions on the $80 million of free cash flow pro forma 2021 on the heels of the consolidation and at the time i asked what sort of pricing on the contracted tons is underpinning that guidance. and so i want to repeat that question today and any other color you may be able to share for example, the proceeds from asset sales. would that also be included in the $80 million of free cash flow. i really appreciate your color. thank you.
mitesh thakkar -- chief financial officer
so, lucas i would say the income would have expected to be booked in 2020. so it would not have been reflected in that $80 million number from a free cash flow perspective, but the cash generation of i think the $20 million to $25 million that i referred to for the second quarter would be in that number.
lucas pipes -- b riley -- analyst
very helpful, thank you. and in terms of pricing, what sort of pricing assumptions are baked in. obviously, you've booked 13.2 million tons, so maybe you can speak to that and then also what you're also winning on contract bid or rather unpriced tons for the balance?
robert braithwaite -- vice president marketing and sales
lucas, this is bob. as jim mentioned, we are right in the heart of rfp season right now. we have several, several bids out that we expect to get some feedback and some positive feedback for that matter here over the next several weeks and as jim mentioned, we expect to secure meaningful volumes. on the pricing front, for competitive reasons, i want to be careful what i say, but i would suggest to you, if you look at the market in general, there is a lot of contango in our market. gas prices are in contango, power prices are contango.
i would say simply suggest to you that when you look at the current public marks out there whether you're looking at ihs, coal desk etc, we're expecting that those prices will be north of what those published marks are and i think you've heard this before, there is no -- there is no one out there that can live at these current prices long-term. so we feel very confident about our ability to secure meaningful volumes under these current rfps that are out and our expectations are pricing will be better than what you're currently seeing in the forwards?

lucas, this is, this is dan [phonetic], i might just add a little bit more color to that. we are still obviously in a period of transition kind of climbing out from the bottom that we faced this year and i'm not sure that people always appreciate the stretch that we've gone through here with gas prices. i mean, looking at the first 10 months of the year, gas has only been above $2 in three of those 10 months, january, august, and october, never been above $2.50 and to find gas below $2 prior to this stretch.
you've got to go all the way back to may of 2016 when we were at $1.92 henry hub spot price and if you look at kind of the scenario then, you had northern app coal in the spot market publish prices at about $33.50 [phonetic], you had pjm west power right at about $24.30 and soon thereafter going into 2017, we did see gas prices improve to right around $3 per million btu, very similar to where the fort [phonetic] strip, sits right now for next year and given time to recover northern app spot price has got back up to probably around $47 to $48 on a spot basis published prices. pjm west power fell in line at about $29 and change per megawatt hour. so a very similar scenario setting up i would say when you look at the forward strips for gas and power heading into 2021 and as bob said, just need the market to balance and i think many of the same fundamentals still exist.
lucas pipes -- b riley -- analyst
that's very helpful. thank you for that. and then second question, you touched on this in the prepared remarks and some of the earlier questions, but just to make sure i'm not missing anything. all the mines are fully running here, is that right? and would that be the outlook for 2021 at this point as well?
jimmy a. brock -- chief executive officer and director
currently, lucas we're running four longwalls. typically, we run five, but we're currently running four. we'll have our other longwall well set and ready to go if the market conditions warrant that we ramp up to that. so we would look -- but i would tell you today, we're running at about 6 million tons to 6.5 million tons a quarter and as you well know, we can run 27.5 million tons to 28 million tons. so i would say we're running at about 85% capacity currently today and if the market warrants, we certainly have the ability to ramp right back up to that 27 million plus number.
lucas pipes -- b riley -- analyst
that's very helpful. i appreciate that and continued best of luck.
jimmy a. brock -- chief executive officer and director
thanks, lucas.
mitesh thakkar -- chief financial officer
thanks.
operator
our next question comes from nick jarmoszuk with stifel. please go ahead.
nick jarmoszuk -- stifel -- analyst
hi, thanks for taking the questions. the first one on the 13.2 million tons for '21. directionally, can you let us know if the contracts that those replace does that pricing up or down?
jimmy a. brock -- chief executive officer and director
when you say contracts replaced, i'm not sure i'm following your question.
mitesh thakkar -- chief financial officer
you mean the new contracts, nick.
nick jarmoszuk -- stifel -- analyst
yeah, yeah the new contracts for those 13.2 million tons is the roughly $43 [phonetic], is that up relative to what you were receiving for those tons in 2020?
robert braithwaite -- vice president marketing and sales
so 2021, i would suggest that the contracts that we're currently negotiating are deals that we're currently negotiating. it depends on the timing of the market. today, i'd say you're probably a little bit below that $43 avg. number. however, one thing that i see happening right now is many utilities are still concerned about covid. so they're not buying i'll say 100% of their burn needs for next year.
they're leaving a lot more open for the spot market and i think dan just went through some good math that suggest should these economies reopen, should people get back to working in our offices, kids going back to school, i think there'll be a strong spot demand and spot market happen in the first quarter of next year and potentially even further out. and at that time i think that the pricing will improve. so again for the contracts we're currently talking about, i'd say they're above the published marks, but probably somewhat somewhere below the $43 average price we currently have today.
nick jarmoszuk -- stifel -- analyst
and then on the second lien buybacks, i believe you have a $25 million annual limit for those repurchases? first question is, is that still in place and then is there any consideration to going back to the first lien lenders to loosen up that basket?
mitesh thakkar -- chief financial officer
listen, we'll look at all the tools that we have from a corporate finance perspective. i will say that we still have availability on that basket. so it's not that we need to go back to seek relief or anything like that. i think -- and the trading liquidity in the second lien bonds is like right now i don't think i can do $50 million of buyback on my second lien given the trading liquidity without running up the prices as high because that basket is on market is on face value -- is on market value. so at $0.50 on $1, you can retire like $50 million. i'm rounding.
depends on the market value, right? i think that capacity is good for us through december. i mean, next year we are going to get a new bucket for that and hopefully our leverage is going to go down and we will have other baskets open up for us. so i think from a strategic perspective, if you think about it, you have the bucket for the rest of this year, you will have new bucket next year and if our leverage drops below two, you will have other baskets open up that will allow you to buy back. so i don't see the need to go back to the first lien lenders to offer more capacity if you roll.
nick jarmoszuk -- stifel -- analyst
okay and then final question just on working capital, how should we think about that for the next couple of quarters, whether it's a source or a use of capital?
mitesh thakkar -- chief financial officer
that is that a little bit tough question to answer and i'll tell you why because a lot of the times the working capital is driven by what the mines do. as you know, we don't have a lot of inventory space. so if the mine stop producing we'll collect our payments from the last month and your receivable balance will come down. as you might have noticed that has picked back compared to last quarter because we are shipping a lot more coal now. so that is one driver. a couple of other things that i mentioned that is going to help working capital is, for example, the $20 million to $25 million payment that we are expecting in the second quarter of next year that should that sets as working capital right now, it's going to reverse next year.
nick jarmoszuk -- stifel -- analyst
okay. that's all i had. thank you.
jimmy a. brock -- chief executive officer and director
thanks, nick.

operator
good day, and welcome to the consol energy second quarter 2021 earnings conference call. [operator instructions]
i would now like to turn the conference over to nathan tucker, director of finance and investor relations. please go ahead
nathan tucker -- director -- finance and investor relations
thank you, and good morning, everyone. welcome to consol energy's second quarter 2021 earnings conference call. any forward-looking statements or comments we make about future expectations are subject to some risks, which we have outlined in our press release and our sec filings and are considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934. we do not undertake any obligations of updating any forward-looking statements for future events or otherwise. we will also be discussing certain non-gaap financial measures, which are defined and reconciled to comparable gaap financial measures in our press release and furnished to the sec on form 8-k, which is also posted on our website. additionally, we filed our 10-q for the quarter ended june 30, 2021 with the sec this morning. you can find additional information regarding the company on our website, www.consolenergy.com.
on the call with me today are jimmy brock, our chief executive officer; mitesh thakkar, our chief financial officer; dan connell, our senior vice president of strategy; and bob braithwaite, our vice president of marketing and sales. in his prepared remarks, jimmy will provide an update on the recommenced development of the itmann metallurgical project, a recap of our key achievements during the second quarter of 2021 and specific insights on operations and sales. mitesh will then provide an update on our liability management initiatives, our financial performance during the quarter and 2021 guidance. in his closing comments, jimmy will lay out our key priorities for the remainder of 2021. after their prepared remarks, there will be a question and answer session in which dan and bob will join us as well. finally, we posted a supplemental slide deck on our website this morning, which we refer to on this call.
with that, let me turn it over to our chief executive officer, jimmy brock.
jimmy a. brock -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, nate, and good morning, everyone. we capped off the first half of 2021 by delivering another strong quarterly performance in q2. on the operations front, despite two longwall moves in the quarter, we delivered a solid cash cost performance.
additionally, we once again demonstrated our ability to achieve strong cash flow performance by generating north of $50 million in free cash flow in q2 of '21 and increasing the unrestricted cash on our balance sheet by more than $50 million as well. we reduced the leverage on our balance sheet and reaffirmed our ability to raise a significant amount of long-term capital through the recently completed tax-exempt financing on the pamc -- expansion project.
on the marketing front, we continue to execute our strategic shift into the export markets. and we also strategically layered in some financial hedges in the api2 market to secure revenue visibility and capture some of the recent export market strengths for 2022. on the safety front, our bailey preparation plant, consol marine terminal and itmann project each had zero recordable incidents during the second quarter of 2021. however, our total recordable incident rate or trir at the pamc finished q2 '21 higher than what is typical for us. although the severity level on each of these incidents was very low, we strived to perform each day at zero incidents. and our year-to-date trir at the pamc remains significantly below the national average for underground bituminous coal mines.
now, let me start with our most exciting news this quarter and provide an update on our itmann metallurgical coal project. we have been very clear that one of our major strategic goals is to diversify our revenue streams and reduce the percentage of revenues associated with power generation markets. this project is a very important step in that direction. as most of you know, in early 2019, we announced the commitments of the development of our itmann mine project, which is a low-vol metallurgical coal mining operation in wyoming county, west virginia.
however, due to the unprecedented demand and earnings decline associated with the covid-19 pandemic in 2020, we made the capital allocation decision to pullback spending on this project in order to focus our discretionary capital toward repurchasing our second-lien notes in the open market, which were trading well below par value at that time.
now, as our debt has continued to trade up to near par levels and as our free cash flow generation has significantly improved, i am very pleased to announce our decision to recommence the itmann project. despite the significant pullback in project expenditures, the past 12 to 18 months were instrumental in repositioning the project. we used this time to complete initial development mine to shore up our confidence in the reserve, and we optimized plans for the preparation plant, to create an additional upside potential. we evaluated several options for the preparation plant. first, build a brand-new facility from scratch.
second, purchase an existing plant at a nearby location and truck the coal for process, or third, identify an existing preparation plant for sale that could be relocated to our itmann side. based on our analysis, the third option made the most economic sense. and we are moving forward with relocating a higher capacity and state-of-the-art preparation plant to the itmann project side which is expected to start up in 2022. by relocating the plant, we eliminate potentially long lead times on equipment and avoid inflationary pressures from steel and other construction materials. we expect to produce 900,000 plus tons of high-quality, low-vol coke and coal annually from our itmann number-five mine once were at full run-rate production.
we expect this to be a low-cost operation with a long reserve life of 20-plus years of production at maintenance capital levels. while the overall project capital cost has increased slightly due to the reoptimized plants for the prep plant, we believe this can be more than offset by the expanded capacity afforded by the prep plant and improved cost structure due to the inclusion of a highly efficient rail load down. the prep plant where we are relocating will have a processing capacity that is nearly double that at the plant originally envisioned for itmann, opening up the opportunity for us to process up to 750,000 to one million product tons of third-party coal in addition to the coal from our itmann mine.
we expect this will create additional growth opportunity and higher revenue potential compared to the original project plan. with that, now let me provide an overview of the coal markets. we continue to execute on our multiyear transition of diversifying our sales mix and increasing our exposure to nonpower generation markets. following a record export sales volume in q1 of '21, we successfully placed a new record 3.2 million tons in the export market in q2 of '21, representing nearly 55% of our total shipments in the quarter. additionally, 47% of our tons sold were used in the industrial or metallurgical nonpower generation applications as we continue to diversify our way from traditional power generations.
as you can see on slide five, we have continued to steadily diversify our global customer base and end-use markets since our span in 2017. and in the second quarter of 2021, our overall export volume as a percentage of total sales volume went up roughly 22 percentage points versus full year of 2017. this improvement was driven by a sharp increase in the portion of our tons going into the industrial markets, which has risen by 33 percentage points versus 2017. we continue to focus on our strategy of further reducing our exposure to a declining u.s. coal market for power generation with a heightened focus on increasing our industrial business. we believe that with our quality of coal and cost structure at the pamc coupled with an ownership of consol marine terminal, we are very well positioned to take advantage of developing and sustaining opportunities in the export market.
demand for our product continued to strengthen in the second quarter of 2021 on the back of economic recovery and improved electric power and export demand. henry hub natural gas spot prices averaged $2.95 per million btu during the quarter, a 73% increase compared to q2 of '20. additionally, average pjm west day-ahead power prices continued to improve, and in q2 of '21, 61% above the year ago quarter. spot pricing trends were especially encouraging given that we were in the shoulder season. pricing has continued to improve since the end of the second quarter.
henry hub natural gas prices are now in the $4 per million btu range for august deliveries with calendar year 2022 now well above $3 per million btu. prior to 2021, you'd have to go back to 2018 to find a month in which henry hub averaged $4 or more and prior to that all the way back to 2014. we remain optimistic that overall market conditions will continue to improve due to accelerating global economic recovery and a relatively muted supply response.
on the export front. we have seen sustained improvements in the seaborne thermal coal market since the end of the third quarter of 2020. pet coke prices continued to remain supportive as a result of reduced oil production, propping up demand and pricing for northern app coal in high cv markets. api2 spot prices also continued to rise in the second quarter of 2021, largely driven by hot and dry weather, strong lng pricing and a limited supply response and ended the quarter improved by 82% compared to q2 of '20. as such, we layered in commodity derivative contracts in the api2 market for calendar year 2022, which mitesh will provide more color on shortly. additionally, we completed four term deals in the export market during the quarter with durations from one to two years in length. and we recently contracted a cargo of pamc coal to china for the first time since 2018.
from a marketing perspective, it is encouraging to see that demand for our coal has continued to improve since the low point in q2 of '20. we continue to maintain the vast majority of our core customer base and continue to see improvement in our customers' contracting appetites. our sales teams remains opportunistic in its marketing strategy and increased our contracted position by 9.4 million tons since our last earnings release, bringing our contracted position to 24.6 million tons in 2021 and 10.9 million tons in 2022. now, let me review our q2 '21 operational performance in detail. coal production at the pennsylvania mining complex came in at 5.9 million tons in q2 '21 compared to 2.4 million tons in q2 of '20. the vast improvement despite the aforementioned multiple longwall moves in q2 of '21 was due to a continued increase in demand for our products since the covid-related trough and demand that bottomed out during the year ago quarter.
as a result, productivity at the pamc measured as tons per employee hour improved by an impressive 46.7% in q2 of '21 compared to q2 of '20. on the cost front, our average cash cost of coal sale per ton was $28.02 in q2 of '21 compared to $25.90 in q2 of '20. although this seems impaired, keep in mind that the $25.90 per ton did not reflect the $32 million in mine idling cash cost incurred during the year ago quarter. when adjusted for that, q2 '21 cash costs significantly outperformed the prior year period. even without accounting for that idle cost, our year-to-date average cash cost of coal sold per ton was improved by nearly 15% versus the first half of 2020. our operations team continues to focus on maintaining tight control over cash expenditures as we move forward.
the consol marine terminal achieved a throughput volume of 3.8 million tons during q2 of '21 compared to 1.6 million tons in the year ago period. the significant increase was again due to improved demand in the seaborne markets compared to the trough of the covid-19 related decline in coal demand in q2 of '20. the terminal throughput volumes reflects a pace of over 15 million tons per annum and marks the second consecutive quarter with an annualized run-rate north of 15 million tons. terminal revenues for the quarter came in at $17.4 million compared to $15.9 million in the year ago quarter. despite the major increase in throughput tonnage, the impact on revenue was somewhat lessened due to the take-or-pay contract that was in place in the prior year period. cash operating costs came in at $5.3 million versus $3.8 million in the year ago quarter.
with that, i will now turn the call over to mitesh to provide the financial update.
mitesh thakkar -- chief financial officer
thank you, jimmy, and good morning, everyone. i will start with an update on the progress we have made on our key financial priorities. i will then review our second quarter 2021 results and our full year 2021 guidance.
as we have discussed in the past, our financial priorities remain maximizing free cash flow generation, maintaining strong liquidity and reducing outstanding debt. while these remain on north star, we are now also selectively allocating capital toward strategic initiatives such as our itmann project. after accomplishing a significant milestone of achieving a net leverage ratio below 2 times at the end of 1q '21, we further reduced our leverage to 1.7 times at the end of 2q '21. this was despite our recently completed tax-exempt bond offering, which we previously highlighted would increase our leverage in the near-term due to the treatment of restricted cash under our credit agreement. however, if we include the restricted cash, our leverage ratio as of june 30 would have dropped to 1.54 times. while we have more work to do on our balance sheet front, we have several initiatives underway or recently completed that we believe will create long-term value for our shareholders.
first, we continue to make strides on our overall debt reduction goal as we made total debt payments and repurchases of $18 million in 2q '21. this included open market repurchases of outstanding second-lien notes where we spent $4.8 million to retire $5 million at a slight discount to par. we view these buybacks as a good use of capital even as the market price of our second-lien notes have rallied back to trade at near par levels.
second, we made the discretionary decision to execute an $18.4 million early buyout option on an existing operating lease for a set of longwall shares. this decision not only saves us nearly $900,000 per month in operating lease expense for the next 12 months, but also eliminates the buyout requirement in 2q '22 at fair market value. given where steel prices are currently, this fair market value would most likely have been elevated and could have been close to or more than the $18 million fixed early buyout amount we executed. the early buyout also reduces the operating lease liability on our books, which rating agencies include in their leverage calculations.
third, as highlighted last quarter, we continue to find ways to tap alternative sources of capital by successfully securing $75 million of tax-exempt solid waste disposal revenue bonds at the beginning of the second quarter. we received reimbursements from qualified expenses in the amount of $21.5 million in 2q '21, which dates back to the initial inducement date in mid-2020. additionally, we have $53.5 million in restricted cash associated with this financing that will be used to fund future spending on the refuse disposal areas at the pamc and will reduce our leverage ratio over time.
from a strategic standpoint, this transaction gives us additional financial flexibility and helps to de-risk a portion of our future refinancing efforts by pushing $75 million of maturity in 2028. the transaction is also a testament to our ability to access long-term capital. it gets even more exciting when you consider that the commodity environment and our balance sheet has only strengthened since the closing of this transaction. we also expect this as a future financing avenue that could be available to us.
fourth, to capitalize on the strength in the export market, we initiated a targeted revenue hedging strategy during the second quarter of 2021. so far, we have layered in two million metric tons of commodity derivative contracts in the api2 market for calendar year 2022 at a weighted average price of $79.34 per ton. these financial hedges ensure strong netback core prices for us for the approximately two million tons of physical contracts we signed during 2q '21 for 2022, which are also tied to api2 prices. the good news for us is that api2 prices and other export market pricing indicators continue to strengthen. and we still have an additional 13-plus million tons of coal sales uncontracted for 2022. we anticipate a significant portion of these sales will go into the export markets.
fifth, on the legacy liabilities front, under our current actuarial assumptions, we have a fully funded status on our defined benefit pension plan. at this point, we do not have any funding requirements for the foreseeable future and have significantly lowered our exposure to equity market volatility. as we move forward, we'll continue to focus on strengthening our balance sheet while implementing our targeted growth and diversification strategy. this includes our commitment to completing the itmann project. we expect this project to require an additional $65 million to $70 million of capex to complete given the increased processing capacity and new train load out at the preparation facility. this is an addition to the $24 million already spent on the project to-date since its inception in early 2019.
recommencing this project is not an either our decision relative to our debt reduction priority. we still expect to continue to reduce our outstanding debt on our balance sheet -- and unrestricted cash. this project like all financial decisions went to our rigorous capital allocation process. excluding any third-party revenue, we expect it to generate a rate of return north of 25% over the life of the project assuming an australian premium low-vol coking coal price of $160 to $170 a ton, which is consistent with the actual trailing 10-year average price and the current forward strip for 2023 to 2025.
we believe the returns on the itmann project will exceed our weighted average cost of capital, even at long-term average australian premium low oil prices of $130 a ton. we are very excited about this project and its earnings and free cash flow potential. with that, let me now recap the second quarter results before moving on to our 2021 guidance. ceix reported a very strong financial performance for 2q '21 with net income of $4.2 million or $0.12 per diluted share, which included $20.4 million of unrealized mark-to-market losses related to commodity derivatives and adjusted ebitda of $84.4 million. this compares to a loss of $18 million or $0.69 per diluted share and adjusted ebitda of $34.2 million in the year ago quarter. in 2q '21, we generated $94.6 million of cash flow from operations, which included $25.6 million of positive working capital changes driven by a significant reduction in our accounts and notes receivable balance.
additionally, we spent $43.7 million in capital expenditures, which included the previously discussed $18.4 million for the discretionary operating lease buyout and we received $3.4 million in proceeds from asset sales. this resulted in free cash flow generation of $54.4 million in 2q '21. this highlights the ability of our business to generate free cash flow in challenging markets and capture a meaningful upside in stronger markets. as a result of our free cash flow generation, we have increased our unrestricted cash position by nearly $56 million in the quarter and now have an unrestricted cash position of $146 million, which is the highest level since 2q '19. including the restricted cash position of $53.5 million, our cash and cash equivalents balance is over $200 million.
now, let me provide you with our updated outlook for 2021. due to our strong first half '21 operational performance and outlook for the remainder of the year, we are increasing our expected sales volume for 2021 to 23.5 million to 25 million tons, up from our previous guidance of 22 million to 24 million tons. additionally, due to the efforts of our operations team to drive costs down despite inflationary pressures, so far this year, we are adjusting our expected average cash cost of coal sold per ton to a range of $27 to $28 per ton, down from our previous guidance of $27 to $29 per ton.
on the pricing front, we currently have a 2021 contracted position of 24.6 million tons at an expected average price of $44.02 per ton. the improvement compared to our prior guidance reflects the strength in the current pricing environment on the additional contracted volumes we have layered in as well as an improvement in the assumed pjm west power forwards. finally, we are increasing our capital guidance due to the decision to recommence the itmann project and the completed lease buyout to a range of $160 million to $180 million. as always, we will continue to reassess our guidance ranges each quarter and adjust them as necessary.
with that, let me turn it back to jimmy to make some final comments.
jimmy a. brock -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, mitesh. before we move on to the question and answer session, let me take this opportunity to provide a recap of our accomplishments in the second quarter and reiterate our priorities as we move forward.
first, we continue to prioritize strengthening and enhancing our balance sheet by improving our liquidity and financial flexibility. despite shrinking access to capital for coal companies, we have had good success in identifying and tapping alternative sources of capital.
second, despite significant inflationary pressures, we continue to keep costs at our operations under control through efficiencies, reduced discretionary spending and creativity in our supply chain management program. the team continues to look for ways to effectively drive costs down without sacrificing the effectiveness of our operations. by rightsizing our operations, we've taken some slack out of the system, allowing our four operating longwalls at the pamc, the ability to essentially run full out. this drives efficiency and results in a sustained reduction in our average cash cost of coal sold per ton compared to our historical averages.
third, our consol marine terminal is one of the most strategically valuable assets in our portfolio. the terminal will be essential for executing our longer-term strategic shift into the export market, which we expect will derisk our domestic exposure and allow us to capitalize on growing international demand for our high cv product. year-to-date, we shipped more than 50% of our total sales volume into the export market, which highlights the value of owning our own terminal and is a huge differentiator for us compared to our peers.
finally, we're extremely excited to be in a position to restart the itmann project. we view this project as the next phase of our strategy, which focuses on targeted growth and diversification as an additional avenue to increase value for our shareholders. this project is strategically important as it will diversify our portfolio by adding a new metallurgical coal product stream to the mix. and it aligns well with our current operations by being low cost, high margin and high quality. before handing the call over, i want to reiterate that we are extremely proud of our accomplishments to-date and believe we have a lot of opportunity in front of us to build upon our strategic priorities.
our capital allocation process, world-class asset and employees have helped us to come out of 2020 prime to excel in 2021 and beyond. there's always more work to do. but we continue to focus on our goal of strengthening our balance sheet and creating long-term value for our shareholders.
with that, i will hand the call back over to nate for further instructions.
nathan tucker -- director -- finance and investor relations
thank you, jimmy. we will now move to the "," session of our call. at this time, i'd like to ask our operator to please provide the instruction to our callers.
 :
operator
[operator instructions] and the first question comes from nathan martin with the benchmark company. please go ahead.
nathan martin -- the benchmark company -- analyst
good morning, guys. congratulations on the first half performance.
jimmy a. brock -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, nate.
nathan martin -- the benchmark company -- analyst
maybe i'll start on the cost side first. you guys obviously lowered your guidance by, i guess, $0.50 a ton at the midpoint. but even if i run costs in the second half flat with your second quarter results of $28, which at the high end of your revised full year guidance, you end up right at the low end of that new guidance range. is there something that pushes costs higher here in the second half or maybe is there a chance you could possibly outperform there?
jimmy a. brock -- president and chief executive officer
nate, if you remember on our last earnings call, i said that we expect to come in at the lower half of our cost guidance. and as we look forward, there's still some uncertainties in the market out there. i mean, we have a contracted position for 2021, that's up significantly than on our last earnings call. but still, we have two longwall moves in the second half of the year, one in each quarter, whereas in that first quarter, we didn't have any. and inflationary pressures from some of the commodities that we produced with, we see those could come to us.
so as mitesh mentioned in his comments, we'll reevaluate and look at it. but our goal is to keep a tight lease on cost where we can. and then, let the operations team do what they do best and they figure out ways to lower cost as we continue to produce. but the reason that we lowered it $1 is because of our performance to-date. and then, as we look forward with one longwall move in each quarter, we think we'll have an opportunity to still come in toward the lower end of that guidance and that's what our goal will be.
mitesh thakkar -- chief financial officer
and nate, i think inflation is a big part of a little bit of cautiousness here. as you know, all raw material prices have been higher since the beginning of the year. so i think that is something that we continuously monitor. i think our supply chain team has done a good job of managing that so far. but there's always some buffer related to inflation as we go through the year as things continue to be very strong in the commodity landscape.
nathan martin -- the benchmark company -- analyst
got it. i appreciate those thoughts guys. and then, maybe shifting over to the pricing side. looks like you're essentially fully contracted for this year, meaning additional 400,000 tons or so at the high end of revised guidance. should we assume those tons would likely go to the export market? and then, if we look forward to 2022, i think you layered on an additional five million tons or so there. can you talk about the mix of those tons and give us an idea of what prices they were layered in? thanks.
robert braithwaite -- vice president marketing and sales
yes. sure. nate, this is bob. just to kind of highlight 2021, as we mentioned earlier, we have now 24.6 million tons sold. the additional volume we had to get to the upper end of the guidance, i would suggest that that's likely going to go into the export market. there's still about a $5 to $10 arbitrage versus what the domestic prices are today. even at $4 gas, i would suggest that the prices you're seeing in the publications cold desk reference and they call it the mid $50 range. we're still seeing an arbitrage in the export market. so it's likely that those volumes will go there.
as far as 2022 is concerned, we did contract an additional 5.3 million tons since our last earnings call. about 80% of those volumes were contracted into the international market. so sitting here today of the 10.9 million tons, a little over four million tons of those are contracted to go exports. and based on where we sit today, i would suggest that our export volumes will be pretty much similar to, if not a little bit higher in 2022 than what we expect to export in 2021. and again, that goes based on jimmy's comments of our strategic shift, and then, also, again based on the price arbitrage that exists today.
nathan martin -- the benchmark company -- analyst
i appreciate that color bob. and just any early thoughts on potential production levels in 2022 given the positive quarter view of the market?
jimmy a. brock -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. i think as we've always said, we'll run to the market. thus far, we've been able to run our four longwalls full out. we would want to continue that into 2022. and then, depending upon what future forecasts we see there, we could run some additional shifts or something. but i would expect our tonnage for 2022 to be very similar to what we have in 2021 with possibly some upside.
nathan martin -- the benchmark company -- analyst
got it. thanks for that jimmy. and then, just a real quick one to shift to itmann. i appreciate all the color you guys are given on the projects and the updates there. i guess, how do we think about production ramp? i'm assuming we'll have to wait for the prep plant completion before we see any meaningful production, which i think you guys would say may be mid to second half '22, can you kind of talk about that? and then, maybe your decision to relocate the existing prep plant with additional capacity, maybe just any thoughts on the appetite you see to fill that excess capacity? thanks.
daniel connell -- senior vice president -- strategy
sure, nate. this is dan. regarding the first part of your question on the production ramp, we have been fortunate in being able to continue our development mining here at a reduced rate for the past number of months, and we'll continue that as we build out the plant. so that puts us in really good position when the plant becomes available, targeting kind of the q3 2022 timeframe to very rapidly ramp-up and bring both of the additional sections on that we will need to scale-up to full production.
so i think our plan would be that during the second half of next year, we can move from kind of the controlled development mining that we've been doing to something very close to, if not achieving full production during 2022. the decision to relocate the plant is one that, as jimmy mentioned, we ran a lot of analysis on. we had time to give that a thorough look given kind of the pause in the project during last couple of months. so we feel like we've vetted that plan very well. there are a number of reserves kind of in the vicinity of where this prep plant is being built that are -- have yet to be developed. and we actually have some development mining going on nearby it and then in some of the upper seams as we speak, that we'll likely be looking for a home. so we feel optimistic about the opportunity to pull third-party tons into the plant based on economics, should help to improve the product wins that we can produce coming out of itmann.
and to be clear, the economic numbers that we've been reporting do not assume any upside from those third-party tons. so we have -- we based our decisions on just kind of an itmann base case, and we view the third-party tons as upside to that plan.
jimmy a. brock -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. and nate, just to add to that one of the things. when we were looking at the preparation plant, which is a big decision. as far as us ramping up to full production, the 900,000 tons plus that we had mentioned, we would not want to do that until we're processing our own coal and we can get that through. so when we looked at the preparation plant, one of the key factors there on our initial plan, we were going to build a much smaller plant that would be somewhere around 350 tons an hour. and then, we were going to -- if we got all the third-party business, everything, we would add that second piece on.
well, we're buying this plant and relocating it, we have that from day one. and then, some of the increase in capital was because of the trained load-out that we're going to have. that's going to give us the ability to not only move our coal very efficiently on the rail line, but also any third-party coal that we have coming into there. so i remain very, very excited about the itmann project. i'm happy that we put ourselves in a position to whereas we can recommence it. and i think it's going to be a nice return and be a nice project for our shareholders.
nathan martin -- the benchmark company -- analyst
got it. i appreciate that -- those additional thoughts, that makes sense. and then, just finally, i think mitesh, obviously you went through some quick irr numbers for itmann and i might have missed some of those. but have you guys done kind of any payback period calculations for the project and what that might look like at various net price decks? thanks.
mitesh thakkar -- chief financial officer
sure. i think it depends on what met price do you use. i mean some of these cases, the payback period could be as little as two to three years. i'll let dan address some more specific payback periods if you will.
daniel connell -- senior vice president -- strategy
sure. no, i mean, i think as we mentioned nate during the remarks, we've kind of run the project economics using a price strip that's consistent with both the 10-year average historic met prices and the current forward strip. and that puts you kind of in the payback range that mitesh mentioned, i think in terms of roi numbers, we said north of 25%. obviously, if you run the numbers at the current market and assume that it holds out here for a couple of years, payback period becomes quite short. and these are paybacks. the roi numbers just to clarify are based on total project capital costs since inception. if you look at the numbers on a go-forward basis, may become more attractive than what was before.
mitesh thakkar -- chief financial officer
i think that's an important point that i want to highlight that all these economics that we ran are on total project cost basis. it's not just a go-forward capex that we used for analysis. even though, today, if you are making that decision, you should look at go forward because that's more applicable. we wanted to make sure that the project economics hold.
nathan martin -- the benchmark company -- analyst
got it. i appreciate all that information guys. thanks again for the time today and best of luck in the second half.
jimmy a. brock -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. thanks, nathan.

[operator instructions] the next question comes from lucas pipes with b. riley securities. please go ahead.
lucas pipes -- b. riley securities -- analyst
thanks very much, and good morning, everyone.
jimmy a. brock -- president and chief executive officer
good morning.
lucas pipes -- b. riley securities -- analyst
i may have missed it earlier. but jimmy, you mentioned the spread between the international and the domestic market. and i wondered, can you elaborate on what that spread is today, i.e. what is seeing for export tons, what is pricing for domestic tons? and then, do you have a view on what might trigger these prices to which obviously would be great to see the domestic pricing move up. so i appreciate your thoughts on there. thank you.
robert braithwaite -- vice president marketing and sales
yeah, lucas. this is bob. right now, i'd say the arbitrage versus kind of the published marks, the published marks are call it mid $50 levels for prompt right around $50 levels for coal strip '22. the volumes we've locked in to-date on the international side, the arbitrage is roughly around $5 or $10. and that does not include any, again, terminal revenues that we receive as well. so that's kind of the level we're at today. going forward, i still view that this market has legs for at least another 12 to 18 months.
i mean, the supply response just is not there, not only in coal, but gas space as well. and inventories are significantly below their averages. in fact, i read an article just last week that gas reserves in europe are the lowest they've been in over a decade. and then, when you look at pet coke, prices continue to trend upward and now 90% up year-on-year. so again, i think this market has legs on a continued -- the back of a continued post pandemic recovery and just a relatively muted supply response.
jimmy a. brock -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. and i would add, lucas, going forward, when we're looking at gas prices where they are today and i can't reiterate enough the supply response just hasn't been there. so i think -- i agree with bob. i think the market does have legs into the coming years, particularly on the international market, and that will help drive some of the domestic pricing as well. so we feel like it does have legs with demand increasing for electricity, gas prices where they are and a muted supply response.
lucas pipes -- b. riley securities -- analyst
thank you very much bob and jimmy for that perspective. in terms of your capital allocation, you're clearly shifting -- well, you're shifting toward growth with itmann. good to see that. and i wondered from here on out, what are your priorities? is it more so on the capital? is it more on the debt side, buying back maybe more --. we saw at your transaction on the capital lease side. what are some of the opportunities? and mitesh, maybe if you could speak to any limits or restrictions you may have would very much appreciate your perspective. thank you.
mitesh thakkar -- chief financial officer
so let me start by saying that we are in a very strong position today and are constantly reviewing our capital allocation priorities to ensure that they are consistent with changing market conditions and provide us the best risk-adjusted return. in-line with our strategic priorities and the attractive rates of returns that we just talked about for itmann project, we relaunched it, makes a lot of sense for incremental dollars that we are spending. also, as i mentioned in my prepared remarks, we still have some wood to chop as far as deleveraging is concerned.
now, debt repurchases are not as attractive as they used to be before. but given that we want to de-lever and the fact that we still have an 11% paper out there, that allows us to be opportunistic in that area. i think you'll continue to see us pay down our debt or repurchase in the open market, because as i said earlier, it's not an either or decision for us as far as deleveraging is concerned and itmann is concerned.
the steps that we are taking with deleveraging and growing our met coal business are all geared toward one goal and that is really to create significant value for our shareholders, whether it comes from growth or from having larger equity value in the enterprise. the good news is that the market is offering us the opportunity today to launch and execute on multiple of these initiatives and returning capital to our shareholders is one of them, right? we are constantly reviewing it and hope to provide you an update in coming quarters as we execute on our near-term goals as well.
with respect to the operating leases, i don't see any big opportunities right now on that front. we saw one in the second quarter and executed on it, which i feel was one of the best projects so to speak, when you think about from a rate of return perspective. we ran the dcf some -- it was a very easy decision to make. so i think those are the opportunities we'll continue to look at and continue to deliver on some of our strategic priorities.
jimmy a. brock -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. and the good news is for us, it's not an either or as mitesh mentioned earlier in his comments. with us generating free cash flow at the rate we are per quarter, we have an opportunity to do all of these things. but i want to reiterate, really excited about the itmann project. it gives us that diversity in our product stream of having the low-vol metallurgical coal in the mix. and i think we're going to continue to do the things that we've done in the past, which enhanced the balance sheet, provides great liquidity and add a new product mix to our stream.
lucas pipes -- b. riley securities -- analyst
thank you very much. and when i saw those capital lease numbers, i thought i should get into the business of lending to you guys. really appreciate all the color continued best of luck

the next question comes from michael dudas with vertical research partners. please go ahead.
michael dudas -- vertical research partners -- analyst
good morning everyone.
jimmy a. brock -- president and chief executive officer
[speech overlap] good morning.
michael dudas -- vertical research partners -- analyst
first question, maybe you can elaborate a little bit more on your domestic customer base. again, certainly, inventories down, demand up. how urgent do you feel they are right now, especially as where we've had better economic activity going forward and where gas prices are? and any update on your customer base relative to potential coal power plant closures and your exposure there and how that may impact maybe some of your competitive suppliers as those things work through the system?
robert braithwaite -- vice president marketing and sales
mike, right now, we are in discussions with several domestic customers, not only for the balance of '21, but 2022 as well. without a doubt, utilities are realizing that spot coal is not readily available as it once was. so with that being said, i do believe that there will be opportunities to lock-in some longer-term volumes to ensure they have supply going forward. so with that being said, stay tuned there. but as you mentioned, inventories are, i would say, near critical levels for many of the domestic utilities that we do serve. when i say critical levels, i'm saying sub-10 days of inventory on the ground. and with gas price at $4, i don't see that that this will change in the very near future. so again, it should bode very well for us in our contracting abilities for 2022.
as far as closures are concerned, as of right now, within the next 10 years, we have very minimal of our customer base, look -- that has announced that they will retire. i would say, it's in a neighborhood of 0.5 million to one million total tons that we view at risk. obviously, as jimmy talked about before is reggie. we do have to be concerned about reggie, which we're keeping a close eye on. that could have some additional impact on us in pennsylvania. but again, we are continuing to look and focus on shifting some of those volumes already in the export market. so that's kind of where we stand today.
michael dudas -- vertical research partners -- analyst
i appreciate that. secondly, moving internationally, say to your important market in india and you mentioned about pet coke. and could you maybe just a thought on just the dynamics going on in the asian coal market, especially with some of the shifts in coal in and out of china and then the lack of supply response. again, not to predict the future markets, but you got pretty strong curves out there. relative to say -- and jimmy mentioned your 2014 and 2018 coal price spikes in internationally. how different is it dynamic and what you're seeing here, especially as you guys have evolved into a much more important and solid provider coal into those export markets?
robert braithwaite -- vice president marketing and sales
yeah. one thing that benefits us as we mentioned in our remarks, our coal being a high btu, high calorific value coal does transport very nicely into these markets, especially into the asian markets, where there is additional transportation. as far as this time around versus what happened in call it 2014, as we mentioned, the supply response isn't there. i mean, if you look at the production, not only in the u.s. but look at the production in colombia, i mean, it's significantly down. and they're just not -- those production basins just aren't coming back is strong. plus not only that, there's additional build-outs internationally. i mean india obviously is a targeted market for us. they're going -- they have been going through and continue to go through industrial revolution. and then, again, with the whole australia and china tensions continuing. it is opening up doors for us to get bailey coal into china as well.
as jimmy mentioned, we did contract our first cargo there this year, which is our first since 2018. so again, i think a lot of this is based on just again, a post-pandemic recovery and muted supply response that we just do not feel is coming back.
michael dudas -- vertical research partners -- analyst
understood. and finally, i guess mitesh, on your derivative book that you're creating here. is that something that is -- i assume its opportunistic. but as we see that as you managed the pricing markets, there's a little bit more exposure to that as you move forward? is that something that's going to be part of how you -- on the marketing and hedging side going forward, especially with your more exposure in those export markets?
mitesh thakkar -- chief financial officer
yeah. so mike, you're absolutely right. i think what we did in the second quarter was more opportunistic, but it also demonstrates a tool that we have in future. i think one of the things that we have noticed is there was interest in doing api tooling contracts by some of our supplier -- by some of our customers. so we wanted to manage that risk. and in hindsight, you look at it, it almost looks like we could have waited three more months, and we would have been a lot better off.
but i think the goal there was to mitigate the risk, and i think we used it appropriately at that time. but it also gave us another tool to do some of the things where if we want to -- if we are seeing that we are not making progress on improving our contracted position, but the api2 market is there. we can lock in tons there and have some of that book.
right now, that's not the case, but that doesn't mean it's not going to be in the future. i think our marketing team is very successful in layering in some contracts here in the export markets, even on a term basis and not just spot basis, which is really good. we like that approach much better than using the derivatives, but it's a tool that we have we can use.
michael dudas -- vertical research partners -- analyst
that sounds great. i appreciate your thoughts gentlemen.
jimmy a. brock -- president and chief executive officer
