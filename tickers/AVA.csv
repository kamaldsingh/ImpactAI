ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the avista corporation's second quarter 2020 earnings conference call. [operator instructions] after the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [operator instructions]
i would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, john wilcox, investor relations manager. thank you, please go ahead, sir.
john wilcox -- investor relations manager
good morning, everyone, and welcome to avista's second quarter 2020 earnings conference call. our earnings were released pre-market this morning and are available on our website.
joining me this morning are avista corp, president and ceo, dennis vermillion; executive vice president, cfo and treasurer, mark thies; senior vice president, external affairs and chief customer officer, kevin christie; and vice president, controller and principal accounting officer, ryan krasselt.
i would like to remind everyone that some of the statements that will be made today are forward-looking statements that involve assumptions, risks and uncertainties, which are subject to change. for reference to the various factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed in today's call, please refer to our 10-k for 2019 and 10-q for the second quarter of 2020, which are available on our website.
to begin this presentation, i would like to recap the financial results presented in today's press release. our consolidated earnings for the second quarter of 2020 were $0.26 per diluted share, compared to $0.38 for the second quarter of 2019. for year-to-date, consolidated earnings were $0.98 per diluted share for 2020, compared to $2.14 last year.
now, i'll turn the discussion over to dennis.
dennis vermillion -- president and chief executive officer
well, thanks, john. and good morning, everyone. we hope everyone is staying safe and healthy during these uncertain times. it's hard to believe that we've been managing through the covid-19 pandemic for five months now. and every day, i continue to be inspired by how our employees continue to rally on all fronts to respond to the crisis. i couldn't be more proud of how we're staying vigilant and adapting across the organization to the new policies and procedures that can quickly change in the states where we serve.
i appreciate their patience, their persistence and professionalism, as we all navigate through these unchartered waters to seek out our new normal, all while still providing the energy that is so essential to our customers. as always, our top priority is to preserve the health and safety of our customers, our employees, contractors and our communities.
as the regional economies across the areas we serve move forward with fits and start, we're doing our best to support those customers, who we know are struggling. you may have seen recently the avista foundation provided more than $500,000 to support 37 different organizations throughout our service area. and so far in 2020, our foundation has provided more than $1.5 million to help those in need. although the majority of our employees are still working from home, it hasn't impacted our ability to complete important work across our business.
wildfires continue to be an important topic for our industry and our company, especially this time of year. before the wildfire season arrived, we enhanced our 10-year wildfire resiliency plan to expand our current safeguards for preventing, mitigating and reducing the impact of wildfires to help minimize the possibility of wildfires and the related service disruptions.
our team spent the last year developing our plan through a series of internal workshops, industry research and engagement with state and local fire agencies. the plan has certain key areas that include grid hardening, vegetation management, situational awareness, operations and emergency response and worker and public safety. in total, we expect to spend approximately $330 million implementing the plan components over the life of the 10-year plan.
we're also excited for construction to be completed on the catalyst building and the scott morris center for energy innovation. we can hardly wait for the buildings to open next month and when they do, scott morris' vision to create the five smartest blocks in the world will become a reality. avista will be able to continue to innovate and test new ideas about how to share energy in a shared economy model. and what we learn could not only shape how the grid of the future will operate, but also could provide a transformative new model for the entire utility industry.
last year, we established a goal to serve our customers with a 100% clean electricity by 2045 and a 100% carbon-neutral resources by 2027. consistent with our goal and our 2020 integrated resource plan, we are seeking proposals from renewable energy project developers, who are capable of constructing, owning and operating up to 120 average megawatts. our intent is to secure the output from the renewable generation resources, including energy, capacity and associated environmental attributes. this will allow us to offset market purchases and fossil fuel thermal generation, which is a key step to achieving our goals.
with respect to results, our second quarter consolidated earnings were in line with expectations and we are on track to meet our 2020 earnings guidance at avista utilities, ael&p and our other businesses. as such, we are confirming our 2020 consolidated earnings guidance, a range of $1.75 to $1.95 per diluted share.
and finally, one last point. our senior vice president, chief legal counsel, and corporate secretary, marian durkin, just retired on august 1. i'd like to take this time to thank marian for her 15-years of service to avista. during her tenure, marian defined our business needs and -- to build our legal department from the ground up to the robust team that it is today. as the focus and scrutiny on compliance has grown across many different industries, marian also centralized the company's compliance efforts and has taken our compliance department to a new level.
also, under marian's leadership, earlier this year, avista was named as one of ethisphere's world's most ethical companies. it's a tremendous honor to receive this designation, thanks to marian. we wish marian all the best as she begins her retirement and transitions into this new chapter.
and now, i'll turn this presentation over to mark.
mark thies -- executive vice president, treasurer and chief financial officer
thank you, dennis. and good morning, everyone. i have big news for you. hockey is back. i'm very excited about that. the blackhawks, because of the pandemic, made the playoffs and we're currently 1-1 with edmonton with a game tonight. so, those on the east coast, it's a 10:30 game, but i'd like you to stay up and route for my blackhawks.
for the second quarter of 2020, avista utilities contributed $0.26 per diluted share, compared to $0.32 in 2019. compared to the second quarter of 2019, our earnings decreased due to lower electric utility margin and from higher power supply costs and decreased loads related to covid-19, which was partially offset by rate relief and customer growth. we also had lower operating expenses in the second quarter of 2020.
the energy recovery mechanism in washington was a small benefit in this year of $0.4 million, compared to a much larger benefit in 2019 of $6 million. for the year-to-date, we recognized a pre-tax benefit of $5.6 million in 2020, compared to $3.5 million in 2019, all with respect to the erm.
with respect to the covid-19 impacts on our results, we recorded an incremental $3.3 million of bad debt expense for the year-to-date and we expect the incremental amount to be $5.7 million for the full-year, including the first quarter as -- first half, as compared to our original forecast. in july, the idaho commission issued an order that allows us to defer certain costs, net of any decreased costs and other benefits related to covid-19.
during the second quarter, we deferred $1.1 million of bad debt expense associated with this order. compared to normal, in the second quarter there was a -- our loads, there was a decrease of approximately 6% on overall electric loads, which consisted of approximately 10% decrease in commercial and a 14% decrease in industrial, which was partially offset by about 4% increase in our residential loads. these loads decreased earnings by about $0.03 in the second quarter and we expect to have continued lower loads throughout most of the year, with a gradual recovery toward the end of the year. we expect to be able to mostly offset the lower utility margin through our cost management activities, and this is reflected in our consolidated guidance.
we do expect a gradual economic recovery, but prolonged high unemployment that will depress load and customer growth into 2021. we have decoupling and other regulatory mechanisms, which help mitigate the impact of these load changes on our -- the impact on our revenues for residential and certain commercial customers. over 90% of our utility revenue is covered by regulatory mechanisms.
during the second quarter, we began experiencing some supply chain delays due to the effects of the covid-19 pandemic, with delays ranging from a couple of weeks to up to six weeks in some cases. however, we do not expect this to have a significant impact on our planned projects and we continue to be committed to investing the necessary capital in our utility infrastructure and expect our spending in 2020 to be still be about $405 million.
with respect to liquidity, at june 30, we had $160 million of available liquidity under our $400 million line of credit and we had $100 million in cash from our term loan. in the second quarter, we extended our line of credit agreement a year to april 2022. we expect to issue this year approximately $165 million of long-term debt and up to $70 million of equity, and that includes $24 million that we've issued through june.
as dennis mentioned earlier, we are confirming our 2020 guidance, with a consolidated range of $1.75 to $1.95. we're expecting that covid-19 impacts at avista utilities of increased operating expenses include bad debt expense, reduced industrial loads and increased interest will be mostly offset by expected tax benefits from the cares act and other efforts to identify cost reduction opportunities that we have implemented.
we have filed for deferred accounting treatment in each of our jurisdictions. and as i said earlier, in idaho, the idaho commission issued an order that allows us to defer certain costs related to covid-19, net of any decreased costs and other benefits. the idaho commission will determine the appropriateness and prudency of any deferred expenses when we seek recovery.
we continue to expect -- to experience regulatory lag until 2023, we filed the general rate case in oregon in march of 2020 and continue to anticipate filing in washington and idaho in the fourth quarter of this year. we expect our long-term earnings growth after 2023 to be 4% to 6%.
now, with the specifics on the ranges for each segment. we expect avista utilities to contribute in the range of $1.77 to $1.89 per diluted share. the midpoint of our range does not include any expense or benefit under the erm and our current expectation is that we will be in a benefit of a 90/10 sharing band, which is expected to add $0.06 per diluted share.
our outlook for avista utilities assumes, among other variables, normal precipitation, temperatures and hydroelectric generation for the remainder of the year and we have implemented the cost reduction measures to help mitigate the impacts of costs related to covid-19.
for 2020, we expect ael&p to contribute in the range of $0.07 to $0.11 per share and our outlook for ael&p assumes, among other variables, normal precipitation and hydroelectric generation for the remainder of the year. and we continue to expect our other businesses to have a loss of between $0.09 and $0.05 per diluted share.
our guidance generally includes only normal operating conditions and does not include any unusual items; such as settlement transactions or acquisitions and dispositions until the effects are known and certain. we cannot predict the duration or severity of the covid-19 global pandemic. and the longer and more severe economic restrictions and business disruption, the greater the impact on our operations, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
i will now turn the call back to john.
john wilcox -- investor relations manager
and now, we will open up this call for questions.

operator
thank you. [operator instructions] our first question comes from richard ciciarelli with bank of america. your line is open.
richard ciciarelli -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
hey, good morning. how are you guys doing?
mark thies -- executive vice president, treasurer and chief financial officer
good morning, richard.
dennis vermillion -- president and chief executive officer
good morning.
richard ciciarelli -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
all right. just had a question about how you're thinking about positioning the rate case filing in washington coming out of the pandemic and balancing the customer rate impact, especially given the backdrop of the puget sound decision, where attrition adjustments were denied. do you see an opportunity there for multi-year rate plans or attrition adjustments still to be implemented by the commission? or is there an overall sense of rate fatigue?
kevin christie -- senior vice president, external affairs and chief customer officer
hi there. this is kevin christie. thanks for the question. we're still compiling our case and putting together all the information, taking into consideration the impacts of covid-19 and of course the puget case. and i'd say, it's too soon to say for sure. we're contemplating a multi-year plan, but i can't say that we're going to file one until we get all our data together and the case in better shape and then we'll be able to let you know.
richard ciciarelli -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
okay, got it. that's helpful. and then, just around your capex program, you reiterated for 2020, but you had some commentary that the economic activity can potentially impact this. i'm just curious how you're thinking about the puts and takes there of that spending profile? and is that wildfire resiliency spending that you mentioned earlier included in this program? or is that not yet baked into your $405 million per year?
mark thies -- executive vice president, treasurer and chief financial officer
so, a couple of questions there, richie. on the -- with respect to -- we continue to monitor supply chain and those impacts, but we -- as we mentioned, we have seen some disruption, but not enough to make us believe that we won't be able to achieve our capital spending for 2020. and then, as we look at the wildfire resiliency plan, we are looking at it currently as if we will fit that into our $405 million of expected capital spend over the next years and we'll constantly reevaluate that. but at this point, we expect it to be part of that $405 million of spend.
richard ciciarelli -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
all right. got it. that's very helpful. thanks, guys. that's all i had.
mark thies -- executive vice president, treasurer and chief financial officer
thanks, richie.
operator
thank you. [operator instructions] our next question comes from sophie karp with keybanc. your line is open.
sophie karp -- keybanc -- analyst
hi. good morning, guys. how are you?
mark thies -- executive vice president, treasurer and chief financial officer
good morning, sophie.
dennis vermillion -- president and chief executive officer
good morning.
sophie karp -- keybanc -- analyst
a couple of questions from me. firstly, loss on equity investments. could you remind us what those are? and how should we think about that going forward?
mark thies -- executive vice president, treasurer and chief financial officer
the equity investments?
sophie karp -- keybanc -- analyst
yes.
mark thies -- executive vice president, treasurer and chief financial officer
our other businesses?
sophie karp -- keybanc -- analyst
yes, yes, exactly.
mark thies -- executive vice president, treasurer and chief financial officer
we have investments in a number of different small businesses that are really energy related. the largest amount of our other business investments really are two fund investments in energy impact partners and they invest in a lot of other businesses as well. so, we also have an investment in a restaurant and we own the steam plant, which is in downtown spokane, and a number of other small businesses that are legacy businesses that have valuations that -- the steam plant, that restaurant, is really at this point shut down. we anticipate the ability possibly to reopen in the future, but we don't know that for sure, we've put that off for now. so, we have just a number of equity investments.
and then, as we mentioned, as dennis mentioned in his remarks, the catalyst building and the morris center for innovation, those are also investments -- equity investments in different -- in two different buildings. again, here, located in spokane.
sophie karp -- keybanc -- analyst
got it. so, that's basically that mostly, i guess the restaurant and other covid impact of business that drove the devaluation in the second quarter?
mark thies -- executive vice president, treasurer and chief financial officer
no. the second quarter, we didn't really have as much of a change there. as the biggest impact to our other businesses during the first quarter.
sophie karp -- keybanc -- analyst
okay.
mark thies -- executive vice president, treasurer and chief financial officer
and energy impact partners did have some lower valuations. but again, it wasn't a significant...
sophie karp -- keybanc -- analyst
all right. and then, my second question is, i guess, when we think about future capex, right, and you mentioned that the sustained, i guess, economic distress might impact that. and i think we understand how those situations work out. is there -- my question is, is there a way to really frame this conversation with your regulators in a way where this is infrastructure work that can actually help jobs recovery? it's something that's happened in some other space, right, where the regulators actually want the utilities to propose some infrastructure work that may lift the unemployment rate. so, i was wondering if that maybe -- could be an opportunity for you as well to frame those conversations in this way to make sure that your capex program stays intact?
dennis vermillion -- president and chief executive officer
well, i think the way we position the capex program is it's important work to maintain the safety and reliability of our infrastructure and our systems to serve our customers. i mean, that's our main goal is to be able to serve our customers with the energy they need. and so, we have focused our discussions with our regulators as that's how we're spending our dollars, is we have to identify each of those projects when we go in for a rate case and say why this is important to provide benefits for our customers.
an ancillary benefit, yes, is that we do maintain employment for people. a number of those are our own employees and there are some contractors that also work on our construction as well. but we haven't really identified that as additional -- this is within our expected capital plan. it's not necessarily adding additional jobs. it's just not having more jobs reduce. so, i don't think we can pitch it necessarily as we're adding additional jobs. we're just protecting the jobs that we have and our contractors have by continuing to deploy this capital, which does benefit the economy and does benefit the service territory in which we live and serve.
sophie karp -- keybanc -- analyst
got it. all right. thank you. and appreciate your comments.
dennis vermillion -- president and chief executive officer
okay. thank you, sophie. operator, any other questions?
operator
thank you. and i'm currently showing no further questions at this time. i'd like to turn the call back over to john wilcox for closing remarks.

operator
ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the avista corporation third quarter 2020 earnings conference call. [operator instructions] please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [operator instructions]
i would now like to turn the call over to your speaker today, john wilcox, investor relations manager. thank you. please go ahead, sir.
john wilcox -- investor relations manager
good morning, everyone, and welcome to avista's third quarter 2020 earnings conference call. our earnings were released pre-market this morning and are available on our website. joining me this morning are avista corp president and ceo, dennis vermillion; executive vice president, cfo and treasurer, mark thies; senior vice president, external affairs and chief customer officer, kevin christie; and vice president controller and principal accounting officer, ryan krasselt. just want to let you know that analysts [phonetic] are remote due to the pandemic.
i would like to remind everyone that some of the statements that will be made today are forward-looking statements that involve assumptions, risks and uncertainties, which are subject to change. for reference to the various factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed in today's call, please refer to our 10-k for 2019 and 10-q for the third quarter of 2020 which are available on our website.
to begin this presentation, i would like to recap the financial results presented in today's press release. our consolidated earnings for the third quarter of 2020 were $0.07 per diluted share compared to $0.08 for the third quarter of 2019. for the year-to-date, consolidated earnings were $1.04 per diluted share for 2020 compared to $2.21 last year.
now, i'll turn the discussion over to dennis.
dennis vermillion -- president and chief executive officer
well, thanks, john and good morning, everyone. as we begin the ninth month of working through the covid-19 pandemic, we hope you're staying safe and healthy as we see the numbers of cases climb across our country. avista continues to support our customers and communities. recently, avista and the avista foundation approved another round of funding as community agencies experienced an increased need for services, which now boost our charitable giving their share to more than $2 million throughout the areas we serve. and with numerous communities throughout our region were devastated by the labor day windstorm, we partnered with community leaders to quickly galvanize resources to help those who were impacted.
today, we continue to look for ways to support affected communities as they work to repair the damage and rebuild. amidst the stress and the strain of these uncertain times, the safety of our customers, our employees and our communities continues to be our top priority and i continue to be amazed and inspired by our employees who work safely and diligently to provide the energy that is so essential to our customers.
despite these trying times, we continue to make significant progress across our business. in september, avista chairman, scott morris's vision to create the five smartest blocks in the world became a reality with the grand opening of the catalyst building and the adjacent morris center for energy innovation. these two new buildings are the latest examples of avista's rich history of innovation, a centralized plant located in the morris center will provide the energy to power both buildings through a shared energy model we call it eco-district. this type of innovation will be essential to achieve a clean reliable and affordable energy for all of us. also a majority of our washington smart meter project will be completed in the next few weeks. and this means our washington customers will have access to more timely information about their energy usage during the upcoming winter heating season.
last week, we filed general rate cases in washington. due to the challenges caused by the covid-19 pandemic, we have worked very hard to identify how we can move forward in a way that doesn't increase the cost to our customers at this time, while also acknowledging the financial investments we've made in infrastructure on our customers behalf. through the use of a tax credit to customers, our proposal would completely offset an immediate increase in electric and natural gas bills. i'm proud of our employees for finding an innovative solution to balancing the interests of our stakeholders.
with respect to results, our third quarter consolidated earnings were below our expectations, primarily due to higher bad debt expense for avista utilities. however, we anticipate being able to defer the additional bad debt expense through a covid-19 deferral in the fourth quarter. as such, we are confirming our 2020 consolidated earnings guidance in the range of $1.75 to $1.95 per diluted share.
and now, i'll turn this presentation over to mark.
mark thies -- executive vice president, treasurer, and chief financial officer
thanks, dennis. good morning, everyone. i always love to start out with my usual blackhawk comment and we got rid of two time stanley cup champion goalie, corey crawford, which is a sad day for me. craw was a great goaltender and really led us to a couple of championships. so we'll see how we do in this upcoming season. but with that, i'll start, talk about avista now, which is what you want to hear about. the third quarter of 2020, avista utilities contributed $0.08 per diluted share compared to $0.09 in the prior year. and compared to our third quarter, our earnings decreased due to higher operating expenses as dennis mentioned primarily related to bad debts and decreased loads resulting from covid-19. this was partially offset by higher utility margin due to lower power supply costs and rate relief in washington and oregon. in addition, we also had some customer growth, which helped out margins.
the energy recovery mechanism in washington was a slight pre-tax benefit in the third quarter of $0.3 million compared to an expense in the prior year of $2.4 million. for the year-to-date, we've recognized the benefit pre-tax of about $6 million compared to just over $1 million in 2019. with respect to the covid-19 impact on our results, we have recorded an incremental $8 million of bad debt expense year-to-date and we expect an additional $3.5 million for the full year as we compare to our original forecast.
in july, idaho issued an order that allows us to defer certain costs, net of any decreased costs and other benefits associated with covid. for the year-to-date, we deferred $2.5 million of that bad debt expense associated with the order. now with that, so the third quarter had we had orders in washington and oregon in the third quarter, we would have deferred an additional $0.06. we expect to defer that in the fourth quarter, as we do expect, we did get an order in oregon very late and we got it in october, and we do expect an order in washington to allow us the deferral of those costs. so that would have benefited the third quarter by $0.06 had those order has been in the third quarter.
compared to normal, our third quarter was a decrease of 2% on loads -- on electric loads which consisted of a 6% decrease in commercial as well as a 6% decrease in industrial, which was partially offset by a 5% increase in residential load, which is consistent with past quarters. we expect a gradual economic recovery, but prolonged unemployment that will depress load and customer growth into 2021. we do have decoupling mechanisms, which really mitigates the impact of changes in loads for revenues for residential and certain commercial customer classes, and over 90% of our utility revenues are covered by our regulatory mechanism.
during the third quarter, we continued to experience some supply chain delays due to the effects of the pandemic, with delays ranging from a couple of weeks to eight weeks in some cases. however, we do not expect to have a significant impact on any of our planned projects this year. with respect to that, we continue to be committed to investing the necessary capital in our utility infrastructure and expect to spend approximately $430 million, which was up from about $405 million in 2020 at avista utilities. this is primarily due to higher development of growth in our customer base.
as of september 30, we had $324 million of available liquidity under our credit facility. and during the third quarter, we issued $165 million of long-term debt and we expect to issue up to $70 million of equity in 2020 and that includes the $53 million we issued through september.
with respect to earnings guidance, as dennis mentioned earlier, we are confirming our 2020 earnings guidance with a consolidated range of $1.75 to $1.95 and we expect to be near the midpoint, including the benefit of the erm, which is a change we are including the benefit of the erm which offsets some additional costs we've incurred, as well as some lower margin we expect to incur relative to our forecast, primarily due to the pandemic, that's not covered by our decoupling mechanism. so, it'd be certain commercial customers and our industrial customer base.
we expect that the covid impact related to these operating expenses including bad debt will mostly be offset by tax benefits in the cares act, but the part that we don't, we're using the erm to cover. we have filed for deferred accounting treatment for our covid expenses, i mentioned each of our jurisdictions, and we anticipate being able to differ in washington and oregon in the fourth quarter. we continue to experience regulatory lag and we expect that to continue until 2023, which is consistent with what we've said in the past. in the general rate case in oregon, we filed that in march, we filed in washington, in oregon, we just filed that last week and we anticipate filing in idaho in the first quarter of 2021.
we are still expecting our long-term earnings growth after 2023 to be 4% to 6%. we expect avista utilities to contribute in the range of $1.77 to $1.89 per diluted share for 2020 including the erm, our current expectation is that the erm will be in a benefit position than a 90:10 [phonetic] sharing band, which is expected to add $0.06 per diluted share. the benefit of the erm is offsetting lower utility margin and higher operating costs.
our outlook for avista utilities assumes among other variables normal precipitation, temperatures and hydroelectric generation for the remainder of the year. at ael&p, we expect to contribute in the range of $0.07 to $0.11 per diluted share. and our outlook for ael&p assumes among other variables normal precipitation and hydroelectric generation for the remainder of the year. we expect our other businesses to have a loss from $0.09 to $0.05 per diluted share, and our guidance generally includes only normal operating conditions and does not include unusual items such as settlement transactions or acquisitions or dispositions until the effects are known and certain. we cannot fully predict the duration and severity of the covid-19 global pandemic. and the longer and more severe the economic restrictions and business disruption, the greater the impact on our operations and our results.
i will now turn the call back over to john.

[operator instructions] our first question comes from richard ciciarelli with bank of america. your line is open.
richard ciciarelli -- bank of america -- analyst
hey, good morning. hope you're all doing well today?
dennis vermillion -- president and chief executive officer
good morning, richy.
mark thies -- executive vice president, treasurer, and chief financial officer
hi, richy.
richard ciciarelli -- bank of america -- analyst
hi, first question just on the regulatory front in washington. you ultimately elected not to file the multi-year rate plan but seem to find a convenient solution with the tax credits. just curious of any initial feedback from stakeholders there in the state and any precedents for the accelerated flowback for customers on the tax credit side?
kevin christie -- senior vice president, external affairs and chief customer officer
good morning, richard, it's kevin christie, good to hear from you. the -- we talked in advance with our commissioners in washington and give them the heads up. but no, we haven't had any conversations with any of the parties, since we filed.
richard ciciarelli -- bank of america -- analyst
okay. got it. still early there...
mark thies -- executive vice president, treasurer, and chief financial officer
richard, with respect to the tax position, we did file also with our rate cases we filed petitions for a change in accounting, which we need approval from all of our commissions to change the accounting on certain of those tax strategies that we are -- we're completely able to do, but we will need their approval and that allows us to accelerate the flow back of those deferred tax items to the benefit of our customers.
richard ciciarelli -- bank of america -- analyst
okay, got it. thank you. that's helpful. and then just on the covid deferral docket in washington, i know the commission now was taking a more of a wait and see approach, but it sounds like you're confident you'll get something in 4q here. i guess what just gives you confidence in that fm?
kevin christie -- senior vice president, external affairs and chief customer officer
yeah, this is kevin again. we expect the commission to take action in meeting in november. and as we went through the process, the proceeding with third parties, we saw the commission take the steps to move forward with this first aspects and no pun intended deferred the deferral part of until a subsequent meeting. but everything we've seen in the process, and as we work with third parties, we would expect the commission to move forward with approval on that.
richard ciciarelli -- bank of america -- analyst
got it. that's helpful. and one more if i can just slip in. any update on the timing of the dnr investigation?
mark thies -- executive vice president, treasurer, and chief financial officer
no, we don't really have any update on that. dennis, anything?
dennis vermillion -- president and chief executive officer
no, we don't have any updates. it would be very difficult to speculate. so i think that would be a question-best asked of dnr.
richard ciciarelli -- bank of america -- analyst
all right, thanks a lot. that's all i had.
mark thies -- executive vice president, treasurer, and chief financial officer
thanks, richard.

hey, good morning, everyone. just to clarify on the midpoint of the guidance, it includes $0.08 for the erm and it also includes covid recovery of deferred bad debt of deferred costs in the fourth quarter, correct?
mark thies -- executive vice president, treasurer, and chief financial officer
we do expect to be able to cover to differ most of the bad debt, there is a calculation there it may not be 100% of it, but we do expect to differ most of it that we do expect to record in the fourth quarter, but the erm is only $0.06, brian as i mentioned earlier on the call, not $0.08.
brian russo -- sidoti -- analyst
okay. so the midpoint includes the $0.06 benefit from the erm and assumes covid -- most of the covid cost recovery on the bad debt in the fourth quarter?
mark thies -- executive vice president, treasurer, and chief financial officer
yes. well, we will report it, we don't -- we're deferring those costs, we don't necessarily get recovery until the commissions in each of our states rule that we can recovery, we're just allowed to defer it. so it's not an expense in our books that will reverse an expense we've already recorded, not to give you an accounting rule, but my controller here is not happy with me right now.
kevin christie -- senior vice president, external affairs and chief customer officer
yes. understood, thanks for the clarification. and then the wildfire plan costs that you're requesting deferral of in the recently filed washington rate case, is that o&m expense cost that would be incurred that you're looking to differ for recovery of later? or is that rate base or capex or rate base investment that you would seek to differ and recover a return of and on at a later date? just curious.
dennis vermillion -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, brian, i'll take the latter first. we're including about $2.6 million of capital for the first 10 months, i'm sorry, first nine months of 2021. and then its o&m for the tracker of balancing account that we are proposing in the filing. and in 2021 that's about $5.4 million. and i think of it as a balancing account mechanism. the idea here is that o&m increases, decreases, initially increases over time and then decreases levels out a bit. and of course, this is the biggest portion or has the biggest impact on our overall rate lager rate on our financial situation by moving the o&m if approved.
brian russo -- sidoti -- analyst
okay. right. so deferral of that helps your lag relative to historical levels?
dennis vermillion -- president and chief executive officer
yes, it would.
brian russo -- sidoti -- analyst
okay. and then just on the increasing capex in 2020 to $430 million out of this utilities, is that just one time, meaning it's just for 2020 or is that a step-up in the annual capex run rate of about $405 million?
mark thies -- executive vice president, treasurer, and chief financial officer
all right, at this point, we just -- were given the guidance on this year, we'll continue to look at it as if growth accelerates, we'll have to look at that if in the future. but in this year, we did see some higher cost associated with customer growth. so we added that in there. so right now we're not giving guidance for next year. we'll provide guidance for next year in february. and that will include our capital assumptions.
and brian, just to be clear on your question on the o&m related to wildfire when kevin mentioned the balancing account, that not as much historical lag as it is protecting future cost increases due to our wildfire resiliency plan and the costs associated with that. so we're attempting to differ those costs as opposed to recovering prior year's costs that would slow lag. what it does is it protect us from additional lag, but it may not reduce lag because it's really covering additional cost. just to clarify how that works or how we propose it to.
brian russo -- sidoti -- analyst
okay, got it. and then just on that. the wildfire plan you're referring to was that $200 million, i think $70 million of 10-year proposal filed with the commission several months ago, that is still pending review the two quarterly...
dennis vermillion -- president and chief executive officer
to be clear there, brian, we filed with idaho for idaho's portion previously, and now we're including the washington portion here.
brian russo -- sidoti -- analyst
got it. understood. thank you very much.
mark thies -- executive vice president, treasurer, and chief financial officer
thanks, brian.
operator
thank you. [operator instructions] our next question comes from sophie karp with keybanc. your line is open.
mark thies -- executive vice president, treasurer, and chief financial officer
good morning, sophie.
sophie karp -- keybanc -- analyst
hi, good morning, guys.
dennis vermillion -- president and chief executive officer
hi, sophie.
sophie karp -- keybanc -- analyst
how are you?
mark thies -- executive vice president, treasurer, and chief financial officer
good.
sophie karp -- keybanc -- analyst
yeah, thanks. just wanted to really just quickly that's based on the balance sheet rate would be -- we're just looking at the rate cases that you have in process or planning to file. it looks like you did in earnings, but not necessarily cash flow in, how are you thinking about balancing impact of that and is that a concern? thank you.
mark thies -- executive vice president, treasurer, and chief financial officer
so what we looked at is given what's going on, we were -- as dennis mentioned earlier in the call, we are looking at ways we know that we need to get recovery of the cost and the capital that we're spending to serve our customers, but we also recognize that significant increases when customers are hurting right now due to employment and economic difficulties associated with the pandemic. it was kind of a two battles against each other. so we tried to find a way to offset the balance in the near term and we were able to do that by taking a change in our tax position and we filed for these accounting changes to allow us to offset in the near term the impacts to the customers, while still being able to maintain the ability to earn our return on the capital that we've deployed to benefit our customers.
so we think that's creative, it does cost us some drag in the near term on our cash flow. but we believe that our financial strength is still strong enough that we'll be able to maintain our credit ratings and benefit our customers in the near term. and then presumably things will get better in the years to come and that will all even out. but that was our strategy and we think it makes sense to balance the -- getting the return for our shareholders while protecting our customers' bills.
sophie karp -- keybanc -- analyst
thank you. that's all from me.
mark thies -- executive vice president, treasurer, and chief financial officer
thanks, sophie.

operator
ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the avista corporation fourth quarter 2020 earnings conference call. [operator instructions] as a reminder, today's program is being recorded. [operator instructions]
i'd now like to introduce your host for today's program, mr. john wilcox, investor relations manager. please go ahead, sir.
john wilcox -- investor relations manager
good morning, everyone, and welcome to avista's fourth quarter and fiscal year 2020 earnings conference call. our earnings and our 2020 form 10-k were released pre-market this morning and are both available on our website. joining me this morning are avista corp. president and ceo, dennis vermillion; executive vice president, treasurer and cfo, mark thies; senior vice president, external affairs and chief customer officer, kevin christie; and vice president, controller and principal accounting officer, ryan krasselt.
i would like to remind everyone that some of the statements that will be made today are forward-looking statements that involve assumptions, risks, and uncertainties which are subject to change. for reference to the various factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed in today's call, please refer to our 10-k for 2020, which is available on our website. to begin this presentation, i would like to recap the financial results presented in today's press release. our consolidated earnings for the fourth quarter of 2020 were $0.85 per diluted share, compared to $0.76 for the fourth quarter of 2019. for the full year, consolidated earnings were $1.90 per diluted share for 2020 compared to $2.97 last year.
now, i'll turn the discussion over to dennis.
dennis vermillion -- president and chief executive officer
well, thanks, john and good morning, everyone. as we begin 2021 continuing to work through the covid pandemic, we hope you're staying safe and healthy. looking back on the last year, i'm just so proud of our employees for navigating the challenges presented by the pandemic, continuing to provide energy like they always do to our customers and progressing our business plans forward. i would like to thank all of our employees for their dedication and determination throughout the last year. we continue to help those who are struggling and most in need in our communities. in 2020, avista and the avista foundation provided more than $4 million in charitable giving to support the increased need for services that community agencies are still experiencing throughout the areas we serve.
financially, our earnings for 2020 were better than expectations, and mark will provide further details here in just a few minutes. operationally, we finished installing nearly all of our smart meters, electric smart meters and natural gas modules across washington in one of the largest projects in our history. the deployment of this infrastructure will provide customers with more real-time data, so they can better manage their energy use. the technology enables us to proactively push high energy alerts to notify customers, if they could exceed their preset energy budgets, which of course, helps eliminate surprises when their bill arrives at the end of the month.
beyond generating bills, we're using the data from smart meters to run a more reliable and efficient power grid and to deliver a higher level of service for our customers. for example, we now have more visibility into our system, which allows us to detect and restore power outages more quickly. we also made strides to meeting our clean energy goals, as the rattlesnake flat wind farm went online last december. during its construction the project created clean energy jobs for our local communities and now that it's completed the project's 20 -- project's 57 wind turbines excuse me will provide 50 average megawatts of clean renewable energy for our customers at an affordable price. that's enough energy to power 38,000 homes for years to come.
as wildfires continue to have an impact on our region we implemented a new comprehensive 10-year wildfire resiliency plan that aims to improve defense strategies and operating practices for a more resilient system. we expect to invest about $330 million implementing the components of this plan over the life of the plan, which as i said was 10 years. we were proud to announce yesterday that avista has been recognized again as one of the 2021 world's most ethical companies by ethisphere, a global leader in defining and advancing the standards of ethical business practices. this marks the second year in a row that avista has achieved this distinction. we are only one of nine honorees recognized in the energy and utilities industry based on their assessment.
in 2021, 135 honorees in total were recognized spanning 22 countries and 47 industries. we are honored to receive this recognition because it acknowledges our belief that integrating corporate responsibility into our business builds trust, forges lasting relationships, strengthens morale, reduces risk and delivers enhanced value to our shareholders and ultimately enables us to more effectively deliver on our vision to provide better energy for life. in january, we published avista's 2021 corporate responsibility report on our avistacorp.com website and i urge you to check it out when you have some time. this content provides a broad look at our operations and how we're fulfilling our commitments to our people, our customers, our communities and our shareholders.
the website also provides links to avista's reporting on a series of industry and financial esg disclosures. the updated content supports avista's long-standing commitment to corporate responsibility and sharing this information with our stakeholders. switching gears with respect to regulatory filings, in january we filed two-year general rate cases in idaho. and as you know in 2020 we filed general rate cases in washington. and we continue to work through the regulatory processes in both of these jurisdictions. we take our responsibility to provide safe, reliable energy at an affordable price very seriously.
and we work hard to make prudent financial investments in our infrastructure, manage our costs and identify ways to best serve our customers that contribute to keeping energy prices low. for example, our proposed tax customer credit would completely offset an immediate increase in electric and natural gas bills for our washington customers. in oregon new rates went into effect on january 16 of this year and we expect to file another rate case in the second half of 2021 in oregon. looking ahead, we remain focused on running a great utility and continue to invest prudent capital to maintain and update our infrastructure and provide reliable energy service to our customers.
we are initiating our 2021, 2022 and 2023 earnings guidance with consolidated ranges of a $1.96 to $2.16 per diluted share for 2021, $2.18 to $2.38 in 2022 and $2.42 to $2.62 per diluted share for 2023. this puts us on track to earning our allowed return by 2023. lastly, earlier this month the board increased our dividend by 4.3% to an annual dividend of $1.69 per share and a dividend increase approved by the board marks the 19 consecutive year the board has raised the dividend for our shareholders, and i believe it demonstrates the board's commitment to maximizing shareholder value.
at this time, i'll turn this presentation over to mark.
mark thies -- executive vice president, treasurer, and chief financial officer
thank you, dennis, and good morning, everyone. we had low expectations coming into this year. no, not the company, the blackhawks and the blackhawks have really started off pretty good after a slow first four games. we've had five rookies score their first goals ever in the nhl, so pretty exciting times for all you hockey fans out there. for the company in the fourth quarter, avista utilities contributed $0.81 per diluted share compared to $0.67 last year. our earnings increased primarily due to higher utility margin and customer growth. also in the fourth quarter, the oregon and washington commissions joined the idaho commission to allow for the deferral of certain covid-19 related expenses for future -- possible future recovery.
additionally, avista utilities earnings were better than expectations due to higher utility margin and lower income taxes, which were partially offset by higher operating expenses. with respect to covid-19, as i mentioned earlier, we have now received accounting orders in each of our jurisdictions to defer the costs and benefits associated with covid-19. and those will be addressed in future proceedings with each of those commissions. we expect a gradual economic recovery that will still have some depressed load and customer growth in '21. we expect that to start improving in the second half of '21, our economy. we do have decoupling and other regulatory mechanisms, which mitigate the impacts of changes in load for our residential and certain commercial customers. over 90% of our revenue, as you recall, is covered by regulatory mechanisms.
as dennis mentioned, we continue to be committed to investing the necessary capital in our utility infrastructure. we expect our capital expenditures in 2021 to be about $415 million and at ael&p we expect about $7 million and about $15 million in our other businesses. with respect to our liquidity, as of december 31, we have $270 million of available liquidity under our committed credit line at avista utilities and in 2020 we issued about $72 million in stock in 2020. in '21 we expect to issue about $75 million of equity or stock and up to $120 million of long-term debt. as dennis mentioned, we are initiating guidance not only for 2021 but also for 2022 and 2023.
and as we mentioned those ranges, this is to get us back to earning our allowed return by 2023 and our guidance does assume timely and appropriate rate relief in each of our jurisdictions relative to the capital expenses that we have going forward. we experienced regulatory lag during '20 and expect this to continue through the end of '22 due to our continued investment in infrastructure and our delayed filings. we again delayed last year as we talked about with the pandemic in washington and idaho. dennis mentioned those earlier. we expect our cases in washington and idaho along with new rates to provide some relief in 2021 and begin reducing that regulatory lag. going forward we'll strive to continue to reduce debt and closely align our returns to those authorized by '23. after '23 we expect to grow at 4% to 6% our earnings.
our '21 guidance reflects unrecovered structural cost estimated to reduce the return on equity by approximately 70 basis points and in addition our timing lag, which is what we're trying to reduce with rate cases has reduced it by about 100 basis points. this results in expected return on equity for avista utilities of approximately 7.7% in 2021. we are forecasting operating cost growth of about 3% and customer growth of about 1% annually, which has slightly improved from prior numbers on the customer growth side. for 2021 we expect avista utilities to contribute in the range of a $1.93 to $2.07 per diluted share and the midpoint of our guidance does not include any expense or benefit under the erm. our current expectation for the erm is in the benefit position within the 75% customer, 25% company sharing band which is expected to add $0.05 per diluted share.
for 2021 we expect ael&p to contribute in the range of $0.08 to $0.11 per diluted share and our outlook for both avista utilities and ael&p assumes among other variables, normal precipitation and hydroelectric generation for the year. we expect a loss between $0.05 and $0.02 per diluted share for our other businesses as we continue to develop opportunities for the future. we'll spend a little bit of money in the next couple of years to continue to get those earnings up over the course of the next five years and we look forward to those opportunities. they're both in our service territory and in funds. our guidance generally includes only normal operating conditions and does not include any unusual or non-recurring items until the effects are known and certain.
so, i'll now turn the call back to john.
john wilcox -- investor relations manager
and now we would like to open up this call for questions.
",":
operator
certainly. [operator instructions] our first question comes from the line of richard ciciarelli from bank of america. your question, please?
richard ciciarelli -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
hey, good morning. thanks for taking my question.
mark thies -- executive vice president, treasurer, and chief financial officer
good morning, richie.
dennis vermillion -- president and chief executive officer
good morning.
richard ciciarelli -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
yeah, just the first one, can you speak to the progress in your rate case filings in washington and idaho? and i guess what percentage of the revenue requirement ask are you assuming to get to the midpoint of your 2021 guidance range?
kevin christie -- senior vice president, external affairs and chief customer officer
hey, richie. it's kevin christie. how are you?
richard ciciarelli -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
doing well, thanks.
kevin christie -- senior vice president, external affairs and chief customer officer
as far as the rate case progress goes, we're really just under way in both cases in idaho. the most recently filed case we have not established or have not seen the procedural schedule yet. that should happen in the next few weeks. the procedural schedule has been established in washington and we've been going through the discovery process thus far. we have our first settlement conversation coming up on march 10. as far as your latter question goes what we typically see is constructive outcomes from a regulatory get versus ask perspective, is in that 55% to 65% range and again we think we've spent prudent capital and would expect fair recovery from the regulators as we move forward.
richard ciciarelli -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
got it. that's very helpful. thanks for the color there. and i guess just in terms of your forward-looking outlook for '22 and '23, your capex was relatively unchanged. obviously two rate cases now that sound like you're kind of in the early stages. i guess what gives you the confidence that you'll be able to earn closer to your allowed roes throughout the company? and how you plan on executing to kind of get there? does that embed any multi-year rate plans or anything like that within the outlook?
kevin christie -- senior vice president, external affairs and chief customer officer
well, so a couple of things on that. it does -- we do need to get fair results or reasonable results in our commissions from our filings. but we also believe that we filed appropriate cases. we've got prudent capital we spent for our customers and our costs are prudent as we go to serve our customers. we're catching up on timing lag. so we believe that we'll be able to catch up incrementally in the next couple years not all at once. we think that'll take a couple of years. we did file a multi-year case in idaho. we have a two-year case in idaho right now.
and we would look -- as we go forward, we'll go through. we looked at it for washington but felt with everything going on with the pandemic and certain large projects as dennis mentioned, the ami project, one of our largest projects in history is going into this case. we didn't feel a multi-year made sense. so we filed the single year. we can file multi-year in the future and that can get us to where we need to be. and that's really what our plan is, is to put forward an appropriate case reviewed by the staff and the parties. but we believe we can get back to earning our allowed return.
richard ciciarelli -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
got it. no, that makes sense. and then you're talking about still the structural lag there of roughly 70 bps.
kevin christie -- senior vice president, external affairs and chief customer officer
that's -- yeah, we expect that. we've had that for a long time and we just point that out. so yes, we expect that to be the case.
richard ciciarelli -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
got it. sorry, sorry go ahead.
dennis vermillion -- president and chief executive officer
going forward we're working with the other parties that we typically work with in washington along with the commission and the other utilities and there is a piece of legislation that's sitting in the senate right now that's intended to help guide and actually require multi-year rate plans of at least two years and up to four years. and with that, if that were to move forward, we feel like it's a really constructive piece of legislation that would allow us to have that multi-year rate plan option, i'm sorry, requirement, and it would help us get the first year right and the transitions from year-to-year right as well. so that would be something we look toward the future after this particular case in washington.
richard ciciarelli -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
yeah, absolutely that would be helpful. okay, cool, and then just the last one i had here was i think -- in your press release you mentioned looking at strategic opportunities in 2021. can you just describe what specifically you're looking at? you mentioned some increased costs there as well, just curious what the [indecipherable].
mark thies -- executive vice president, treasurer, and chief financial officer
it's a nominal increase to cost to richie. it's a nominal increase to cost. but we're looking -- some of that's just in the university district within spokane. we continue to grow out our five smartest blocks in the eco-district [phonetic]. we're spending some dollars there. we're looking at a pilot on some opportunities and some regional communities that we think could have some opportunities for us and we're also spending money in a couple of different funds that we've had consistent dollars in. so, we expect those -- they're nominal at this point from a cost perspective, but we think they have opportunities as we go forward and they really go toward the innovative aspect of our company. we have a history of innovation and so we spend those dollars because there are opportunities to help in the market.
richard ciciarelli -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
okay. this is all in the other businesses, not the utilities, just.
mark thies -- executive vice president, treasurer, and chief financial officer
correct.
richard ciciarelli -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
okay. thank you. that's all i have.
mark thies -- executive vice president, treasurer, and chief financial officer
it's within our service territory, but it is outside of the utility business.
richard ciciarelli -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
all right. great. thanks for all the time. that's all i have.
mark thies -- executive vice president, treasurer, and chief financial officer
thanks, richie.
operator
thank you. [operator instructions] our next question comes from the line of brian russo from sidoti. your question, please?
brian russo -- sidoti & company -- analyst
hi. good morning.
dennis vermillion -- president and chief executive officer
good morning, brian.
mark thies -- executive vice president, treasurer, and chief financial officer
good morning.
brian russo -- sidoti & company -- analyst
hey, you mentioned in an upcoming washington irp in 2021; is that second half or fourth quarter?
dennis vermillion -- president and chief executive officer
i believe that's april. we'll have to check on that. we filed in idaho last year with a progress report in washington, but to line up the sequencing with the new clean energy transformation act in washington -- that's why we did the progress report. i believe it's -- we can double check that but i believe it's here just in a couple of months.
brian russo -- sidoti & company -- analyst
yeah. okay. i was just curious what can we expect from that -- pursuit of more ppas when colstrip is retired and the lancaster ppa expires i believe in 2025 or will there be any self-build scenarios in any competitive rfp going forward?
dennis vermillion -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. i mean you're right. obviously, with colstrip, we'll be leaving our portfolio in 2025 and then lancaster the year later. so we will be in acquisition mode. we actually have an rfp for renewables out right now. and what we would expect to do -- expect to acquire and this is based on the irp that we filed in 2020. i don't expect it to be a whole lot different in 2021, but it'll be a combination of generation plant upgrades, additional clean energy, renewables and storage, energy efficiency and demand response. so the way we would do this, ultimately we want to meet our customers' needs in the most cost effective way on a risk-adjusted basis and reliability will be an essential designed element of whatever we choose. but it would be a competitive process. whether or not we have self-build options that make the cut or not we'll just have to wait and see when we get there. but ultimately the objective is lowest cost risk-adjusted basis to our customers.
brian russo -- sidoti & company -- analyst
okay. and is the wildfire investment 10-year plan, is that included in this rate case or is that a separate docket to be approved?
mark thies -- executive vice president, treasurer, and chief financial officer
the wildfire, kevin you want to talk about that? is it included in this case or is it a separate docket?
kevin christie -- senior vice president, external affairs and chief customer officer
yeah. let me go through both states. in idaho it was its own docket, it's been filed, approved and it allows for a deferral mechanism that includes expense, depreciation and capital. in washington we filed it with under a separate docket though with the latest grc in washington and it was consolidated with our grc. so that will play out over the length of those 11 months or we would expect that to be the case. and then what that includes is for 2021 deferral of o&m and then going forward post effective -- rate effective period for the rate case of october 1 that would include both expense and capital.
brian russo -- sidoti & company -- analyst
okay, great.
dennis vermillion -- president and chief executive officer
brian we just checked and the irp, the next irp in washington will be filed in april of this year. so i was right on that.
brian russo -- sidoti & company -- analyst
okay, great. and it looks like last year you issued $72 million of equity. i think you're planning approximately $75 million in 2021. could you just talk about the balance sheet capacity relative to your capex and then the unique structure of this rate proposal with the tax credits that may pressure cash flows in the near-term? just wondering what your target ffo-to-debt or debt-to-cap structure for rating, credit rating purposes is?
mark thies -- executive vice president, treasurer, and chief financial officer
well again, our target is to maintain our current ratings. so we looked at that tax customer credit and looked at the impacts to our ffo and believe that we should be able to maintain our current credit ratings. it's just a short term. it's an interim rate relief. it's not -- the rate relief is for a year up to two years depending on where we end up in each of those cases. but we then return to normal cash flows after that. so we don't believe we should have -- we might have a slight degradation in the current year post effective so it'd be 2022 would be more where that would hit.
but we don't believe that should change our ratings because we get right back quickly to having a normal cash flow from that. so we don't expect our ratings to be off. and we continue to raise the capital, the equity and the debt that we do to maintain a -- to fund our capital expenditures, but the result is maintaining a prudent capital structure for regulatory purposes. so that's -- we believe that we we'll have that. now, we'll have to walk the rating agencies through that and go through that process as we normally do. but we've had a look at it and we've had an outside review of that as well and we believe it shouldn't change our ratings.
brian russo -- sidoti & company -- analyst
okay, got it. and then you mentioned some legislation pending in the senate and washington allows for multi-year rate cases, etc. how does that triangulate with the clean energy transformation act that authorizes to commission a variety of tools in terms of up to 48 months of using the useful plant -- earn a return on ppas, etc? is that something additional or does that take the place of ceta, just want to clarify?
dennis vermillion -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, good question brian. it's in addition to -- ceta still exists as we know it and all the facts and figures we've shared before apply. this just adds additional clarity to the commission's ability and focus on a multi-year. it's efficient to in the fact that many of the utilities are filing rate cases year-after-year and this helps the commission get to a point where utilities are somewhat staggered where there are cases because of the multi-year aspect. and it also provides clarity as far as what's included in gaining that first year right and that transitions from year-to-year as well in. the utility has the option to file between two and four years if this legislation were to move forward. and again, that would give the commission the ability to make a determination based on those filings.
brian russo -- sidoti & company -- analyst
okay. and i suppose the expectation is for that legislation to be passed or not in this legislative session when this legislation session end.
dennis vermillion -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. that's correct. it might come out of the house -- i'm sorry, the senate this week and then it would move over to the house and then they would go through the normal process that transpires in washington. so, it should be by the end of the session if not before, if it moves through.
brian russo -- sidoti & company -- analyst
okay. and just to follow up on an earlier question; is the expectation that you will file a second washington rate case to include either what's in ceta or what's in this legislation for new rates to close that regulatory gap beginning in 2023 or with a constructive rate case outcome in the pending case that gets you there.
dennis vermillion -- president and chief executive officer
we'll need to file -- we'll likely file in the first part of next year and if this legislation moves forward and even if it doesn't, we may still move forward with a multi-year and that would include all the capital that's being spent now, that's not yet in -- it is not in the current case.
brian russo -- sidoti & company -- analyst
okay, got it. and just.
mark thies -- executive vice president, treasurer, and chief financial officer
brian because idaho, our filing, it's a two-year case.
brian russo -- sidoti & company -- analyst
yes. correct. just the multi-year guidance and the losses you're incurring in the other businesses this year, is there an expectation for the losses to reverse and start generating positive earnings and/or monetizing some of the investments through the multi-year guidance period?
mark thies -- executive vice president, treasurer, and chief financial officer
well, in the multi-year we didn't breakout our guidance, and i'm not going to breakout right now between avista utilities, ael&p and other for '22 and '23. we gave consolidated guidance but we have said in the past and we stand by that, that's why we're making the investments we're making is, that we expect, we started i think in 2019 to say that in three to five years, we expect to start making earnings out of that, $0.05 to $0.10 of earnings and we still believe that we're going to do that. so probably by the '23-'24 timeframe, we're looking to have earnings in those other businesses. and when we come out with specific guidance on that, we will put that in there, but we do have that expectation and that's why we continue to invest dollars in those areas.
brian russo -- sidoti & company -- analyst
right. i get it. so the way to think about it is the $15 million you are investing this year. the expectation is you'll earn some sort of return on that $15 million over the next several years.
mark thies -- executive vice president, treasurer, and chief financial officer
well, some of them are new businesses like -- as we're investing in the university district, some of those may not make a return for several years but come in after that and others may make returns sooner than that. it's not -- you're not buying a bond or you're going get a return every year on it. these are start-up investments and they take some time. some are quicker than others. and we've seen earnings come out of the fund investments that we've made already and turnaround pretty quickly and we've seen others that will be longer term. so it's a balance there, brian, it'll just take some time. i don't have specifics for you on that. when we come out with our guidance in those forward years we'll lay out -- but we do expect as you're looking at it by '23 or '24 to start generating earnings from those businesses.
brian russo -- sidoti & company -- analyst
okay. and then once again, you're expecting to be in the 75% to 25% sharing on the erm, which i think you've been -- benefit for every year for the last four or five years at least. what's driving that erm this year relative to last year? is it just -- and then that would be a segue into a second question on, which current outlook on hydro -- given the weather patterns that we've seen in the pacific northwest and what's expected over the next couple of weeks or months?
dennis vermillion -- president and chief executive officer
yeah brian, this is dennis. i think the things that have been driving the erm over the last several years have been a combination of a couple of things. one is just lower gas prices right, in general from what we've seen before and then also our team's ability to optimize or manage our resources efficiently. and so it's a combination of those things continuing that i think put us in a real good position to be in the benefit in the erm for this year. so obviously, future looking if we saw a dramatic run up in natural gas prices things might change on that. but as long as gas stays where it is we're sitting pretty good. and then your second question?
mark thies -- executive vice president, treasurer, and chief financial officer
hydro.
dennis vermillion -- president and chief executive officer
hydro, here we are -- its mid -- almost the end of february. so we still have a couple months really left of snow build opportunity in the mountains. right now we're just expecting on a forward look normal. and then as it sits today, the northwest river forecast center runoff or water supply runoff forecast for april through september is basically average for us or a 100% up to -- rough plus or minus just a little bit based on the different basins, but generally speaking we're expecting normal conditions -- normal hydro at this point in time, going forward, for this year.
mark thies -- executive vice president, treasurer, and chief financial officer
and remember brian, the importance of temperatures and how quickly it melts, that's always -- we may have snow in the mountains. if it melts really fast, that's bad. if it's a long cold spring and it melts off slowly, that's really good anywhere in between like dennis said, we expect normal because we have good snowpack but there is -- you do have to also see how that comes off.
brian russo -- sidoti & company -- analyst
right, of course, you want average temperatures in that april and.
mark thies -- executive vice president, treasurer, and chief financial officer
and that's what we assume in our expectations.
brian russo -- sidoti & company -- analyst
and that's what you're seeing today in the marketplace.
mark thies -- executive vice president, treasurer, and chief financial officer
yes.
dennis vermillion -- president and chief executive officer
yes.
brian russo -- sidoti & company -- analyst
yeah, ok. and then just lastly just -- curious, interest rates have been rising lately and there's concerns with inflationary pressures. how does it impact number one, maybe the timing of your 2021 financing plans on the debt side and then that that 3% o&m expense growth that you mentioned earlier as part of the 2021 assumptions. just curious what your thoughts are there?
mark thies -- executive vice president, treasurer, and chief financial officer
well, with respect to the o&m growth we continue to always look at trying to manage our costs. we put a number out there and then -- can we try to come in, inside of that. we work to that to the extent we can but we wanted to put our expectations as where we are because we've seen some higher costs, in insurance costs and pension costs and other costs have gone up and then we need to continue to work to manage those but that's our assumption and we want to put that. with respect to interest rates yes, they have come up some but not -- they haven't changed significantly and we're looking at doing 30 year debt and we've hedged some of that. i don't -- we're not trying to time the market over the last amount. the fed chair is just testifying in front of congress yesterday and today. and we expect him to continue to say that we expect to keep rates low. so i'm not -- we're not moving -- we're continuing to monitor that and if it makes sense we'll look at doing our debt a little bit earlier. but right now we don't think that makes sense. and we would expect to come out like we always have and do it in the second half of the year.
brian russo -- sidoti & company -- analyst
okay, great. thank you very much.
mark thies -- executive vice president, treasurer, and chief financial officer
thanks, brian.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of to mind of chris ellinghaus from siebert williams. your question, please? chris, you might have your phone on mute.
dennis vermillion -- president and chief executive officer
chris, are you there?
chris ellinghaus -- siebert williams shank & co. -- analyst
sorry. my bad. how are you? good morning.
dennis vermillion -- president and chief executive officer
we're not even in video chris, we couldn't tell you you're on mute.
chris ellinghaus -- siebert williams shank & co. -- analyst
yeah. well, i make a lot of mistakes. the $75 million kind of run rate you've been at on equity. can we assume that that's what you've got built in through this sort of guidance period?
mark thies -- executive vice president, treasurer, and chief financial officer
we've had a history of issuing at that level and we're not changing our capex. the only changes will be cash flow.
chris ellinghaus -- siebert williams shank & co. -- analyst
okay.
mark thies -- executive vice president, treasurer, and chief financial officer
so we don't give guidance forward with that. but that's been our historical expectations for issuing.
chris ellinghaus -- siebert williams shank & co. -- analyst
okay. you didn't say anything about the dividend payout. can you just address that?
mark thies -- executive vice president, treasurer, and chief financial officer
well, our dividend payout has been the same since we started the -- having some lag. we've said we were going to continue our dividend and we will get to -- our stated guidance is to get to 65% to 75%. but we won't get there till we're back to earning our allowed return. so we'll run a little high right now and we'll have our earnings growth. as you see the guidance ranges, the growth is greater than the dividend increase, which was 4% to 5% on the dividend. as dennis mentioned, the 4.3% i think it was. and so the earnings growth is greater than that, which will get us back in line with our stated 65% to 75% payout ratio as we get to earning our allowed return.
chris ellinghaus -- siebert williams shank & co. -- analyst
sure. what was the increase in bad debt expense last year?
mark thies -- executive vice president, treasurer, and chief financial officer
i want to say $6 million or $7 million.
chris ellinghaus -- siebert williams shank & co. -- analyst
okay. and you did mention that you're expecting the pandemic to continue to be a drag through the first half of the year. can you give us any color on what you think that looks like for this year?
mark thies -- executive vice president, treasurer, and chief financial officer
i'll just say the color is it's included in our forecast. i mean it's really, you're going to see some load expectations as we've seen it but we're decoupled largely as i mentioned in my earlier comments. so there's -- un-decoupled load is an impact. and then to the extent that bad debts are there but we have deferral mechanisms as we mentioned in each of our jurisdictions to be able to defer that and then go after recovery through a future proceeding. now, if that proceeding comes up differently, we'll have to address it. but we -- our expectation is those are costs that we should recover through those future proceedings.
chris ellinghaus -- siebert williams shank & co. -- analyst
so with the deferrals and with the decoupling you're basically not expecting it to be terribly big?
mark thies -- executive vice president, treasurer, and chief financial officer
that's our expectation and it's included in our guidance.
chris ellinghaus -- siebert williams shank & co. -- analyst
all right. one last thing, dennis, can you give us your thoughts on the electrification bill in washington?
dennis vermillion -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. yeah. good question, chris. first of all, i guess what i would say is we support reducing emissions and obviously with what we're doing on the electric side of things we're doing that and making good progress, but we need to do it in a manner that minimizes the cost burdens on our customers and avoids or protects i guess i would say the word reliability of the regional energy systems. and just i think we need to be doing it in a holistic fashion to minimize the unintended consequences. so, having said all that, the bill doesn't really fully consider all these broad impacts.
now, i am happy to say that we have been working with our fellow utilities in the northwest -- or in washington state and other stakeholders in really trying to educate legislators as to the serious concerns that we have with the bill and the serious impacts that we believe the bill would have on our customers and the energy system. so, i'm pleased to report that our efforts have led to defeat of the bill early in their legislative session. so, that's good. so, it's basically done for this year. however, obviously, we can expect that some components of it or the bill will come back at some point in time in the future and we just need to continue to educate legislators as to what our point of view is and that is again we believe strongly that natural gas plays an important role as we de-carbonize our energy system.
and i'm not saying that to give natural gas a pass. we're working on plans for renewable natural gas. we're experimenting with other technologies or we're investigating other technologies. and energy efficiency is an important component to that as well. so we're going to do our part on the gas side as well, but we just are really concerned with the effects of electrification not only what it would on the -- for our customers from an affordability perspective but what the implications are on our electric system. our studies have shown that it would require a doubling of electric infrastructure including generation to meet the increased needs from an full electrification in our system and there's obviously reliability and cost impacts associated with that that are concerning. so that's kind of where we sit on this right now and what we're going to do is spend the next -- we'll continue to work on educating stakeholders as to why gas makes sense going forward. does that help?
chris ellinghaus -- siebert williams shank & co. -- analyst
yeah, that's helpful. thanks. i appreciate the color. be safe

2021-Q1,AVA,2021-05-05 10:30:00,"prepared remarks:
operator
good morning, my name is kree, and i will be your conference operator today. at this time, i would like to welcome everyone to the avista corporation q1 2021 earnings conference call. [operator instructions] after the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session.
[operator instructions] as a reminder, today's conference is being recorded.
i would now like to turn the conference over to mr. john wilcox. sir, you may begin.
john wilcox -- investor relations manager
thank you. good morning, everyone. and welcome to avista's first quarter 2021 earnings conference call. our earnings were released pre-market this morning and are available on our website.
joining me this morning are avista corp. president and ceo, dennis vermillion; executive vice president, treasurer and cfo, mark thies; senior vice president, external affairs and chief customer officer, kevin christie; and vice president, controller and principal accounting officer, ryan krasselt. i would like to remind everyone that some of the statements that will be made today are forward-looking statements that involve assumptions, risks, and uncertainties, which are subject to change. for reference to the various factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed in today's call, please refer to our 10-k for 2020 and our 10-q for the first quarter of 2021, which are available on our website.
to begin this presentation, i would like to recap the financial results presented in today's press release. our consolidated earnings for the first quarter of 2021 were $0.98 per diluted share compared to $0.72 for the first quarter of 2020.
now, i'll turn the discussion over to dennis.
dennis vermillion -- president and chief executive officer
well, thanks, john, and good morning, everyone. i'd like to begin my remarks this morning by acknowledging that after managing through the impacts of covid-19 for more than a year now, we're encouraged to see some light at the end of the tunnel as more people are vaccinated against the virus and the economy shows signs of recovery. yet we know it could still be a while before we're able to return to the offices or settle into any type of new normal.
in the meantime, we'll continue to provide care and compassion for those who are struggling to make ends meet through energy assistance programs, through payment arrangements, and even covid-19 debt relief grants. i am extremely proud of our employees, despite these unique times, they have adapted easily and continue to move our business forward on all fronts.
the quarterly results, we are sharing with you today demonstrate their drive and determination to get the job done. recently, we've taken steps to move us toward a clean energy future. a few weeks ago, we announced our aspirational goal to reduce our carbon emissions for natural gas by setting new natural gas goal of being carbon-neutral by 2045, with a near-term goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 30% by 2030.
our strategy to achieve lower emissions includes investing in new technologies like renewable gas, rng, which is rng hydrogen or other renewable biofuels. we're evaluating how to best integrate rng into our gas supply portfolio and researching hydrogen as another renewable fuel. we will also focus on reducing consumption through conservation and energy efficiency and improving our infrastructure.
we realize this is a heavy lift. there are several critical pieces that will need to fall into place in the coming years. technology costs must come down, new innovations need to occur, and regulatory support will be necessary for us to achieve these goals. as we identify our strategies keeping costs affordable will be a priority. we're committed to executing on this goal in ways that support affordability and reliability for our customers.
our natural gas goal demonstrates that our vision of a clean energy future income consists both electric and natural gas resources. and then we are dedicated to reducing greenhouse gases from the energy we deliver to our customers. we're also moving the dial toward achieving our clean electricity goal of providing customers with carbon-neutral electricity by the end of 2027, and carbon-free electricity by 2045.
last month, we entered into a contract with the chelan county public utility district that will add more renewable hydropower to our electric generation portfolio. the contract delivers on the strategies included in the 2021 electric integrated resource plan that we filed recently and also supports the goals of washington state's clean energy transformation act or ceta.
in regards to our quarterly results, we're off to a good start in 2021, and we are on track to meet our earnings targets for the full year. avista utilities' earnings were better than expected while ael&p's earnings met expectations for the first quarter, and our other businesses exceeded our expectations. in regulatory matters, we're pleased to share just two days ago on monday afternoon, governor -- washington governor, jay inslee, signed into law senate bill 5295. that new law will help transform the regulation of electric and natural gas companies toward multi-year rate plans and take the first steps toward performance-based rate-making.
the benefits we see with the passage of this important legislation is a requirement to file multi-year rate plans from two to four years in length with the foundation of the rate plan being set using methodologies the commission may use to minimize regulatory lag. ultimately, it will require current and future commissioners to implement the change, but we feel this is an important first step toward progressing the regulatory model in the state of washington. meanwhile, here's an update on our regulatory filings in january. as you know, we filed two-year general rate cases in idaho, one for electric, one for gas. and in 2020, we filed general rate cases in washington again, one for electric and gas. we continue to work through the regulatory process in these jurisdictions. in oregon, we expect to file a rate case in the second half of 2021.
we reached a significant milestone in our focus on electric transportation when the washington utilities and transportation commission approved three tariffs that allow us to proceed with several programs outlined in our transportation-electrification plan. among other things, the utc's approval allows us to establish both an optional general service and large commercial electric vehicle rates which will help us enable and accelerate fleet electrification for commercial customers such as the spokane transit authority.
our transportation, electrification plan and newly approved tariffs will serve as a valuable model for others. and it's a great example of our industries' role in electric transportation and our clean energy future. once again, avista is leading the way. looking ahead, we remain focused on running the great utility and continue to invest prudent capital to maintain and update our infrastructure and provide reliable energy service to our customers. we are confirming our 2021 through 2023 earnings guidance.
and with that, i'll turn this presentation over to mark.
mark thies -- executive vice president, treasurer, and chief financial officer
thanks, dennis, and good morning, everyone. so last night, my blackhawks were eliminated from the playoffs. so we have five more games left, but we have no chance for postseason play this year. so that's a sad day for me. but on the happy note, we had a great first quarter, the avista utilities contributed $0.92 per diluted share compared to $0.68 last year. and compared to the prior year, our earnings benefited from higher utility margin. and we had general rate increases and customer growth.
the first quarter also included an accrual -- the first quarter of the prior year had some negative accruals in it related to the washington remand case, a 2015 case, and disallowances around colstrip in an accrual for the colstrip community fund. that all happened in 2020 that were drags on 2020 earnings. the erm in washington with a pre-tax benefit of $4.3 million in the first quarter compared to $5.2 million in the first quarter of 2020.
we continue to be committed to investing the necessary capital in our utility infrastructure, and we expect avista utilities' capital expenditures to total about $415 million in 2021. with respect to liquidity on april 5 of 2021, we repaid the outstanding balance of our one-year credit agreement that we entered into in april of 2020, and that was to remind you to make sure we had sufficient liquidity at the start of the pandemic.
on april 30, we had $182 million of available liquidity under our $400 million line of credit, and we expect to extend that line of credit into a multi-year deal in the second quarter. we expect to issue approximately $120 million of long-term debt in 2021, and $75 million of equity. as dennis mentioned earlier, we are confirming our 2021, 2022, and 2023 earnings guidance with consolidated ranges of $1.96 to $2.16 per diluted share in '21, $2.18 to $2.38 in 2022, and $2.42 to $2.62 in 2023. and this puts us on track to earning our allowed return by 2023.
our guidance does assume timely and appropriate rate relief in all of our jurisdictions. our '21 earnings guidance reflects again unrecovered structural cost estimated to reduce our return on equity by approximately 70 basis points. and in addition, our '21 guidance reflects a regulatory timing lag estimated to reduce our equity return by approximately 100 basis points. this results in a return on equity for avista utilities of approximately 7.7% in 2021.
we are currently forecasting customer growth of about 1% annually for avista utilities. for 2021, avista utilities is expected to contribute in the range of $1.93 to $2.07 per diluted share with the midpoint of our guidance range, not including any expense or benefit under the energy recovery mechanism. our current expectation is to be in the 75% customer, 25% company sharing band, which is expected to add approximately $0.06 per diluted share.
for 2021, we expect ael&p to contribute in the range of $0.08 to $0.11 per diluted share, and our outlook for both avista utilities and ael&p assumes among other variables normal precipitation and slightly below normal about 92% for avista utilities hydroelectric generation for the year. for 2021, we expect our other businesses to be between a loss of $0.05 to $0.02 per diluted share. our guidance generally includes only normal operating conditions and does not include any unusual or non-recurring items until the effects of such items are known and measurable.
i'll now turn the call back over to john.
john wilcox -- investor relations manager

[operator instructions] your first question comes from the line of kody clark with bank of america.
kody clark -- bank of america -- analyst
hey. good morning, everyone. thank you for taking my question.
dennis vermillion -- president and chief executive officer
good morning, kody.
kody clark -- bank of america -- analyst
good morning. so, maybe first on the rng side. i know it's early, but i'm wondering if you're planning on any unregulated investments and production or otherwise. are you just thinking about it in terms of integrating it into your distribution system and maybe there is some incremental capex on interconnection with the facilities, but just wondering how you're thinking about this --
dennis vermillion -- president and chief executive officer
hi, kody. yeah, kody, this is dennis. at this point in time, it's the latter. so we are looking at it as a utility resource that would be integrated into our system to meet our utility loads.
kody clark -- bank of america -- analyst
got it. okay. and then maybe just higher level, if you could share your thoughts on the puts and takes of potentially exiting colstrip, removing it from rate base and replacing it with ppas that earn a wacc return under ceta. i'm kind of wondering how this plays into your post 2023 growth outlook.
dennis vermillion -- president and chief executive officer
well, with colstrip, it's clear when you look at our integrated resource plan recently filed. and we've been stating all along that it will need to exit our portfolio at the end of '25. so we recently issued an rfp for new resources in that. as a result of that process, the chelan county pud contract that i referenced earlier was selected. we will continue to meet our needs going forward through a competitive process. we need to -- any self-build options we would have, we would have to stack up with an rfp what might be available in the marketplace. and of course, the end obligation and desire here is to get the most cost-effective resources for our customers to serve their needs going forward. does that help?
kody clark -- bank of america -- analyst
okay, got it. yeah. yeah, understood that. understood that. that's all i had. thanks again for your time.

hi. good morning guys. how are you?
mark thies -- executive vice president, treasurer, and chief financial officer
hi, sophie.
sophie karp -- keybanc -- analyst
hey, i was wondering if you could comment may be on the montana lawsuit related to colstrip that is being reported sort of any color you can offer on the positions of the parties and what do you think will transpire with respect to the bill that they passed in this proceeding?
dennis vermillion -- president and chief executive officer
well, this is dennis. it's hard to know what will transpire at this point. as we've talked before there are six owners in the plant. we've all been working in good faith to try to find a solution that meets the needs of all parties including the parties in montana, and just a very complex situation. it's unfortunate that the bills in question, senate bill 265 and 266 were signed into law. it complicates matters. it adds complication to an already complicated situation. and we were just in a position where we need to protect our rights under the current agreement. so those have been -- those are in process, and it really is, at this point in time, sophie, impossible to know how those will play out. but we will keep you updated as we go forward.
sophie karp -- keybanc -- analyst
all right. thank you. that's all i had.

operator
good day. thank you for standing by, and welcome to the avista corp. q2 2021 earnings conference call. [operator instructions]
i would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, john wilcox. thank you. please go ahead.
john wilcox -- director of finance, assistant treasurer
good morning, everyone, and welcome to avista's second quarter 2021 earnings conference call. our earnings were released premarket this morning and are available on our website. joining me this morning are avista corp. president and ceo, dennis vermillion; executive vice president, treasurer and cfo, mark thies; senior vice president, external affairs and chief customer officer, kevin christie; and vice president, controller and principal accounting officer, ryan krasselt.
i would like to remind everyone that some of the statements that we made today are forward-looking statements that involve assumptions, risks and uncertainties, which are subject to change. for reference to the various factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed in today's call, please refer to our 10-k for 2020 and 10-q for the second quarter of 2021, which are available on our website.
to begin this presentation, i would like to recap the financial results presented in today's press release. our consolidated earnings for the second quarter of 2021 were $0.20 per diluted share compared to $0.26 for the second quarter of 2020. for the year-to-date, consolidated earnings were $1.18 per diluted share for 2021 compared to $0.98 last year.
now i'll turn the discussion over to dennis.
dennis vermillion -- president, chief executive officer & director
well, thanks, john, and good morning, everyone. i hope your summer is going well and that you're staying safe. on june 30, washington state officially lifted most of the remaining restrictions that have been in place during the pandemic. we're excited to see our local economies continue to recover. we're experiencing increased loads, and customer growth is steady. like many other businesses, we continue to monitor the pandemic very closely and watch what's happening with variants and case count in our communities.
we're ready and able to successfully adjust our business as needed and also continue to provide care and compassion for those who are struggling. now let's look at some highlights from our second quarter. we had a challenging second quarter, which included an unprecedented heat wave that brought with it several consecutive days of triple-digit record-breaking temperatures across the region. on june 29, spokane temperature soared to 109 degrees, setting new record -- a new record high temperature and was even higher in many of our neighborhoods.
that same day, avista experienced a major increase in customer usage, which resulted in the highest energy usage in our company's 132-year history. the intense temperatures, combined with record high usage, strained parts of our electrical system and caused some of the equipment that runs our electric grid to overheat. six of our 140 distribution substations were impacted. to prevent the equipment from overloading and to avoid extensive and costly damage to our electric system, we implemented protective outages for customers served by the equipment that was most impacted by the heat. over the course of the event, we were able to reduce the impact to customers through system modifications.
we appreciate our customers' patience for those who experienced outages. higher customer loads, related to the extended heat wave, were the primary driver for an increase in net power supply cost to serve our customers, which negatively affected the energy recovery mechanism, or erm. overall, we've experienced hotter and drier-than-normal weather across the pacific northwest, which contributed to lower-than-normal hydroelectric generation and increased power prices. for these reasons, we had to rely on thermal generation and purchased power at higher prices to serve those additional loads. as a result, avis utilities' earnings were below expectations for the second quarter. ael&p's earnings met expectations in the second quarter, and they are on track to meet the full year guidance.
it was a strong quarter for our other businesses, which exceeded expectations due to gains on our investments and the sale of certain subsidiary assets associated with spokane steam plant. wildfire resiliency continues to be a focus for avista. our region has experienced extremely dry conditions all spring and summer. and combined with high temperatures, wildfire risk is high. in response to these conditions, avista has been operating in, what we call, dry land mode since late june, and dry land mode decreases the potential for wildfires that could occur when reenergizing a power line. normally, under normal conditions, these lines, located in rural and/or forested areas, are generally reenergized automatically.
however, during the current dry weather conditions, avista's line personnel physically patrol in outage area before a line is placed back into service. this can require more time to restore service, but it decreases a potential fire danger. this practice is in line with avista's wildfire resiliency plan, which was released last year, building on prevention and response strategies that have been in place for many years. avista has committed to a comprehensive 10-year wildfire resiliency plan that includes improved defense strategies and operating practices for a more resilient system. in regards to regulatory matters, we are pleased to have reached an all-party settlement in our idaho general rate case. the new rates are fair and reasonable for our customers, the company and our shareholders and will allow avista to continue receiving a fair return in idaho. our washington general rate cases continue to work their way through the regulatory process.
our hearings have been held, and we expect a decision by the end of september. in oregon, we expect to file a rate case in the fourth quarter of 2021. we are confirming our 2021 earnings guidance with a consolidated range of $1.96 to $2.16 per diluted share. while we are confirming our consolidated range, we are adjusting our 2021 segment ranges to lower avista utilities by $0.10 per diluted share and raise other by $0.10 per diluted share. for 2022, we are lowering consolidated earnings guidance by $0.15 per diluted share to a range of $2.03 to $2.23 per diluted share.
for 2023, we are confirming our earnings guidance with a consolidated range of $2.42 and to $2.62 per diluted share. although we expect to experience headwinds in 2022 from regulatory lag, we are confident that we can meet our earnings guidance for 2023 and earn our allowed return. looking ahead, we'll continue focusing on our utility operations, while prudently investing in the necessary capital to maintain and update our infrastructure to provide safe, reliable and affordable energy to our customers and our communities.
now i'll turn this presentation over to mark.
mark thies -- executive vice president, treasurer, and chief financial officer
thank you, dennis, and good morning, everybody. i know everybody is sitting on the edges or seat waiting for the blackhawk's next acquisition, which is a spokane native. we got tyler johnson, a 2-time stanley cup champion, who is a spokane native. so we're pretty excited about that. there's your hawks update. as dennis mentioned, we're confirming our 2021 earnings guidance, lowering our utility guidance for '21 and also '22 and confirming '23 consolidated guidance. our guidance -- i'll spend a little time on that. our guidance assume, among other things, a timely and appropriate rate relief in our jurisdictions. that's very important as we need -- dennis mentioned, we settled our idaho case.
we're still awaiting approval from the commissions, which we expect before those rates go into effect september 1. for 2021, we expect avista utilities to contribute in the range of $1.83 to $1.97 per diluted share, and the lower end of our guidance in '21 and '22 for the avista utilities is primarily due to increased regulatory lag. that's due to increase capital expenditures primarily due to growth and higher-than-expected depreciation expense. but that is, we believe, all timing, and we begin -- as we begin to plan for our next washington general rate case to be filed early in the first quarter of '22, we expect that to be a multiyear rate plan as required under the new law.
we will seek to include all capital investment through the end of the rate plan period in rates in an effort to earn our allowed return by 2023. in addition, we have experienced an increase, as dennis mentioned, in actual and forecasted net power supply cost. although the midpoint of our guidance range does not include any benefit or expense under the erm in washington, the increase in power supply cost has reduced the opportunity for us to be in the upper half of the guidance range.
and our current expectation for the erm is a surcharge position within the 90-10 sharing -- company sharing band, which is expected to decrease earnings by $0.08 per diluted share. and recall, last quarter, our estimate for the erm for the year was in a benefit position, which was expected to add $0.06 per diluted share. in addition, we are also absorbing more net power supply cost under the pca in idaho. for 2021, as dennis mentioned, we expect ael&p to contribute $0.08 to $0.11. and we increased the range in our other businesses by $0.10, which really offsets the utility reduction, and that's largely due to a range of $0.05 to $0.08 of diluted share because of investment gains and the gain we experienced from the sale of spokane steam plant.
our guidance generally includes only normal operating conditions and does not include unusual or nonrecurring items until the effects are known and certain. moving on to earnings for the second quarter. avista utilities contributed $0.11 per diluted share compared to $0.26 in 2020. compared to the prior year, our earnings decreased due to an increase in net power supply costs, as dennis mentioned, mainly due to higher customer loads from the heat wave, and we had lower-than-normal hydroelectric generation because of the hot and dry conditions.
our hydroelectric generation is about 91% of -- our expectations are normal for this year. the erm in washington also moved significantly. had a pre-tax expense of $7.6 million in the second quarter of '21 compared to a pre-tax benefit of $0.4 million in 2020. year-to-date, we've recognized $3.3 million of expense in '21 compared to $5.6 million in benefit in 2020. in addition to the higher power supply cost, we also had higher operating expenses in the quarter, mainly due to the timing of maintenance projects, as many of those maintenance projects were delayed in 2020 because of covid-19, whereas in 2021, we returned to our original schedules and performed that maintenance in the second quarter.
the higher maintenance costs were partially offset by lower bad debt expense as we are continuing to defer bad debt through our covid-19 regulatory deferrals. moving on to capital. as dennis mentioned, we're committed to be continuing to invest the necessary capital in our utility infrastructure. we currently expect avista utilities to have increased capital expenditures up to $450 million in 2021 and $415 million in 2022 -- or $445 million in '22 and '23. that's a $35 million and $40 million increase in '21, '22 and '23, $40 million in '23 as well. and this is really to support continued customer growth.
our customer growth's about 1.5%, which is up from 0.5% to 1% in prior expectations. we expect to issue approximately $140 million of long-term debt and $90 million of common stock, including $16 million that we've already issued through june on the common stock side in 2021. the increase in long-term debt and common stock is to fund the increased capital expenditures.
i'll now turn the call back over to john.
john wilcox -- director of finance, assistant treasurer
thank you. and now we would like to open this call for questions.

operator
[operator instructions] and your first question comes from the line of julien dumoulin-smith of bank of america.
kody clark -- bank of america -- analyst
hi. how is it going, everyone? it's actually kody clark on for julien. so a couple of questions here. i guess first, on the guidance reduction in '22. i'm wondering if there's anything else that's driving that outside of just greater regulatory lag and power supply costs?
i mean it seems like those factors wouldn't drive that much of a delta. are you making any assumptions on the washington rate case that's kind of contributing to that dynamic? or are you seeing any increased insurance costs just on the wildfire side?
mark thies -- executive vice president, treasurer, and chief financial officer
well, there's some other nominal costs. we really highlighted the big drivers. there are some other nominal costs on o&m, but it really is in power supply. but it's really largely depreciation and lag. some of it is in some of our capital as well as we deployed capital. it's been in shorter-lived assets that didn't get into the case.
so we expect -- we still expect a fair outcome in our existing case, but realize, as we move forward with how we spend our capital and the type of capital we're seeing is that will really get pushed into the next case, which we expect to file like we said in early '22 -- early in the first quarter. and so no, it has nothing to do with -- we continue to expect a fair outcome in our current washington case. and it is largely additional capital due to growth and depreciation. there are some other small things. that's the main driver.
kody clark -- bank of america -- analyst
got it. and then just on '23 guidance, i guess, all else equal, you're investing more in '21 and '22, and then you're going to file that case in early '22, but you kind of reaffirmed that guidance range for '23 and also stated that you're still assuming that you're going to get to your authorized in '23. so i'm just kind of wondering what's contributing to your reaffirmation of that '23 guidance range? i guess from my perspective, it should be a little bit higher but...
mark thies -- executive vice president, treasurer, and chief financial officer
no, it wasn't a significant move. and the capital assets over long lives have some impact, but it's not a significant impact. so we're still within the range. so rather than have the nuance of moving it a few cents, we just said we've maintained our range.
we expect the confidence -- we want to have the confidence that we expect to get back to earning our allowed return on the capital that we deploy. that will be within that range. it wasn't -- the capital move wasn't significant enough to move it. it is improvement, and it's a positive, but it wasn't enough to move our range for '23.
kody clark -- bank of america -- analyst
got it. okay. i'll pass it off and jump back on the queue. thanks.
mark thies -- executive vice president, treasurer, and chief financial officer
thanks, kody.
operator
and your next question comes from the line of sophie karp from keybanc.
sophie karp -- keybanc -- analyst
hi. good morning, thanks for taking my question. so maybe to build on the previous question a little bit here. so you're talking about increased regulatory lag that's partially due to higher capex, i suppose, in 2022. are you correspondingly increasing your capex outlook? or maybe i'm missing it here somewhere?
mark thies -- executive vice president, treasurer, and chief financial officer
i'm not -- so are you asking -- we are increasing our capex outlook. is that your question? and that is impacting our...
sophie karp -- keybanc -- analyst
yes, yes.
mark thies -- executive vice president, treasurer, and chief financial officer
yes, we are increasing our capex outlook. so we're going to go to $450 million for this year and $445 million for '22 and '23. that compares to $415 million previously and $405 million and $405 million. so it is a $35 million, $40 million and $40 million increase. and it's largely due to growth in the cost of really doing the same projects that we have and just the cost of doing those projects as materials have gone up.
we believe those projects are very important for our customers. and actually, the growth is good as well for the company. but -- so that's really -- it's not a fundamental. we don't have any new power plants in there or any other major projects we've added, it's just incremental capital to continue to do what we need to do for our system.
sophie karp -- keybanc -- analyst
got it. so ok. that's very helpful color. and so then could you maybe give us a little bit more color on the guidance revision on the other segments this year for 2021. so that goes from negative 5% to 2% to positive 5% to 8%, kind of a little bit more color on what accounts for that would be?
mark thies -- executive vice president, treasurer, and chief financial officer
it was really largely driven by the second -- i mean the second quarter -- we had strong earnings in the second quarter, and it was due to investment gains in the funds that we're -- and we're in with the energy impact partners and also the sale of steam plant. we had a small gain on the sale of steam plant square as well. so that's really hooked into our actual results, and then we just look at that forward. we're not expecting more significant gains. it's really based on the actual results we had in the quarter.
sophie karp -- keybanc -- analyst
yes. do you disclose what you have on those funds? is it kind of similar to energy venture portfolios that some of your peers have?
mark thies -- executive vice president, treasurer, and chief financial officer
i don't know what the peers are invested in, particularly. but no, the -- we don't disclose what the particular investments of the fund are, just that we have invested in fund i and fund ii, and we committed $25 million to each fund. and we are investing in those funds continuously. so we don't -- but we don't -- we expect to invest about $15 million in our other businesses in '21 and i believe also in '22. yes, '22.
sophie karp -- keybanc -- analyst
got it. got it. okay. and then before i pass it on, maybe on the power supply situation, so clearly, i understand hydro was an issue. what is -- how do you think this is going to stack up in the second half? is hydro going to become less of a factor in the second half? maybe if you can give us some color on that? and also remind us how the mechanism kicks in here.
mark thies -- executive vice president, treasurer, and chief financial officer
so when we do our estimates for -- and we said $0.08 negative surcharge position, that is for the year. so that does include our expectations for the year of what hydro will be. now what we do assume is normal hydro. in the summer months and in the fall, we don't expect much rain typically. but in the winter, we do.
so we do expect normal hydro conditions for the rest of the fall and into the winter. so that could have some variability, but most of the variability typically, again, occurs in runoff. and that's why we were also down because we got such heat early that it used all the water. and so our hydro is down. like i mentioned, we're 91% for the year. it's about 50 average megawatts for the year is what the impact is.
and so we -- could we have continued adjustments going forward? yes, but we incorporate current conditions into our forecast. so it would have to vary from the current condition.
sophie karp -- keybanc -- analyst
got it. and so your ability to recover those costs is basically limited by the rate structure there, correct?
mark thies -- executive vice president, treasurer, and chief financial officer
well, the erm, it's what our power supply cost is. so if the cost of natural gas and our loads and our hydro changes, that would change, but we're in the 90-10 right now. so that's where -- if it gets worse, we only have a 10% impact. it does impact the customers that 90%.
sophie karp -- keybanc -- analyst
alright. thank you.
mark thies -- executive vice president, treasurer, and chief financial officer
thank you, sophie.
operator
your next question comes from the line of vedula murti from hudson bay capital.
vedula murti -- hudson bay capital -- analyst
good morning.
mark thies -- executive vice president, treasurer, and chief financial officer
good morning, vedula. how are you?
vedula murti -- hudson bay capital -- analyst
i am ok. a couple of things. i guess, one, in terms of 2022, you've indicated about depreciation and regulatory line, but you also referenced power costs. so is there like an erm negative that you're incorporating for 2022 that we ought to be aware of?
mark thies -- executive vice president, treasurer, and chief financial officer
well, the power cost actually reset in our rate cases. so when we come out and give '22 guidance, we will put that expectation in, but our power costs will reset in our rate case, which in washington, which we expect to be effective october 1. again, we still need commission approval and all that in order, but we expect that to be effective october 1. and in that case, we expect to reset power supply costs, and then we will have a forward look on what impact that could have in our '22 expectations.
vedula murti -- hudson bay capital -- analyst
should we -- ok, that should be fair to say then that the revision downward for 2022 really is not tied to cost at all, it's more tied to increased capex and plant and service that's not yet reflected in rates that type of thing?
mark thies -- executive vice president, treasurer, and chief financial officer
correct. there's some minor impacts. minor. it's really depreciation and capital.
vedula murti -- hudson bay capital -- analyst
okay. in terms of equity, you're up to 90. i heard you've done 1-6, 16, such that there's like a 74 left to do?
mark thies -- executive vice president, treasurer, and chief financial officer
correct.
vedula murti -- hudson bay capital -- analyst
okay. now given the elevated capital going forward, is $90 million now a better level on an annual basis? if i recall properly, we were at $50 million on an annual basis kind of every year going forward. is now $90 million the new number?
mark thies -- executive vice president, treasurer, and chief financial officer
we've been in the $50 million to $75 million on average over the past several years. i don't remember the exact numbers. and so -- and it will depend on the cash flows that we have because it's -- also operating cash flows helped offset our needs for equity. but we'll be in our normal ranges adjusted for the additional capex.
so if you just assumed, a good assumption would probably be if you assume 50-50 on the additional $40 million, $45 million -- $40 million going forward, that's an additional $20 million to our historical levels. so i don't know that we necessarily get to 90, but we could. we'll have to look at that, and we issue that guidance when we come out in future years.
vedula murti -- hudson bay capital -- analyst
okay. because i guess that you would still be kind of like in a range where needing to do any type of a block or a public type thing as opposed to your various stock plans and at atm type of program that still looks to be sufficient?
mark thies -- executive vice president, treasurer, and chief financial officer
absolutely. the current atm program that we have with four banks would be sufficient to cover any of our equity needs, we believe. that doesn't mean we don't have the opportunity to do a block under that agreement, but typically, we do it under that program.
vedula murti -- hudson bay capital -- analyst
okay. and as i recall, in the past with the discussions coming out increasing capex and dealing with just system issues, my recollection is that the $400 million level approximately kind of triangulated with what you felt was an appropriate level of increase in cost to customers that balance things out.
now i'm wondering with increased capex here, whether to the extent that there might be -- that there's pressure there because that's a little counter to what i recall previous discussions over the last, say, 18, 24 months?
mark thies -- executive vice president, treasurer, and chief financial officer
well, we've been at the $405 million level for many years. i don't know if it's eight or nine years. i don't remember the exact year we went up, but we've been at that level for a long time. so given that, we looked at it and said, ""we have more -- we just came out, as dennis mentioned, with our new wildfire resiliency plan. that added some capital we need to spend over the next 10 years in that plan, and we have our -- we had our plan consistently for a long time.
so we decided -- and growth capital has gone up as we continue to add customers and we're joining the energy imbalance market as well. so there's a number of different needs outside of our regular capital need that we felt now was the time to continue to manage that and increase it slightly. again, it's about a 10% increase that we felt was prudent, while still understanding that we do have to manage and work through the cost pressures and affordability to our customers.
so we didn't -- we've identified that if you look at our regulatory filings, over $500 million of projects we could spend money on every year. and as we have these new things added to that, we still try to maintain our capital at a prudent level, but felt now is the time to move up to the $445 million in the next few years.
vedula murti -- hudson bay capital -- analyst
and with the 1q '22 rate filing, can you talk a little bit about the multiyear abilities and some of the other facets that legislation provided you? and how you are thinking about using those to be able to collapse the regulatory lag for '23 and be able to earn whatever return it is?
kevin christie -- senior vice president, external affairs and chief customer officer
you bet. this is kevin christie. i wanted to describe that a little bit for you. we have, starting with 2022, the requirement to file a multiyear rate plan. it can be as few as two years and as many as four years. and in that legislation that moved forward the ability to have the multiyear or the requirement to have the multiyear rate plan, it sets a process or the ability to get the first year right.
that's, of course, my words, not how it reads exactly in the legislation. and so that means getting all the capital, assuming that it's prudent capital, and we think we are spending prudent capital in at the rate effective date and then also the transitions from year to year. i can't say for sure, the duration of the rate plan will file.
some of -- all of this depends on the outcome of the current case, which mark described, and we expect an order here before october 1. so again, it's -- the legislation provides for the opportunity to bring in good capital up until the rate effective date, and then make transitions based on the capital spend from year-to-year going forward within the rate plan.
vedula murti -- hudson bay capital -- analyst
and one last question. can you remind me there's -- you always have structural items that simply are not permitted recovery such that if you're giving a headline number of authorized return, there's a certain number of basis points, you will be underneath it simply because they are fundamentally not permitted. i'm trying to recall whether it's like about 70 basis points or something like that, that's been a consistent policy of regulation for you in washington?
mark thies -- executive vice president, treasurer, and chief financial officer
you're spot on, vedula. it is -- 70 basis points is our expectation there. and it's really largely costs that are not allowed to be recovered from customers.
vedula murti -- hudson bay capital -- analyst
okay. just wanted to double check that. thank you.
mark thies -- executive vice president, treasurer, and chief financial officer
thank you.
operator
[operator instructions] and we do have another question from the line of julien dumoulin-smith.
kody clark -- bank of america -- analyst
hey, kody here again. just a couple of very quick follow-ups.
mark thies -- executive vice president, treasurer, and chief financial officer
hey, kody.
kody clark -- bank of america -- analyst
so just wondering if you could share what you're assuming in terms of earned roe for '21? i think previously, you pointed to 7.7%, but wondering if that's updated with the guide here?
mark thies -- executive vice president, treasurer, and chief financial officer
we're off from that. i didn't really do that calculation. we are -- i mean we're lowing our utility guidance $0.10. so i don't have that. it is lower than the seven -- 70. you can do the math if you want.
kody clark -- bank of america -- analyst
got it.
mark thies -- executive vice president, treasurer, and chief financial officer
just to project earnings.
kody clark -- bank of america -- analyst
yes. got it. and then just wondering if there's any updates on the claims from the dnr on the babb road fire? any updates from when we last spoke?
dennis vermillion -- president, chief executive officer & director
yes. this is dennis. yes, really no updates on that. we're continuing to engage with the department of national -- natural resources constructively. we've had a few minor claims, but nothing material.
and the dnr report has come out, and we continue to stand by our position and believe that it was not -- the fire was not caused by any of our equipment deficiencies or any concerns around that. it was just an unprecedented storm that knocked down a tree outside right of way and started the fire. so nothing new from what we've talked about in the past.
kody clark -- bank of america -- analyst
okay. and then are there any fires in your service territory now that we should be aware of?
dennis vermillion -- president, chief executive officer & director
yes, there's -- well, you can tell by watching the nightly news. if you do that, there's fires all over the northwest. and there's been a few in and around our service area. nothing that is material at this point. so at this time, no concerns.
obviously, as i mentioned earlier, it's really peak fire season, and we -- they are smoky with all the fires in the northwest. we continue to monitor and manage our system accordingly to mitigate any adverse impacts. but the short answer is really nothing material at this point.
mark thies -- executive vice president, treasurer, and chief financial officer
and the ones -- kody to add to what dennis was saying, the ones that have started, there's been some lightning -- as some things have come through and lightning again, has caused it, not any deficiencies in our equipment or anything with respect to our equipment.
dennis vermillion -- president, chief executive officer & director
yes, that's correct.
kody clark -- bank of america -- analyst
okay. helpful. thank you very much.
mark thies -- executive vice president, treasurer, and chief financial officer
thanks, kody.
operator
and you do have another question from the line of vedula murti.
vedula murti -- hudson bay capital -- analyst
in terms of the reaffirmation of 2023, can you remind us kind of what the -- in terms of that range, what the earned roe was assumed to be in that period?
mark thies -- executive vice president, treasurer, and chief financial officer
again, we're getting to our allowed roe minus the 70 basis points. so we're allowed about 9.4% in our jurisdictions. and assuming approvals from the different -- idaho still pending commission approval. but assuming approvals of the idaho commission and no change in washington, assuming we get our current roe, it's 9.4% in each of those jurisdictions with 70 basis points of lag, it would be about 8.7% from an roe perspective.
vedula murti -- hudson bay capital -- analyst
thank you very much.
mark thies -- executive vice president, treasurer, and chief financial officer

operator
good day, and thank you for standing by. welcome to the avista corporation q3 2021 earnings conference call. [operator instructions] please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [operator instructions]
i would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, stacey wenz. please go ahead.
stacey wenz -- investor relation
thank you. good morning, everyone, and welcome to avista's third quarter 2021 earnings conference call. by way of introduction, i have been with avista since 2009, working in our accounting group. i'm very excited to be taking over from john for my first earnings call, and i look forward to working with all of you in the coming year. our earnings were released pre-market this morning and are available on our website. joining me this morning are avista corp., president and ceo, dennis vermillion; executive vice president, treasurer, and cfo, mark thies; senior vice president, external affairs and chief customer officer, kevin christie; and vice president, controller and principal accounting officer, ryan krasselt. i would like to remind everyone that some of the statements that will be made today are forward-looking statements that involve assumptions, risks, and uncertainties, which are subject to change. for reference to the various factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed in today's call, please refer to our 10-k for 2020 and 10-q for the third quarter of 2021, which are available on our website. to begin this presentation, i would like to recap the financial results presented in today's press release. our consolidated earnings for the third quarter of 2021 were $0.20 per diluted share compared to $0.07 for the third quarter of 2020. for the year-to-date, consolidated earnings were $1.38 per diluted share for 2021 compared to $1.04 last year.
now i'll turn the discussion over to dennis.
dennis vermillion -- president and chief executive officer
well, thank you, stacey, and welcome to the ir team. thanks for heading up the team for us. as you heard, this is stacey's first call today, and we're just so happy to have her in this role, and she's going to be with us at eei too. so you'll -- everybody will have a chance to meet stacey and get to know stacey a little bit. so good morning, everyone. i'd like to start our conversation this morning by acknowledging that it's been more than 1.5 years since we started this pandemic journey. and unfortunately, looks like we still have a ways to go. we will, no doubt, face more challenges as we move forward. our region and our nation, we're recovering and rebuilding from this, and we're ready for the challenge. i continue to be extremely proud of our employees, and i'm just so grateful for the resolve and resiliency that they've all demonstrated and the flexibility they've displayed. and then the commitment and concern they have for our customers and communities just really fantastic. and just so proud of our team. i'm confident that no matter what the future brings, that we have the team and we have what it takes to manage through whatever the future may bring. now, let me turn to our earnings results at avista utilities. our earnings were above expectations primarily due to the timing of the recognition of income taxes.
and over at ael&p, their earnings remain on track to meet the full year guidance. and in our other business, we've had a great year so far, and we are pleased with our investments. they produced significant gains in 2021, exceeding expectations. we continue to expect these investments to contribute $0.05 to $0.10 per diluted share going forward. in regards to regulatory matters during the third quarter, we concluded our idaho and washington general rate cases with rates effective september one and october 1, respectively. we are pleased with both commissions' support of our ongoing investments in the infrastructure that serves our customers and offers us the opportunity to continue to provide our customers with safe and reliable and affordable energy without immediately impacting customer bills. however, we did get -- we did not get recovery of certain operating expenses through the washington general rate cases. in october, we filed our general rate case in oregon. we have proposed that the increase in base revenues included in the rate case be fully offset for a 2-year period with tax customer credits of the same amount, resulting in no impact to customer bills. early in the first quarter of 2022, we expect to file general rate cases in washington, both electric and gas.
they will be multi-year rate plans as required under the new law, and we will seek to include in rates all capital investments and expected operating expenses through the end of the rate plan period in an effort to earn our allowed return by 2023. in other regulatory filings, we were the first utility to file its clean energy implementation plan with the washington commission in october. our plan sets the course for an equitable transition to clean energy and provides a road map for specific actions to be taken over the next four years to show the progress we're making toward achieving clean energy goals established by the clean energy transformation act or ceta. and that plan is available on our website under the clean energy future tab, and there's a good executive summary there if you have interest in checking that out. focusing back on earnings, we are confirming our consolidated earnings guidance for 2021 and 2023 of $1.96 to $2.16 per diluted share for 2021, and $2.42 to $2.62 per diluted share for 2023. we are lowering our consolidated guidance by $0.10 per diluted share in 2022 to a range of $1.93 to $2.13 per diluted share. so with that,
i'll turn this presentation over to mark.
mark thies -- executive vice president, treasurer, and chief financial officer
thank you, dennis. good morning, everyone, and welcome stacey to the team. we look forward to seeing everybody down at eei as well and talking about our company, which we're excited about. for everybody's reference, the blackhawks are on a one game winning streak. i can only say that because it's the only game they won this year. we've had a tough start. but for us, at avista, the third quarter has been a good quarter for us. as we mentioned, avista utilities is up, we have $0.13 a share compared to $0.08 in the prior years. but this is really primarily due to income taxes and how we record the timing of such income taxes, and we expect that outperformance to offset in the fourth quarter to back to normal performance for avista utilities. the erm, the energy recovery mechanism in washington had a pre-tax expense of $3.8 million in the third quarter compared to a benefit in the prior year. and for the year-to-date, we've recognized an expense of $7.1 million compared to a benefit of $5.9 million. but when we look at it for the year compared quarter-over-quarter, last quarter, we expected for the full year to be a negative $0.08, and we currently expect it to be a negative $0.09. so it's really just a slight move in our expectations over the year, within the year, and we had a big recognition in the quarter though.
for capital expenditures, we continue to be committed to investing the necessary capital, as dennis mentioned, in our utility infrastructure. we currently expect avista utilities to spend about $450 million in 2021 and $445 million in '22 and '23 to continue to support customer growth, and maintain our system to provide safe, reliable energy to our customers. to fund that capital, we expect to issue approximately $140 million of long-term debt and $90 million in equity in 2021. $70 million of the debt has already been issued. we issued that and also $61 million of the common stock has been issued through september. during 2022, we expect to issue $370 million of long-term debt, which is really covering a $250 million maturity and then also $90 million of common stock, which will help us fund our capital expenditures and maintain a prudent capital structure. as dennis mentioned, we are confirming our '21 and '23 guidance, but we're lowering '22. and as we look at it, for lowering '22, there are a few factors. as he mentioned earlier, we didn't get all the recovery. we believe we had a fair order in our washington rate case and our idaho rate case, and we had many big projects that kevin will be able to answer questions on in the order in washington, but we didn't -- so we got our capital, we believe in a fair way, but we had some operating expenses that we were not allowed to recover. we believe that we'll be able in our next case.
we expect to file our next case in -- early in the first quarter of '22, and we expect that case to be completed by the end of '22 if the normal timing works. and we believe we'll be able, as dennis mentioned, to get our capital and our operating expenses for the rate period in that rate case. with respect to our guidance range at avista -- we expect avista for '21, we expect avista utilities to contribute in the range of $1.83 to $1.97 per diluted share. and primarily due to the impact of the erm, as i mentioned earlier in my comments, we expect to be down about $0.09. we expect to be near the bottom of the range at avista utilities. our current expectation is to be in a surcharge position in the 90% customer/10% company band, which is expected to decrease earnings by $0.09. in addition, based on our year-to-date results, we expect to be above the top end of our range with respect to our other investments. we had, as dennis mentioned, significant gains. we've had strong performance in our investments that we've been investing for the last several years. a number of different investments, not just one, a number of different investments had positives, and we expect to be above the top end of the range.
so when you add that together with ael&p matching their expectations, we expect to be near the middle of our range for 2021, including the negative impact of the erm. for 2022, we are lowering our guidance due to the lower recovery of certain costs. and those costs really included insurance costs, increases in labor as we've seen inflationary pressures impacting labor and other costs, it costs and certain colstrip-related costs. early in -- in the first quarter of '22, we do expect to file our general rate case, and it will, as dennis mentioned, be a multi-year plan as required by our new law, and we will seek to include all of our capital and projected operating expenses for the planned period to allow us to have the opportunity to earn our allowed return by 2023. as always, our guidance assumes, among other things, timely and appropriate rate relief in all of our jurisdictions as well as normal operating conditions and does not include any unusual or non-recurring items until they're known and certain.
i'd like to turn the call back to stacey now.
stacey wenz -- investor relation
thanks, mark. now, we will open the call for questions.

[operator instructions] your first question comes from the line of kody clark of bank of america.
kody clark -- bank of america -- analyst
so first, just wondering what gives you confidence in reiterating your 2023 guidance? you're implying 24% growth year-over-year, which is a large step-up in rates paired with this increasing power supply cost backdrop. so can you provide some color on what sort of rate relief you're assuming in '23? any specific assumptions there would be helpful. or are you just kind of assuming you would get to your allowed roe minus structural lag?
kevin christie -- senior vice president of external affairs & chief customer officer
this is kevin christie. thanks for the question. i'll start by saying we're, of course, still formulating that case. but it's important to point out that as we formulate the case we're visiting with the commission and consulting with them as we consider how to best move forward. but we do know we will include all capital in the case from 2021 to 2022, which will bring us up to the rate effective date. and from the rate effective date through the rate period, the two year period, if we do in fact file a two year, we have the requirement. as you might recall from the legislation to file a two or three or four year rate plan at our election, and we're still analyzing that. we'll take advantage of the legislation that we worked with the commission and other parties on to formulate the methodology to move from the first year through subsequent years of that rate case. and we will, again, absolutely include all the capital that we have spent in '21, will spend in '22, and what we expect to spend within the rate effective period. and we are also including for the legislation an approach that will allow us to properly capture our expenses up into the rate effective period and through those rate periods as well. so we are leaning on the legislation. we think it gives us the opportunity. and if you look back at this last case, the commission offered good support for our capital, as mark highlighted. and so, we think it's very viable, very likely. i should rephrase that, it's very possible that the commission will come along with us with the plan as we optimize or utilize that legislation.
kody clark -- bank of america -- analyst
okay. but to be clear, so is that assuming some recovery of the operating expenses that were disallowed in this rate case? is that what is implied with that step up?
kevin christie -- senior vice president of external affairs & chief customer officer
let me offer -- let me clear that up a bit. the expenses were not disallowed. they weren't placed into rates yet. we expect to bring the expenses that weren't placed into rates in as well as the items i just described as we look forward.
kody clark -- bank of america -- analyst
okay. thanks, kevin.
mark thies -- executive vice president, treasurer, and chief financial officer
kody, one thing to add to that. just one thing to add to that for a little clarity. when we file, which will be early in 2022, that will give you a sense, obviously, of size and what we're looking at. so we're not going to come out with a number prior to that. well, as kevin mentioned, we're working on it. but early in '22, we expect to file, so you'll have a number there, and it will give you a sense. and by the end of '22, we expect it. if the normal timing of 11 months in washington go through it, we expect it too. by the end of '22, we will have an order or a clear adjudication of this case.
kody clark -- bank of america -- analyst
okay. got it. and then you stated that you expect $0.05 to $0.10 of other contribution going forward. i think this is a change from prior commentary. i know the gain was previously contemplated for 2021 consolidated guidance given sale of some assets, but to be clear, are you embedding this in '22 and '23? and can you remind us what you're assuming previously for run rate other contribution? i seem to remember that it was breakeven to $0.05 and increasing over time. but if you could just clear that up, that would be great.
kevin christie -- senior vice president of external affairs & chief customer officer
we have -- so i have said -- i don't remember the exact time i started this statement. i said in three to five years, we expect it to be $0.05 to $0.10 of earnings. we're in that period now. so we expect to be $0.05 to $0.10 in earnings. we've been making investments in a number of different investments on the other category, and it's been between $15 million and -- i'll say, between 10 and $20 million over the last several years, and those investments are starting to mature and produce earnings. we continue to expect to make similar investments as we go forward. and so, we do expect -- when we make those investments, we do expect to have earnings. so it's -- our expectation going forward is $0.05 to $0.10 in earnings. it's not -- i don't believe it's a change. we're just moving through the cycle of timing, and we're there now. this was an outperformance. there's no question this year. those investments have done significantly better, which is a positive, but that's not always going to be the case. so we want to have a reasonable expectation for our return on capital as we continue to deploy capital in those businesses.
kody clark -- bank of america -- analyst
okay. thank you. and last one, if i can just sneak it in there. can you touch on the increased equity needs in '22? what was the driver here as capex kind of stayed the same?
mark thies -- executive vice president, treasurer, and chief financial officer
well, we're -- we've been slightly under-equitized overall. not significantly from our regulatory, and we're expecting to file a larger case in this next case in a multiyear, and we want our capital structure to be appropriate to what's currently allowed, which is in idaho and oregon, 50-50. and in washington, it's 48.5% equity and 51.5% debt. and alaska is separate, but it's not overly material to that. so we did have to increase slightly our equity to get to that level. so when we have our case and get to our rate effective period, we are having our cap structure where we are to our currently allowed cap structure. if the commission gives us a higher, we would raise additional equity to match that, and -- but we're just trying to get to our allow. so it's slightly higher than it has been in the past.
operator
[operator instructions] your next question comes from the line of richie ciciarelli of schonfeld.
richie ciciarelli -- schonfeld -- analyst
just following up on kody's question. just given the other business, you're expecting that to be $0.05 to $0.10 per year. i guess, what does that imply for utility growth year-over-year relative to your guidance this year?
mark thies -- executive vice president, treasurer, and chief financial officer
well, rich, we haven't come out. we'll come out. when we file our case, we expect to file our next washington case early in the first quarter. so in our next call, we've typically given the segment guidance. so we'll follow that history, and we expect to come out with our segment guidance in the first quarter, in our february call. so we haven't -- we've given consolidated guidance going forward to give you a sense of how we're trying to get back to earning our allowed return. we'll come out with our segment guidance for '22 once we file that case, and we'll have more color then.
richie ciciarelli -- schonfeld -- analyst
okay.thanks. and then just to be clear, you're -- are you still expecting to earn your allowed return in '23?
mark thies -- executive vice president, treasurer, and chief financial officer
yes.
richie ciciarelli -- schonfeld -- analyst
okay. and i guess, what does that imply in terms of a step-up in rates from '22 to '23?
mark thies -- executive vice president, treasurer, and chief financial officer
again, we haven't come out with a number in our rate case. when we file our rate case, you'll have a sense of what we're filing for. we always have some offset. the commission doesn't allow everything that we ask for. we have some offset. but we'll need -- like kevin said earlier, we'll need to get the capital and the expenses to that rate effective period or the rate plan period however we're calling it. so i'm not going to give you a number. the number that you see is a significant increase in our earnings per share, over 20%, around 25%, i don't have the exact number right in front of me. but it is an increase in earnings, but we've been under earning. that gets us back absent -- as kody said, absent structural lag to earning our allowed return.
