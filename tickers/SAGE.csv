ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the sage therapeutics announced first quarter 2020 financial results conference call. [operator instructions]
i would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, jeff boyle. thank you. please go ahead, sir.
jeff boyle -- investor relations
hello, and thank you for joining sage therapeutics' first quarter 2020 financial results conference call. before we begin, i encourage everyone to go to the investors and media section of our website at sagerx.com, where you can find the press release related to today's call. i would like to point out that we will be making forward-looking statements, which are based on our current expectations and beliefs. these statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, and our actual results may differ materially. please consult the risk factors discussed in today's press release, and in our sec filings for additional details. we will begin the call with prepared remarks by dr. jeff jonas, our chief executive officer; mike cloonan, our chief operating officer; and kimi iguchi, our chief financial officer. we will be joined for the q&a session of the call by dr. steve kanes, our chief medical officer.
i will now turn the call over to jeff.
jeff jonas -- chief executive officer and board of directors
thanks, jeff, and thanks, everyone, for joining us this afternoon. we are pleased to update you today on our first quarter results. first, let me congratulate mike on his promotion to chief operating officer. mike and i have worked closely together over the last three years, and we share a bold vision for sage. i'm confident that in his new position, mike will help fulfill the potential of our brain health pipeline through his knowledge of our business and industry, his passion to help patients and his strong leadership skills. now i'll provide an overview of our first quarter activity and discuss our depression, neuropsychiatry and neurology franchises. then mike will provide a more detailed business update. and lastly, kimi will provide an update on financials. i want to take a moment to acknowledge the challenges faced by the global covid-19 pandemic. i'm extremely proud of the way our employees, partners and the community have responded in this unprecedented time. i'm happy to say that our teams at sage are handling virtual work quite well, and our progress across the pipeline to date remains strong. mike will provide additional detail about potential impact to our business, although, at this point, our timelines remain intact. sage remains committed to discovering and developing new treatment options for people with brain health disorders.
and we believe today, executing on this mission is even more important than ever as mental health issues are coming to the forefront, and will continue to have a significant impact even after the current phase that the pandemic goes over. we believe the strategic decisions we made in the first quarter have us on the right track to continue our pipeline development of potentially important medicines. so let me start first with our depression franchise. first, we made the difficult but prudent decision to reduce our investment in zulresso, resulting in an expected annualized cost savings from the zulresso-related expenses of approximately $150 million. we remain committed to working with healthcare providers, sites of care and patients seeking access to zulresso, but our downsized commercial efforts will now focus primarily on geographies that have existing and active treating sites. with zuranolone, following our earlier discussions with the fda, we plan to initiate three new short-term clinical studies in 2020, with the potential, if successful, for three distinct indications. each of these studies are independent of each other in terms of potential filings. so this is an efficient pathway, requiring, we believe, just one additional positive acute study to demonstrate efficacy in order to bring this medicine to patients in each of the first indications.
of note, if we're successful, this can be achieved while maintaining a longer-term strategy with the episodic treatment of major depressive disorder, or mdd. one of the questions we've been hearing over the last several weeks is related to our decision to add a 50-milligram dose to the phase iii program. while we won't disclose proprietary data regarding this decision, you may recall that overall reports of adverse events in the mountain study were similar between zuranolone 30 milligrams and placebo, signaling the ability to go higher in dose. in fact, zuranolone has been well tolerated in our pivotal clinical studies to date, with no reports of loss of consciousness. to be clear, we have provided and discussed our available data set with the fda, which includes subjects treated across a broad range of doses and formulations. and these data include our proprietary pk biomarker, adverse event and response data. so we have agreed and a gained agreement to proceed with a 50-milligram dose in our ongoing and upcoming studies. clinically, we already believe from our studies that 30 milligrams is active, with two positive pivotal trials, one in postpartum depression and another in mdd, and one that just missed the primary endpoint, while still demonstrating rapid onset. if the new phase iii trials with 50-milligram doses are successful, having multiple dose options makes sense for a patient, clinician and the payor.
let me turn now to our neurology franchise in sage-324, our next gaba pam. we remain on track to initiate a phase ii trial with sage-324, 60 milligrams in essential tremor in the first half of this year. as a reminder, essential tremor is the most common movement disorder and affects an estimated six million people in the u.s. alone, and there has not been innovation in the treatment of this disorder in 50 years. earlier open-label data with phase iii sage-324 demonstrated it is a compound with the pharmacologic characteristics, we believe are well suited for development opportunities, not only in essential tremor, but also in epilepsy and parkinson's disease. we're also progressing the development of sage-718 and nmda pam as the lead asset in our neuropsychiatry franchise. we plan to initiate one or more phase iia open-label studies in disorders associated with cognitive dysfunction in the second half of this year. as a reminder, in a phase i study of patients with early huntington's disease, sage-718 was well tolerated, and patients demonstrated improved performance compared to baseline on assessments of executive function. we believe these data support our belief that sage-718 may have potential as a treatment in multiple disorders within payer cognitive function, including huntington's, alzheimer's and parkinson's disease. before i turn it over to mike, there's one more point i'd like to make. our teams have been hard at work assessing the potential impact of covid-19 on trial conduct. as of today, our analysis continued to indicate paths forward, including the enrollment of studies at open sites that have put procedures in place for social distancing and have available patients who desire to participate in clinical trials.
so with that, i'll turn it over now to mike.
mike cloonan -- chief operating officer
thanks jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. as jeff mentioned, during the first quarter, we continued a rigorous prioritization and resource allocation process to provide a clearly defined path forward, allowing us to advance programs across our depression, neurology and neuropsychiatry franchises. let me start with zulresso. i want to first acknowledge it was a difficult decision to reduce our investment in this innovative treatment. as jeff noted earlier, we will maintain a level of access to zulresso by focusing primarily on geographies with existing treating sites and continuing to support women with ppd. during the first quarter, we continued navigating the barriers to treatment with zulresso, and revenue was $2.3 million, a 17% increase over q4 2019. the number of moms infused in the first quarter increased by more than 20% compared to the previous quarter, and 12 new treating sites of care were added in the first quarter, increasing the total number of sites that have treated patients with zulresso to 41 since launch. that said, the recent rapid spread of covid-19 in the u.s. had resulted in a significant reduction in patient demand and sites of care paused treating new patients with zulresso. we started to see this trend in march, and the number of sites pausing treatment has increased. as a result, only 15% of sites that were active in the first quarter, remained active in april.
we also believe that concerns about exposure to the virus have caused a reduction in the number of women with ppd seeking treatment with zulresso, as evidenced by the approximately 75% decline in monthly start form volume in april compared to the average monthly volume in q1. given the impact of the covid-19 pandemic in the u.s., we expect de minimis revenues from sales of zulresso in the second quarter of 2020. we do not plan to provide revenue guidance for the balance of 2020, but we believe the covid-19 pandemic will continue to have an adverse impact on zulresso sales even after pandemic-related restrictions are eased as we anticipate sites of care will focus efforts on adjusting to new processes and addressing ongoing concerns stemming from the evolving situation. beyond the impact of covid-19 on zulresso, i want to spend a few minutes updating you on the potential impact to our clinical programs from the pandemic, and on our efforts to create risk mitigation strategies. we are actively monitoring the guidelines offered by regulatory authorities related to conducting clinical trials during the covid-19 pandemic. we are aware of many clinical sites that are operating during the pandemic, continue to see trial subjects in person, instituting social distancing measures. given that the primary endpoint in all zuranolone trials is assessed by subject interview, if a site pauses in-person visits for some or all participants due to the pandemic, we have the potential to implement telemedicine approaches with the appropriate documentation as directed by the regulators.
if that were to recur, we would evaluate the potential impact on the trial and consider whether to make any adjustments if we thought adjustments were warranted. at this time, our timelines for initiating new trials with zuranolone as well as the two phase ii trials with sage-324 and sage-718 remain unchanged with anticipated initiations for this year, and we are executing against the variables we can control, focusing on patient safety and data collection. with zuranolone, our plans include initiating three new short-term clinical studies in 2020, with the potential, if successful, for three distinct indications, postpartum depression, acute rapid response therapy, or rrt, and mdd when coinitiated with a new standard antidepressant, and episodic treatment of mdd. importantly, these pending studies are designed to allow for an nda submission for zuranolone, potentially for a range of dosing with only one additional positive study to support efficacy in ppd and in rrt when coinitiated with a new standard antidepressant. for the episodic indication, we would need one additional positive efficacy study, plus data from the redwood study. we're also currently evaluating the ongoing zuranolone clinical pharmacology and safety program and plan to finalize requirements to support a potential future nda with the fda. this is a good example of our overall approach. we leverage learnings, quickly adapt our new and existing trials and create multiple shots on goal, all with the mission of bringing medicines that matter to people with brain health disorders.
as we prepare to initiate these trials, our efforts are currently focused on database developments, irb approvals, contracting, investigator meetings and site activation, all of which can be managed remotely and are, therefore, minimally affected by the covid-19 pandemic at this time. in addition, sites conducting the ongoing shoreline trial remain active by utilizing social distancing policies, and where necessary, remote resources. from a sequencing perspective, we expect that the new 50-milligram cohort for the shoreline study and the placebo-controlled 301b study, which we are now calling waterfall study, we'll begin enrolling at sites that are able to see subjects in person. we also plan to initiate the ppd study and, finally, the rrt study later this year. we also expect to initiate the phase ii trial with sage-324 in essential tremor by the end of the second quarter, and one or more open-label phase iia studies with sage-718 in disorders associated with cognitive dysfunction in the second half of this year. and again, we are currently focused on database development, irb approvals, contracting, investigator meetings and finalizing site activation. before i hand it off to kimi, i want to reinforce our commitment to leverage learnings and creating medicines that matter. we look for multiple pathways to deliver on our mission, including innovative clinical trial designs, business development opportunities and executing against well thought out strategies to get medicines that matter to patients as quickly as possible.
and now i'll turn the call over to kimi to review our financials.
kimi iguchi -- chief financial officer
thanks, mike, and good afternoon, everyone. before i update you on our financial performance for the quarter, i want to take just a moment to mention how pleased we are with the progress the team has made over the last few months in the face of some truly unprecedented circumstances. as an organization, we've leveraged our resilience to make difficult decisions. i remain as confident as ever that we have a strong financial foundation and the discipline to enable us to operate efficiently as we execute against our current goals. while these unprecedented time has the potential to impact our business, we believe we're well capitalized financially to advance programs across our three brain health franchises for the remainder of 2020. back in december of 2019, with the mountain data readout, we made difficult prioritization and resource allocation decisions. at that point, we paused noncritical investments as we awaited clear direction on our path forward for zuranolone. with that clear path forward for zuranolone, and in the light of the pace of zulresso uptake, we determined the need for restructuring. this was a difficult decision. this encompassed major cost reductions and a reallocation of resources intended to help sage advance our mission of bringing medicines that matter to people with brain health disorders.
the restructuring included a workforce reduction of more than 50% as well as decreases in external spend. this will result in expected annualized cost savings of approximately $170 million. a significant portion of those cost savings are related to zulresso commercial operations and related g&a support. as part of the restructuring, we will record a charge of $31 million. these costs are principally associated with the workforce reduction. i'll now walk you through the highlights of our first quarter 2020 financial results. starting with our balance sheet, we ended the first quarter with approximately $875 million in cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and marketable securities. that's compared with $1 billion at the beginning of the year. we continue to have a strong balance sheet, and i want to emphasize that we anticipate our cash on hand will support operations into 2022 as we advance programs across three brain health franchises. net revenues were $2.3 million in the first quarter from the sales of zulresso compared to $0.5 million in collaboration revenues from shionogi for the same period in 2019. as mike mentioned earlier, as a result of the ongoing impact of the covid-19 pandemic in the u.s., we expect de minimis revenue from zulresso sales in the second quarter of 2020. we do not plan on providing revenue guidance for the balance of 2020. our r&d expense decreased to $64 million in the first quarter, including $12 million of noncash stock-based compensation expense.
this compares to $86 million, including $21 million of noncash stock-based compensation expense for the same period in 2019. the decrease is primarily related to the completion of the mountain study and positive enrollment of the redwood and rainforest studies with zuranolone. this is part of the resource allocation decision to pause noncritical investments and activities and totally understood our path forward for zuranolone. we remain focused on key strategic areas and supporting ongoing development activities across our depression, neurology and neuropsychiatry franchise. we continue to execute with a deliberate and disciplined approach to capital allocation to advance our pipeline. selling, general and administrative expenses were $70 million, including $19 million of noncash stock-based compensation expense in the first quarter of 2020. this compares to $84 million, including $23 million of noncash stock-based compensation expense for the same period in 2019.
the decrease in sg&a expenses was primarily due to a decrease in the professional fees related to preparations in the first quarter of 2019 for the commercial launch of zulresso in the u.s. finally, we reported a net loss in the first quarter of $127 million as compared to a net loss of $163 million for the same period in 2019. based on our current operating plan, we anticipate our balance of cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and marketable securities will be at least $550 million at the end of 2020. our current operating plan does not require us to raise money in 2020. we anticipate our current cash balance of $875 million will support our operations into 2022. but as we've always said, we'll continue to consider sources of capital and other business development opportunities. as you've heard me say before, we take a deliberate approach to our resource allocation. looking at the year ahead, we'll continue to invest thoughtfully to sequence assets we believe will create near, mid- and long-term value for our stakeholders.
i'll now turn it over to jeff for closing comments.
jeff jonas -- chief executive officer and board of directors
thank you, kimi. we have a clearly defined development path to advance programs across our three brain health franchises. i'm proud of how the sage team has responded to the current covid-19 pandemic, remaining flexible and resilient as they continue their work to advance our mission. our business remains strong, we have implemented business continuity policies and practices intended to save proud employees and help reduce the spread of covid-19. we're working closely with clinical site teams to develop strategies to help mitigate potential disruptions caused by covid-19 and, at this time, we do not anticipate there will be a significant impact on our time lines for our planned or ongoing clinical programs. before we open the call for q&a, i'll leave you with three key points as we move into the second half of the year. first, we have a clearly defined development path forward with the runway expected to support operations into 2022 to advance programs across our three brain health franchises. second, we are leveraging learnings and making strategic decisions in the context of a very rich portfolio, resulting in several viable pathways we can follow. and third, we believe we will have five data readouts before the end of 2021, with the shoreline 30-milligram data readout by the end of 2020.
so with that, i'd like to open the call for questions. operator?

operator
[operator instructions] our first question comes from the line of salveen richter from goldman sachs. your line is now open.
salveen richter -- goldman sachs -- analyst
hi, thanks for taking the question. so as we look to the year-end data readout with shoreline, what do you view as incrementally positive here? and how should we think about interpreting the data, given that this is a single arm study? so just trying to tease out if it will be difficult to assess the efficacy as with no placebo here?
jeff jonas -- chief executive officer and board of directors
great. so this is jeff. i think we're i'm trying to get steve on the line, and we're having some technical difficulties. but so again, thanks, everybody. hope everyone is healthy, and welcome to the call. remember, shoreline is we still have is basically a naturalistic study. it's a real world study, and it's a sort of study that we've been asked to conduct or people have expected to be conducted in the area of antidepressant work. our right now, it's a pretty classical study. we'll be looking at relatively endpoints such as overall treatment response. we'll be looking at how many people come back for retreatment and once twice or never. and we may be looking at other demographic factors. so what you can expect is a data that suggests how the drug performs in a real-world situation, without any kind of style any kind of clinical intervention beyond what physicians best practices may be. so we believe it's going to be highly informative and something that will help frame our label moving forward about how zuranolone potentially might be best used.
salveen richter -- goldman sachs -- analyst
great, thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of andrew tsai from jefferies. your line is now open.
andrew. your line is now open. andrew tsai from jefferies. your line is now open.
andrew tsai -- jefferies -- analyst
hi, can you hear me?
jeff jonas -- chief executive officer and board of directors
yes.
andrew tsai -- jefferies -- analyst
hi, glad everyone is doing ok. maybe just a follow-up on the shoreline question. i'm actually curious, what kind of information can you see for the enrolled patients so far? i'm curious if you can actually see details on, for example, patient baseline characteristics as well as whether you can monitor for instances of aes or dropout rates on an ongoing basis. just very curious to see basically whether you have ability to see that data as patients start to retreat themselves with a higher 50-milligram dose?
jeff jonas -- chief executive officer and board of directors
thanks for the question. if everyone can hear me, i'm hoping you can. basically, we're treating this like any other typical pivotal program. and that is, we are not doing real-time analysis of the study, save for serious adverse events or anything that might require a 15-day report. but again, that has not been an issue in the program. the way we're planning to do this because, as you know, enrollment is complete, is, at some point later this year, we will lock the data and then undergo an analysis. i think one of the pitfalls we want to avoid is the idea that somehow we're managing an ongoing trial by looking at open label data. so as i think we've talked about this before, our approach to this study is to keep the data within the data monitoring group, but otherwise not to do any real-time analysis.
akash tewari -- wolfe research -- analyst
thanks, jeff.
jeff jonas -- chief executive officer and board of directors
you bet.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of akash tewari from wolfe research. your line is now open.
akash tewari -- wolfe research -- analyst
hey, guys. thanks so much. so given the formulation issues seen in the mountain study with the 30-milligram dose, do you have any color on if you saw a similar dynamic show up in robin? basically, were there patients in that study that you suspected didn't receive an efficacious dose? and if not, could there be different efficacy thresholds in ppd versus mdd? i also noticed you recently published an interesting subgroup analysis from the robin study, where you showed non-sat efficacy in patients who had a ham-d under about 28.6, and then stats state over 28.6. given the trial only included patients with a ham-d of 26 or greater, what do you think is an appropriate ham-d inclusion cutoff for your three new pivotal trial?
jeff jonas -- chief executive officer and board of directors
so i'm going to start, and then i'm going to turn this over to jim or steve, actually, steve, can you hear me?
steve kanes -- chief medical officer
i can hear you, yes.
jeff jonas -- chief executive officer and board of directors
just. okay. good. so basically, i think there's a couple of points. as we take a look at this mostly initially to look at the question of so-called severity. but in terms of actual trial metrics, i think we've had i think we've discussed this before, but really, it's an important point, which is the trade-offs in any of these studies are always as follows: as you go higher with ham-d, it's easier to you expect to it's easier to show a larger treatment effect for obvious reasons, you have more room to move. you have smaller rates of enrollment due to the contingencies of looking for higher ham-ds. so with respect to overall depression, if you take a look at most depression trials, most of these decisions are made on trial metrics versus any particular heuristic rationale for why you would use one cut off or the other. the so i think, just generally speaking, most people will look anywhere between a 22% to 24%. we've learned we're not we can't talk about a lot of it. well, some of it's proprietary. we do have some maneuvers in thinking about how we'll recruit in the future. but i think most people will argue 22%, 24% in that area up to 26%, a reasonable inclusion criteria contingent upon the cut of patients you want to take a look at, level of severity. i'm going to turn this over to steve then.
steve kanes -- chief medical officer
yes. thanks, jeff, and apologies for the technical difficulties. yes, part of it is, and jeff is right from the technical perspective, and that's actually the way we look at it. the other piece of it is we want to have a variety of inclusion criterias at time of enrollment. that allows us to get the most general label so that we're not only having to specify a level of severity for patients that are included in the studies, but be able to have a more general label related to the treatments of depression or postpartum depression. so it's both of those things together that we look at as we think about the inclusion criteria for such studies.
akash tewari -- wolfe research -- analyst
yes. and any color on if you saw a similar dynamic in robin that you saw in mountain where some patients maybe may have not received an efficacious dose?
steve kanes -- chief medical officer
the kinds of things that we've talked about is we look at these are standard things that you look at all trials. we pointed it out specifically from mountain to really help us and help others understand that there wasn't something fundamental about the trial and the drug. there's always some level of people who don't take medication. however, what we've seen across all of our studies is a very rapid and sustained response. that's been true across all of our studies. we always i think we said it in the call, we leverage our learnings procedures that allow us to track these, and that's what we're doing for the studies moving forward.
akash tewari -- wolfe research -- analyst
thank you so much. appreciate it.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of yatin suneja from guggenheim. your line is now open.
eddie -- guggenheim -- analyst
hey, guys. this is eddie [phonetic]on for yatin. i have a question about the episodic treatment trial that you're going to run. you mentioned in the press release that you'll need the redwood study as well to file in the episodic indication. but you also mentioned that you're sort of winding down sites in the redwood study? so can you just help us understand sort of what the timing is for the readout of the redwood study? and if we should expect it before after the new episodic trial?
steve kanes -- chief medical officer
yes. so thanks for that. the things that you need to think about for the entire program is, right now, we're prioritizing the initiation of the studies for both postpartum depression as well as rrt. what we're committed to is going after episodic treatment. but for the moment, the most important things for us are really the most efficient pathway to filing. so as we look at the program together, ppd is something that we can file on with just one additional study. same thing with rrt. one additional trial without the need for the long-term data is what we would require or would be required for filing for either of those indications. so when you look about prioritization, we look at what kind of data we need now and what data we need in the future. we've paused enrollment in the redwood study. we'll reinitiate that when it's appropriate, and that's kind of the way we think about it. we're trying to be very prudent with the way that we focus our efforts as well as our resources.
mike cloonan -- chief operating officer
yes. and i think, steve, maybe just to add on, this is mike. i mean, this really is a portfolio prioritization process, right? we went through the restructure. we looked at the three paths that we had with 217, and we determined that there's still a great path for all three and we can hold on the 302 study, the redwood study now, but still very much committed to the episodic treatment, right? so we're excited about the three paths and giving us a single-shot on goal for both ppd and rrt. and then we'll prosecute and move the 302 study at the right time, but it really is a resource allocation, portfolio allocation and strategy that we laid out.
jeff jonas -- chief executive officer and board of directors
yes. one actually additional comment, which is practical. so practically speaking, is we have we've been working on a lot of these trials since the first quarter. and as we open up sites and the sites are opening, it's not usually advisable to have competitively enrolling trials with the same medication. so there's also quite a practical issue here, which is, we'd like to make sure we move these trials that are necessary could give us rapid registration first. and so they there's some pragmatics here as well.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of paul mattias from stifel. your line is now open.
paul mattias -- stifel -- analyst
great, thanks so much for taking my questions. two for me. one on the questions surrounding the therapeutic index of 50 mg. how much can you tell us about what additional data you've submitted to the fda? and how many total exposures you have above 30 milligrams of 217 just across different types of studies? and then in terms of shoreline, can you just talk a little bit about how you might handle dropouts? and for the clinical data in different scenarios? there's i guess there's an element to this where, if a patient does great on one dose, it might be hard to track that patient out to a year. so how do you think about that kind of funky scenario where you could be a victim of your own success in certain populations?
jeff jonas -- chief executive officer and board of directors
great. so a couple of comments. with shoreline, we have we'll take it when the staff finds to kaplan-meier and there are different maneuvers that one can do. and as you've already pointed out, in any study where you have naturalistic treatment, both responders may drop out and nonresponders may drop out. so very almost equal and opposite reasons. so there are ways to do that. one of the maneuvers is to simply assume that you're an analytic your analysis denominator are the patients who, at least make it to your first official follow-up, which, in shoreline, is in 60 days. and there are other maneuvers as well. now i think one of the questions you didn't ask, but certainly one we have to consider is covid and what that will do with people's accessibility to follow-up. so i think that's something we'll also take into account. but in any kaplan-meier discussion, you'll be doing sensitivity analysis in the analysis plan to take a look at those eventualities. with respect to the 50, i think a lot of the data that we have is proprietary.
and with respect to biomarkers, exposures and what we've done. i think it's fair to say that you have to remember that this was a program it is a program that has a large cohort of studies that are conducted as part of the nda, that are part of an nda that where we don't disclose things like driving studies, drug abuse liking studies and things. and so we've gone substantially higher than 50 in these studies. again, i don't we can't provide any more of a breakdown at this point for competitive reasons. i think what's important to point out is all of the data has been seen by the agency, including the population pkae data and all these kind of cross exposure and all formulations, with various levels of exposure, and we're comfortable that 50 has an as you know, by regulation, has an adequate safety margin, and we're very comfortable that this is the right dose to test.
paul mattias -- stifel -- analyst
that's really helpful. will we see any 50 data later this year when we get the shoreline results?
jeff jonas -- chief executive officer and board of directors
that's your third question.
paul mattias -- stifel -- analyst
sorry.
jeff jonas -- chief executive officer and board of directors
that was well done, but i'll talk so our plan is to enroll patients with 50 insurer line and to allow retreatment with 50. i think the presentation of data for that study is really it's still premature to estimate when those 50-milligram data would be coming out. and so we'll keep you posted.
steve kanes -- chief medical officer
yes. we have it. yes, paul, what we have said is that we'll have we'll certainly have data at 30 with shoreline with this year, and i think that's something that we're very confident in.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of cory kasimo from jpmorgan. your line is now open.
turner -- jpmorgan -- analyst
hey, this is turner [phonetic] on for corey. i'm hoping you just provide any additional details for the phase iii rrt trial, in particular, just the sizing of the study? and what do you need to achieve on top of standard of care and antidepressants?
steve kanes -- chief medical officer
so thanks for the questions. the rrt study is really just to raise it up a notch is this is really a study to look at the opportunity to get patients better quickly in addition to a newly started antidepressant. so the study will be comparing two arms, one patient one group where they're taking the new antidepressant plus placebo, the other arm is a new antidepressant plus sage-217 and zuranolone at 50 milligrams. when we initiate the trial, we really get it under way. we'll share all of the details, including the size of the patient numbers, the sizing and all the statistical assumptions. but i would say this, it's in line with the kinds of studies that we've done for our phase iii programs and their phase ii studies. the approaches that we're taking are very similar and say, for the 50-milligram dose, which is what jeff was just describing, that the endpoints and the approach that we're taking is very similar.
mike cloonan -- chief operating officer
and steve, maybe just i can add some the commercial strategy and how this kind of ties together too, right? i think it's helpful to remind folks that with rrt is the first indication we could have in mdd, we look at this as an exciting opportunity to get real-world evidence for both patients, physicians and payors with zuranolone. and so when we look at this, as steve said, there's a treatment gap that exists today that we think zuranolone has the opportunity to fill. and by getting this real-world evidence, while we're waiting for the episodic treatment to come, think there's the potential to accelerate that treatment paradigm shift that we've said. we still really believe in this in the paradigm shift that we're going after with episodic, that is the end game for us. but the elegance of this strategy right now is to get some real-world experience early with rrt. and steve, i don't know if you want to add one thing on top.
steve kanes -- chief medical officer
yes. i mean, this is where there's a lot of things at sage that i'm really interested in. as a psychiatrist, i can tell you that being able to fill that gap in therapy that michael was referring to is a really important one. there's nothing out there that does this people people really have an interest in finding ways to get patients better quickly, and to have that be fully integrated into their way of thinking about treatment. it's why there's a new fda guidance around this. and it's why i think it's such an important initial step into the mdd world. it's something that we're really, really interested to get going, but as a psychiatrist, i'm really excited to have this data.

our next question comes from the line of ritu baral from cowen. your line is now open.
lyla -- cowen -- analyst
hi guys, this is lyla [phonetic] on for ritu. just a quick follow-up for on shoreline. you said that you can easily involve telemedicine in the readout. but could you briefly say how maybe a proportion of patients that have already been using telemedicine? and also whether or not you aim to report subjects that have had telemedicine versus those that were able to visit in person?
steve kanes -- chief medical officer
so yes, this is steve. we were talking about what approaches we'll take. i would say that this is giving you an idea of how we'll approach if we need to do these things. and so how we handle the data is it would certainly be premature to speculate on that. what we do know is the fda has given guidance on how to handle these adaptations during this period for registration programs. so as we work through the program, as we understand what impact that might have, we'll certainly share that. i think the most important thing to keep in mind is that there are ways to implement the key endpoints in ways that are in agreement with the fda guidance that allows us to move forward in an appropriate way. and i think, mike said it during the call, we are monitoring this extraordinarily closely. we are in touch with the sites, the cros, the procedures they're putting in place, including the data collection, and that's, from my perspective, paramount.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of dane leone from raymond james. your line is now open.
dane leone -- raymond james -- analyst
hi, thank you for taking my questions and the update. just two quick ones for me. one, you said enrollment was complete in shoreline. is was that did you enroll to the target? i thought it was around 600 patients. so that's question one, just what actual enrollment was that's been completed? and the second one, we get a lot of questions in sorry, you want to answer that first?
steve kanes -- chief medical officer
yes, i'll just fire it out there. yes, we enrolled to our target. it's completed enrollment.
dane leone -- raymond james -- analyst
okay. great. and then the second one, maybe a little bit more complex. you have a peer company that is seemingly going in a similar direction on the rrt basis, but more in treatment resistant. so there's been a lot of questions in the investment community about how your approach in what you characterize as mdd would be different considered clinically versus what you do in traditional treatment? how does your team think about what you would define rrt for major depressive versus treatment-resistant kind of delineate?
jeff jonas -- chief executive officer and board of directors
so i'm not aware of which someone has to mute their phone. i'm not aware of which company you're referring to, but it's probably not relevant at this point. if you look at what's required for rrt, there are a few attributes that we believe are necessary for a drug to be useful. and i think one of the reasons we pursue 217 is that when and you've seen and we've made this data available, we published that data. so one is, as you probably know, in all of our trials, even mountain and in all the zulresso trials, we've consistently demonstrated rapid and clinically meaningful separation from placebo in a within the first few days or measurement period. so that's #1. secondly, we've demonstrated what happens after the drug has been withdrawn. and that is we've seen it with both mechanisms, zulresso and in mountain. you see overall good stability of the effect. third, we have extensive drug-drug interaction data, which is critical for the utility in rrt, where it's anticipated these drugs will be and this is what will i think steve mentioned this, these drugs need to be co-administered with ssris. so the ability to avoid drug-drug interaction is very important. and as you know, over 1/3 of our patients in our trials, have shown we have a lot of safety data on that. and fourth, we've shown that there's we've shown no evidence of rebound or withdrawal after the drug has been stopped as well as stability. so if you look at the attributes, and you go through the guidance, i'm not sure who else is looking at that, but i believe, based on the published and public data, 217, we believe, is uniquely situated to meet the fda requirements for rrt.
steve kanes -- chief medical officer
yes. i would just add. so yes, i would just say that a part of what's so important about this is that statistical separation very early on and clinically meaningful differences that we see right away. and that is a very unique profile, one that we're very interested in continuing to explore in rrt as well as in ppd as well as major depression.
dane leone -- raymond james -- analyst
thank you.
operator
thank you. [operator instructions] our next question comes from the line of vamil divan from mizuho securities. your line is now open.
vamil divan -- mizuho securities -- analyst
thanks for all the color on the clinical program. i guess i just have one, maybe more on the numbers and how to think about sort of spending trends for the rest of the year? i know you're not giving formal guidance. it sounds like you're already making some tough decisions back in december, january. you announced the program formally at the beginning of april. i'm just trying to get a sense of how much of the restructuring was already implemented in 1q versus how much more of a step down might we see or change when we see as we look at our 2q and the second half of the year, both in terms of r&d and sg&a, if you could?
kimi iguchi -- chief financial officer
great. this is kimi. hopefully, everybody here should me. but again, just context setting, remember, we have $875 million at the end of the first quarter in cash, and we said that we would have at least $550 million in cash at the end of the year, at the end 2020, and that the cash that we have on hand will support our operations into 2022. i think the other thing that we've always said consistently is that we've been very disciplined and deliberate in our investing. and i think you saw a bit of that in the first quarter, right? some of that is with regards to i talked earlier about when we got the data for mountain, we said, let's step back and look at nonclinical investments and make those decisions now to pull back, and that's really reflected in the sg&a line in the first quarter. and also within r&d, we had we held on zuranolone until we had our path forward. we waited for our discussions with the agency and understanding what our clear path forward was so there was some reductions in the r&d spend related to that. those there are not the impacts from the restructuring. those impacts, you'll see in q3 and q4. but again, this just shows that we take a very disciplined approach to it. we identified things early, and we made those adjustments. and lastly, i'll just say, and jeff has talked about it. there's a lot of trials initiating, a lot of data readouts. and those are a lot of levers that will happen for us, and the way we think about continuing our investing and what we move forward. so as those data readouts happen, that will also impact our thinking on our investment level thank you.

thank you. our next question comes from the line of matthew harrison from morgan stanley. your line is now open.
max skor -- morgan stanley -- analyst
okay, thank you. okay. this is max skor on for matthew harrison. i was just wondering, have you thought about how covid-19 could have an effect on placebo responses. how are you potentially controlling for variable region-specific events?
steve kanes -- chief medical officer
the one season placebo responses across all our trials are well within industry metrics. obviously, it's the same answer. as we get rolling with the trials. we'll be looking to see whether or not there's anything about the conduct of those studies that we need to adapt. but the same thing is always true, which is, these are randomized trials. if there are effects that are nonspecific, that we would expect them to be in both arms. but of course, we'll be tracking that closely. and if there's anything we need to do to adapt the trials, we'll do so.
max skor -- morgan stanley -- analyst
thank you.

thank you. our next question comes from the line of marc goodman from svb leerink. your line is now open.
rowan -- svb leerink -- analyst
hi guys, this is rowan [phonetic] on the line for mark. a quick question about the three upcoming studies for zuranolone. could you elaborate a little bit on the virtual capabilities that you might be building into these trials, like remote monitoring or things like that? and if you know if your selected sites are already doing this now?
jeff jonas -- chief executive officer and board of directors
this is jeff. i'll start, and i'll turn it over to steve. i just want to speak a little bit more broadly and which is, we're not alone in saying this. we haven't just recently discovered telemedicine and remote monitoring. we've been doing this in many of our trials from the start. as you may expect, in the 303 trial, in shoreline, we've already been we have many of those things in place. we've also had remote data and other, which we haven't disclosed in the mountain study. so we have a fair bit of experience already having done that. and we've incorporated a lot of those learnings into these new programs. so i think that, beyond that, i'm not sure we're at liberty today, for proprietary reasons, to talk about what which technologies we've utilized, but suffice it to say, this has been part of our programs from the early days of the company. steve, i don't know if you want to add anything to that?
steve kanes -- chief medical officer
yes. i would just say, we've been all over this since covid first popped up. we've been looking at ways that we can file guidance that we can adapt. as you said, many of our endpoints are fully adaptable to be used remotely. it's even part of the trends within medicine, as you're well aware, and in psychiatry, in particular. so as we think about what's going to be useful for us now, also what's going to allow us to continue our work in the future, understanding how to use technologies of all sorts and adapt our trials in accurate ways is exactly what we'll be doing. we'll be getting those data as we move forward. we'll be tracking the trials in real-time to understand what impact they might have. but from where we sit right now, as jeff said, implementing the kinds of things we need to do in order to move things forward is exactly what we're doing, and we're very confident about it.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of gary nachman from bmo capital markets. your line is now open.
ely -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
hi guys, thanks for taking the question. this is ely [phonetic] on for gary. i was wondering if you can comment on the status of your collaboration with for shionogi for zuranolone and what their clinical development efforts have consisted of thus far?
mike cloonan -- chief operating officer
yes. this is mike. i'll take it first, and then i'll pass it over to steve. i mean, just at a high level, we've been very pleased with the collaboration with shionogi right? as you go back to even when we first initiated the collaboration with them, we found a very like-minded partner that has an outstanding track record in cns in japan. they are progressing the clinical development well in japan, continuing to make progress on everything that we've seen there in lockstep with us, taking the learnings that we've had, right from our trials and adapting where necessary. but at this point, they continue to be on track. they have finished the phase i. and so steve, i don't know if there's any other color that you want to add to the clinical development there?
steve kanes -- chief medical officer
yes. i mean so the ability to track and have us work hand in glove has been part of the original partnership, and that's been going extraordinarily well. they share our vision around the short-term treatment for depression, whether it be for episodic treatment and retreatment and so forth. and they view that as industry leaders in japan and in asia in depression, they view that as something that's really important to move the field forward. so all of that is to say that their program has been going well. what they see is what we see. the profiles of the drug is very similar across regions, and they're continuing to move forward as we are.
ely -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
thanks.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of brian abrahams from rbc capital markets. your line is now open.
brian abrahams -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
hi, thank you for taking my questions. i'm curious what special challenges do you foresee to initiating the new 217 studies into a pandemic environment? i know you mentioned your ability to collect endpoint data through telemedicine. but i guess i'm also curious about whether you might expect inflated baseline ham-ds, which obviously could impact placebo effect, or any sort of caps on potential improvement? and how you might manage through that? and then secondarily, i was wondering if you could remind us your latest views on how much durability data beyond the 2-week period for the ppd and rrt studies might be required for approval?
jeff jonas -- chief executive officer and board of directors
this is jeff, and i'll then turn it over to steve. i think there's a general issue, which is, one, that we always deal in psychiatry, which is what's the impact of the psychosocial stressor on the development of depressed mood? and i think well, i don't think. it's really important to remember that people who come into these kind of studies really ought to meet the criteria for major depressive disorder. so they will meet the dsm-5 criteria. so respective of the no, regardless of what psychosocial precipitants might be, now these are not going to be people with reactive depression, which is what you worry about with people with acute onset sort of grief or that kind of reaction. so we're comfortable that the diagnostic criteria have enough reliability to weed out the so-called reactors. with respect to the general with respect to the issue about durability, we've already discussed this with respect to episodic. with respect to the other two indications, both the rrt indication and postpartum, all that will be required is the same type of design that we've used before, two weeks of acute therapy with an additional with additional four weeks of follow-up, and that will be it. and that's, of course, one of the reasons when we looked at our prioritization, we recognize that those two indications provide a potentially very rapid pathway to for patient access into the market with those two other indications. steve, i don't know if you have anything else you want to add?
steve kanes -- chief medical officer
yes. the only thing i'd add is the exploration of drugs for depression for psychiatric disorders couldn't be any more important than it is right now. as we emerge from the covid crisis, the rates of depression, you're already starting to see this in the late press and people are talking about it. the rates of these true depressions, we're not as jeff said, not reactive depressions, refracs, we're talking about major depressive disorders in the midst of a global crisis. it is going to be critical to be able to provide new rapidly active medicines, not just for the trd patients, but for everybody. and that's what this program has been about since the beginning. and it's why we're persisting through this, figuring out our way because we really want to get that medicine to patients as efficiently as we can.
brian abrahams -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
really helpful perspective. thanks, steve and thanks, jeff.
steve kanes -- chief medical officer
you bet. thanks so much.
operator
thank you. at this time, i'm showing no further questions. i would like to turn the call back over to management for closing remarks.
jeff jonas -- chief executive officer and board of directors
well, first, thanks, everybody, for attending today, and i hope all of you continue to stay safe and healthy. and i want to make a few closing remarks before i release all of you. i think, first, i think steve made a really important point. we often give a lot of lip service to the need for treating mental health, but we're seeing this more and more today, people under severe stress, under our frontline workers who are working in the ers and the hospitals, their mental health is a medical medically important aspect of our ability to beat covid. and we really need to pay attention to it, and it is just going to be a more serious issue as time goes on. with respect to sage, a few other comments i'd like to make. i think we're now in a very unique position, especially after all post mountain. we have a clearly defined development path forward for multiple programs across our brain health franchises. with respect to zuranolone, we fundamentally have three shots on goal in a company with what we believe is potentially one of the richest cns pipeline still in the cns space. we have five data readouts to be looking forward to by the end of 2021 and the shoreline data for 2020. so we believe that sage is uniquely positioned with a great team, with great financial strength to execute on our objectives. so with that, i'd like to thank everyone for their attention. i really appreciate your time. i hope everyone stays healthy. and we look forward to our one-on-ones. thanks, everybody.

operator
ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the sage therapeutics second quarter 2020 financial results conference call. [operator instructions] after the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [operator instructions]
i would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, jeff boyle, senior director, investor relations. thank you. please go ahead, sir.
jeff boyle -- senior director of investor relations
good morning, and thank you for joining sage therapeutics' second quarter 2020 financial results conference call. before we begin, i encourage everyone to go to the investors & media section of our website at sagerx.com where you can find the press release related to today's call as well as the slides that contain supplemental details.
i would like to point out that we will be making forward-looking statements, which are based on our current expectations and beliefs. these statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, and our actual results may differ materially. please consult the risk factors discussed in today's press release and in our sec filings for additional details.
we will begin the call with prepared remarks by dr. jeff jonas, our chief executive officer; mike cloonan, our chief business officer; and kimi iguchi, our chief financial officer. we will then be joined for the q&a session of the call by dr. steve kanes, our chief medical officer; and dr. jim doherty, our chief research officer.
i'll now turn the call over to jeff.
jeff jonas -- chief executive officer and member of board of directors
thanks, jeff, and thanks everyone for joining us this morning. we are pleased to update you today on our second quarter with progress across our development programs. today, i'll provide an overview of our second quarter activity and discuss our depression, neuropsych and neurology franchises, then mike will provide a more detailed business update, and lastly kimi will provide an update on financials.
as all of you are aware, we're operating in a new environment with the challenges of the global covid-19 pandemic. however, even in the face of these challenges, i'm pleased to report that execution of our clinical programs remains on track. we are aware that some companies made the decision to stop a pause recruiting or enrollment in clinical trials, but i'm pleased that the teams at sage were proactive in their planning and management of our trials.
as you know, our lead clinical asset is zuranolone in studies for major depressive disorder and postpartum depression. additionally, we have sage-324 in development for essential tremor and sage-718 which we are exploring based on early study findings we believe are compelling for its potential in areas where executive function is impaired. based on our progress in the last six months, we expect to have numerous catalysts coming over the next 18 months. we've been able to advance several programs and have had strong enrollment to date in our zuranolone waterfall study. we have been dosing subjects with 50 milligrams in our shoreline study as well and have advanced the anticipated topline readout for our sage-324 tremor study to the latter part of 2020 or the first quarter of 2021. so, we are running on or ahead of schedule across our development programs. in sum, during the second quarter, we initiated four new clinical trials across two franchises.
i'd like to comment further on our depression franchise. we set out to develop a therapy that we believe, if successfully developed and approved, will be an important and unique option for people with major depressive disorder or mdd. our clinical programs are designed to answer very specific questions to achieve this goal, and we are executing in a step-wise progression. we believe that patients want to get well quickly and stay well and many would prefer not to undergo chronic pharmacotherapy. in this light, we believe both zulresso in postpartum depression and zuranolone in mdd and ppd have pharmacological characteristics consistent with this type of approach.
as a reminder, our zuranolone program has been designed to achieve a first nda as efficiently as possible, with three ongoing studies where each with a positive outcome supports a unique potential filing pathway. for each pathway, we believe just one additional positive acute study is needed to show efficacy. as noted earlier, we made significant progress toward this goal by initiating dosing with 50 milligram in our phase 3 waterfall study in patients with mdd. based on our enrollment, which has now surpassed 50%, we have updated our anticipated completion date for the waterfall study to the first half of 2021. we've also initiated dosing in our postpartum study, our phase 3 skylark program. topline data from the skylark study is anticipated in 2021.
and finally, as noted earlier, we initiated dosing in the 50 milligram cohort of our phase 3 open-label shoreline study. topline data from the shoreline study 30 milligrams is expected by the end of this year. and it is also possible, we will have preliminary data from patients who receive 50 milligrams in the study by year-end as well. we're also on track to commence dosing in the phase 3 coral study later this year. recall, the coral study is looking at zuranolone 50 milligrams as an acute rapid response therapy in mdd when co-initiated with a newly administered standard antidepressant. mike will talk about the utility of this potential indication later in the call, but what i can say is that we now have three shots on goal to bring zuranolone to market.
today, we are also reporting results from the six-month follow-up arm from the mountain study. as we set out to understand more about the durability of zuranolone, we asked what happens to treatment responders at six months. this has been an important question and an area of speculation, as clinicians need to understand the treatment path for patients who respond to zuranolone. as part of the mountain study, subjects will offer the opportunity to participate in a six-month blinded follow-up to assess durability of response in those patients who responded after 14 days of treatment. as a reminder, the study was not powered to detect statistical significance from placebo beyond day 15.
about half of the study participants elected to participate in the follow-up, and we were pleased to see that more than 80% of those completed the six-month follow-up period. there were no drug-related adverse events, changes in labs, ekg measures, vital signs or suicidality ratings seen following exposure to zuranolone and there were no signals of withdrawal or rebound after treatment with zuranolone was completed at day 14. we were also pleased to see that approximately 75% of the patients who responded to zuranolone 30 milligrams at day 15 maintained their response rate at the last follow-up by day 182.
this was true of the overall population regardless of treatment arm. but more importantly, for those who show a significant benefit from zuranolone 30 milligrams, that is the population with ham-d greater than or equal to 24 at baseline. the improvement over placebo seen at day 15 was sustained over the full six-month period and at no time during the follow-up period, to [phonetic] the change from baseline in ham-d in the placebo arm surpassed that in zuranolone 30 milligram arm. this suggests the persistence of benefit following the initial two-week zuranolone course. this benefit was seen regardless of whether or not the patient was treated with ssris.
we believe these data support our vision for unique treatment profile for zuranolone for people with mdd. we understand development of an as-needed therapy in mdd runs entirely counter to the status quo of assuming all patients require chronic drug treatment and we understand two decades of one approach will require data to effect change. we believe these data are another step along that path. we're looking forward to the topline data readout for the zuranolone 30 milligram cohort in the shoreline study, which we expect will be reported by the end of the year.
before i move on, i want to reemphasize that our goal with mdd is nothing less than to offer a disruptive, distinct and novel treatment approach for patients. there are already several things we've observed in clinical trials with the zuranolone to date, which we believe along with our six-month data suggest the potential for zuranolone to be uniquely situated for this approach. first, we've observed repetitive response within days that has been consistently observed across our studies. second, the drug has been well tolerated in these studies with more than 2,500 subjects. there have been no adverse events of loss of consciousness, including up to doses of 90 milligrams evaluated in our clinical pharmacology studies. and third, there have been no signals of rebound or withdrawal after the drug is stopped.
i'm sometimes asked why we are looking to treat depression like a medical condition rather than a chronic disease that labels a person as a mental health patient. it's long been recognized that the preference or reliance on chronic pharmacotherapy is a problem in psychiatry and the numbers bear this out. 17 million new diagnoses a year for major depression, but nearly twice that many people remain on treatment for two years [phonetic] or more. we see this is an area of substantial unmet medical and societal need. if we are successful, zuranolone has the potential to allow patients to get treated, get better quickly and not require another treatment until when or if he or she has another depressive episode as you might expect when treating any other medical condition.
now turning to a new development with brexanolone, we are pleased to announce that under the fda's coronavirus treatment acceleration program or ctap, brexanolone has been cleared for a phase 3 study in people with advanced covid19-related acute respiratory distress syndrome or ards. this announcement comes after several months of analysis of brexanolone clinical and preclinical data. as many of you know, we already have extensive icu experience and generated significant critical care data with brexanolone in our srse trials.
sage also has extensive chemical equity and medical chemistry experience. and we've been looking at other ways our compounds may impact peripheral receptor systems. the brexanolone trial and covid-19-related ards will involve several leading academic centers. sage has undertaken this initiative believing there is a sound rationale to test whether brexanolone may be able to mitigate the morbidity and mortality associated with covid-related ards. it's also we believe the right thing to do. we look forward to answering further questions about this trial during our upcoming investor day planned for september.
turning now to our neurology franchise. we have begun dosing in our phase 2 double-blind study, which we are calling kinetic with sage-324 at 60 milligrams in essential tremor. as a reminder, essential tremor is the most common movement disorder in the u.s. affecting an estimated 6 million people in our country. earlier open-label data with sage-324 demonstrated it is the compound with the pharmacologic characteristics we believe are well suited for development opportunities not only in a essential tremor, but also in epilepsy and parkinson's disease. we anticipate reporting topline data from the essential tremor trial in the fourth quarter of this year or the first quarter of 2021.
we're also on track to initiate our phase 2a open-label study with sage-718 in the second half of 2020, the lead asset in our neuropsych franchise and our most advanced nmda pam in patients with parkinson's disease cognitive dysfunction. results from this study, which we are calling the paradigm study, will inform the potential advancement of sage-718 in various disorders with cognitive dysfunction. as a reminder, in early studies, sage-718 was well tolerated and patients as well as healthy volunteers demonstrated an improved performance compared to baseline on assessments of executive functioning. we believe the data we generated in our phase 1 program support our hypothesis that sage-718 may be relevant to multiple disorders with impaired cognitive dysfunction, including huntington's, alzheimer's and parkinson's disease.
before i turn it over to mike, i want to share my appreciation for the team at sage. the team is executing well across all franchises to advance our therapies as quickly as possible for the benefit of patients and families. we believe we've created a novel drug company successfully able to convert our chemical equity library into a rich pipeline of clinical assets that are new chemical entities and not just repurpose molecules.
so with that, i will turn the call over to mike.
mike cloonan -- chief operating officer
thanks, jeff, and good morning, everyone. as jeff mentioned, we made significant progress over the last quarter with the initiation of four new clinical trials. we've built upon the rigorous prioritization and resource allocation we began in the first quarter, as we continue advancing programs across our depression, neurology and neuropsych franchises.
let me add a bit of perspective on how we're thinking about positioning the differentiated profile of zuranolone in our depression franchise, if successfully developed and approved. we have consistently observed rapid response within days and good tolerability of zuranolone in our landscape clinical program to date. rapid action in depression, if also seen in our ongoing and planned trials, would be an important profile for zuranolone whether used episodically or treat as needed or as a rapid response or rrt therapy when co-initiated with the new antidepressants. physicians, patients and payers have consistently viewed the many unique characteristics of this target profile positively.
as you know, we initiated dosing in the waterfall study and updated our guidance on an anticipated data readout to the first half of 2021. we also initiated dosing in our ppd study skylark as well as the 50 milligram cohort in the ongoing shoreline study. we are on track to begin dosing in the coral study, the acute rapid response with a newly administered antidepressant study, during the second half of the year. as we think about the end game for zuranolone, if we're successful changing the paradigm by moving toward a treatment as needed or episodic option, there are going to be physicians who will want to use zuranolone at least initially in combination with traditional antidepressants until they get comfortable with zuranolone as a stand-alone agent. this is consistent with the coral study design, which we are on track to initiate this year.
if the coral study is positive, we expect to first seek regulatory approval for use of zuranolone when co-initiated with a new antidepressant in the treatment of mdd. if we receive approval in this indication, it would give us an opportunity to leverage the profile for physicians, patients and payers to gain real world experience with zuranolone and better understand the rapid-acting profile. and if the waterfall and the longer-term safety data are positive, we think the combination of the rrt experience and the retreatment data from shoreline and redwood will expand the labeling and use, making the transition to episodic treat as needed much more efficient.
this means the physicians will be able to take a phased approach in changing the treatment paradigm building on their own experiences along the way from using zuranolone in conjunction with a newly administered antidepressant to prevent relapse to the use of zuranolone as needed or episodically to treat subsequent episodes. the receptivity to a unique target profile is there. we have heard the questions on durability, including what happens after day 15 and day 42. with the six-month mountain data we just announced and with the shoreline data anticipated by the end of the year, we continue to build our datasets to help answer some of the questions we anticipate receiving from key stakeholders.
we want to give patients and physicians another option in the treatment of mdd. and if we are successful, we believe zuranolone can offer not only a clinically differentiated treatment option, but also a commercially differentiated approach. this is another example of our overall strategy. we leverage learnings and quickly adapt, all with the mission of bringing medicines that matter to people with brain health disorders.
with zulresso, we are executing as expected. revenue during the quarter was $1.1 million. and as anticipated, it was impacted by covid-19 as multiple hospitals continue to prioritize their bed capacity, reducing elective admissions like zulresso. through sage central, we can remain close to all the treating sites of care to understand their ability to treat ppd patients and any shifts in their approach. we will continue to support geographies with active existing treating sites and support ppd patients through the process. given the ongoing surge in the number of cases of covid-19 in the u.s. and continuing concerns about the pandemic across the country, the company expects the significant adverse impact of the pandemic on zulresso revenues to continue.
jeff provided a thorough update on the clinical progress we've made with sage-324, an essential tremor, and our plans with sage-718 in indications involving cognitive dysfunction. i'll spend just a few minutes discussing the tremendous unmet need for patients suffering from these disorders. with et, we are talking about the most common movement disorder, affecting an estimated 6 million-plus people in the u.s. despite its high prevalence, only about 20% of people with et seek treatment. and for cognitive dysfunction associated with diseases like huntington's where we've already seen an early signal pointing toward the potential for improvement in executive function and other neurodegenerative conditions that manifest with executive functioning deficits like alzheimer's and parkinson's, we're talking about the potential to improve cognitive dysfunction symptoms that track closely with functioning in the real world.
by improving these symptoms, our goal is to provide patients with the opportunity to remain more cognitively intact and potentially retain the ability to live and thrive independently. and so, we believe sage-324 and sage-718, if successfully developed and approved, have the potential to become truly innovative treatment options with the potential to help millions of people and their families.
before i turn it over to kimi, i also want to take a minute to express my appreciation for the team at sage. they have worked tirelessly and executing with precision during these challenging times and supporting our mission to bring medicines that matter to people with brain health disorders. i feel as confident as ever that our execution against a well thought out strategies will enable us to get medicines that matter to patients as quickly as possible.
and now, i will turn the call over to kimi to review our financials.
kimi iguchi -- chief financial officer
thanks, mike. this is a year of execution for sage with cash on hand anticipated to support operations into 2022. we have a clearly defined path forward designed to advance programs across three brain health franchises. our experienced team is working to create value by converting our extensive chemical equity into a rich pipeline of clinical assets in the areas of unmet medical need. we remain true to our mission. as a reminder, we started the quarter with a difficult, but prudent decision to restructure the organization. but we ended the quarter with the extensive list of accomplishments and progress that you heard from jeff and mike. as we move into the second half of the year, we do that with a solid financial position to continue to build on those achievements.
as you've heard me say many times before, at sage, we take a portfolio approach to how we think about resource allocation with the goal to maximize the value of our opportunities. by reprioritizing our activities and rethinking how to deploy our resources, we anticipate annualized cost savings as a result of the restructuring of approximately $170 million. these savings are intended to help sage advance our mission to deliver medicines that matter to people with serious brain health disorders.
i'll now walk you through the highlights of our second quarter 2020 financial results. revenues were $1.1 million in the second quarter from sales of zulresso compared to $0.5 million of collaboration revenues from the shionogi collaboration for the same period in 2019. as mike noted earlier, zulresso revenues have been significantly affected by covid-19 in the u.s., and we expect a significant adverse impact of the pandemic on zulresso revenues to continue.
selling, general and administrative expenses were $38.2 million in the second quarter compared to $88.2 million in the first quarter of 2020. our reduction in commercial support for zulresso was the primary driver of the decrease in the sg&a in the second quarter. and as part of the restructuring, we recorded a charge of $28 million in the second quarter. research and development expenses were $73.3 million in the second quarter compared to $89.1 million in the second quarter of 2019. the decrease was primarily related to the completion of the mountain study and a decrease in the non-cash stock-based compensation expense.
finally, we reported a net loss of $136.3 million for the second quarter of 2020 compared to $168.2 million for the first quarter of this year [phonetic]. we ended the quarter with $757 million [phonetic] of cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and marketable securities. as previously stated, we anticipate ending the year with approximately $550 million in cash, which we expect will provide runway for us into 2022. we're looking forward to the second half of the year. we anticipate continued savings from our restructuring and resource reallocation.
in closing, we expect the second half of 2020 will be highlighted with proof points to illustrate our ability to execute, showcase the progression of the pipeline and show the value of our chemical equity. this will be accomplished in part by the strength of our balance sheet. and i'm confident that we have the right team in place at sage to execute on all the opportunities. we look forward to sharing our ongoing updates.
i'll now turn it over to jeff for closing comments.
jeff jonas -- chief executive officer and member of board of directors
thanks, kimi, and thanks, everybody. and good morning, everyone. i just want to make a few more comments prior to going to question and answer. i think as you've heard today that the execution of our clinical programs remains either on track or ahead of schedule, and that's no small part of the efforts of the folks at sage working through these programs. our goal remains constant with respect to zuranolone. we are looking to disrupt the treatment model in depression. we understand that is something that may be hard to do, but it's something that we think meets an important unmet medical need in the treatment of psychiatric disorders.
as you heard today, with our phase 3 initiation for brexanolone into covid-related ards, we have a distinct and active discovery group and medicinal chemistry group, and we're looking to leverage that expertise as we move forward. we have clearly defined pathways to advance all of our programs across all of our franchises. and as you can hear today, we have a catalyst-rich 1.5 years upcoming where we hope to report on this progress over time.
so with that, let me open the call to questions.

[operator instructions] our first question comes from akash tewari with wolfe research. your line is open.
akash tewari -- wolfe research -- analyst
hey, guys. thanks so much for the questions. i have a few if i may, so i wanted to dig into what the 50 mg dose can and cannot help with. so number 1, will the 50 mg dose ensure that patients who take sage-217 without a proper meal would still maybe get into a therapeutic drug concentration or would that just not be possible if you don't take it with food?
number 2, were the patients in the mountain study generally heavier than the robin study, and will the 50 mg dose allow for a greater percentage of those patients to hit a therapeutic threshold?
and then lastly, can you give some color on how your pk curve evolve over time as you go from a single ascending dose to multiple ascending dose for sage-217? like visually, how does that pk look like and how would you define someone who would be low exposure versus high exposure? thank you.
jeff jonas -- chief executive officer and member of board of directors
hey, it's jeff. i'm going to start and i'm going to turn this over to jim. just some broad commentary. one of the goals of any drug development program is fixing the proper dose. the metrics and the biomarkers and the analysis required are not necessarily straightforward. i know people like to look at it that way, but they're not. and as a company, i just have to say that, as i think you're alluding to picking the right dose can be challenging. and in fact, we think that the 50 milligram is a good dose as we've mentioned earlier. we've now dosed up to 90 milligram. it's very well tolerated.
and so, we're comfortable about the 50 milligram dose, but that analysis that has led us to the 50 milligram in some part remains proprietary. we realize that this could be a competitive advantage for the company. we know we have a lot of fast followers looking at these mechanisms. so a lot of this we just have not disclosed and will not disclose. with that said though, the performance of the 50 milligram to date, i think as we've mentioned earlier has been quite satisfactory. we've now gone up to 90 milligrams. and so, we're very pleased with that.
i'm going to turn the rest of this over to jim doherty.
jim doherty -- chief research officer
thanks, jeff. hi, akash, yes. to answer couple of your questions in a little bit more detail. so first around the 50 milligram and pk, as jeff said, we are quite confident in the performance of the 50 milligram dose from the data that we've seen so far. and so, yes, we are confident that by dosing at 50 milligrams, we are moving the population into a range of exposures that we think is going to be consistent with efficacy i think. obviously, each individual person responds a little bit differently, but we do think that this does gives us the right balance that puts folks into an efficacious range.
and your question around body mass, i would say that all of our trials we see a pretty consistent picture of body mass for individuals, and pretty consistent with most of the u.s. population. and then to your point around pk profiles, yes, we think that the pk profile for zuranolone, which we call was designed to have once a day kinetics in human, gives us really a very good opportunity to sort of keep the exposure levels where we think they need to be to see efficacy in our studies across a population.
akash tewari -- wolfe research -- analyst
thanks a lot.
operator
thank you. [operator instructions] our next question comes from paul matteis with stifel. your line is open.
paul matteis -- stifel -- analyst
hey, great. thanks so much. i just have a quick follow-up on this mountain six-month data. can you just quantitatively speak to how you define responder or maintenance of response at six months? i guess in the phase 2 mdd study, we saw a couple of point up creep in ham-d from day 15 to day 42. would kind of something in that margin of error constitute maintain response? and then, i was wondering if you could just comment on the proportion of patients that initiated an ssri during follow-up, and how this kind of all informs your expectations for shoreline? thank you.
jeff jonas -- chief executive officer and member of board of directors
yeah, i'll take this i think, and then i'll turn it over to jim. a couple of points i want to make. first is, one of the interesting findings that all the six-month data has shown runs counter to the current mythology around depression that you have to stay on a drug. and that's the sort of most striking finding to me and i think to us, as we move forward to this notion that if you have depression, you don't have to be on an antidepressant for the rest of your life. and so, that's number 1.
and i think what really came home and if you look at the population that had a response, and i think that's the 24 and above, what you see there is actually a constant or very constant separation, pretty steady between drug and placebo. and what that indicated initially and what suggests is that if you respond to the drug, you continue to respond to the drug even after the drug is stopped. and we think that is a unique finding. with respect to antidepressants, this was also what made us -- what encourages us about these data and which we also -- it gives us a lot of optimism about shoreline. and that is only a very small number of patients actually started new antidepressants.
and overall, i'd say it was only a handful, and overall, it's only about 30% of the patients were on ssris during the study. so, this really does run counter to the dogma, the dogma about depression that you have to be on a drug and that you're -- you must be chronically treated. and for us, it has been very encouraging when you see that almost 75% of the patients maintain their response, and with the 24 and above, which of course is the relevant population where we had a positive endpoint, that response is maintained out to 182 days. the study was not powered for significance, but even then the p-value there was 0.06. so, this was a very strong finding and one i think that i have to say exceeded our expectations. jim, do you want to add anything else to that?
jim doherty -- chief research officer
i think i just would reiterate, jeff, that when you look at the data, i think the key message is that patients who are seeing a benefit, patients who are getting better at that day 15 time point are staying better. so paul, we'll put the detailed data together from the mountain study for presentation later. but, the answer to your question is, the scores are pretty similar to what they were in those early days out of the six-month time point.
paul matteis -- stifel -- analyst
great. thank you very much.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from tazeen ahmad with bank of america. your line is open.
tazeen ahmad -- bank of america -- analyst
hey, guys. good morning. thanks for taking my question. one of the focus on essential tremor if i could. can you give us a little bit of color on why you think it will be important to look at the primary endpoint at day 29? and then as it relates to upper limb tremor score, can you walk us through the importance of that and how physicians view that particular score in general as it relates to et? thanks.
jim doherty -- chief research officer
yes, tazeen, this is jim. i'll take that one and then i'll ask steve to weigh in a couple of minutes around your question around how physicians perceive upper limb score. so, of course, this study that we're talking about, that was initiated for sage-324, the kinetic study is building on what we've already learned both from our earlier programs, but importantly from the work we did last year in the sage-324 program where we confirmed that [indecipherable] like sage-324 has a significant ability to reduce -- tremor in essential tremor patients.
those studies were done with acute dosing. and so, we are at an important stage of progression for the program. essential tremor is a chronic disorder. and so, that 28-day time point is our next step in showing the sustainability of the response to sage-324 that we've seen earlier. and i'll mention around upper limb scores that is one of the most sensitive measures for essential tremor patients and also one of the most troubling when you think about daily life and what people are trying to do. but steve, let me have you jump in at that point.
steve kanes -- chief medical officer
sure. we've been looking at this quite a bit, tazeen, as you know we've been working in essential tremor since early days with -- initially with zulresso, then sage-217. and as jim said, we've seen very consistent results across the board. we consulted with experts in the field and they have told us that upper limb tremor is the most debilitating part of the symptom complex, but you can have tremor anywhere. the inability to do things like write or drink or -- and it's an intention tremor. so, the more you try to do something, the worse the tremor gets.
those are the things that really get in patient's way on a day-to-day basis. so there's a few things that we really been focusing on one, the upper limb score. we have to make sure that's improved across the board. and that's something that we've seen consistently. the other is given the level of use of accelerometers and other wearables, it's something that we're able to track throughout the day. so, there are real advantages in understanding the signal, understanding the effects on patients as well as the ability to understand what impact our development program may have on this patient throughout the day.
tazeen ahmad -- bank of america -- analyst
okay. thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from brian abrahams with rbc capital markets. your line is open.
david szeto -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
hi. this is david szeto on for brian. just two quick questions. first, looking ahead, how are you thinking about the landscape of depression evolving ahead of any potential launch? and maybe just related thoughts on how the pandemic might have affected mental health and telemedicine and how you see that potentially evolving ahead of the next couple of years?
and then the second question, just on -- going back to the waterfall trial and the enrollment that you're seeing, i know that there's definitely synergies from the mountain trial. but i'm just wondering if you see any extrinsic reason for why enrollment might be better as possible read through to the other mdd trials, including coral and rrt?
jeff jonas -- chief executive officer and member of board of directors
okay, this is jeff. thanks for the question. in general, i think we're seeing an increased incidence of reporting of people with mood disorders. but, psychiatry and depression has always been a major area of unmet medical need. and so, i think what we're seeing in the mountain study -- there are a couple of things that we're seeing in the mountain study.
and i'll go to your second question first, one is, there is increasing interest among people who are doing depression studies looking at novel therapies. and if you think about all the therapies that are currently in development, they all have -- they all really are of a kind, except for zuranolone. they are two weeks to six weeks to eight weeks and then chronic pharmacotherapy for as long as the physician requires it. we just think that patients deserve another option. and we're seeing tremendous interest in our studies, because the zuranolone data really so far and now with the six-month data, i think it's even more so suggest that there may be a different and unique way to treat depression.
so, we view that as an area of interest and an area of uptake that has really spurred interest in our trials. also, the team has done a great job. i mean, i think they -- i think as i said at the start, a lot of people have stopped their studies or thought they couldn't do studies and our teams really done a nice job proactively preparing for this environment. and the reality is, there are a lot of people who are depressed.
now, the second point is that as you -- if you think about the face of depression, i think that's really something that we are really interested in changing. and with covid, i think what you're seeing is a greater recognition of the importance of mental health, the importance of -- and the morbidity associated with depression in terms of lack of function and lack of an engagement and it's brought home as people are not distracted by work and have more time with their families where people can be -- where depression can be diagnosed.
we don't think the diagnosis has changed obviously. we think that using rigorous criteria, we can find people who have made real depression versus reactive depression, which is what we're distinctly not treating. but we do think the face of depression is treating. and we believe very firmly in fact, probably more now than we have in the past, that there is a real need for not putting everyone who gets depressed on a drug therapy for years and years and years. we think that, zuranolone with its profile, with its ability to show rapid response, with its tolerability profile, really can offer a disruptive and unique approach to treating depression, especially as the treatment of depression becomes ever more recognized as something that's an area of unmet medical need.
mike cloonan -- chief operating officer
yeah, maybe just let me -- this is mike. let me just add on to that, jeff. i think you said it well and i also think just if you think about our two shots on goal that jeff alluded to before right, we have the rrt option for patients, and then we also have the end game we're just getting it episodic [phonetic] or treat as needed. and as jeff said like, there has not been a molecule like zuranolone that is -- even that will give the physicians and patients this opportunity to treat as rapidly within days and see that effect, if we successfully get either rrt or the episodic treatments over the line.
and the way we see this playing out is, we'll be able to move this paradigm in time. right. so, we will evolve the paradigm, but we can start with the rrt indication, allow patients and physicians to get comfortable with the rapid acting nature of zuranolone, while they're using in combination with the antidepressant standard, antidepressants. as they get that real-world experience and we can publish redwood data and the shoreline data and they get more comfortable with their treatment data, that will give us the opportunity to expand the label and to evolve that paradigm to that treatment as needed approach that we think is really important for patients. and that's what we hear back from patients and physicians. this is what's important to them. and it's giving them multiple approaches as to how to treat mdd and allow us a chance to evolve that paradigm over time.
operator
thank you. [operator instructions] our next question comes from ritu baral with cowen. your line is open.
lyla youssef -- cowen -- analyst
hi. this is lyla on for ritu. thank you for taking the question and congrats on the progress so far. i was wondering if you could maybe speak to the dropout rates or maybe patients lost a follow-up that you're seeing with shoreline? did covid have any impact on your ability to follow-up with patients? and can you remind us that patients need to come in for the treatment, or they can initiate via telemedicine and have it delivered to their home? thank you.
jeff jonas -- chief executive officer and member of board of directors
this is jeff. we've not seen much of an issue with that. and i think we've always used various maneuvers to assure compliance in terms of follow-up. and if you take a look at our six-month data compared to most psychiatric trials, we have an astonishing amount of follow-up, i think was almost 80%. that's really i mean -- i've done this a long time.
and that's a very good follow-up number and part of this is due to the diligence of the teams and the nature of the trial designs that we instituted to encourage patients to maintain the blind. and if you look at what we did with mountain in particular, i'd argue that -- i can't -- i don't think we can find another six-month blinded follow-up of any drug after the drug has been discontinued and just watch these patients naturalistically. so, we haven't seen really this much as an issue.
as i mentioned, we've done a number of internal maneuvers to show compliance and the team has done a great job with that. but one of the things about covid is that i think people are depressed, they do need treatment. and depression is a serious medical disorder, and it has not discouraged patients from either participating in trials or in their follow-up.
lyla youssef -- cowen -- analyst
great. thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from salveen richter with goldman sachs. your line is open.
salveen richter -- goldman sachs -- analyst
good morning. thanks for taking my question. with regard to the six-month follow-up cohort in the mountain study, could you just help us understand how the placebo and 20-milligram arms compared to the 30-milligram at six months?
jeff jonas -- chief executive officer and member of board of directors
actually, i'll start and then i'm going to turn it over to jim. so remember in the overall trial, we did not achieve significance so as -- but, the interesting finding in the overall population as regardless of treatment in the overall population that the patients who got better tended to stay better. so, we were interested. and again, that runs counter to the current dogma about depression, which was -- we were fascinated by, because it's not what you would -- what people have been taught.
but we've seen this in most of our studies. and at six months, we've seen the same thing regardless of treatment. the problem with -- of course, in the overall population is that what you see is like with any medical disorder, when people -- whoever people are, when they get better, they get better that would be through a community-acquired pneumonia study where people get better versus penicillin.
but the interesting finding in the mountain study was in the relevant population where we saw a treatment effect 24 and above, and that's why we looked at it. there we saw continued separation from placebo. and that persisted whether or not the patient was on an ssri. and it is important to note that minority of the patients, only 30%, were on ssris.
so, this is a really unique finding for us and one that we think continues to in a step-wise fashion, derisk our thesis, that there is a way to treat patients with depression, with a drug that acts rapidly and can get people better without the necessity for maintenance therapy. just so you know, we think this is a pretty unique finding. we are going to publish this and prepare for presentation because we think some of the sciences is important. and it's likely we'll wait for the shoreline data because we think that there's a lot we've learned now about the natural history of depression in the modern world that is really runs counter to all the dogma that i think people accept that if you're depressed, you are a chronic mental patient. and we've been very encouraged by the six-month data. and we think it's unique and we're looking forward that we will be publishing it and presenting it.
salveen richter -- goldman sachs -- analyst
okay. thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from andrew tsai with jefferies. your line is open.
andrew tsai -- jefferies -- analyst
thanks. good morning. maybe just to follow-up on salveen's question, of course, and press release has noted a large majority of patients maintain response regardless of arm. so, i'm just wondering for the placebo arm conceptually, could a durable response that you saw be attributed to background ssris kicking in after six weeks to eight weeks or what could be the explanation of that? thanks.
jeff jonas -- chief executive officer and member of board of directors
well, this is jeff. i mean, you have to pretend that if you look at this like a regular disease. so, in the original study obviously, we didn't have significant separation. so it's hard to interpret those data. what you're seeing in the large -- and again, just imagine if you have anyone spontaneously remitting from any disease, they spontaneously remit. so if you have one patient, that remission curve will look the same as 100 patients.
so, it's hard to make much of the overall population, except to say, yes, you're right, everyone was a lot on antidepressants, they could have rescue therapy. so that's why when the study, we turned to the 24 and above, where the study showed difference. and that's why -- which, of course, the relevant population. and that's the majority of the patients in the study, and there you don't see any drift at all. you just simply see the patients -- 75% of the patients maintain their response after six months.
the other point to make and remember is that the relevant question and we're not really dealing with it today because i don't want to -- we don't want to be -- we don't want to sort of cherry-pick the data. if you look at responders, the majority, almost a large majority maintain their response and -- even without intervention.
and when you go back to the early days, and i think someone mentioned this earlier, when you look at curves in the original study, you sort of see those curves creep up sometimes and creep down. you got to remember those curves represent combinations of non-responders and responders. so here, we did a blinded study after six months and we just observed stability. i understand for everyone, it's counterintuitive.
but it looks as though the natural history of depression, remembering two-thirds of these patients were on ssris, it actually looks like a medical disorder. we know depression waxes and wanes. and it looks as though that it looks just like any other medical disorder. if you get better and you have an accessible treatment, you stay better. the difference is in all of these approaches, even in the mountain, the original study, the patients on drug get -- show separation from placebo much more very rapidly within days.
so you do you see benefit within the first two weeks even though in mountain, we didn't see -- didn't quite a treat in significance. and for us, plus the six-month data, that really supports the utility and the rapid rrt approach. we do see early separation, as well as our overall thesis that one can treat depression very differently.
andrew tsai -- jefferies -- analyst
great. that makes sense. thanks for the added color.

yatin suneja -- guggenheim -- analyst
hey, guys. thank you for taking my question and congrats on the faster-than-expected enrollment in some of the trials. just a question quick one on mountain. have you looked at the data in terms of its consistency between men and women, given that this neurosteroid is more implicated in women, any differences you saw in sort of the responses? and then the second part of the question is i think jeff, you did mention a p-value of 0.6 [phonetic], i missed it. could you just tell me or just confirm what you were referring to in the mountain follow-up? thank you.
jeff jonas -- chief executive officer and member of board of directors
i'll answer the quick one and then i'll turn it over to jim. we looked at the difference that whether it was maintained on the 24 and above, right. so if you're looking at, see if there's a difference, you got to start with the population where there was a difference. and that was not the majority of the population was 24 and above and even though it wasn't powered for significance after six months on the blinded analysis, the p-value between placebo and drug was about 0.06. so, it almost maintained its significance after six months, which was we thought a very remarkable finding, considering that this was a long-term study and it wasn't powered for that. i'll turn the rest over to jim.
jim doherty -- chief research officer
yes and to your other question, yes, of course, we have looked for whether or not there are differences between men and women as well as the number of other demographic factors in the study. and the short answer is, we don't see any difference between genders in the study.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from thomas lavery with morgan stanley. your line is open.
thomas lavery -- morgan stanley -- analyst
good morning, and thanks for taking my question. i have a question about sage-718. the topline data in parkinson's disease is expected later this year. what kind of data do you need to see -- to move this program ahead next year? thank you.
jim doherty -- chief research officer
yeah, so this is jim doherty. i'll take that one. so, the study that we're talking about is looking at the effects of sage-718 with relatively short-term dosing in parkinson's patients with cognitive impairment. and what we're doing is building off the results that we had talked to you all about at the end of last year, showing that in huntington's patients, we're able to see acutely an improvement in executive function and other aspects of cognitive function.
and so, because this is such a novel space, and because this is such a novel approach, and because we were so happy to see the results that we saw from the huntington's patients, rather than move forward with the very first patient population that we saw into a more detailed placebo-controlled study, we decided to pause and go through the activity of looking at various patient populations. so that's what this study is now.
we're going to essentially run a similar short duration study in open-label format in parkinson's patients similar to what we did in huntington's patients to see if that's another patient population that can benefit. we'll also look at other neurodegenerative disorders. and really, this is all built on the role of the nmda receptor in cognitive function. there's reason to believe that you can see a broad improvement in cognitive function across more than one patient population. and so, that's what we'll do with the next study in pd patients is really look to see if we can expand the results that we've seen to-date in hd patients.

thanks for the question. right, i think obviously, it will depend on the data from waterfall and the data from shoreline. right now, we still have to have some larger study or some study like the longer-term analysis, but when we see waterfall, one of the things we're going to have to take a hard look at is based on the six-month data, we're not seeing a lot of relapses. if you think about patients getting the drug treatment, and you're thinking about 75% of patients maintaining their effect regardless of background therapy or no background therapy, yeah, that's something we'll need to take up with the agency, because initially, we had only had follow-up data out to day 42, and we had assumed that people would need sort of recurrent treatment. i think that assumption so far is being challenged by the six-month data. and we'll have to take a look hard or look at shoreline, and shoreline, which we're optimistic about now, based on the six-month data gives us something like that. we'll revisit what long-term data we might need, if waterfall reports out positively. steve or jim, you want to add anything to that?
jim doherty -- chief research officer
yeah, i'll just say a few things. i mean, first of all, just to remind everyone, this is a program that's proceeding under breakthrough therapy designation, which gives us an opportunity to have interactions across the board. and so as the data unfold, we're able to interact with the fda and talk about what the potential pathways forward are as breakthrough because we share our understanding of the urgency for developing an entirely new therapy. and that's what this whole program has been designed to do.
so yeah, when we have data, we'll do -- we always do, we just go back to the agency. remember, it's not just the clinical efficacy data, it's also informed data and everything else that we've been consistently showing across the board. and now with more than 2,500 patients that have been exposed to the drug, we have a very clear idea on what the overall adverse event profile or safety profile is. so a lot of information comes through, all of which will lead to the most efficient regulatory strategy forward. so, there is a lot of words to say, as the data unfold, we'll have those discussions and identify the most efficient path forward for patients.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from cory kasimov from jpmorgan. your line is open.
cory kasimov -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
hey. good morning, guys. thanks for fitting me in. so for the rrt study that's on top to begin in the second half, do you plan to piggyback on top of your existing mdd sites? or will they be separate? i guess i'm just curious how fast this can go, since it sounds like this would represent the initial mdd filing? thank you.
jeff jonas -- chief executive officer and member of board of directors
yes, there'll be a combination of sites. i mean, waterfall is moving quick. we have a lot of really well-performing sites. so, i think that we'll continue to try to execute quickly. i think that one of the lessons of waterfall and the lessons of this whole of this year has been that our ability to leverage our infrastructure that we've developed over time, and the team's ability to move quickly from protocol-to-protocol. so, we'll be doing that as well.
we do think the design of these studies -- we do design the studies to be, want a better word, palatable to the investigators and sites. and one of the advantages of zuranolone in general has been that two-week course of therapy patient -- potential patient benefit quickly has been very -- has been greeted with a lot of enthusiasm by treating clinicians. that's one of the encouraging things that we've seen throughout all of this. jim, i don't know if you want to add anything to that.
jim doherty -- chief research officer
yeah, i would just add, jeff that we have a pretty large network of sites. and so, we're confident that we're going to be able to run all the studies and keep ourselves on track for all of them.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from laura chico with wedbush securities. your line is open.
kenneth shields -- wedbush securities -- analyst
hi, this is kenneth on for laura. thanks for taking the question. so on skylark, zulresso sales were clearly impacted by covid. and while the extended disruptions appear to have stabilized since the spring, what are your expectations around recruitment base? and with data in 2021, how should we be thinking about the number of sites that will be necessary for recruitment? and will this be fully outpatient? thank you.
jim doherty -- chief research officer
sure. thanks for the question. this is jim. yes, i think the important thing to remember for skylark is that with zuranolone what we're talking about is an outpatient therapy. and so, that's just a different opportunity than with zulresso. but certainly from a recruiting perspective, we're anticipating that we're going to be able to recruit for the skylark study in a comparable way to what we're seeing on our other studies with zuranolone. it's a smaller patient population and so, of course, there will be an impact there. but i think the -- probably the most important thing is that with an oral drug in an outpatient setting, it's just a slightly different situation. steve, do you want to add anything?
steve kanes -- chief medical officer
yeah. i was just saying with covid, mike referred to that as impacting patients sort of being able to be admitted to the hospital for treatment. on the other side of that, of course, is that there is enormous unmet need and that's only growing with increased isolation of women in the face of being delivering without significant others in the delivery room and having to go home without the support of family members and so forth.
the rates and potential interest in postpartum depression is only growing. so as jim said, the trial itself is an outpatient trial. it gets around some of those logistical challenges. and just based on our experience with execution, we anticipate being able to enroll that in a very similar way as we have with waterfall. so the important issue, it's an important disorder and one that we've been committed to for a long time.
mike cloonan -- chief operating officer
and i'll just come in [phonetic], this is mike as well. i think it's important for a couple of points. one is, as we said, we have those distinct paths now for zuranolone. we have the ppd path with skylark, right, one study we'll be able to seek approval there. we have the two paths with mdd both the rrt indication and the episodic. and the one point i'll also make in combination with things, very different profiles, right on the ppd side between zulresso and zuranolone, right, the rapid acting nature is still there, but an oral therapy that patients aren't going to have to go into a hospital to receive the 60-hour infusion, right. we're still very excited about the ppd market and what we think zuranolone can do there.
kenneth shields -- wedbush securities -- analyst
okay. thanks so much.
operator
thank you. and our last question is from jay olson with oppenheimer. your line is open.
jay olson -- oppenheimer & co. -- analyst
hi. thanks for taking the question. were you surprised by the durability of zuranolone in the six months mountain follow-up? and how do you plan to leverage that finding with regards to your filing strategy and ultimately your target product profile for zuranolone?
jeff jonas -- chief executive officer and member of board of directors
hi. this is jeff. thanks for that question. i don't want to use the word surprise, i guess i'd say we were gratified that the data that we've acquired to date overall of our studies can be now be extended out to six months. we're aware, and as i said in my opening remarks that this is really counter to the narrative about depression that you enlist -- that patients enlist themselves as chronic mental health patients for the rest of their lives that they're so delicate that they have to stay on treatment for years and years. and those of us who are treated these patients, we've always wanted something better, and we've wanted something different.
and so, i think we've been gratified by it. i do think that the data really do -- i wouldn't say surprised, but the data really don't run counted like i think steve and i are both psychiatrists don't run counter to our personal experiences and how we used to treat patients, but it really does -- it is surprisingly inconsistent with the pharmacomythology about how to treat depression. and so, we do think that data, we continue to -- this is just another step and we do think that these data though do inform what might come from shoreline. and if we can sustain this, we think the profile of the drug will be unique. we think that the ability to get patients better more rapidly to have a tolerable side-effect profile and to eliminate the necessity for automatic chronic pharmacotherapy will be in a really important treatment option for patients that otherwise are looking at years, potentially years of ssri therapy.
so, we're very encouraged by it. and we intend to think about how we could disrupt the treatment from our paradigm, and that'll be of course, mike's job once we have the data. but we do think these data are an important next step where you're not seeing rebound, you're not seeing withdrawal, you're seeing very good -- you're not seeing any sign, you're seeing really good durability.
now, the other thing i'd point out though is we've said early on that the thesis behind these drugs and the mechanism behind some of the neural stories is the ability to alter post-synaptic receptor trafficking. and we've always thought about restoring normal homeostatic mechanisms in the brain. and in that respect, we've always believed that zuranolone is a distinct [technical issues]. it's not really what other people call an antidepressant. it's something different. it's something that normalizes mood, potentially normalizes neural circuitry, and potentially offers a reset of mood function. so, we think the six-month data really represent this sort of paradigm shift and how one can think about major depressive disorder. so, we do think that we're on the way to doing it. we think that this will be an important treatment option for patients and it's one we intend to continue to pursue.
jay olson -- oppenheimer & co. -- analyst
super helpful. thanks for taking the question.

thank you. i'd now like to turn the call back over to jeff jonas for closing remarks.
jeff jonas -- chief executive officer and member of board of directors
well, again, thanks, everyone for joining us this morning. i know you're all busy, and i hope everyone's healthy and your families are healthy. to close, i just want to reiterate three important points. the team at sage has done a great job executing on our clinical programmers, all of which remain on track or ahead of schedule. as you've heard today, we have numerous catalysts over the next 18 months. and sage is really proud of our discovery and medicinal chemistry group for developing this really -- what makes us unique, our rich pipeline of novel and internally developed clinical assets, which we believe have the potential to help literally millions of people.
so with that, i'm looking forward to updating all of you in the future with all of our milestones and hope all of you stay well and have a great day.

barry greene -- president, chief executive officer & director
thanks, jeff, and thank you, everyone, for joining us this morning. as we pass the 1-year mark of the unprecedented public health crisis created by the covid-19 pandemic, i'm extremely optimistic that we're turning the corner in containing this devastating impact the virus has had on society. however, and this is critically important, there is a hidden pandemic, the brain health pandemic. and while more and more is coming out about this pandemic, there's a long way to go.
indeed, as we know, during the covid pandemic, we've seen rates of depression in the u.s. alone increased fourfold, while suicidality among adults has nearly doubled. these will likely affect the world for years to come, broadening the unmet need and further exposing the urgent need for novel brain health medicines. and i'm very proud of the ongoing efforts at sage to make medicines that address the very real crisis in brain health. i'm pleased to report the significant advances we made over the last quarter across our depression, neuropsychiatry and neurology franchises as we continue our mission to become the leading brain health company and a top-tier biopharmaceutical company.
i believe the progress we made in the first quarter of 2021 sets up for short, medium and long-term value creation opportunities as we further advance our deep sage invented organic pipeline. at sage, we believe we have the potential to transform the lives of millions of people with brain health disorders, who are in need of new innovative therapies by modulating the gaba and nmda pathways. now by understanding endogenous receptors, applying our unique chemical innovation to neuroactive steroids, including oxysterol chemistries, we have created novel therapeutics designed to modulate these pathways in highly specific and highly tailored ways. we currently have three programs in late-stage development with 4 ongoing phase iii trials, all of which are on track to read out this year. additionally, we have 4 mid- and early stage programs in clinical development, and we're committed to the goal of developing two or more high-quality inds per year starting in 2023. in particular, this quarter, we were thrilled to report positive top line data from our 2 lead programs, zuranolone, the lead program in our depression franchise and sage-324, the lead product in our neurology franchise.
in march, we reported continued positive 12-month data from the 30-milligram cohort and interim data from the 50-milligram cohort of the ongoing phase iii open-label shoreline study, evaluating the safety, tolerability and need for repeat dosing with zuranolone in adults with major depressive disorder. the 30-milligram showed that approximately 70% of participants had a positive response to an initial 2-week treatment and required at most 1 additional zuranolone treatment during the 12-month study period. and after the initial 2-week zuranolone treatment, more than 70% of patients who received 30 milligrams and 80% of patients who received 50 milligrams achieved positive response at day 15. when we embarked on the landscape program, our goal was to develop a rapid acting, short duration, durable, treat-as-needed option, and we believe the data from shoreline support this potential product profile.
moving to the late-stage program in our neurology franchise, sage-324, we recently announced a positive phase ii data from our kinetic study of sage-324 in essential tremor. to remind you, what we were looking for from the study was a reduction in tremor amplitude of 30% to 50% that was sustained for the full study period. in other words, no loss of effect or tachyphylaxis. we're also looking for no adverse event surprises.
the kinetic study achieved our objectives and more. we saw a statistically significant reduction from baseline in the tetras item 4 upper limb tremor score at day 29 compared to placebo. the safety profile was generally consistent with previously reported data for sage-324. and just to be clear, we believe sage-324 has tremendous potential in essential tremor. the results from the study are statistically significant reduction in tremor and a statistically significant correlation in tremor reduction to activities of daily living are meaningful indicators that further development and optimization of dosing with sage-324 are important next steps as we think about fine-tuning the therapeutic index and commercial profile for its important potential therapy.
and to further set some context for the kinetic study, we designed the study to evaluate what we knew was the high end of the dosing rate. we're looking for a big effect on tremor with no surprise adverse events. we administered the dose in the morning with the understanding patients would experience somnolence. our goal was to gain an understanding of the pk/pd characteristics for sage-324 and identify plasma levels correlated to efficacy. we look forward to presenting these data at a later time and in working with our collaborator at biogen to optimize next steps for the continued development of sage-324 with a dosing frequency for phase iii.
at this time, we don't think additional formulation work is necessary. we're confident the work proposed to be done in a planned phase iib trial will result in dose and frequency designed to optimize benefit risk and further development for essential tremor. this quarter also marked progress across our neuropsychiatry franchise, where we are evaluating sage-718, a first-in-class nmda receptor pam as a potential oral therapy for cognitive disorders associated with nmda receptor dysfunction. i'll provide an update on the positive data from the phase ii paradigm study in a moment, but i want to confirm that we intend to initiate a phase ii trial in huntington disease later this year as an important step toward pursuing the initial indication for sage-718. assuming, of course, the data continues to support that path.
recall, we previously reported encouraging phase i open-label data in measures of executive function in patients with hd. and this, combined with consistent positive data on test of executive function we saw in paradigm study as well as our discussions with key opinion leaders, patients and regulators to support huntington's disease as a target for our initial indication. now on paradigm, the interim data cut showed patients demonstrated improved performance from baseline on multiple tests of executive function over 14 days of treatment. results are very similar to previous results in healthy volunteers and patients with huntington's disease and further support development of sage-718 for cognitive dysfunction.
steve will provide additional details on this exciting data, but it's clear that sage-718 has the potential to become a very important treatment for multiple diseases for cognitive dysfunction or the need for better executive function is a driver of disability. in addition to hd and further work in parkinson's, we intend to evaluate several other paths forward with sage-718, including cognitive dysfunction associated with alzheimer's disease with the ongoing luminary study in alzheimer's disease on track to read out later this year. this means that by later this year, in addition to initiating a placebo-controlled phase ii for huntington's disease, we expect to have completed all 3 data readouts for sage-718 as we accelerate our efforts to move this program forward.
with that, i'll turn the call over to steve for more detail on the data we reported this quarter as well as our additional clinical programs. steve?
stephen kanes -- chief medical officer
thanks, barry, and good morning, everyone. we've made great progress across all 3 franchises to date, including positive data from our zuranolone and sage-324 program, as barry mentioned, as well as positive results with sage-718 and the paradigm study. since our path toward hd as the initial indications and supported further by the results of the paradigm study is the news of the day, i'd like to spend the majority of the next several minutes reviewing the progress in our neuropsychiatry franchise and our vision for further development of sage-718, our nmda receptor pam in development as a potential oral therapy for disorders where cognition is one of the main drivers of disability, including the very encouraging results from paradigm we're announcing today.
before i get to the paradigm results, and given the broad spectrum of potential indications for our nmda program, we thought it would be really important to first level set and ensure that we clearly define what we're talking about when we use the word cognition. cognition can be defined as the sum of all of our mental abilities, a fairly abstract definition, but 2 key domains of cognition are executive function and learning and memory. executive function is the conductor of the brain's orchestra. it controls our ability to plan, make decisions and also adjust to the challenges or new situations as they arise. it's also the core skill that allows us to react and adapt in real-time to navigate our constantly changing and evolving environment. executive functioning touches so many aspects of what we do on a daily basis, that it becomes very difficult to operate independently as executive function declines for example, in huntington's and parkinson's diseases. you're probably also familiar with the concept of learning and memory, which is the ability to take in information, file it away in our brain's internal organization system and then retrieve it at the appropriate time and place. what we don't expect to see, based on our mechanism of action, are any impact positive or deleterious on performance metrics like attention and psychomotor speed. so what's so exciting about sage-718 is that beginning with healthy volunteers and then patients with huntington's disease, we were looking for and saw improvements in executive function. and now in patients with parkinson's disease, sage-718 has showed a positive impact on multiple domains of cognition, including executive function and learning and memory, while not altering simple attention or reaction time, which are performance but not true cognitive attributes typically enhanced by amphetamines.
to our knowledge, there's nothing to date in clinical development that has generated data suggesting this kind of profile. the potential ability to augment key cognitive domains without the challenges often associated with other approaches.
turning now to paradigm. these data reinforce and extend previous cognitive findings in the new patient population, parkinson's disease. today, i'm going to provide a brief summary of what we've seen with this initial data cut. to date, there have been 8 patients aged 50 to 75 years old with mild cognitive impairment due to parkinson's disease who received sage-718 3 milligrams daily for 2 weeks. similar to earlier findings in healthy volunteers as well as in patients with huntington's disease, patients in the paradigm study demonstrate improved performance from baseline on multiple tests of executive functioning over 14 days of treatment.
it's also important to note that in the study, sage-718 had no impact on attention and psychomotor speed, signals that are typically associated with other approaches like stimulants. emerging signals from the paradigm study also suggest that there are improvements in performance on tests of learning and memory over a similar time frame, an important finding as sage-718 is currently being evaluated in another phase ii open-label study, the luminary study in patients with mild cognitive impairment and mild dementia due to alzheimer's disease.
as in previous studies, sage-718 was generally well tolerated. specifically, there were no serious adverse events and no treatment-emergent adverse events were determined to be related to sage-718. it's worth repeating, we have not seen any serious adverse events or treatment-emergent adverse events related to sage-718 across all studies. sage-718 continues to demonstrate from these early trials, a consistent and promising profile as a potential treatment to address multiple aspects of cognitive impairment. and so i'm excited by the performance of sage-718 in the paradigm study, and we intend to activate a 4-week dosing arm in the paradigm study to gather additional data in the pd patient population and inform next steps. the data from paradigm also reinforced our decision to move forward in huntington's disease where sage-718 has performed similarly in an earlier phase i trial.
so, we're planning to advance into a double-blind, placebo-controlled phase ii study in huntington's later this year, and if positive, will bring us one step closer in pursuing the initial indication for sage-718. we'll provide greater detail on study design as we get closer to trial initiation. but what i can share is that we'll be studying a similar battery of cognition tests as previously studied with the goal of sustained changes out to 3 months. hd is an orphan disease estimated to affect more than 20,000 people in the united states, and cognitive deterioration is one of the earliest and most disabling features of this devastating neurodegenerative disease. cognitive impairment may begin years before a formal diagnosis, and with no available treatment to slow the progression of decline leading to loss of independence, the unmet need for these patients is significant. we have very high ambitions for our nmda platform, with the ability to target conditions where cognitive deficits really impair patients' ability to lead independent lives.
in addition to sage-718, our neuropsych franchise also includes sage-904, an nmda receptor pam product candidate being evaluated as a potential oral therapy for other disorders associated with nmda hypofunction. this is currently an ongoing phase i study that we plan to complete this year. and sage-421, an oral nmda pam is being evaluated for potential use in neurodevelopmental disorders and cognitive recovery and rehabilitation, which we expect to advance to preclinical studies later this year.
turning now to our neurology franchise. we recently announced positive top line data from our phase ii double-blind kinetic study of sage-324, 60 milligrams in essential tremor. in earlier open-label studies, sage-324 demonstrated pharmacologic characteristics, we believe are well suited for development opportunities, not only in essential tremor, but also in epilepsy and parkinson's disease. in the study, 69 patients aged 18 to 80 years old were randomized 1:1 to receive either 60-milligram sage-324 or matched placebo once daily in the morning for 28 days with a follow-up period of an additional 2 weeks. the trial evaluated treatment of sage-324 at the high end of the dose range and the daily dose could be down titrated to 45 or 30 milligrams if 60 was deemed to be not well tolerated. the primary endpoint of the study was changed from baseline compared to placebo on day 29 in upper limb tremor score as measured by item 4 of the tetras performance subscale, a physician-administered scale designed to provide an accurate, comprehensive assessment of essential tremor motor symptoms and has been shown to correlate with tetras activity of daily living.
we are pleased the study met its primary endpoint, a statistically significant reduction in tetras item 4 upper limb tremor score from baseline at day 29 in the prespecified full analysis set compared to placebo with a p-value of 0.049, which corresponds to a 36% reduction from baseline and upper limb tremor amplitude in patients receiving sage-324 versus a 21% reduction in patients receiving placebo.
in patients with more severe tremor at baseline, with a median tetras performance subscale upper limb tremor item 4 score of 12 or higher, sage-324 demonstrated a statistically significant reduction from baseline in tetras item 4 upper limb at day 29 compared to placebo with a p-value of 0.007 that corresponds to a 41% reduction from baseline in tremor amplitude at day 29 compared to an 18% reduction for placebo. 62% of patients who received sage-324 down titrated in dose, as allowed by the study protocol, discontinuations were noted in 38% of patients receiving sage-324. adverse events were generally consistent with the safety profile of sage-324 seen to date and with other gaba pams. treatment emerging adverse events that occurred in 10% or more of patients in the sage-324 treatment group and a rate at least twice as high as that of patients in the placebo group were somnolence, dizziness, balance disorder, diplopia, dysarthria and deep disturbance. these data exceeded our expectations for the 60-milligram dose, and we're focusing on optimizing dose and frequency for the ongoing development of sage-324 in essential tremor, along with our collaborators at biogen.
we're encouraged by the potential of sage-324 for essential tremor, a disorder with a high unmet need. as barry mentioned, we're confident in our ability to develop a dose and frequency regimen for further development in the chronic treatment of essential tremor. beyond sage-324, our neurology franchise includes sage-689, a potent investigational product with rapid absorption, good viability and solid formulation flexibility with potential in areas of high unmet need, including acute agitation, mania or even migraine. we're also planning to advance sage-319, an oral extrasynaptic gabaa receptor-preferring pam to preclinical studies for potential use in disorders of social interaction.
turning to our depression franchise. in march, we reported continued positive data from our phase iii shoreline study which was designed to naturalistically follow patients with major depressive disorder and evaluate the safety and tolerability of zuranolone 30 milligrams in adults for up to 1 year. as a reminder, the study was amended in may 2020 to include a 50-milligram dose of zuranolone. data reported showed that after the initial 2 weeks zuranolone treatment, more than 70% of patients who received 30 milligrams and 80% of patients who received 50 milligrams achieved positive response by day 15.
in the 30-milligram cohort at day 15, the mean change from baseline was 15.2 points and 73.5% of patients achieved response. and 40% achieved remission as measured by a ham-d score of less than or equal to 7. approximately 70% of participants with positive response to an initial 2 week 30 milligram treatment required it most when additional zuranolone treatment during the 12-month study. in the 50-milligram cohort at day 15 of the initial treatment course, the mean ham-d change from baseline was 16. 80.5% of patients achieved response and 43.2% achieved remission. of the 489 patients in the 30-milligram cohort continuing in the study, 42.9% used only the single initial zuranolone course, 25.6% used a total of 2 courses, 11.9% used a total of 3 courses, 10.8% used a total of 4 courses, and 8.8% used a total of 5 courses. in both cohorts, zuranolone was generally well tolerated with an adverse event profile consistent with data reported earlier. we're also announcing plans to reopen enrollment in the 50-milligram cohort of the shoreline study, increasing the target enrollment to 500 patients. we remain on track to report top line 1-year data from shoreline 50 milligrams in late 2021 with data from the expanded 50-milligram cohort expected in 2022. additionally, we plan to offer patients from the coral study, the ability to roll over into the shoreline study following completion of the coral study.
these extensions allow sage to collect additional long-term data on patients treated with zuranolone 50 milligrams. and finally, we remain on track to report top line data from the phase iii waterfall study in the first half of this year and from phase iii coral and skylark studies by the end of the year. this was an important quarter for sage marked by progress across our entire pipeline. we're excited about the year ahead with several milestones in front of us, including multiple phase iii readouts expected. we believe this progress positions us well to continue to expand and accelerate our pipeline in order to advance our mission of making medicines that matter.
i'll now turn the call over to kimi for a review of the financials. kimi?
kimi iguchi -- chief financial officer & treasurer
thanks, steve. let me start by congratulating the sage team on another great quarter as a result of their commitment, determination and execution. we're off to a great start in 2021, reporting positive data from 3 trials with another 7, including 3 pivotal trials on track to read out later this year. as a reminder, this is the first full quarter of our transformative collaboration with biogen for zuranolone and sage-324. this collaboration includes 50-50 cost and profit sharing for zuranolone in sage-324 in the united states. by design, the collaboration provides financial and operational flexibility, enabling us to potentially expand and accelerate not only our near-term development of zuranolone in sage-324, but also increase investment in our wholly owned products and accelerate our pipeline.
so, now let me walk through the highlights of our first quarter financials and then close on some thoughts on our financial guidance. revenues were $1.6 million in the first quarter from the sales of zulresso. that was compared to $2.3 million for the same period of 2020. we remain committed to moms, their families and all those impacted by ppd. our targeted commercial efforts aim to help moms with ppd who may benefit from treatment with zulresso gain access. selling, general and administrative expenses were $40 million in the first quarter compared to $70 million for the same period of 2020. the decrease in sg&a expenses was primarily due to the restructuring the company underwent during the second quarter of 2020. research and development expenses were $58 million in the first quarter, that was compared to $64 million for the same period of 2020. the decrease was primarily a result of the $22 million reimbursement by biogen related to the ongoing zuranolone sage-324 clinical programs and offset by an increase in spending on our waterfall and coral study.
going forward, and prior to launch, we expect r&d and sg&a expenses related to zuranolone in sage-324 will represent approximately 50% of total collaboration program costs regardless of whether sage or biogen performs the work. essentially, this sharing of expenses establishes a new baseline for sage, representing a lower net investment for spend on zuranolone in sage-324. collaboration spend will increase as the programs advance, but will continue to be shared with biogen 50-50 in the u.s. additionally, this allows us to further invest in our wholly owned pipeline including sage-718 and our discovery engine. we reported a net loss of $96 million for the first quarter of 2021. that was compared to $127 million for the comparable period of 2020. finally, we continue to maintain a solid financial foundation, ending the first quarter of the year with $2 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. we do not expect any milestone payments from collaborations during 2021 and anticipate ending the year with a cash balance of more than $1.7 billion.
the cash on hand in addition to the ongoing cost-sharing with biogen, will allow us to work to expand and accelerate the pipeline and continue to invest thoughtfully, sequencing assets we believe will create near, mid and long-term value creation opportunities for our stakeholders, with the potential, if we're successful, to positively impact more than 450 million people worldwide.

[operator instructions] our first question will come from the line of salveen richter from goldman sachs.
andrea tan -- goldman sachs group -- analyst
this is andrea on for salveen. maybe just 1 on this additional 4-week dosing cohort for the paradigm study, just if you could provide a little bit more color on what you're looking to understand there.
barry greene -- president, chief executive officer & director
yes. andrea, i'll start out and then turn it over to jim for additional detail. so you're asking about sage-718. we're really excited by the neuropsych franchise and sage-718, our first sort of nmda receptor modulator in clinical studies. and as we talked about on the call, we're very excited by the forward progress into huntington's disease as our initial indication and the continued efficacy and safety profile we're seeing with sage-718 through the luminary data that we reported out today. so all in all, we have a very robust package. in doing drug development, we're looking to learn more and more as we advance sage-718, and maybe jim can talk about some specifics with the 4-week program or 4-week study.
jim doherty -- chief research officer
yes. absolutely. thanks, barry. yes. so of course, as barry said, we're very excited about the potential for sage-718 and for the nmda platform in general. and i think one of the things you're hearing today from steve is that we're seeing consistent types of responses across multiple patient populations now. so some of the design in the study for paradigm was to keep things as close as possible to what we had done previously. so we're only varying patient population. and so because of that, the design for paradigm was quite similar to what we had done before a 2-week dosing period. given the results that we're seeing today and given the investment that we've made to get the trial to this point, as we've done in the past, we're trying to be efficient here and continue to leverage our learnings and collect as much information as possible. and so moving to a part b where patients that are already teed up to enter into the trial to give us some information on slightly longer dosing interval is going to advance our understanding of the whole program.
operator
our next question comes from the line of ritu baral from cowen.
ritu baral -- cowen & company -- analyst
i wanted to get your color on helping us inform the upcoming waterfall safety data. specifically, i've had a lot of conversations with clients about what is acceptable sedation, and what is acceptable somnolence. just going back to mountain data, where you saw 6% to 7%, i believe, rates of each. and given the higher dose, how should we think about what's acceptable? and is there a threshold, a written threshold in the public domain by fda on what might complicate actual approval either on sedation or somnolence?
barry greene -- president, chief executive officer & director
yes, ritu. let me start out with some context, and then i'll ask steve to talk about what we're looking for out of waterfall more specifically and why we think zuranolone has the potential to be a transformative medicine. so i'll remind you that we have studied zuranolone in over 3,000 subjects and patients. and to date, the profile we've seen is extraordinarily consistent. we've seen rapid onset of action in 3 to 4 days, patients report they're feeling better. as we reported on the shoreline data, and i won't repeat everything steve said, we've seen remarkable efficacy 2 weeks, both 30 and 50, with most patients requiring only 1 or 2, 2-week doses in the entire year. and the safety profile has been consistent also at dose and dose levels.
what's important is not necessarily specific numbers of adverse events, it's whether patients stay on the drug or not. and because of the unique profile here, literally 2 weeks, maybe 2 to 4 weeks of dosing, we've seen remarkable compliance. and what we're looking for here is a drug that patients will take for 2 weeks, so they get better, faster and stay better. and what we said, and just to be clear, if we hit the primary endpoint, given the different benefit risk of zuranolone, over 35 years' worth of antidepressants, we have a very important medicine in the landscape.
let me ask steve to turn -- to provide a little bit more color.
stephen kanes -- chief medical officer
yes. so ritu, thanks for the question. so first and foremost, we're really confident in the profile, every bit of information that we get from the trials really points to a unique profile, both in terms of benefit as well as in terms of what the adverse event profile might look like. i remind you and your clients on a few things. number one, somnolence is something that is often desirable for patients with depression, many people have sleep disruptions. and we believe that's what's leading to the much smaller dropout rate, very low dropout rate from our clinical trials. we do exit interviews and patients' perceptions are that, that's not something that would potentially limit their use. remember, patients are taking the medication for 2 weeks in any case, and often this can be beneficial. many of these people are taking additional meds to help them sleep.
the second is the numbers that we're reporting are actually comparable, if not better, than many drugs that are used right now to treat depression. and so i'd advise people to take a look at the labels for antidepressants that are in common use. and the reports that we have for either somnolence, sedation and so forth, are well within the parameters of drugs that are approved for the treatment of depression, even standard antidepressants.
so right now the profile is one that we know it's going to be beneficial for patients. we're looking forward to the waterfall data, but we're very confident in terms of the overall profile.
operator
our next question will come from the line of tazeen ahmad from bank of america.
tazeen ahmad -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
i guess as it relates to the waterfall study, in terms of durability, just based on the work that we've done, it seems like on day 15, you should have good data. as we look beyond that to maybe longer term, say, 42, things of that nature, i guess, first of all, would you have that information available at the top line? and how important is that based on your doctor feedback to have a longer durability of response for these acute treatment regimens?
barry greene -- president, chief executive officer & director
yes, tazeen, thanks for the question. let me -- i'll start out and turn it to steve to provide a little bit more. so we're very excited and confident in our soon envelope opening for waterfall. we're looking forward to the data. and let me just be very clear, the primary endpoint in 15 days having the statistical significance is really what we're looking for this drug. there's nothing out there that gets patients better, faster and keeps them better. of course, we're looking at all the secondary endpoints and hopeful that they show promise. for day 42, what we're looking for is consistency of effect in the drug arm, not necessarily versus placebo. but again, a p-value on the primary end point is the most important aspect of waterfall. steve, do you want to provide a little bit more?
stephen kanes -- chief medical officer
sure. for many years, i was practicing psychiatrist in treating patients with depression. and the most important thing you look for is consistency of response in understanding exactly what's going to happen. so what we look for is an understanding of what to expect after somebody takes a medication. the data we've seen to date has been very consistent. majority of the patients really remain well. they don't have an immediate bounce back after the 2 weeks of dosing as an initial concern.
and in fact, even in the mountain study, patients remained well and very few had recurrences and symptoms over the course of 6 months. so while absolutely critical our primary endpoint at day 15, what we want to understand is what proportion of patients stay well during the follow-up period as well as what proportion of patients may require retreatment. those are data that we're getting for waterfall. and what we've seen is something we've talked about before, more than 70% of patients need no more than 2 treatments in a year. that's transformative for patients, and it's absolutely essential to understand that. we're talking about 4 weeks of treatment over the course of a year, 48 weeks without additional need for therapy. that's what's so unique about 217, and that's what we're looking for in both the waterfall data as well as the entire landscape program. and so it's a profile that we think is going to be really, really important for patients once we are successful.
tazeen ahmad -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
okay. and we will see that level of data at the top line?
stephen kanes -- chief medical officer
you can look to our prior releases to give you a sense of the kinds of information that we will have in the release. but as barry said, the things that we're focusing on are the primary endpoint as well as the key secondaries very similar to what we've done for other acute studies.
operator
our next question will come from the line of yasmeen rahimi from piper sandler.
yasmeen rahimi -- piper sandler & co. -- analyst
congrats on the great progress in carrying data from paradigm for us. one question for you. i just wanted to understand maybe the thoughts behind really increasing the shoreline to enroll an additional 500 patients in coral. is this expansion into the open-label based on communication that you had with regulators? if you could just put a little bit color around what prompted the interest to increase the numbers on the open-label arm would be very helpful for us.
barry greene -- president, chief executive officer & director
thanks for the question, yasmeen. i actually very much appreciate the congratulatory note on the positive data. we're very excited by the emerging data for sage-718, and we're thrilled we're moving that forward so rapidly into huntington's disease, supported by the data presented today in parkinson's disease. so back to your question about shoreline. look, we wanted an opportunity, first and foremost, as patients rolled off of clinical studies, coral, that should those patients continue to need another 2-week course of dosing. and you'll note in steve's prepared comments that very few patients require additional doses, but the good news is those that did, responded yet again. so we've got a very promising benefit risk profile with zuranolone and wanted the opportunity for other patients to benefit by zuranolone, particularly those rolling off of coral and other patients out there. jim, you want to offer other thoughts?
jim doherty -- chief research officer
i think that covers most of it, barry. but the other thing i would add is to say there are -- with an integrated set of trials in the landscape program, to barry's point, as patients are rolling off of coral, there's the opportunity for them to participate in shoreline. and we are seeing quite a lot of value in our ongoing naturalistic study for shoreline. and our view of it is that it's going to continue to provide useful information for what we believe is going to be a transformative therapeutic approach. and so we were looking at all opportunities to gather more information on zuranolone, and shoreline will very likely continue to deliver very important data to the overall program.
barry greene -- president, chief executive officer & director
yes. great comment, jim. and just to put a fine point, yasmeen, there was no specific regulatory requests or no regulatory requests at all to increase end. this was a sage decision, as jim highlighted, to provide opportunity to get more data and benefit patients.
operator
our next question will come from the line of cory kasimov from jpmorgan.
turner kufe -- jpmorgan chase & co. -- analyst
this is turner on for cory. so just one on 718. can you provide any additional granularity on what sort of improvement you saw in cognition? maybe just how it stacked up relative to your expectations, but also kind of relative to what we've seen in huntington's disease since that seems like the lead indication going forward?
barry greene -- president, chief executive officer & director
yes. thanks, turner for the question. and let me ask steve to address that.
stephen kanes -- chief medical officer
sure. what we're looking for as we move into other areas is to both look at not just executive function but learning and memory. so what we saw as we expanded the domains of cognition we looked at in these patients is not only improvements in executive function, but also learning and memory. and we think that's really important for 2 reasons. one, different patient populations have different challenges. so huntington's is executive function primarily, and that was our hypothesis going in. in parkinson's, there's both executive function, challenges as well as dementia, so learning and memory. and we think that will also lead into our broader understanding as we move into luminary and alzheimer's where the primary challenges are learning and memory. so as we learn more and more about the 718, the mechanism and its utility, that will really inform how we move forward in both the huntington's as well as the other indications.
operator
our next question will come from the line of laura chico from wedbush.
laura chico -- wedbush securities -- analyst
i just wanted to circle back on the shoreline question. so you said fda did not ask you for any additional data, but i guess i'm trying to understand, is there still a plan to submit a filing for the 30-milligram dose of zuranolone? and i guess, just back of the envelope, it would seem like with the expansion of the shoreline cohort and then enrolling the coral patients, there's probably over 1,000 subjects that would have been on the 50 mg dose at a longer-term once the study is complete. so just trying to understand how the 30-milligram dose fits into everything in terms of the regulatory strategy.
barry greene -- president, chief executive officer & director
yes. laura, thanks for the question. and let me provide some broad context and ask jim to provide a little bit more. so your math is close. we will have a significant end when submitting the package to the fda should waterfall be successful and the ongoing discussions with the fda successful. just what i said earlier was there was no specific request by the agency to increase end, and the shoreline expansion was to provide greater opportunity for patients and more data. we also, as you can imagine, we're getting tremendous requests from investigators, kols and, of course, patients in desperate need. before our studies read out, we can turn out the expanded access program. with most drugs, multiple doses are good to have. so we do plan on talking to the agency, both about 50- and a 30-milligram dose. but jim, can you provide a little bit more?
jim doherty -- chief research officer
sure. laura, i think barry said it well, the way we think about this is that the entire landscape program is designed to produce a package of information about zuranolone. so absolutely, all of the data on zuranolone, including our extensive data set on the 30-milligram dose will be included in the filing. and yes, that isn't really anything out of the ordinary. the discussion will be around the drug itself and all of the data will be included in any potential filing.
operator
our next question will come from the line of akash tewari from wolfe research.
lie ma -- wolfe research -- analyst
this is lie on for akash. recently, a practice mentioned they couldn't claim mdd treatment if they only choose patients for 15 days. so they also look at the day 28 data for their mdd drug candidate. in your case, we have the waterfall secondary endpoint at the 48 -- sorry, 42. and how important is that day 42 data for zuranolone filing? and how did fda view the open-label shoreline study and supporting evidence for the durability of zuranolone? in addition, we also noticed the waterfall trial has completed enrollment of 543 subjects with only 2 arms and about like 15% to 20% dropout rate. is it fair to think waterfall trial has about 80 -- sorry, about 90% power to detect 2.4 to 2.5 ham-d differences to placebo?
and lastly, what's the scale of ham-d 17 tend to increase if we look at patients with ham-d cutoff of 20 versus 24 versus 28?
barry greene -- president, chief executive officer & director
yes. i think there are a number of questions in there. so let me provide a little bit of context and ask steve to comment. maybe jim might want to comment. so look, again, we're very excited by the waterfall readout. as we talked about previously, we had the opportunity to increase the end twice. unfortunately, we are in a brain health pandemic. and as i commented on the call, the rates of depression are 3-4 fold in the united states alone. so unfortunately, there's a lot of people suffering from mdd out there at rates greater than we had prior to the pandemic lockdown. so that increased end provides significant powering on the primary endpoint. what we're looking for is statistical significance at day 15. that -- this is such unique profile the benefit risk here differentiates from, again, 35 years of drugs being developed in the area, and we're very excited by that. steve, do you want to provide a little bit more?
stephen kanes -- chief medical officer
sure. the study itself is designed to show differences at day 15. that's the reason why we have breakthrough therapy designation, the ability to get patients better within 2 weeks is what got us to look at the fda interested in this program. it's what's unique about the profile. and we've seen statistical significance and clinically meaningful differences as early as day 3, day 8, day 15, and those benefits are maintained.
the only real way to assess what that looks like in terms of pattern for patients that have gotten better is to use shoreline data. and again, these are -- this is an overall program that was agreed with the fda when we had breakthrough, where we actually naturalistically see what happens to patients when they're treated upfront and then followed over the course of a year for need for retreatment. and what we've seen is that patients require -- 70% of the patients plus require no more than two treatments in a year, about half of them only required 1 treatment. so this gives us a lot of information about how a drug that works very rapidly would be used in real life. and it's a very unique overall profile.
so for our primary absolutely essential to day 15, we're looking to see essentially patients being -- that have improved, remain well. the real data for that aspect really comes from shoreline, and we have a very substantial and now growing database around that, and it continues to support the idea of episodic treatment.
operator
[operator instructions] our next question will come from the line of jay olson from oppenheimer.
jay olson -- oppenheimer -- analyst
i'm curious about the sage-324, i think you're leading that development program with biogen. can you just talk about the indications you're planning to pursue and whether or not you plan to study 324 in parkinson's disease or epilepsy patients?
barry greene -- president, chief executive officer & director
yes, jay, thanks for the question. so look, we're really excited about treating for a neurology franchise. we believe it's a novel potential treatment for chronic neurological conditions, and we thought very differently about movement disorders. so if this is successful in the initial indication of essential tremor, it will be the first new treatment in over 50 years. so we're really excited about that. as i mentioned, we're very confident that in the phase iib, we'll reach a dose and frequency that is a profile to take into phase iii and then a commercializable profile. with that profile and talking to our collaborators at biogen, we'll map out additional indications, but we do believe that there are a number of additional indications we can pursue with sage-324 once we're over that next step of dose and frequency in essential tremor. steve, anything else to offer?
stephen kanes -- chief medical officer
yes. i think what i'd say is as we dial in what profile we're looking for, we're working closely with investigators, we're working with patients and patient advocacy groups, we're even doing exit interviews with the patients that participated in our trials to understand exactly what they're looking for in a medicine. this is something that we've been looking to essential tremor for quite some time. and right now, the data on hand really speaks to upper limb tremor being one that's a driver of disability. we can see that when we look at the correlation with improvements in activity of daily living.
so overall, our growing understanding of 324 is something that not only is it unique, but it's something that we think is really a great example of the approach that we take to r&d. so we had preliminary data in some of these other indications, parkinson's, nonclinical data in epilepsy. right now, our focus is on essential tremor, but we certainly have broader interest in other areas moving forward. jim?
jim doherty -- chief research officer
yes. maybe to build on that a little bit. the question was about other potential indications in 324, we see as the lead molecule for a neurology franchise. and just -- as steve was just saying, it's a little bit to do with the way we think about r&d in general. and we talk a lot about 2 things following the science and leading with human data. and so following the science, in this case, means we understand that there are multiple patient populations who could potentially benefit from a gaba potentiating molecule like sage-324. and especially with that profile that's optimized for chronic delivery. and so that leads us to that second point of leading with human data. and although our key focus at the moment on the program is in essential tremor, as you've been hearing, we do have data from an earlier program, preliminary look at potential efficacy in parkinson's disease, and we've got an absolute raft of preclinical data indicating that this mechanism and this molecule would be valuable treatment for epilepsy.
so there's a lot of potential value for the neurology franchise, and that's something that our partners of biogen are well aware of, and that will be the subject of ongoing conversations. but the key focus for now is essential tremor, but we think that there is a lot of potential for the molecule in other groups in neurology as well.
operator
and our next question comes from the line paul matteis from stifel.
paul matteis -- stifel, nicolaus & company -- analyst
great. have you guys talked with biogen about scenario planning? if waterfall and coral were to fail, but the phase iii postpartum study were to succeed, would you launch this drug in ppd, and then kind of figure everything else out later, or would you wait? and then separately, what's the status of future trials in anxiety and bipolar depression? and is the kind of -- is the initiation of those studies at all contingent upon what we see in mdd?
barry greene -- president, chief executive officer & director
paul, thanks for the question. so again, i'll remind you that the data we've seen with zuranolone now in over 3,000 subjects and patients has been highly consistent with rapid onset of effect, 3 or 4 days, has been very durable as i and steve and jim have highlighted with an adverse event profile, it's been consistent. so we are highly encouraged by the upcoming data readouts. we sat down with the agency and mapped out 3 unique approaches, 3 unique different ways to potentially get approval to an mdd, as you've highlighted, and 1 in ppd. and we believe that 1 of those phase iii needs to be positive for us to have a drug on the market.
so we're very enthusiastic about all 3 approaches and believe that as you see with many drugs, we need 1 positive phase iii here. and that's an agreement with the agency. yes, we scenario plan with biogen at a very high level, but not in any detail. and we believe we have a very important drug here not only for mdd and ppd but potentially other indications. and we'll share more about those paths forward as we map that out with biogen.

our next question comes from the line of andrew tsai from jefferies.
andrew tsai -- jefferies -- analyst
my question is around waterfall. and i know you guys are very good at controlling this, and i don't think this has ever been an issue for you, but i'm just curious to see what steps you've taken to ensure there won't be a higher-than-expected placebo response out to day 42. basically, i'm just curious to see how confident you are the scenario wouldn't happen.
barry greene -- president, chief executive officer & director
yes, andrew, thanks for highlighting that. and let me make the comment, and i'll turn it over to jim to talk about the conduct of the study. so with the shoreline data, with the increasing end in waterfall, we're increasing our safety database. it's a very large indication, as you're all aware. so the bigger the safety database, the better.
importantly, andrew, we've not changed guidance. we've committed to delivering top line results for phase iii in the first half of this year, and we tend to continue to do that. so we're enthusiastic about the progress of the program. it's fully enrolled, and we're looking forward to the readout. jim, you want to talk about specifics of the control, placebo, entire thoughts there?
jim doherty -- chief research officer
yes, absolutely. and, andrew, thanks for the question. as i think you know, we put a lot of thought and focus into design. and i think the answer is that we've talked a lot about the waterfall design and modifications that we made in design based on learnings. but the other important thing to remember is many of the things that we have learned through multiple trials in the landscape program very much remain in the design of waterfall. and i think that's our view on things like controlling for placebo effects. i think what we try to do is be very rigorous about our execution, and that is something that we are doing again with the waterfall study.
operator
and our next question comes from the line of neena bitritto-garg from citi.
neena bitritto-garg -- citigroup -- analyst
so i'm just kind of curious about the next steps kind of after waterfall. i know you've talked about not necessarily meeting the redwood study at this point given the data you're seeing from shoreline and a number of other studies. but i guess, is there -- are there kind of differences in next steps depending on the magnitude of effect that you see in waterfall? and assuming it is statistically significant, just depending on kind of the differential between drug versus placebo, is there -- do you envision there being kind of any differences in next steps, or as long as it's that big, there's really just one path forward?
barry greene -- president, chief executive officer & director
yes, neena, thanks for the question. i'll take it. and if steve has other color, ask him. so as we said, what we're counting on for waterfall is a statistically significant result at day 15. if that's true, and we have an adverse event profile that's consistent with what we've seen already in over 3,000 subjects and patients, we have a very important medicine with a very differentiated benefit risk than anything that exists in the market today.
so statistically significant at day 15, we have a drug. and i think the unmet need is so extreme that kols, patient groups and the regulators appreciate that that's what we're looking for. so obviously, data matter and effect size matters to some extent. but we're really looking for statistically significance.
our plan should waterfall be positive, is to sit down with the agency and be very clear on mapping out next steps. we could start a rolling submission, we could file waterfall. a key that we're looking for, just to be clear, is also timing of coral. we would not want to get into a situation where we filed an nda, had another major data readout, submitted that readout and went into kind of a 3-month extension. so should the agency want to see coral, we'd likely wait the whole clinical session for both waterfall and coral.
now you asked about redwood. i'll remind you that before data existed, as it exists today, a question was asked, how many times in a year can you effectively and safely treat a patient? that's not really a question with all the data we have right now, waterfall, shoreline that needs to be asked.
we're very confident assuming a positive waterfall that redwood will not be a regulatory requirement for filing nda. we might have other post-approval commitments that we'll map out as soon as we talk to the agency. steve, anything to add?
stephen kanes -- chief medical officer
yes. the only thing i'd say is when we started this program, we set out to identify a drug with a very unique profile, a medicine that aligns closely with patient interest. it's quick, the effects are durable, and they're long treatment-free intervals.
the data that we get from shoreline really supports that approach. what we're looking for is that next study, where we're showing the acute effects, that's the day 15 endpoint. so that is absolutely essential, and it's important. the other thing i'd add is that sometimes people wonder about effect versus effect size. what we've seen across the board, it's been very consistent. our large, rapid and sustained improvements in the drug group, placebo varies quite a bit. and so that's why we're very confident around statistical significance being the primary endpoint here in the goal prior to filing.
operator
our next question comes from the line of gary nachman from bmo capital markets.
evan hua -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
this is evan hua filling in for gary. so regarding sage-324, what are the next steps in terms of developing the protocol for phase iib? are there like any additional cuts of data you'd be looking at in the next several months that could help inform how you move forward in terms of dose, timing of dose and patient population? and if so, when would you release some of that data?
barry greene -- president, chief executive officer & director
yes. thanks for the question. so let me hit it at a high level and ask jim to talk about it. so the team of sage and biogen is actually pouring through the detailed kinetic data, looking at looking at dose, duration, pk/pd and the value of those data will help us design the phase iib dosing frequency, and we'll likely test a couple of different ones to make sure that we have the right profile going into phase iii. so we're very encouraged by the kinetic readout, particularly the patients that were the worse patients over 12 where we saw a 41% reduction in essential tremor, very important reduction for these patients. jim, you want to talk about any specifics and next steps?
jim doherty -- chief research officer
yes. absolutely, barry. and when we think about the results from kinetic, as you heard earlier, statistically significant effects on the primary endpoint and sustained over a 28-day period with an adverse event profile that's consistent with what we understand about the drug and about the mechanism of action.
so the question to be answered from kinetic was can we see efficacy, can we see efficacy without tachyphylaxis which we're excited about because that's the result that we see. so the focus on the iib and the rest of the phase ii program is on dosing strategy. and remember, 324 is a long half-life drug that's been optimized for chronic dosing that gives us a lot of flexibility in exactly the dosing strategy that we'll use for pivotal studies. and so that's going to be the focus. and as i think barry mentioned, there are a number of different things that we can look at modifying. so certainly, dose levels, dose frequency, there are a number of aspects that we're looking at. and so the sage and biogen teams will figure out what's the most efficient way to answer those questions in phase iib.
operator
thank you. now that is all the time we have for questions today. i'll turn the call back over to barry greene for any closing remarks.
barry greene -- president, chief executive officer & director
thanks, operator. thanks, everyone, for joining us this morning. we are very pleased with the significant progress in the first quarter, and we're excited about the potential for additional milestones throughout the balance of this year. and i want to acknowledge that may is mental health awareness month, and i'm excited to see the real movement across the world, a movement encourages people to speak up and change the narrative on brain health and mental wellness.
there's also growing awareness of the global impact the current mental health pandemic is having on the young and the old. and in fact, just this week, mtv convened a groundbreaking coalition of media companies and mental health experts to harness the power of media in storytelling, kicking off at better together, a mental health storytelling summit, drawing talent, including oprah winfrey, trevor noah, regina king, among many others.
the coalition unveiled its first of a kind comprehensive mental health media guys, which provide best practices and evidence-based recommendations to empower content creators in entertainment to expand portrayals of mental health to further encourage viewers to speak up and get help. true progress as we further lean in, is a very real challenge presented by a lack of progress in talking about and treating brain health issues.
we're excited to see this progress and for others joining us in what we have acknowledged is a big lift. now more than ever, patients suffering with brain health issues need better, more effective treatment, and the sage team is working tirelessly to deliver on our vision of bringing such treatments to patients so they can get better sooner. thanks, everyone. looking forward to further discussions. see you all.

good morning. welcome to sage therapeutics second quarter 2021 financial results conference call. [operator instructions]. this call is being webcast live on the investors and media section of sage's website at sagerx.com. this call is the property of sage therapeutics and recording, reproduction, or transmission of this call without the expressed written consent of sage therapeutics is strictly prohibited. please note that this call is being recorded.
i would now like to introduce jeff boyle, vice president, investor relations at sage.
jeff boyle -- investor relations
good morning and thank you for joining sage therapeutics second quarter 2021 financial results conference call. before we begin, i encourage everyone to go to the investor and media section of our website at stagerx.com where you can find the press release related to today's call as well as the slides that contain supplemental details. i would like to point out that we will making forward-looking statements which are based on our current expectations and beliefs. these statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties and our actual results may differ materially. please consult the risk factors discussed in today's press release and in our sec filings for additional details.
we will begin the call with barry greene, our chief executive officer who will provide an overview of accomplishments during the quarter and some general context. barry will be joined by steve kanes, our chief medical officer, who will review recent clinical progress and kimi iguchi, our chief financial officer, who will review second quarter financials and discuss financial guidance.
so with that, i'll turn the call over to barry, barry?
barry greene -- president, chief executive officer & director
thanks, jeff, and thank you everyone for joining us this morning. we've made tremendous progress over the first half of the year on our mission to become the leader in brain health as a top tier biopharmaceutical company by transforming the lives of patients with debilitating disorders of the brain. and with 4 positive data readouts in the first half of the year and multiple potential catalysts pending in the coming months, we are demonstrating the sage methodology is working while executing across all three of our franchise, depression, neuropsych and neurology. innovation drug development requires a flexible and thoughtful approach with the intention to provide the best patient impact and experience. sage has been innovating since day one with the goal of delivering medicines that matter so people can get better sooner and stay better longer.
i'll start the call by reviewing the progress made this quarter and our approach to supporting the millions of patients worldwide with brain health disorders, who are need of innovative medicines. i'll then turn the call over to steve to review the clinical implications and potential importance to patients from our recent data readouts in more detail. kimi will then provide an update on our financial progress during the quarter.
in june we announced positive top line data from the phase iii waterfall study of zuranolone in patients with major depressive disorders for mdd. the study met its primary endpoint demonstrating a statistically significant and clinically meaningful reduction in depressive symptoms as measured by ham-d 17 compared to placebo after the standard 2-week treatment regimen and as we've seen in all studies was zuranolone in addition to day 15, a significant reduction ham-d scores began at the first measurement during treatment. that's in this case day 3, and i'll remind you that, after only two doses. reductions were also seen at day 8 and day 12. perhaps just as importantly we saw clear maintenance of effect through day 42, four weeks after treatment was stopped. these data further support our belief in the potential for a differentiated benefit risk profile for zuranolone as demonstrated in the clinical development program to date, and as we believe the millions of people suffering depression deserve a treatment option with a rapid and sustained reduction in mdd symptoms.
thinking about results from waterfall in the context of the entire landscape and development program, zuranolone has shown a remarkably consistent and differentiated profile. to date, three or four late stage pivotal studies with zuranolone have been positive with ham-d reductions from baseline after two weeks of oral treatment ranging from around 12 to 18 points. these results in the context of the overall benefit-risk for an oral medication are unlike anything currently available or in development, and these data give us tremendous confidence in our belief of the regulatory path forward.
notably, in addition to our announcement of the top data from the waterfall study results from zuranolone with the positive phase iii robin study and ppd were recently published in jama psychiatry. it's a striking paper that i suggest you read. with waterfall data and the totality of the landscape in this program to date we and biogen are planning to discuss the potential nda package and timing with the fda. as we've said, we believe we have the efficacy data in hand to file the first nda for zuranolone and our goal is to provide an update later this year including an update on potential timing of an nda file if our discussions with the fda to align with our expectations.
in addition to the ongoing clinical studies, we're also currently running clinical pharmacology studies at the 50 mg dose needed for an nda. at this time, after discussions with the agency we do not believe the redwood and studies, which were suspended in early 2020 need to be completed for an anticipated nda filing package. as you may recall, redwood was designed study fixed schedule intermittent dosing of zuranolone throughout the course of the year. we believe, data from the shoreline study address this question. rainforest was designed to investigate the efficacy, safety of zuranolone in co-morbid mdd and insomnia where zuranolone has consistently improved sleep across clinical studies as measured by sleep component of the ham-d scale, we do not believe rainforest is required for initial filing.
real innovation has been absent treatments for depression for decades. there been more than 35 treatments approved over the last 30 years with the benefit-risk profile and approach to treatment have been largely unchanged in rates of depression continue to rise steeply. despite the available treatments, there are still more than 90 million adults who experienced at least one major depressive episode each year in the us alone and cases are increasing every year. additionally, there has been as high as a four-fold increase in depressive symptoms during the covid-19 pandemic. we firmly believe zuranolone has the potential to offer a unique and compelling profile, if approved, with clinical data to date showing clinically meaningful reductions in depressive symptoms with consistent improvements in mood, anxiety and sleep.
rapid-onset, a 2-week treatment regimens that offers the potential to treat as needed with maintenance of response after treatment completed and a well-tolerated safety profile with no evidence of weight gain, sexual dysfunction,euphoria, gi upset or sleep disruption, symptoms that are typically the cause of treatment discontinuation with standard of care antidepressant drugs. together with biogen we are now taking the steps in building a best-in-class commercialization program for zuranolone to meet the needs of patients with depression, hcps and payers. and if we're successful in our efforts to gain approval we've illustrated this on slide 19 and 20.
as we focused on our goal to bring zuranolone to market our commercialization work is imperative. we intend to revolutionize the way depression is thought about and treated. current standard of care treatments for mdd can be slow for patients to experience response if any are chronic with most patients staying on some form of chronic treatment for at least two years, and are often accompanied by burdensome side effects causing adherence issues and drug regimen changes. we believe the target profile for zuranolone with clinical trial data to date showing a rapid clinically meaningful reduction in depressive symptoms, time-limited treatment regimen and well-tolerated safety profile will be welcomed by patients living with depression.
the work to create a paradigm shift in the treatment of depression has started. we look forward to sharing more on our approach to engaging and educating key stakeholders as we ramp up our disease education and launch planning efforts for zuranolone.
now, let me remind you that sage has a deep pipeline of programs invested in house and we've made great progress in expanding and accelerating our pipeline during the quarter. our neurology franchise is led by sage-324 which is also part of our collaboration with biogen, and in april we announced positive data from our phase ii kinetic study in essential tremor. in the study sage-324 met the primary endpoint by demonstrating a statistically significant reduction from baseline in the tetras item 4 upper limb tremor score at day 29 in the total study population compared to placebo. we also saw a statistically significant correlation between tetra scores and activities of daily living at every time point. these observations are important as they may help provide future regulatory flexibility.
for patients essential tremor can affect nearly every aspect of day-to-day living and can make the simplest half task difficult if not impossible. we believe with pharmacologic characteristics of sage-324 are well suited to address unmet needs for these patients. we are progressing this program and expect to initiate the phase ii dose-ranging study in late 2021 with the goal of optimizing the dosing frequency with a good tolerability profile and a dosing schedule to maintain plasma concentrations that translate into sustained tremor symptom control.
turning to our neuropsych franchise. we are evaluating sage-718 our wholly owned first-in-class nmda receptor pam as a potential oral therapy for cognitive disorders associated with nmda receptor dysfunction. in may, we announced positive data from part a of the paradigm study and sage-718 in parkinson's disease cognitive dysfunction. and i'm pleased to report the first patient has been dosed in part d of that study. we believe that this four-week dosing arm will provide additional information about sage-718 to inform the development path forward. additionally, the luminary study with sage-718 in alzheimer's disease cognitive dysfunction remains on track to read out later this year. and also later this year we intend to initiate a randomized, placebo-controlled phase 2 study in huntington's disease, which is positive we expect will bring us one step closer and pursuing the initial regulatory indication for sage-718 as you can see so far in 2021 we've executed on the promised expansion and acceleration across our growing portfolio. we look forward to providing more updates, including additional analysis of previously reported data to allow key stakeholders and opportunity to further assess the data in detail. that's all going to come in the second half of this year and we expect to do a lot of education around those data.
with that, i'll turn the call over to steve for more detail on the data we reported this quarter as well as our additional ongoing clinical programs. steve?
stephen kanes -- chief medical office
thanks, barry, and good morning everyone, i'm thrilled with the data we've generated to-date and the progress across all three franchises throughout 2021. starting with our depression franchise led by zuranolone, our next generation positive allosteric modulator of gabaa receptors. we've seen remarkably consistent and differentiated data with zuranolone throughout the landscape and nest clinical development programs that was further supported most recently by the positive outcome in the pivotal waterfall study, and as barry mentioned, we believe the data we've generated to date along with the ongoing pharmacology studies and safety data from coral supporting the nda filing [technical issues] and specifically discuss these data and the regulatory nda filing pathway.
in the waterfall study zuranolone met the primary endpoint demonstrating a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement compared to placebo and ham-d scores at the end of the two-week dosing period. we also saw a rapid onset of activity beginning at day, the earliest time point measured. as a group patients who responded to zuranolone after two weeks of treatment retained on average more than 85% of their improvement through the end of the trial, in this case a full 30 days after the last dose of medication, with the majority of these patients maintaining most if not all of the improvement. as we continue to analyze the data from this study in the entire landscape program, we look forward to presenting additional data pertaining to the overall profile of zuranolone along with the patient reported outcomes to speak to the potentially paradigm-changing profile that's zuranolone may present for patients and we're successful.
what i can say is that the data to date tell us it's zuranolone has shown rapid onset, large improvements in overall depressive symptoms, prolonged benefit after completing the two-week treatment regimen and a well-tolerated safety profile. for example in the shoreline study, the largest naturalistic study conducted in an mdd development program we assume that nearly 50% of patients who responded to 30 mg only required one treatment and the 12-month period and roughly 70% of patients responded to 30 mg required no more than two 2-week treatments throughout the year. and as a psychiatrist i believe patients are looking for rapid and sustained reductions in depressive symptoms with the confidence that it is a treatment only when needed.
the safety profile of zuranolone has now been characterized in more than 3500 patients and the data from the waterfall study is consistent with this large and growing safety database. for example in the waterfall study, the vast majority of adverse events were mild-to-moderate in severity or most importantly, there were no deaths or a loss of consciousness. there were also no reports of weight gain, sexual dysfunction, or euphoria, all of which can be associated with current standard of care antidepressants and can lead to discontinuation. to that end. importantly, very few patients discontinued from the study because of adverse events with 3.4% of those receiving zuranolone and 1.5% from placebo discontinuing because of ae's. there were only two serious adverse events in zuranolone group and two in the placebo group. as we continue to review the substantial amount of data from the waterfall study in the rest of the landscape program, we are also committed to sharing data a premier scientific forums as quickly as possible.
slide 14 in our corporate presentation provides details on the types of data, we plan to present at upcoming congresses including patient reported outcomes, which we believe will be very insightful. the totality of the data seen with zuranolone date supports our view of its target profile is a rapid, durable and use as needed or episodic treatment that we believe has the potential to be meaningful for patients in our healthcare system overall. recent health economics and outcomes research conducted by sage and published in the peer-reviewed journal pharmacoeconomics showed that the economic burden of mdd treatment with multiple lines of treatment for depression was much higher compared to a single line of treatment for depression, in fact there was an increased economic burden associated with delay of depressive episode resolution as early as the second line compared to the first-line in mdd. it's clear that a rapid-acting, well tolerated episodic treatment for depression is needed, and we believe zuranolone has the potential to fill that void in the market.
turning to the three additional ongoing phase iii studies with zuranolone. the coral and shoreline studies are on track to read out with data in late 2021. coral is investigating the efficacy and safety of zuranolone 50 mg when co-initiated with new open label ssri in patients with mdd. the positive results from the waterfall study, we believe, have sufficient efficacy data to support our first fda filing for zuranolone, although consistent safety profile remains an important aspect to coral. that said, of course, we expect to see consistent efficacy profile supporting the differentiated benefit risk of zuranolone in this trial including rapid onset of effect.
shoreline is designed as a naturalistic open-label safety and tolerability study to investigate as needed repeat treatment with zuranolone over a one-year period in patients with mdd. we expect to report top data cuts in the 50 mg, one year cohort and shoreline in late 2021. we're also continuing to enroll patients in the study following our announcement last quarter that we expanded the target enrollment to 500 patients and we're offering patients from the coral study the ability to roll over into shoreline following the completion of the coral study.
the other ongoing phase iii study of zuranolone is a skylark study in postpartum depression. we're updating our guidance on the skylark study, which is now expected to readout in mid 2022 as a result of a slower than anticipated pace of enrollment in the study due to a dramatically and unfortunate lower level the women diagnosed with ppd during the pandemic, possibly preventing women from accessing appropriate screening and diagnosis.
also in our depression franchise today we announced top line data from the chickadee study evaluating the safety and tolerability and pharmacokinetics of zulresso in adoloscent females aged 15 to 17 with postpartum depression. this study was conducted as a post-marketing requirement to investigate zulresso in adolescent females with ppd. the data showed that the safety and pharmacokinetic profile for zulresso in this population was consistent with prior studies in adults and the fda approved product label, importantly the efficacy seen a chickadee study is consistent group will be seen in the clinical program in adults. we plan on working with the fda to potentially add this broader age groups to the label.
moving to our neurology franchise, which is led by sage-324, a novel treatment that we believe has incredible potential in the treatment of essential tremor. the data we announced in april for the kinetic study, a 36% reduction in upper limb tremor amplitude from baseline to day 29 in the total study population seen with sage-324 the adverse events that were generally consistent with the safety profile of 324 seen previously are supportive of further development in the target product profile for 324 may potentially be very meaningful for patients. to that end, we plan to initiate a dose ranging phase ii clinical trial with sage-324 in essential tremor in late 2021. we also look forward to working with our collaborators at biogen to optimize next steps for the continued development of sage-324 to identify the profile we expect to move into pivotal trials. as a reminder, at this time, we don't believe additional formulation work is necessary for sage-324.
we're confident our proposed phase ii b trial will result in the dose and frequency designed to optimize benefit risk as we continue to develop this novel product candidate for essential tremor. beyond sage-324 our neurology franchise includes sage-689 a potent product candidate with rapid pk in solid formulation flexibility with potential in areas of high unmet need including acute agitation, mania or migraine. i'm pleased to share the first patient has been dosed in the phase i program for sage-689 and we're on track to complete the phase i sam study in late 2021. additionally, i'm pleased to share that ind enabling preclinical work is underway for sage-319, an oral extra synaptic gaba-a receptor preferring pam. the advancement of the sage-689 and sage-319 programs represents meaningful expansion and acceleration of our sage developed wholly owned pipeline.
turning to our neuropsych, where we are continuing to develop sage-718, our nmda receptor pam in development as a potential oral therapy for disorders where cognition is one of the main drivers of disability. consistent with the data seen in huntington's disease patients in our phase i studies in patients with parkinson's disease sage-718 is shown in an open label phase ii trial, the paradigm study, a positive impact on multiple domains of cognition including executive in learning and memory while not altering simple attention or reaction time. in the study, patient is 75 years old with mild cognitive impairment due the parkinson's disease who received sage-718 3 mg daily for two weeks demonstrated improved performance from baseline on multiple tests of executive functioning of our 14 days of treatment. to our knowledge, there is nothing in clinical development that has generated data suggesting this kind of profile, the potential ability to augment key cognitive domains without the challenges often associated with other approaches. within the safety data available, the rates of adverse events reported has been low with with the most frequently reported ae being headache. no serious adverse events have been recorded to-date. we're confident in the potential of sage-718 and today announced that we have dosed the first patient in a four -week dosing arm in the paradigm study to gather additional data in the pd patient population and informed next steps.
as we previously announced, we are planning to initiate a double-blind, placebo-controlled phase ii study of sage -718 in huntington's disease later this year and are on track to report top line data from the luminary study evaluating sage-718 in patients with ad, mild cognitive impairment and mild dementia later this year as well.
in addition to sage-718, our neuropsych franchise also includes sage-904, an nmda receptor pam product candidate being evaluated as a potential oral therapy for other disorders associated with nmda hypofunction, we are on track to complete sad and mad studies late 2021. our neuropsych franchise also includes sage-421, an oral nmda pam being evaluated for potential use in neuro developmental disorders and cognitive recovery and rehabilitation, which we expect to advance to preclinical studies this year.
lastly, today we announced that we're terminating our phase iii study evaluating brexanolone in covid-19 related acute respiratory distress syndrome or ards. the study did not meet enrollment expectations and was closed to further enrollment this quarter. we will report the data collected to date after full analysis of the results.
this was an important quarter for sage marked by advancements across our pipeline, and we're excited about the second half of the year with several potential value creating catalysts expected. we believe our significant progress this quarter leaves us well positioned to build on our momentum and to advance our mission of making medicines that matter.
i'll now turn the call over to kimi for a review of the financials. kimi?
kimi iguchi -- chief financial officer & treasurer
thanks, steve. as you heard from steven barry we're executing well in 2021 are making decisions based on data that we believe will ultimately help us deliver medicines that positively impact patients. it's an exciting time for sage and we're expanding and moving our pipeline forward for position of strength, underpinned by our strong financial position.
let me start with the highlights from our second quarter financials and then close with some commentary on our financial guidance. we recorded $1.6 million in net revenue in the second quarter from the sales of zulresso. that compares to $1.1 million of revenue from sales of zulresso for the same period in 2020. we remain committed to our moms, their families and all those impacted by ppd. our targeted commercial efforts including an integrated approach to engage key stakeholders, our moms with ppd, who may benefit from treatment with zulresso gain access.
selling, general and administrative expenses were $43.3 million in the second quarter compared to $38.2 million for the same period of 2020. this includes an increase in expenses of $8.6 million and a reduction in expenses of $3.5 million due to reimbursement from biogen as part of our collaboration. the increase in expenses was driven by an increase in activities focused on disease awareness, increased launch readiness activities for our potential product launch, if our zuranolone development efforts are successful, and non-cash stock-based compensation expense from the achievement of a milestone for certain outstanding performance restricted stock in.
research and development expenses were $56.2 million in the second quarter, that was compared to $73.3 million for the same period of 2020. this reflects an increase in expenses of $13 million and a reduction in expenses of $20.1 million due to reimbursement from biogen as part of our collaboration. the increase in expenses was driven by clinical pharmacology studies that began in 2021 and non-cash stock-based compensation expense from the achievement of milestones for certain outstanding performance restricted stocking.
additionally, we had no restructuring expenses in the second quarter of 2021 compared to $28.4 million in the second quarter of 2020. we recorded a net loss of $107.2 million for the second quarter. that was compared to a net loss of $136.3 million for the comparable period of 2020.
i'd like to highlight the components that we expect will continue to support and build our financial strength for the remainder of 2021 and beyond. specifically, there are three areas that give me confidence in our financial strength in our potential to create value. first, we expect our cash on hand of $1.9 billion plus ongoing funding and resources from the biogen collaboration will provide the financial flexibility to allow us to continue to make sound and strategic decisions designed to improve our probability of success. the biogen collaboration provides ongoing cost sharing for r&d and sg&a expenses for agreed upon activities related to zuranolone and sage-324, and we have the potential for up to $1.6 billion if we meet development and commercial milestones. second, our thoughtful and flexible r&d approach combined with our strategy to invest in near, mid and long term has led to a portfolio of multiple programs across three franchises, all of which have shown promising signs of long-term value potential for patients and shareholders. and third, we're working to build a best-in-class commercialization program designed to help us address patients, hcps and payers if our products are approved. and with the potential if more successful to deliver significant shareholder value.
separately, we are reiterating our prior financial guidance that we expect to have a cash balance of more than $1.7 billion at the end of 2021 and as a reminder, we did not expect to receive any milestone payments from collaborations for the remainder of 2021. it's sterling to see what's been achieved to date and we're just getting started. i'm confident that our strong financial position and flexibility will allow us to continue to drive the portfolio expansion as we work to develop innovative treatments with the potential to impact millions of lives.
i'll now turn it over to jeff to handle q&a with the operator. jeff?

[operator instructions] our first question or comment comes from the line of ritu baral from cowen. your line is open.
ritu baral -- cowen & company -- a
hi, good morning. thank you for taking the question and congrats on the quarter, and maybe just to go back to the regulatory strategy, just to clarify, coral to be successful to file in mdd, and in the decision to terminate redwood and rainforest, does that mean the fda has indicated that shoreline will provide sufficient retreatment data for the filing? thank you.
barry greene -- president, chief executive officer & director
yeah, thanks, thanks for the question. so as we said on the call, we have sufficient efficacy data for filing. we take a step back. we've studied zuranolone in over 3500 patients in subjects to date and the profile of zuranolone has been consistent, which in a rapid onset of action advocacy as early as the first measured time point day three that's been consistent with day 12 and 15 significant clinically meaningful results. so it's really the totality of the efficacy data is filed. as we mentioned on the call with ongoing pharmacology studies, which also need to be complete, and then we believe that need to confirm this definitively with the agency that will take a snapshot of the safety data from our ongoing other clinical studies including coral and then packaging totality will be sufficient for filing. we did and we have breakthrough status, so we're in ongoing dialoge and we were able to confirm redwood and rainforest would not be required for this filing, and then to your specific question with shoreline and we saw really important data with shoreline as steve mentioned on the call 50% of the patients in the shoreline and that was the 30 mg dose required one 2-week treatment and the entire course of the year. and 70% patients only required one or two treatments in the entire course of the year, and then about 10% required 3, 4 and 10. so even at the most frequently study dose of 5 two-week treatments, we are talking about 10 weeks of drug versus 52 weeks of current antidepressant. so, we believe that those data are sufficient to provide the retreatment regime, steve anything to add? steve, you might be on mute.
stephen kanes -- chief medical office
okay. yeah, i'd say is with a big important factor of all of these for filing is making sure even appropriate safety database and now with more than 3500 individuals dosed in hand a very clear safety profile along with three positive trials, which includes waterfall we believe that we definitely have the efficacy as well as the safety information necessary for filing, and as barry said will confirm that with our next meeting with the agency.
ritu baral -- cowen & company -- a

thank you. our next question or comment comes from of salveen richter from goldman sachs. your line is open.
salveen richter -- goldman sachs -- analyst
hey, good morning and thank you for taking our question, this is elizabeth on for salveen. i'm just wondering if there are any additional steps that need to be taken ahead of the phase ii dose-ranging study for 324. thank you.
barry greene -- president, chief executive officer & director
yeah, it was. thank you. and i'm really important that you mentioned that. so, you're taking the step that we started the year articulating to everybody that our intention this year based upon our strength and balance sheet we can stand and accelerate the pipeline and positive kinetic data where we were asking the question, can we treat essential tremor patients throughout the course of 30 days and see consistent reduction in essential tremor with a favorable safety profile without any technical lapses or untoward safety and thats exact results we had, which gives us confidence to move into a longer-term study of essential tremor. so, together with our partners advising we are designing that next step dose frequency study where we hope to come out with the dose to frequency that provides us the profile to move into phase iii. so all this news, is we've agreed with biogen now is to work with the agency to make sure that we have the right, the frequency, and we plan on releasing that later this year and we will provide guidance and design details once we've initiated that study. so we're moving forward rapid.
operator
thank you. our next question or comment comes from the line of cory kasimov from jp morgan. your line is open.
cory kasimov -- jpmorgan -- analyst
this is gavin on for cory. thanks for taking my question. i was curious about investor feedback that you've gathered since the topline waterfall readout and what aspects of the debt, if any, really stand out to to the kols? thank you.
barry greene -- president, chief executive officer & director
yeah, thanks, to answer that question, so since since we've had the waterfall readout we've integrated that with the totality of data and that we had great discussions with various investigators and kols. and i think what everybody is seeing is really a paradigm shift here. when we think about the last 35 to 50 years antidepressants, when we think about what's in development today, including some later stage programs nobody has seen an oral medicine that works after one or two doses, and as you know, we've seen statistical significance at day 3 with continued efficacy, and i'll ask steve talked about the totality of data seen shoreline help to emphasize that point.

yeah, i think the profile itself is really unique, we talk a lot about the paradigm shift, but i'll just remind everybody that what we mean is something really substantial for patients. the typical treatment duration for first episode for depression is 6 months. typically people are on their antidepressant for years and what we're offering, we're successful is a time limited treatment, 14 days, two weeks of therapy to treat a major depressive episode. that is a real revolution for i mean patients as well as physicians are looking for. the kinds of things that we are now working with is really integrating the data to be able to illustrate the overall benefit risk profile and working specifically with all of the kols that we're in touch with to both make sure they understand exactly what we're trying to do and then getting their feedback about how best to articulate that benefit risk profile. what we've seen so far is that most patients require no more than two treatments over the course of the year, that more weeks and we 48 weeks in the year, they are not taking medication, a real revolution in the treatment of depression when that patients themselves are really quite interested in. so, the kinds of things we'll be looking to go more deeply into our one of the patients who use of this treatment, how does that reflected in the overall outcome something that's very important to demonstrating clinical meaningfulness and using that with the kols and everybody else to really help everyone understand how this may be used in the treatment paradigm. it's, a very welcome new tool if approved and how best to then introduce it into clinical practice. so, it's exciting for me because it's something that's entirely new base and i haven't seen the data for years now, if i had this medicine my arm i was a practice that would have used it on everybody and finding ways to sort of educate and then ultimately change practice is kind of where we are right now and it's a really exciting opportunity.

thank you. our next question or comment comes from the line of paul matteis from stifel. your line is open.
paul matteis -- stifel, nicolaus & company -- analyst
hey, thanks so much for taking the question. hey, i just wanted to clarify one thing and then ask one quick question after that. but on your comments, barry, is there a scenario here where you could initiate and complete an nda filing for zuranolone before we ever get the coral data? just trying to understand if that's one of the possible permutations, and then can you just remind us where you are on abuse liability work for zuranolone and kind of what your operating expectation is, as you approach a regulatory review. thanks so much.
barry greene -- president, chief executive officer & director
yes, paul. thanks for the question and i'll like context in that steve to fill it in. so what we said is the efficacy data we have to-date, three out of four past phase iii including the data from shoreline are sufficient for an efficacy filing. we have ongoing pharmacology study, we did run the pharmacology studies at 30 mg but changing to now the 50 mg data from earlier phase ii learning for rerun pharmacology studies, including reviews that is as it happens, those will be completed later this year. so that those data will be part of the, the filing. in terms of other studies coral and skylark, we believe and we need to confirm this with the agence that a blinded snapshot of safety data will be required to file. so it's conceivable that we are filing the regulatory package before other phase iii readout, but that's simply a matter of time. steve anything to add?
stephen kanes -- chief medical office
no, that the you have specifically about whether or not the clinpharm package is complete and there are some ongoing as barry said this at 50 mg obviously for any drug that gets into the cns, there is an abuse liability package that you do. we'll certainly have that in time for the filing and there is nothing there that's giving us pause. we expect that we'll have all of there that we need to file that at the time of completion after our meetings with the fda. as barry said with the efficacy data as well as the safety data, it's really just a matter of the technical aspects of what goes into a filing that we need to sort of agree on.

sorry about that. can you hear me now?
barry greene -- president, chief executive officer & director
yeah.
tazeen ahmad -- bank of america -- analyst
okay, great. thanks for taking my question. and good morning. one question that i have about this discontinued rainforest study. one thing that was being studied there of course was co-morbid insomnia, and for the time that we've looked at this drug one of the major benefits that physician checks have given us is that the ability of patients to be able to sleep better at night would be a big positive and would increase there wanted to prescribe zuranolone. and so, now that you've discontinued the study, i'm just curious how would we get a little bit more color on the ability to set help sleep structure and is that still something that you would want to have language in an ultimate label? thank you.
barry greene -- president, chief executive officer & director
yes, that's a great question. so i will remind you that through the md scores and the patient reported outcomes in the completed clinical studies we have insight into not only mood, anxiety, but sleep and sleep architecture, and we believe we have data sufficient in understanding that patients sleep patterns have been improved. now, obviously with label negotiations, [indecipherable] matter of fda negotiation, but we believe that we have those data. if we believe after we get the label that ongoing studies required to make more definitive statements we certainly can do our studies, but we think we've got data in hand that helps us understand that patients aren't back and many of these patients, as you know on sleep is the aren't back are sleeping better. steve anything to add?
stephen kanes -- chief medical office
tazeen like you, we remain interested in the potential benefits of sleep, and how to get it that is something that we'll be looking into. certainly we've seen consistently, when we look at the individual factors, that sleep is improved, not only sleep, of course, we're seeing improvements in the core symptoms of depression and so forth, which is what you need to be an antidepressant, but sleep is certainly a factor there and one that we think is going to be important as a benefit for patients. how we get to that, first focus on depression if the drug is approved, something that's absolutely important during a health pandemic where the rates of depression are going up through the roof. and, as we become successful you be able to take another look at that, but certainly from scientific data, data communication will be able to say words about that, obviously, we've done a lot of sleep work already and then through the individual factors from our trials will be able to articulate those benefits, and those are some of the things that we're planning to doing near term how we address that long-term is something that obviously we're working out with biogen as we move forward.
tazeen ahmad -- bank of america -- analyst

thank you. our next question or climate comes from the line of yasmeen rahimi from piper sandler. your line is open. hi team.
yasmeen rahimi -- piper sandler & co. -- analyst
hi team, thank you for taking my questions and thank you for all the updates. i have questions on shoreline. the first one is can you tell me how many patients on the 50 mg dose where we'll have one year completed for the data late this year. and then 2, when you look so far is the rate of recourse are leading a second dose, the same in the 50 mg versus the 30 mg dose that you have reported. thank you.
barry greene -- president, chief executive officer & director
yeah. yes, thanks for the question and thanks for asking about shoreline. this is a really important study that helps us understand the incredible durability that we're seeing in patients, and keep in mind that and people have to reflect on it. patients are taking drug for two weeks. and as we've seen in our phase iii, the four weeks or more after-dose patients are still reporting that there is enormous of stage and shoreline further reflects the durability of the drug. i am going to turn over to steve to get into the details, but shoreline is very important in the context of zuranolone.
stephen kanes -- chief medical office
yeah, yeah, the short answer. of course is we'll know the actual number when the study is completed, and so we're following that and the goal is to have as many patients as we can at the end of the study as you continue to roll patients in, in fact were rolling patients from coral study into the trial and what you do with long-term trials like this is take data cuts along the way. what i can tell you is we're seeing very remarkable results in terms of response in remission in the shoreline study during those initial 50 mg doses and that's been true since the earliest cut. so in our estimates now or that 80% plus of patients are showing a response, meaning a 50% reduction and about 43%, a little bit more are showing full remission. and those have been rock solid since the earliest days to our program, they're not only higher than what we saw on 30 mg, but in the same general range. so, we're seeing really good response, that's been continuing both for first with 30 mg and now throughout the 50 mg dosing. we'll have the actual metrics and numbers when the study completes.
yasmeen rahimi -- piper sandler & co. -- analyst
thank you, steve. are you able to come in as of right now, the size of shoreline just like how many patients are currently in shoreline.
stephen kanes -- chief medical office
i can say that this is the last data cut it was more than 500 patients enrolled in the trial and this will be the equivalent of a long-term safety study where we expect attrition throughout the year. people are getting better. they're going about their business. they don't necessarily are interested, especially if they're feeling well to continue to to check in. so even the the rates of attrition in the trial are things that we look at, but what we're seeing is very high levels of retention. one of the points we like to make is is not only in shoreline are patients getting better, but only a small number of them are requiring additional retreatments. this would be the equivalent of a reverse placebo effect, meaning patients know they're not on therapy and only a fraction of them require additional treatments. and so, among other things, we get it, we start to understand what treatment in the real world would look like with our medicine and one treatment, but half of all patients only required that indexed treatment, another 20% required one more treatment in the course of a year. that's fundamental that you're not going to find out a literature of, and this is part of what we're doing, creating both a new approach to treatment, as well as the foundational data that's necessary in order to make treatment choices. so that's why shoreline is so important, and there's all there's a lot there, but those are from my perspective, those are the things that are really most important business program progresses.

thank you. our next question or comment comes from the line of andrew tsai from jefferies. your line is open.
andrew tsai -- jefferies -- analyst
hi, good morning and thanks for having me. so my question is on coral, as investors start to think about the likelihood of success and what the study could show at day 15. is it fair for us to assume the comparator arm, which is the typical ssri could essentially be viewed as a traditional placebo arm since ssris takes 6 to 8 weeks to work or does co-initiated with an ssri or still somehow change the calculus and then a corollary to that is, as we think about day 42 could both arms improve on ham-d as ssri start to kick in. for some patients. thanks.
barry greene -- president, chief executive officer & director
andrew, thanks for the question. i'm going to ask steve to talk about the rest of experience to multiple steps to help anaswer that question for an improved drug. but let me say this, a coral, as you highlighted as that an important question. what happens when we co-administer an antidepressant with patients with zuranolone and the data we have today have patients [technical issues] these are not patients that you assume experience from the horrific side effects that you might on antidepressant. so we're asking different question and we should learn from coral. now. i will also say that as has done each and every time, but when we conduct clinical studies we learn from those clinical studies and we make adjustments for future studies based on those learnings. so if there is adjustments to be made to coral we will make those adjustments and work with the agency on any necessary adjustments, but your specific point, you're right, we do not expect that the antidepressant alone will confer any benefits for 4 to 6 weeks, but may in fact the side effects earlier and that will be very interesting to date because as steve highlighted earlier while we have seen somnolence and sleepiness with zuranolone, we have not seen things like weight gain, sexual dysfunction, gi upset, some of the other side effects you see with with antidepressant. steve maybe you can talk about how arms might come together multiple weeks up dosing when patients on on those drugs.
stephen kanes -- chief medical office
absolutely. we [indecipherable] antidepressants when given over the course of several weeks may actually demonstrate benefit. and just like in our other clinical trials we do know that patients over time may improve even in the placebo arm. so we're not looking as we have it for placebo drug differences out to day 42 especially not in coral, this study is looking to address a very particular use case, which is how do you jump-start therapy when you co-initiating an antidepressant with sage-217 zuranolone with an antidepressant. in oncology, they call the induction with maintenance. how do you start people to get better more quickly, and so we're looking at this early time point, they've shown consistent differentiation from placebo or any other drug that's available. it's a 3 day, 8 day, 12 day 15 really early on. are there non-specific effect that we think we have, of course, i mean we do that through the powering and we do that through the conduct of the trial and so forth, but we do think that if the study is successful just yet another use case where patients may or physicians may want to choose this as a treatment option. and the technicalities of it are obviously, we plan for success to ensure the powering is adequate to show those differences.

thank you. our next question or comment comes from the line of lars chico from wedbush. your line is open.
laura chico -- wedbush securities -- analyst
good morning. thank you very much for taking my question. i have one on zuranolone and ppd, so the phase iii jama paper shows a higher proportion of patients with symptom amount during the third trimester versus zulresso studies and it seems like a bit of a shift in diagnosis, but not much time elapse between when the zuranolone ppd and zulresso ppd studies were conducted. so with skylark pushing back. i'm just wondering if you can comment on whether you think these are more permanent changes in the ppd landscape. it's interesting because you're seeing elevated depression rates elsewhere, but not in postpartum depression. so i guess the question here is how does this impact, one on your ppd submission strategy, but then also how do you see this playing out in a commercial environment in terms of maybe who might be the primary point of care for zuranolone. thanks.
barry greene -- president, chief executive officer & director
yeah. laura. thank you. a few different questions in there. so let me try to unwind it and get hope steve here so you. thank you for highlighting the paper. we're really proud of the robin study and as i highlighted in my prepared remarks just a beautiful paper in and a paper that really reflects just how well zuranolone works and do these moms with ppd. let me start with the kind of the commercial landscape. so, if we're fortunate with our successful waterfall to file as we expect with the agency and get an indication for both mdd and ppd, which is what we expect we will be reaching out and making sure that all moms, particularly those with risk factors have a plan. every mom as you know has a plan for when her water breaks, you knows where the bag is who is taking there in, who her position is going to be, where you're giving birth, but almost no momns have a plan for being depressed a week, two months, three months after the baby is born. so we're going to make sure that we work with patient advocates, we work with ob-gyns, we work with psychiatry, community to ensure that that all moms have a plan after after giving birth. that is probably broader than just the prices in the news, there's other health concerns of moms have after after giving birth. so we will be aggressive in ensuring that that mom with depression has access to zuranolone. we heard some kols actually say that with certain mothers with risk factors they intend to those moms so actually leave the hospital with a scripted hand in case does the symptoms come up. so, i think it will be well prepared there, steve, you want to talk about the timing differences that laura highlighted?
stephen kanes -- chief medical office
oh sure. so, laura, and i'm glad you did the close reading. we've always included patients that had an onset during third trimester. so we think there are few things that are going on, one of them is with the approval of zulresso there is a heightened awareness among treaters both to identify and diagnose patients. and that's i believe is being reflected in the ability to at least identify patients prior to the being treated. importantly, we are not enrolling patients in the study despite when their diagnosis was made until a full month after the delivery, that's to ensure that we're not medicalizing sort of the normal changes in mood immediately after delivery. i mean people have to have their onset of symptoms and they have to be maintained for several weeks, four weeks plus for them to really be appropriate for a diagnosis of mdd, and that's really important for us. i mean unless symptoms remain they're not mdd. so we think there is, awareness, screening, attention and a bit of know-how on how to how to identify these patients and that's important.
with regard to the epidemiology, well we know a few things, one rates of depression, if you just ask people their way up. we also know that births are down and we also surmise based on discussions with investigators and kols that new moms are much more reluctant to come into care during the pandemic. so all of those factors taken together speak to, one, the importance of of a portable treatment to modern treatment, time-limited treatment that doesn't require people coming into a center as well as the ongoing work related to the skylark study. so as much as it's disappointing to change in timelines the importance of the work remains and we are really looking forward to give that study over the finish line. i would also add that as part of our filing strategy, we do intend to discuss the utility of our current package for getting both an mdd and a ppd label. so all of that as part of our current approach based on the outcomes from the jama psychiatry paper and the study.
laura chico -- wedbush securities -- analyst

thank you. our next question or comment comes from the line of jay olson from oppenheimer. your line is open.
jay olson -- oppenheimer -- analyst
thank you for taking the questions. appreciate the importance of a rapid response in mdd which we described earlier. can you talk about how an early response correlates with positive longer-term outcomes in mdd, and also a comment on how the onset of response for zuranolone compares to other novel anti-depressant such as esketamine. thank you.
barry greene -- president, chief executive officer & director
yes, jay, thanks for the question, and really thank you for highlighting a really important point. so what we know about mdd, and there has been many studies from us and others, is that the earlier you diagnose and the more rapidly you get people better, the better the longer-term outcomes for depression and other comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes. and there is literature from many that talk about the downstream effects of not treating a person with depression rather than get them better faster. steve could you talk about some of the health economic data that's out there about not treating people earn back benefits to treating people early getting them better faster.
stephen kanes -- chief medical office
yeah, i mean the most important thing. let's start with patients first. everyone wants to get better quickly, that's kind of the goal of all medicine. there's a few things we know with depression though, which is the more quickly someone get better, the more likely they are to maintain those benefits, regardless of what the treatment is. so when we lean into getting patients better with a two-week course of therapy that very much builds on a well described phenomenon, which is get people better quickly and we know that we're going to be able to get them back into their life, their role functioning and be able to begin that journey of of true recovery. right. i mean, we can just one thing to have symptomatic improvement, it's another to have improvement in your role functioning and really looking at whether it looks like for patients and from patient reported outcomes, is something that's really important for us. so those impacts are ones that we're really lookingto to get out into the real world, both from the waterfall study, but more importantly from landscape. with regard to other drugs including esketamine, while there are reports of very early onset the real statistical significance differences in this drug is really after multiple, multiple treatments. i would also point out that [indecipherable] sending a very different patient population, important one which is treat just in depression. our program is focusing on what i would, sometimes referred to as garden variety depression patients. we don't necessarily have multiple, multiple and very severe episodes but still deserve the opportunity to get better and get back on with their lives. so, and we see faster onset as early as day three, we're seeing maintain benefit after a time limited therapy, two weeks and a really, a really positive benefit risk profile. we think this is something that when it's approved will really revolutionize the treatment for many people. i'd only add that with greater than 30 drugs approved in the united states for mdd, there are still upwards of 19 million people here that have major depressive episode. so it's not just people view this as something that's relatively straightforward to treat, the unmet need is enormous and we think everybody deserves to get better quickly and get back on their feet.
barry greene -- president, chief executive officer & director
thank you. and jay, and that all the data out there, which would, steve, just said, we know that of patients that have recurring depression that are treated on multiple medicines and stay depressed for long periods of time go on to develop diabetes, go on to develop cardiovascular disease and other co-morbidities, which yet not only group that individual but add cost in the whole healthcare system, and we were listening to one of the wall street on a panel where kols said these data are remarkable. i mean we give them my patients i need to get better, faster and that's why which patients don't need to get better, faster that physician was a bit dumbfounded. so everybody seems to get better faster.
jay olson -- oppenheimer -- analyst
super helpful. thank you very much.

thank you. our next question or comment comes from sumant kulkarni from canaccord. your line is open.
sumant kulkarni -- canaccord -- analyst
good morning, thanks for taking my question. we've seen the durability and response data within potential real world usage of zuranolone is there anything particularly from a safety perspective that might limit an immediate second 14-day course of therapy, if that's required. i guess, asked another way this goes back to why a 14-day period was chosen in the first place and what the longest continuous safety period for zuranolone might be from a regulatory perspective?
barry greene -- president, chief executive officer & director
yeah, let me start and then ask steve to comment. so the science behind zuranolone was a belief that in depression we can by targeting positive analysis with modulated gabaa that we can reset patients to kind of a normative state, kind of rewire the brain, so the belief of going on with a presumably short duration therapy not a chronic or if that's paradigm shift we're talking about here. so what we've seen now are patients treated for two weeks to get better, faster and the shoreline data [technical issues] thus far about how often recruitment is required. so we have top studies that have animals on for longer-term without other diltrious effect, but the adverse event profile has been consistent effect includes over time as patients are retreated. so we think of this is coming as a treat as needed therapy and as steve mentioned this earlier on the call very important. when when patients often go off antidepressant, typical antidepressants, and they're off drug, they know they're off drug and they ultimate seek to get back on drug. with the shoreline data we patient off drug and steve highlighted this earlier and they say that they are not seeking to get back on drug even though they're off drug. so, we believe that as patients need the two-week therapy to be able to get additional two-week therapy kind of in the real world. steve anything to add?
stephen kanes -- chief medical office
yeah. just, just to speak specifically to your question. obviously we don't have a label yet. we have been saying two-week therapy because when we do the modeling, and then we've talked about this before, most of the improvement happens within the first week. by the end of two weeks, we're really starting to show some incremental improvements, but really patients are doing well, and of course, these are really -i just want to point this out and you guys can go into your research, but these are remarkable data. we're seeing 80% responses and somewhere between 40% and 50% remissions, you are not seeing that with any drug, let alone after a limited course of therapy. and so, for us this is really transformative and part of what we're so excited about the program when we are getting started, is the opportunity to then use these data to think differently about a treatment paradigm which addresses patient needs who want to get better and not necessarily keep taking medication forever. so, assuming the drug is approved, we could potentially think about other kinds of dosing schemes. this already is a really important, and we've seen it very consistent in terms of actually in terms of safety in study after study after study, and it's quite frankly the time limited aspect of this is what got the fda's attention and why we have breakthrough in the first place, it's a concept that i think will really add something unique to the treatment toolbox for patients with depression.

thank you. we have time for one final question. our final question comes from the line of gary nachman from bmo capital markets. your line is open.
gary nachman -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
hi, thanks for taking my questions. evan flaw filling in for gary nachman. i just had a quick question. so for sage-689 and sage-904 programs, are there any specific or potential indications you would be looking to target. some color around that would be great. thanks.
barry greene -- president, chief executive officer & director
yeah, thanks for the question. steve, you want to take that?
stephen kanes -- chief medical office
for 904 we're obviously we usually start at the highest level. we look for disorders, where there is known or suspected nmda hypofunction and were 718 we're looking at neurodegenerative disorders. for 904 we think this may very well be beneficial for neuro developmental disorders, whether that be autism or schizophrenia or other places or other disorders, where there is cognitive impairment and executive function deficits, a little bit different from from neurodegeneration. so that those are areas that we're looking at, as we understand more about the drug will be more specific. for 689, this is a rapid onset parenteral drug that's injectable, it could be formulated the lots of waste. so we're looking at places where rapid onset of gaba positive modulation be very will be helpful. so the kinds of things we've talked about, rsa, agitation where we know there remains an unmet need, whether it be an emergency settings or for people with severe dementia. likewise, there is potential interest in areas like severe migraine or other places where people may come in for and need very rapid responses. so what be driven by the results of the phase 1 and where we are in terms of benefit risk, but we're looking to identify differentiated molecules and then develop them in very different place than the molecules we have already thanks,
barry greene -- president, chief executive officer & director
thanks steve.
operator
thank you. at this time, i'd like to turn the conference back over to mr barry greene for any closing remarks.
barry greene -- president, chief executive officer & director
thank you and thanks everyone for joining us this morning, i'm thrilled with the substantial progress we've made in the first half of 2021 with several milestones achieved on our mission to become the leader in brain health. this is serious business. for example, a recent study noted that up to 30% of people with mdd have suicide and our depression, neurology, and neuropsych franchise has potential to help millions. we're taking on diseases that have massive impact on people, families, society and generations and we're committed to getting it right, even in the face of major paradigm shift and major expectation changes. and let me just put this out there many of us are getting prepared to send kids back to college and uncertain times. if you have a daughter in junior sophomore year and you discover that she hasn't left the room for a couple of weeks and you're fortunate enough to get her health and so you get the diagnosis of major depressive disorder, would you honor on a typical antidepressant that might take 4 to 6 weeks to work with unknown side effects potentially losing her semester per year or potentially her whole college career. would you rather have another drug that gets you better better after one or two days of investing classes. i know it's what i would pick. so that's what we're focused on despite some of the feedback we're hearing initially. the achievements of the age team this year have set us up for several potential near, mid and long-term paddles rest of the year, and into 2022. the safety will continue to work tirelessly to deliver on our vision of bringing medicines to patients so they get better sooner and stay better longer. thanks again and have a great day, everyone. bye.

with that, i'll now turn the call over to barry.
barry greene -- chief executive officer and director
thanks, helen, and thank you, everyone, for joining us this morning. i'll begin the call by reviewing our recent corporate and clinical progress before turning the call to jim to provide commentary on our clinical expectations for the remainder of 2021. then kimi will provide an update on our financials. this year and quarter have been marked by significant progress for sage. we recently announced that following a pre-nda meeting with the fda, we and biogen plan to submit an nda for zuranolone in mdd in the second half of 2022, with an additional associated submission in ppd in the first half of 2023. we're pleased that we've reached alignment with the agency and believe we have a clear path for this submission.
this brings us one step closer toward our goal of helping patients suffering from mdd and ppd. now let me take a step back to reflect on how we got here. we met with the agency in early 2020 and designed three distinct phase iii studies, two in mdd and one in ppd. the plan set in motion was for a positive study from any one of the three paths to support an nda filing and subsequent approval since it will provide the third positive pivotal study. based on the positive results from the waterfall study, we believe that we have the necessary data to submit an nda for zuranolone. and we're delighted that our recent pre-nda meeting with the fda reaffirmed that belief. and now, in fact, we have four positive studies: mdd-201b, robin, waterfall and the shionogi phase ii study.
the data we have generated in clinical development to date support our belief in the overall benefit risk of zuranolone. the planned nda will include efficacy data from mdd-201b, waterfall, robin and the japanese study as well as retreatment data from shoreline, data from the ongoing pharmacology studies in coral and safety from the entirety of the program. importantly, the coral study is adjunctive use study, designed to demonstrate the benefits of zuranolone when co-initiated with a standard antidepressant treatment, or adt. given the efficacy data we already have in hand to support the planned nda filing and to align the coral study, primary endpoint with the goal of the study, we announced today that the primary endpoint, hamd-17 change from baseline will be measured at day three.
this change is designed to allow us to demonstrate the rapid reduction of depressive symptoms. we will also assess the impact of zuranolone during the dosing period as well as its safety profile. we believe if successful, these data may be important to inform potential real-world use if zuranolone is approved. but we do not believe coral efficacy data will be required for the mdd filing pathway. coral data will, however, contribute to overall safety database regardless of the outcome of the primary endpoint. we've had a highly productive and transparent relationship with the agency and look forward to continuing to engage with them as we begin the rolling submission for zuranolone planned to commence in early 2022. we will work to ensure the totality of the landscape and nest programs are appropriately reflected in our planned nda submission package and the product label if approved.
we recently also presented data from the landscape and nest programs at both the ecnp and annual psych congress that reinforce the differentiated profile of zuranolone we've seen to date in clinical development. jim will walk you through the data we presented, but i want to take a moment to highlight that we've seen a consistent profile for zuranolone across the totality of data. i would also like to take a moment to congratulate our colleagues at shionogi, who recently presented positive results from a phase ii study of zuranolone conducted in japan. these results further demonstrate the promise of zuranolone for people living with mdd, and we look forward to continuing our relationship with them. as you can see from the totality of data collected across the landscape and nest programs to date, zuranolone has consistently demonstrated rapid and sustained reductions in depressive symptoms and a well-tolerated safety profile without the adverse events that are often associated with discontinuation of standard of care adts.
we believe that we are well positioned to be able to provide this important treatment to patients suffering from mdd and ppd, if approved. to this end, we are actively engaging in scientific exchange with kols and are pleased that many of them recognize both the value demonstrated across the zuranolone clinical data package as well as the potential for use in specific patient types they see in clinical practice. as we look to the next year, we anticipate building on this work. by remaining steadfast in our commitment to put mdd and ppd patients first in our zuranolone development efforts, assembling the right team at the right time to execute on our planned nda filing and reinvesting our learnings from zuranolone across our pipeline, we believe we are poised to make a difference from people with depression and other brain health disorders.
we look forward to continuing to provide updates on zuranolone as we pursue the initial nda filing submission for mdd. now turning to our neurology franchise, led by sage-324, which is developed in-house and is part of our collaboration with biogen. sage-324 is currently being evaluated as a potential treatment for patients suffering from essential tremor and other neurological disorders, including epileptiform disorders and parkinson's disease. we believe that the pharmacologic characteristics of sage-324 are well suited to address the significant unmet need in patients suffering from essential tremor and other neurological diseases. following the positive results from the kinetic study, we're preparing to initiate a phase ii dose-ranging study expected to commence later this year. the goal will be to optimize the dosing frequency with a good tolerability profile and a dosing schedule to maintain plasma concentrations that translate into sustained tremor symptom control. we look forward to providing updates on this study as we are able.
turning to our neuro franchise, where we are evaluating sage-718, our wholly owned, first-in-class nmda receptor pam as a potential oral therapy for cognitive disorders associated with an mda receptor dysfunction. this quarter, sage-718 received fast track designation for development as a potential treatment for huntington's disease from the fda. as a reminder, we saw promising early data in a phase i study of sage-718 in people with early huntington's disease last year. we're on track with our plan to initiate a randomized placebo-controlled phase ii study with sage-718 in early to-moderate huntington's disease this year. this study, if positive, will bring us one step closer to pursuing an initial regulatory indication for sage-718. i'm also pleased to announce that we plan to initiate a second randomized placebo phase ii study with sage-718 in 2022. this will be in patients with parkinson's disease cognitive dysfunction.
we believe this study will meaningfully contribute to our understanding of sage-718, as we seek to provide a safe and efficacious treatment for patients suffering from this disorder. lastly, sage-718 is also being evaluated in an ongoing luminary study as a potential treatment for alzheimer's disease cognitive dysfunction. today, we announced the study is fully enrolled, and we are on track to announce top line data from the study before the end of this year. as you can see, we realized great progress across our brain health franchises so far this year. i'm also pleased to share progress on key corporate updates on today's call.
this quarter, we are happy to welcome chris benecchi, chief commercial officer to sage and announce that vanessa procter has been elevated to serve as head of external affairs and joined our executive leadership team. additionally, jim doherty on the call with me, has assumed the role of chief development officer. we've also elevated mike quirk to senior vice president discovery and research, where he will continue to build our research capabilities. as we expand and accelerate our efforts across our organization, and with so much to look forward to in the balance of 2021 and next year, i'm confident that their contributions across our organization will be instrumental to our collective progress toward becoming leaders in brain health.
today, we're also announcing the departure of steve kanes, sage's chief medical officer. it's been steve's goal since i met him to seek a ceo role, and he is fulfilling that today and will become ceo at a private biotech company. i'm thrilled for steve in his new role. steve has made significant contributions to sage over the past 8.5 years. we extend our thanks for his leadership in advancing our brain health programs and wish him success in his future endeavors. steve has contributed to establishing sage as a leader in brain health and progressing programs across our pipeline. we're highly confident in the strong team that we have to continue to execute on our priorities.
i'd invite steve to say a few words. steve?
steve kanes -- chief medical officer
thanks, barry. as i reflect on my time at sage, i'm proud of all that we've accomplished. in my 8.5 years here, i've had the opportunity to develop and launch zulresso, establish and grow our development organization, advance the pipeline and brings zuranolone through a robust clinical development program. it's long been my aspiration to lead a company, and i made the decision that now is the right time to pursue a ceo role. i couldn't be leaving sage in a better position. we've seen great data with zuranolone, believe we have a clear path to filing an nda, and i'm very confident that -- in this team's ability to take this program forward. i appreciate the support and encouragement from barry and the leadership team, and i look forward to watching sage's continued success.
i know that i leave sage in great hands, in an extraordinary shape with a clear path toward sage's second drug to market.
barry greene -- chief executive officer and director
thanks, steve. in closing, i'm highly confident that our accomplishments across our brain health franchises in the third quarter will translate into continued success as we execute on our strategic goals. and i believe we are primed to enter the next phase of sage's journey to becoming the leader in brain health.
now i'd like to turn the call over to jim to detail our clinical accomplishments and expectations for the balance of 2021. jim?
jim doherty -- chief research officer
thanks, barry, and good morning, everyone. in 2021, we have made important advancements across our three brain health franchises, including our early stage programs. and i am pleased to highlight our next steps across each, starting with the three ongoing phase iii studies in our zuranolone program, coral, shoreline and skylark. as a reminder, coral is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of zuranolone 50 milligrams when co-initiated with new open-label ssri in patients with mdd. we also announced today that the primary endpoint in the coral study changed from baseline on the hamd-17 will be measured at day three. we believe this update is in line with the goal of the study to demonstrate the rapid onset of zuranolone, and we will also assess the benefits throughout the treatment period and expect to see a consistent well-tolerated safety profile.
additionally, as we continue to increase our focus on the potential commercial launch of zuranolone, we believe that including a trial with a day three primary endpoint may be a useful complement to the broad clinical package for zuranolone. the study is now closed to screening and top line results are expected in early 2022. of note, the enrollment for the coral study is anticipated to be within the expected range allowed by the study protocol. the target enrollment is 424, and we expect the study to enroll about that number of patients or perhaps slightly higher. the shoreline study is a naturalistic open-label safety and tolerability study to investigate as-needed repeat treatment with zuranolone over a one year period in patients with mdd. we believe this study will provide physicians with important information on how zuranolone may be used to treat people with mdd, if approved. we are on track with our plan to report a top line data cut from the 50-milligram one year cohort in shoreline later this year.
moving forward, enrollment in the study will continue following our prior announcement that we expanded the target enrollment to 500 patients. and we are offering patients from the coral study the ability to roll over into the shoreline study following their completion of the coral study. the other ongoing phase iii study of zuranolone is the skylark study in ppd, which we expect to read out in mid-2022. our vision for the zuranolone program is to offer a new way of thinking about the treatment of depression, and we recognize that, that means providing a robust data package to drive that change. this is a program with seven major clinical studies and more than 4,000 patients treated, and mdd is a large market with an estimated 19 million sufferers every year. the size of both the mdd population and our program necessitate a significant filing package. as such, we're planning to assemble a package that meets the requirements of the fda for a submission of this size and provides information on how zuranolone might be used in the real world, if approved.
let me lay out the filing strategy. we plan to begin the rolling submission in early 2022 with the cmc and nonclinical modules submitted first. the clinical module will likely be the last module submitted for this filing, expected to occur in the second half of 2022. this timing reflects five to six months after the last component of the clinical module is anticipated to be completed, during which time the team will focus on integrating the data package across studies to tell the most complete clinical story for zuranolone. additionally, in october, we presented data at the 34th european college of neuropsychopharmacology, or ecnp congress that further supports the differentiated profile seen to date with zuranolone in clinical development, including a rapid and sustained reduction in depressive symptoms and a unique and well-tolerated safety profile.
further, in a pooled analysis from the landscape and nest programs, zuranolone treatment has led to rapid and sustained improvement in quality of life and overall health at day 15. this improvement continued to increase through day 42, as measured by the sf-36 version 2, a patient self-reported measure of general health. dr. anita clayton, chair of psychiatry and neurobehavioral sciences at the university of virginia school of medicine and principal investigator of the waterfall study, recently presented these data in an encore presentation that is available via the investors section of our website. and if you haven't seen our presentation yet, i recommend watching it. we also presented data at the 34th psych congress showing that zuranolone demonstrated rapid improvements across ham-d17 subscales, measuring the core symptoms of depression as well as symptoms of anxiety in the waterfall study.
these findings are consistent with the totality of data from the landscape and nest programs. we also presented analyses demonstrating that zuranolone treatment led to rapid improvements in functional impairment and improvements in depressive symptoms across patient populations, such as age, gender and body mass index at day 15, regardless of whether patients were receiving zuranolone as monotherapy or concomitantly with a standard of care antidepressant. we're proud of the progress we've made with zuranolone throughout 2021 and excited by the profile we've seen across the totality of the development program. we believe zuranolone has the potential to offer a different treatment approach that may enable patients to experience reduction in depressive symptoms quickly and maintain longer treatment-free intervals without burdensome side effects.
now i'd like to detail the advancements made in our neurology franchise led by sage-324, a next-generation positive allosteric modulator of gaba-a receptors, which we believe hold significant potential in treatment of neurological conditions like essential tremor. as a reminder, we reported positive data from the kinetic study earlier this year as shown improvements in upper limb tremor scores measured by the tetras performance subscale item four upper limb tremor score and importantly, demonstrated a statistically significant correlation between tetra scores and activities of daily living observed at every time point. this is an important finding that demonstrates that the reduction in tremor seen with sage-324 in the study translated to meaningful effects for patients. based in part on these results, we are on track to initiate a placebo-controlled phase ii dose-ranging study in sage-324 for et to optimize the dose and frequency planned to commence in late 2021.
in collaboration with biogen, we look forward to continuing the development of sage-324. we remain confident that our planned phase ii study will generate a dose and frequency for further development to advance our goal of establishing an optimal benefit/risk profile. moving to the development underway in our neurology franchise. we're excited about the future prospects of sage-689, a potent product candidate that has demonstrated rapid absorption, good viability and solid formulation flexibility with potential to treat therapeutic areas that suffer from a lack of treatment options, including acute agitation, mania or even migraine. we announced last quarter that we dosed the first patient in the phase i program for sage-689 and remain on track to complete the phase i sad study in late 2021. additionally, i'm also pleased to share that ind-enabling preclinical work is continuing for sage-319, an oral extrasynaptic gaba-a receptor preferring pam.
the advancements of the sage-689 and sage-319 programs represent continued data-driven expansion and growth of our sage developed wholly owned neurology pipeline. turning to our neuropsychiatric franchise. we are making important strides in developing sage-718, our nmda receptor pam that is a potential oral therapy for disorders where impairment of cognition is one of the main drivers of disability. the fast track designation recently granted to sage-718 as a potential treatment for huntington's disease accelerates our developmental efforts to bring this therapy to patients. in a phase i study of patients with early hd, treatment with sage-718 was associated with robust improvements in tests of cognitive performance, such as the two-back test that began on day eight and were maintained through day 14, the end of the treatment period. we are on track with our plan to initiate a double-blind, placebo-controlled phase ii study of sage-718 in huntington's disease later this year.
we also previously reported exciting data in the first part of our open-label phase iia trial for sage-718, known as the paradigm study, evaluating patients with mild cognitive impairment due to parkinson's disease. the data demonstrate that sage-718 had a positive impact on multiple domains of cognition, including executive function and learning memory, while leaving domains altering simple attention or reaction time unaffected. sage-718 has been well tolerated in studies to date. as barry mentioned, we are excited to announce our plans to launch a phase ii placebo-controlled study in parkinson's disease cognitive impairment, which we expect to begin in 2022.
lastly, the luminary study with sage-718 in patients with alzheimer's disease mild cognitive impairment and mild dementia is fully enrolled, and we look forward to reporting top line data expected later this year. in further developing our neuropsychiatry franchise, we are making progress evaluating sage-904, an nmda receptor pam product candidate as a potential oral therapy for other disorders associated with nmda hypofunction. we remain on track to complete the sad study in late 2021, and the mad study is ongoing.
additionally, our other earlier-stage neuropsychiatry programs, sage-421, an oral nmda pam being evaluated for potential use in neurodevelopmental disorders and cognitive recovery and rehabilitation, is making good progress, and we look forward to providing updates on this program when they become available. i'm excited about the future development opportunities for our earlier-stage product candidates and the advancement of our later-stage product candidates with the ultimate goal of regulatory approval and commercialization. we are continuing to expand and accelerate potential indications for our wholly owned programs, and i believe we have the potential to make a difference for people living with brain health disorders as well as their families, caregivers and communities.
now i'll turn the call over to kimi for a review of our financials. kimi?
kimi iguchi -- chief financial officer
thanks, jim. the third quarter was a critical time for our company's growth and development. in reflecting on the tremendous progress made throughout 2021, i'm proud of the work our team has accomplished and believe we're well positioned to execute on our clinical and business priorities. our strong balance sheet gives us the flexibility to continue to invest in our robust pipeline, and we are focusing on building the right team to support our expected growth now and into the future. i'd like to start by highlighting our third quarter financials and then provide some remarks on the financial guidance. we recorded $1.4 million in net revenue in the third quarter from the sale of zulresso, that compares to $1.6 million of net revenue from the sales of zulresso for the same period in 2020.
we remain committed to moms, their families and all those impacted by ppd. our targeted commercial efforts, including an integrated approach to engage in key stakeholders are aimed to help moms with ppd. research and development expenses were $83.5 million in the third quarter, that was compared to $74.1 million for the same period of 2020. the increase in r&d expense reflects the planned acceleration expansion of our wholly owned pipeline, including advancement of sage-718, sage-689 and sage-904 as well as manufacturing-related activities for zuranolone. the increase also reflects the recognition of a one time stock-based compensation milestone. these increases are partially offset by a reimbursement from our collaboration with biogen for zuranolone and sage-324. selling, general and administration expenses were $48.7 million in the third quarter compared to $35.1 million for the same period of 2020.
the increase in sg&a expense reflects an increase in hiring of personnel and activities related to launch readiness to support a potential product launch. similar to r&d, the increase also reflects recognition of a onetime stock-based compensation milestone and is partially offset by reimbursement from our collaboration with biogen for zuranolone and sage-324. we reported a net loss of $130.2 million for the third quarter, which included $34 million of noncash stock-based compensation. that was compared to a net loss of $105.7 million, including $20 million of noncash stock-based compensation, for the comparable period of 2020.
now i'd like to move to our financial guidance. based on our current financial outlook and projections, our financial guidance remains unchanged. we expect to have a cash balance of more than $1.7 billion at the end of 2021. as a reminder, we do not expect to receive any milestone payments from collaborations for the remainder of 2021. we continue to invest thoughtfully and are well positioned to achieve long-term success across our organization as we seek to develop meaningful treatments for the patients who inspire our work.

[operator instructions] our first question comes from the line of ritu baral from cowen. your line is now open.
ritu baral -- cowen -- analyst
hi guys thanks for taking the question. i did want to ask first about the coral primary endpoint change. i guess, first, very quickly, was that fda-driven or sage-driven? and how does it reflect on your anticipated active control change at day three that you're anticipating? are you anticipating that sort of 6.7 to 6.8 change that you saw in mountain and waterfall since ssris really won't have kicked in? thanks.
barry greene -- chief executive officer and director
hey ritu, thanks for the question. that's a great one. so as we shared, we had a very successful pre-nda meeting that confirmed the nda filing package with efficacy data from mdd-201b, waterfall, robin and the japanese phase ii study as well as retreatment data from shoreline. we also anticipate the ongoing pharmacology studies and as you mentioned, coral, as well as safety from the entire program. so with that clarity in hand, we sought overall feedback on the coral study, statistical analysis plan from the agency. and after that feedback, we selected the phase iii -- the day three endpoint as the key primary endpoint really to get back to the original idea of the coral study, which is to demonstrate kind of the rapid relief of depressive symptoms early in clinical trials.
and as you noted, current antidepressants don't kick in for four to eight weeks, if ever. so this represents a sort of rapid relief for the patient. and since we already had the efficacy data in hand for filing, it allowed us now to move the primary endpoint to coral ii to day three. and just kind of the second part of your question, you're right, we don't expect any efficacy benefits from the active arm of antidepressants because we know through millions of patients dosed in literature over the last 30 years that they take a while to kick in.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of cory kasimov from jpmorgan. your line is now open.
thomas -- jpmorgan -- analyst
hey good morning. this is thomas [phonetic] on for cory thanks for taking the question. i guess maybe just another one on the coral update here. i think the update makes sense. and obviously, you guys have said that you have all the efficacy data you need to file. but just curious how important you think it will be for physicians to see a separation from placebo at later time points in the study, particularly as we think about the effects of ssris potentially kicking in over time? thank you.
barry greene -- chief executive officer and director
yeah thanks, thomas. and please send our best to cory. so i think reflecting, you're right, we believe after the pre-nda meeting that we have the package to file, so it was important for us to have day three reflect that rapid onset. and the way i think physicians will think about zuranolone is in the totality of data. it's not any individual study. it's the 4,000 patients and the consistent profile where, as you know, we've seen rapid relief of depressive symptoms, anxiety, no change to sleep pattern to expect potential benefit to sleep pattern. so we really think about the totality of the data across the dosing period and extended period.
i highlight that we saw in the japanese study, in fact, which followed patients out to day 56 that patients continue to improve out to day 56, and you saw sort of a kickup in the placebo patients, probably reflecting kind of return to baseline, which is what we'd expect in the real world. and then we need to reflect the shoreline data, which at 30 milligrams, as you remember, showed that 70% of patients only need one or two two-week treatment in the course of a full year. so when we think about how physicians will think about the data, it's the totality of data and not any individual study.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of paul matteis from stifel. your line is now open.
paul matteis -- stifel -- analyst
great. thanks for taking my question. i have one really quick one and then one that's a little bit more qualitative. just on a quick one, can you confirm what the final sample size of coral ended up being and whether or not you overenrolled? and then second, in your more recent fda conversations, barry, have you talked at all about how these durability time points will be interpreted from a regulatory perspective? i know there's the zulresso adcom precedent, but because postpartum depression is an acute indication and mdd has more chronicity to it, just kind of curious if you've got confirmation that statistical significance at these later time points isn't really a hurdle? thank you so much.
barry greene -- chief executive officer and director
hey paul, thanks for the questions. let me start and then turn it over to jim. i'll start with the second part of your question, and jim can talk more about that part as well as the coral numbers. so i guess the quick answer is that clinical significance at the later third point is not required. what the agency and what physicians look for is consistent and durable impact without a rapid return to baseline. and as we've already talked about across 4,000 patients subjects dosed, we've seen rapid benefit at day three with continued benefit out to day 42, and again, on shoreline, even longer term feedback. so what you worry about, and we don't worry about this as zuranolone, but other kinds of medicines is that someone gets better quickly. but after they stop the drug, they quickly return to baseline. and we see nothing like that with the zuranolone across any of the trials. and jim, do you want to add more color and then talk about the coral numbers?
jim doherty -- chief research officer
yes, of course, barry. i would say, as barry mentioned earlier, it's really about the totality of the data, paul. and the coral study adds to that story that we're telling for zuranolone with 201b rather than waterfall, the shionogi study, the shoreline study. and i think that where the coral study adds is in explaining that element of the co-initiation of zuranolone with a standard antidepressant. and really, certainly, from an efficacy point of view, but i think also perhaps as importantly, from a tolerability point of view, understand what we see from a tolerability perspective with the combination. to your question about the size for coral, as i said earlier, the target for coral, as you know, is 424. i think that we are -- the study is closed for screening. as i said, we're -- we expect to come in around that number with perhaps a little bit enrolled above it since the study ran a little bit longer than originally intended, but we expect to be in the range of that 424.

thank you. our next question comes from the line of yasmeen rahimi from piper sandler. your line is now open.
yasmeen rahimi -- piper sandler -- analyst
hi steve, you'll be greatly missed, and thank you for all your entire contribution. i have a quick question. i guess what i'm trying to make a sense of is, i mean at day three placebo responses tend to be significantly lower than day 15 in the ham-d17 score, so a high probability to hit stat sig and see a separation. why not use this data and file -- from day three into your filing? i guess what i'm trying to figure out is like, we knew all along that day three will show a statistical separation. why not use this data for filing? why do you guys keep saying that we shouldn't -- we don't need it? and b, why change it so close to rolling nda? that would be helpful. thank you for taking my question.
barry greene -- chief executive officer and director
yes. thanks for the question. so let me sort of take a step back, and i commented this in my prepared remarks on the call. but i'll remind you that in 2020, our team sat down with the agency following a number of phase iii studies, one, recognizing that mdd was the major unmet need and, in fact, a growing unmet need. so we and the agency and others appreciated that we needed something in addition to the currently approved antidepressants where we haven't seen a change in benefit/risk in a long time, and designed the landscape and next programs, two mdd studies and one ppd study. and we highlighted, and this is going back to consistent with our guidance in january that we needed one more positive study to have the package to file.
we've got that and more japanese positive study as well. so we sat down with the agency in our pre-nda meeting and confirmed that, that data package was sufficient for filing and that another phase iii was not required. but there was a dilemma in front of us, as we highlighted. we had two ongoing phase iii studies. so we had what i thought was a very good open strategic discussion with the agency, which said like, ""coral's coming up, let's file for mdd."" we're going to include coral in the filing, but the efficacy data is not necessarily required to be positive to file.
now the change to day three will benefit us if, in fact, day three is positive, and we see benefit over the treatment course. those data will be incredibly important to guide our medical affairs force, our sales force in educating physicians about the appropriate use of zuranolone, including the totality of data. so with another positive study, we will see benefits in terms of educating physicians. and i think as you heard anita clayton say in her encore presentation with ecnp, who wouldn't want to get better faster. so this will allow us to really lean in on those kind of data.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of ami fadia from needham. your line is now open.
ami fadia -- needham -- analyst
hi good morning thanks for taking my question. i wanted to switch gears to 324. with the phase ii study planned, are you in a position to talk about what type of doses or frequency you may be evaluating in that study to find kind of a finer trade off between efficacy and safety? and then as just a quick follow-up on the spending for the quarter, is the r&d spending this quarter reflective of the run rate that we should expect going forward? thanks.
barry greene -- chief executive officer and director
ami, thanks for the question and for broadening the dialogue to the rest of our pipeline. i'm going to ask jim to comment on 324 and then kimi to talk about our financials. jim?
jim doherty -- chief research officer
yes. thanks, barry. so the results from the kinetic study, the phase iia study we ran in 324 gave us clear evidence for activity of 324 in treating essential tremor, but along the way with some effects on somnolence. so we knew at the time that, that 60-milligram once-daily dosing was at the top of the range that we wanted to test for essential tremor based on our earlier work open-label in phase i as well as the earlier work that we had done in essential tremor with both zulresso and zuranolone. and so really, it really helps clarify the strategy for the iib study.
so it will be a dose-ranging study looking at multiple doses with 60 milligrams being the top dose in that study. and really, the goal is to identify an appropriate balance between efficacy and tolerability, pretty much a standard activity for a phase iib study. we've thought a lot about things like the pk profile of 324. as you know, the expressed intent for 324 was to produce a molecule with a relatively long half-life and, therefore, a well-suited compound for chronic dosing. and so all those considerations go into the study design for the phase iib study, which, again, we intend to initiate before the end of the year.
kimi iguchi -- chief financial officer
ami, the question on the r&d expenses for the quarter, so you did see some increases in the quarter. a couple of things that i would like to point out that we did have a one time stock-based compensation cost that was reflected in the quarter, and that was about $13 million. so some of that was included in the r&d expenses. but what i will say is that we've always talked about the acceleration and expansion of the pipeline that's reflected in what you see in the quarter for our operating expenses. the other thing i'll remind you is, of course, we have the cost sharing arrangement with biogen. so they are reimbursing us for 50% of the cost for the development and commercialization for zuranolone and sage-324 in the u.s. so we do expect to see some additional increases in the r&d expenses as we continue to accelerate and expand the pipeline.
ami fadia -- needham -- analyst
got it. can i just ask, was the full $13 million included in r&d or what portion of it was in r&d? thanks.
kimi iguchi -- chief financial officer
just a portion of that was in r&d. and i'm sorry, the numbers are escaping me right now. but i think the -- think about it half and half maybe.

hey everyone, thanks for taking my question. this is andrea [phonetic] on for salveen. and sorry, barry, to go back to zuranolone. but just curious how your kol conversations have evolved over the development course? and as you near potential launch, are you hearing any points of pushback or concern about how the drug would eventually be used in the treatment paradigm?
barry greene -- chief executive officer and director
thanks, andrea. no problem going back to zuranolone. no, it's on everybody's mind. so with the totality of data, particularly as presented at ecnp, and that really was the first congress where an integrated data set, including patient-reported outcomes at day 15 and 42 were presented. and when treating physicians saw the totality of data and reflected that even at day 42, four weeks after patients have stopped dosing, that they continue to improve, and across all eight domains were statistically significantly better been placebo, i think a lot of light bulbs went off. this is a new way of treating. it's not an ssri or ssni. it's not a chronic treatment. it's a short-term treatment where patients get better, faster and as we've evidenced in shoreline stay better.
so it's a pretty new approach from, frankly, what many of them learned in medical school for the last 50 years, which is if you diagnose someone with depression, you treat them for six months. at the end of six months, if they're fine, slowly remove drug; if not, keep them on the drug, frankly, for the rest of their lives. so it's a very different approach. and i think, again, light bulbs are going off. the other part of that treating physicians -- potential treating physicians are really starting to appreciate is the safety profile.
one of the things, and i think many of you who listened to anita heard this, and i'm not quoting her exactly, but she said something like the two things she's worried about most is sexual dysfunction and weight gain for her patients, and that's why they stop taking drug. we don't see that. we see a little bit of somnolence which, in fact, in these patients is helpful. but none of the side effects that hurt adherence. and of course, it's a two week course of treatment. so we're making a lot of traction. and as we continue the scientific exchange, i believe you're going to hear more positivity by potential treating physicians in the future.

thank you. our next question comes from the line of laura chico from wedbush. your line is now open.
laura chico -- wedbush -- analyst
hi good morning thanks for taking my question. just one on coral and i guess maybe the longer-term outlook. so could you speak a little bit to kind of the linkage between the day three separation and what is the read-through to remission rates, if there is any? and then kind of unrelated to zuranolone, but beyond coral, what are going to be the key data events that we should have in mind for 2022? thank you.
barry greene -- chief executive officer and director
hey laura, let me start, and then i can turn it over to jim for kind of key data events. so again, the key here is that we have four positive studies in over 3,000 patients and subjects showing the rapid relief of depressive symptoms, anxiety, as early as day three and as evidenced out to day 42. and then you couple that with shoreline showing that most patients will need one or two two-week dose in the course of the year, we have really impressive data for the filing. now what's key for coral on day three is we know that people suffering from depression on current standard of care, if at all, take weeks to get better.
so it's clinically meaningful, and i think anita hit this on the call, is that you want people to get better quickly and who wouldn't. who wants to suffer for four to six weeks to see if i can work through my weight gain, work through my sexual dysfunction to see my depression abate. so day three is incredibly clinically meaningful to patients that end to physicians. and this coral study day three allows us to measure that and potentially even educate on that if the study is positive in the future. so we're thrilled with the change and looking forward to the coral results. jim, do you want to talk about the rest of the year?
jim doherty -- chief research officer
yes, absolutely. thank you, barry. for the rest of the year in 2021, as far as readouts go, we will be expecting the 50-milligram shoreline data for zuranolone showing up to one year of dosing. also for the sage-718 program, we are expecting results from the open-label alzheimer's disease patient population before the end of the year. and then moving into 2022 for the zuranolone program, the coral study to read out early in 2022, the skylark study to read out in mid-2022. and of course, we're expecting to submit our nda in the second half of 2022.
barry greene -- chief executive officer and director
great. thanks, jim. and these aren't data readouts for say laura, but we think it's very important that we'll be initiating the huntington's trial later this year and then soon thereafter the parkinson's trial for 718 and cognitive dysfunction, not data readout, but clear progress on moving a program like 718 along. and of course, as jim already highlighted, the start of the phase ii along with biogen for sage-324 in essential tremor looking at dose frequency at a number of doses as well as longer treatment duration will also be exciting to explain the things to design in the future.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of jay olson from oppenheimer. your line is now open.
matt -- oppenheimer -- analyst
hey guys this is matt [phonetic] on for jay thanks for taking my questions. so we were wondering for sage-324, what forms of epilepsy do you believe make the most sense to study? and then separately for sage-718, what are you hoping to see in the luminary open-label data expected soon? and how could data from there inform a later stage trial in alzheimer's? appreciated it. thank you.
barry greene -- chief executive officer and director
thanks, matt. let me start with 718, and i'll ask jim to comment on 324. so what's really exciting about sage-718, our first of pam in nmda is the biologic hypothesis that started 718 has been consistent now through all preclinical, early clinical studies as well as the early huntington's and parkinson's readouts. so while alzheimer's is much more of a heterogeneous disease, we hope to see and expect to see the same kind of stabilization or even improvement in cognitive -- in cognition. so that means that in the tests that we perform, we want to see that patients aren't progressing and, in fact, stabilize or improve.
and we're really talking about really measuring executive function, learning and memory. and the reason that's important is that in these neurodegenerative diseases often the cognition issues they face lead to their lack of independence. and the hope for sage-718 is that by stabilizing or, in many cases, improving executive function, people can carry on activities of daily living, that is make a shopping list, go to the store, buy the food i want, put it away and remember where i put it. and you can imagine that being able to stay independent for years with these kind of neurodegenerative diseases is very beneficial to patients and their families. so that's the kind of data that we're looking for. jim, do you want to talk about 324?
jim doherty -- chief research officer
absolutely. so matt, the question around epilepsy types for 324, i think it kind of goes back to the way we think about our programs overall and sort of trying to follow the science behind what we do. and really, one of the things that is abundantly clear is that these compounds are quite good at lowering synchronized activity in the brain. and what that means is it really gets right at the mechanism that triggers seizures of multiple types. there are a lot of different kinds of seizures. what we found in all of our modeling is that irrespective of which type of seizures we're studying, the compounds have a pretty robust antiepileptic effects. that gives us a lot of flexibility. so what we'll be discussing with our collaboration partners is really which epileptic syndromes make the most sense for that very broad mechanistic ability to intervene.

thank you. our next question comes from the line of sumant kulkarni from canaccord. your line is now open.
sumant kulkarni -- canaccord -- analyst
good morning thanks for taking my question. what do you expect to see in terms of potential dose dependence for the 50 mg cohort versus 30 mg in the upcoming shoreline data? and what would that mean for perhaps keeping things relatively simple in the real world for regulators, prescribers and patients by filing only the 50 mg dose for your nda?
barry greene -- chief executive officer and director
thanks, sumant. thanks for the question. so in terms of shoreline, i'll remind you that in the 30-milligram readout and the preliminary 50-milligram readout, we saw what we believe are pretty impressive data. the 30 milligram, we saw a 70% response rate; and then same number, 70% of patients required only one or two two-week doses in the course of the year. the 50-milligram preliminary readout saw an 80% response rate to slightly better. and we're hoping that, i believe at the end of the year, we'll see consistent data with that. and if you step back and think about it, someone needing only two -- one, two or even three two-week courses is certainly a major step up from a chronic therapy they have to take every day with the kind of side effects that we're talking about. in terms of filing, it's pretty common with many medicines, many antidepressants to have multiple doses in the filing. so of course, we've got to work through the agency, but it's our belief that in addition to the 50 milligram, we perhaps have the 30 milligram available as well for flexibility and optionality for those patients or physicians believe their patients might...
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of yatin suneja from guggenheim partners. your line is now open.
yatin suneja -- guggenheim partners -- analyst
hey guys thank you for taking my question. maybe just -- i mean, again, it's the question on coral and we understand the change that you are making. we actually wrote about it in july. but trying to get sense if you can talk about what differences do you see from a commercial standpoint by getting an acute -- by getting this acute onset on the label? and in terms of like what led you -- or just trying to get a sense of what led to the realization that the shorter endpoint is needed? is it just the waterfall study? or was there an active engagement from the regulator that led you to decide, ok, let's change it?
barry greene -- chief executive officer and director
yes, yatin, thank you for the question. so let me again sort of remind you and everybody that when we set out the year, we set in motion the landscape and nest programs with two mdd and one ppd study. what we highlighted is that if one of these studies, we needed to be positive for a filing package of the agency. and waterfall, as you highlighted, was in fact positive. we were thrilled with that. and during our pre-nda meeting with the agency, we confirmed what the agency had guided before, which was that was the study required for a filing package. so with the filing package in hand, we -- and in consultation with the agency, we set force to use coral for what it's intended to do. and it's asking a different question.
the data we have to date shows the rapid and sustained effect of zuranolone as a monotherapy and on top of a stable anti-depressant. so what we're doing with coral is we're concomitantly giving zuranolone with an antidepressant for the first time. so those -- that's a different question that we're asking, and we believe that the rapid relief of zuranolone combined with an antidepressant, and that question is very important, and the rapid relief would be new. we know that current antidepressant takes 48 weeks, if ever, to kick in. so getting somebody better fast, it's currently -- certainly very important for that patient and their treating physician. and we know through the totality of data that when people respond quickly, that leads to a very beneficial and often sustained response. so we think it's a very important data in the totality of the data we already have.
yatin suneja -- guggenheim partners -- analyst
and then just one clarification question. so on the day three endpoint, how does it get reflected into the label at some point, right? will it just be in the clinical study section and then how you can -- and will you be able to market it?
barry greene -- chief executive officer and director
yes. so thank you for that. so it's too early to talk about specifics of the label. and of course, we'd like to see a positive study. but i think what's important here is it gives us data to inform the marketplace about potential uses of zuranolone and that's very important.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of akash tewari from jefferies. your line is now open.
akash tewari -- jefferies -- analyst
thanks so much. so you mentioned you're going to include the shionogi study in your package of the fda. is that mostly for safety and not efficacy, considering there is no meaningful separation between the 20 mg and 30 mg doses in that trial? and how do you think that impacts the agency's thinking on updosing to the 50-milligram dose? additionally, just looking at 217 for ppd, what do you think is kind of the long-term opportunity for 217 in ppd? could this be a billion-dollar indication over time? and do you feel like 217 could avoid a box warning around excessive sedation for that indication? thank you.
barry greene -- chief executive officer and director
yes. akash, i think many questions in there. so let me get to a couple of them. so ppd, we think ppd is -- could be a very meaningful indication. one in eight moms suffer from depression, and it's highly underdiagnosed. so having something that a mom takes for two weeks and gets better faster, i think, is very important. and if you think about the number first, one in eight moms certainly seems a very large potential indication. jim, do you want to take the next one?
jim doherty -- chief research officer
yes. so akash, your question about the shionogi trial, we would anticipate using the shionogi trial both for safety, but also importantly, for efficacy. what we see in that trial is a significant effect of the drug separating from placebo in both dosing arms. we also see a similar profile to what we've seen in all of our other studies, that rapid improvement in symptoms occurring as early as the first measured time point as well as the sustained benefit that's lasting out through the end of the treatment period at day 57 in the case of the shionogi study.
barry greene -- chief executive officer and director
yes. i think i would only add, akash, that if you think about the study out in japan, there was a very meaningful difference between both drug arms and placebo that was sustained out to the later time points, which is very impressive. and this is the first study that we've seen that's a pure placebo study. all the other studies we've done have both monotherapy and background antidepressant therapy. so this really represents a true benefit for zuranolone in a patient population. it's a very clean, very well-run study. we don't think the fact that the study should benefit in 20 mg and 30 mg and impact the opportunity that we've seen in 50 mg at all. so as jim said, it will be very important from an efficacy and safety perspective.
akash tewari -- jefferies -- analyst
and just lastly, on excessive sedation, do you think you'd be able to avoid that box warning for 217? thanks.
barry greene -- chief executive officer and director
yes. again, it's too early to talk about the specifics of the label, but we don't see excessive sedation. so that's not a current issue.

thank you. our next question comes from the line of vikram purohit from morgan stanley. your line is now open.
gospel -- morgan stanley -- analyst
good morning, thank you for taking my call. this is gospel, on for vikram. my question is, what can we learn -- what can we expect to learn from the luminary readout later this year? and what do you believe defines success for this readout? thank you.
barry greene -- chief executive officer and director
yes. thanks, gospel. let me start and then i'll ask jim to talk more about luminary. so i will remind you that we designed sage-718 to be a positive modulator for nmda. it was based on the hypothesis that 24s-hydroxycholesterol was seen at lower levels in cognitively impaired neurodegenerative patients specifically discovered in huntington's disease. so we set out for the kind of most homogeneous population first with huntington's, then parkinson's. and while alzheimer's is much more heterogeneous, what we're hoping to see is the same kind of stabilization or improvement in executive function and memory that we saw in huntington's and parkinson's patients. so those are the data we're looking for later in the year. jim, anything to add?
jim doherty -- chief research officer
yes. barry, i would add to that, we believe that sage-718 offers a truly novel opportunity here using the mechanism that barry described. this is a way of interacting with nmda receptor is a very powerful system in the brain. and so we've designed what we call the cognex program to really examine the ability of 718 to have effects on learning, memory, executive function across a number of different patient populations with the idea of a truly new way of interacting with cognitive deficits in a number of these disorders. and so at this point, we're trying to understand which patient populations show the most benefits.
and to date, we've talked about the results from the huntington's and parkinson's populations. and so luminary represents a similar investigation of alzheimer's patients. and so by intent, many of the endpoints and many of the trial design elements are similar across studies. so we'll be looking to see what effects we're having in the ad population, but you can anticipate that many of the sort of trial design elements and endpoints are going to be similar to what we've looked at with both the huntington's and parkinson's patient populations.
operator
thank you. at this time, i would like to turn the call back over to barry greene for closing remarks.
