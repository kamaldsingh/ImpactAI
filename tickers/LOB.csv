chip mahan -- chairman and chief executive officer
greg, good morning, and thanks. in these trying times, you find out what you're made of. what do we, live oak as an institution, stand for? are we just a bank? yesterday, a top four bank account officer told their customer, we don't know anything about the ppp program. call the home office.
what do each of our folks stand for? well, we found out. we reverted to our original guiding principles, and we stood tall. we have always thought of the three-legged stool to business, our folks, our customers and our shareholders. with this thesis that if you do everything humanly possible for your folks and hire the right folks, and you tell them they have one job and one job only, treat every single customer like the only customer in the bank.
and simultaneously, you tell your very talented credit folks that rule no. 1 is soundness, rule no. 2 is profitability and rule no. 3 is growth.
then all three groups will win. shareholders will win. i cannot begin to tell you what all 600 of our folks have done. all 600 have been going at it 24/7 since the situation began.
here are some responses from the field customer. what we're facing right now might be characterized as an economic meltdown. we have prided ourselves in never laying anyone off due to lack of work in 30 years in business until we were forced to curtail operations this march. we can't tell you how thankful we were to see that loan amount in our business checking account this morning.
today, we spent hours planning on how we will bring our employees back and resume our full operations as soon as it is acceptable to do so. no. 2, wow!! i just logged into my bank account and the money is their!!! i feel like crying. i am so happy!!! payroll is thursday, and everyone will get 40 hours!!!!!! no.
3 and lastly. live oak took it upon themselves to try to save the lives of over a dozen restaurants in wilmington. i mean emails at 3 a.m. kind of attempts to help keep these family businesses afloat.
you know the military gives medals for this sort of service. i cannot say enough. now let's take a step back before the virus. we were on our way to achieve what we said on the last call.
we were highly confident we were going to exceed and maybe substantially exceed 2 billion in originations. on the liability side, we were moving all of our savings and cd customers to finxact on the 13th of april. the loan portfolio was growing. next-gen deposit platforms were being delivered.
credit quality was excellent. then boom, the virus. who could have predicted that the united states government would choose the sba platform to distribute what might be $1 trillion in capital to american small business. so now it's game time, and we lept into action.
how can america's no. 1 sba lender help? first of all, i'll get the rules right. as everyone knows, the sba has lots of rules, rules for the express program, rules for 7a, rules for 504. migrations, the book is 550 pages long.
but that was not the object of the exercise. how can treasury and the sba stand up a product overnight to be distributed by banks, in fintechs alike, to literally millions of small businesses. i will remind you that in a normal year, about 3,000 banks make about 25 billion in sba loans. the first 350 went in 13 days.
your team here and other experienced sba lenders had a lot of input into that product. that was launched at 12:01 a.m. on the 3rd of april. now the absolute key to this strip down sba loan is to get a loan authorization number.
this platform is called e-tran. well, e-tran is kind of like my grandfather's jalopy. sometimes you just have to whack old betsy with a hammer. well, we know sba's betsy better than anyone.
many knew that and asked for our help and we gave it to a top four bank, to several top 10 banks, to canopy banks and to some of the largest systems integration firms on the planet, so everyone could win, so small business could go in, so america could win. so what has happened here at the bank to level set? we have 4,400 customers. we service 5,600 loans. before the cares act, 1,128 customers asked for a 90-day deferral of principal and interest, and it was granted.
in the cares act, the u.s. government will pay all principal and interest for six months to 100% of sba borrowers. this should give our customers some breathing room. this is highly fortunate for live oak bank.
after the launch of ppp, we had the following goals: get cash in the hands of 100% of our borrowers that needed it, help small businesses in the communities that we operate and [indiscernible] partners in our verticals. that has happened. as of this moment, we have close funded 4,826 loans, totaling $953 million. we have e-tran numbers for an additional 131 businesses, totaling $28 million.
and 116,000 jobs were saved by these 4,960 business. as we await the starting gun on round two, our pipeline to help others is substantial. lastly, it is our belief that help is on the way on the other side. the express program has been temporarily increased from $350,000 to 1 million.
it is our understanding that the house version of phase 4 of the cares act includes an increase of the guarantee percentages from 50% in the express program to 90% and an increase in the 7a program from 75% to 90. both increases would be temporary, and there is absolutely no certainty that this would happen. it would be good for our customers and good for america. as always, my opening comments discuss credit quality, historically, everybody listens.
this time, i think you'll listen. so i'm moving to slide 5 -- 4, slide 4. i don't think there's a banker in the land or a board that wouldn't be pleased with the ratios noted above. and as always, we like to note our effective capital ratio.
500 million in capital at the bank level, 61 million before the accounts mess with a loan loss reserve that huntley is going to tell you about, about $2 billion of unguaranteed paper for an adjusted capital ratio of about 26%. and on top of that, almost $1 billion of sba guaranteed loans, which if you slap whatever premium won on that is substantial additional capital. in addition to that, we have about $1 billion prepared on the balance sheet before the fed allowed us to finance these loans differently. we took down $50 million in a credit facility at the holding company, bringing the holding company's cash position to about $60 million in cash to begin to attack this challenge.
huntley, over to you.
huntley garriott -- president
thanks, chip. to follow up on his comments, in times of stress, banking fundamentals always seem to come back to liquidity, capital and credit quality. and we believe we've always run a conservative balance sheet. but as the quarter unfolded, we took some precautionary steps to strengthen that even further.
as chip mentioned, $1 billion of liquidity on our balance sheet. that increased by almost 25% over the quarter. we also sold an incremental about $50 million of 7a loans to shore up a little more capital here at the end of the quarter. our risk capital stands at a healthy almost 15%, and in times like this, it's also nice to have $1.7 billion worth of -- or nearly half of our loan portfolio guaranteed by the government.
you might have seen in march, we authorized a small share repurchase program to better position ourselves when we get to the other side of this. we have not repurchased any shares, and we don't anticipate doing so until the world settles down. our dividend is reasonably small at just $0.03 a share, and we plan to maintain that unless things get really rough. chip talked about credit quality.
i'll cover it in more detail, but we've always followed the guiding principle that safety and soundness comes first, and we believe we've been prudent in our credit decisioning. but you only can really tell that prudence in time of stress when you see how well your customers with the help of their bank are able to navigate a crisis. as a small business bank, we find ourselves in the last few months squarely in the eye of the storm. from the time the pandemic started, we've been in touch with 100% of our over 4,000 borrowing customers.
as chip mentioned, we've processed deferrals for over a quarter of them, and we're able to secure payroll loans for all of them who needed it. once we secured sba authorizations for our existing customers, we reached out into our community and the industry verticals we serve. and as chip mentioned, we originated nearly 5,000 loans and nearly $1 billion of payroll loans. we're also proud to report, as chip mentioned, that as of this morning, 100% of those customers have loan docs in their hand, and we funded over 97% of them, which is, as chip mentioned, over 115,000 jobs.
when you turn to the results of the quarter, though, admittedly, there's a lot going on in the numbers. our lending franchise started the year off strong, the deposit franchise was operating extremely efficiently, and we were continuing to build recurring revenue. secondary markets for 7a loans were robust, and our loan pipeline was at an all-time high. all that feels like a lifetime ago.
as the virus spread and the nationwide lockdown set in, our deal pipeline slowed dramatically. and while we continue to see some activity in selected areas, like renewable energy and agriculture, primarily, most of the new business activity has been put on hold. small businesses across the country were facing significant revenue challenges seemingly overnight. after we mobilized the deferrals on our portfolio, we turned 100% of our attention to these payroll protection loans.
now as we close the books on q1, the obvious item that was most impacted was our loan loss provision. and as luck would have it, the industry also faced the implementation of cecl this quarter, and we elected to adopt the new standard starting july 1st. also, of note, in conjunction with implementing cecl, we reclassified a portion of our loan loss reserve into a fair value adjustment for loans accounted for a fair value in accordance with the disclosure requirements for those loans. a bit of balance sheet geography shift that i'll talk about in a minute that add to a bit of the noise.
but all in all, we increased our total allowance by about $13 million, largely as a result of the deteriorating macro environment. given the significant sell-off of risk assets across pretty much all markets into the end of the first quarter, we also saw some volatility in our mark-to-market assets on our balance sheet despite the work we've done over the past 18 months to reduce those impacts. secondary markets for sba loans declined by as much as four points into the end of the quarter. interest rates dropped precipitously and other market indicators decreased across the board.
these market changes impacted our gain-on-sale revenues, the fair value of our hedges, our servicing asset revaluation, as well as the loans we carry at fair value. if you look at the highlights on page 7, for the quarter, our balance sheet and recurring revenues continue to grow nicely year over year and quarter over quarter. all the metrics are largely on track. although expenses were up as we hired into the end of the year, as chip mentioned, our lending franchise, and we continue to invest in our next-generation technology initiatives.
fundamentally though, many of the same trends that we've discussed with you over the past year continued during the first quarter. given the moving pieces in the quarter, we thought it might be helpful to outline the various adjustments on our income statement and try to take a closer look at the core earnings power of the bank, which we lay out on page 9. overall q1 bank core earnings were pretty consistent from q4, but there was an awful lot going on in between. so a little more detail on that.
the total credit-related expenses that would have previously been in the provision line was $18 million, which comprises $11.8 million addition to the provision and $6 million that is included in the fair value adjustment on loans. the mark on our usda lending hedges drove a $4 million swing as loan interest rates dropped 125 basis points in the quarter. the fair value losses on the loans accounted for under fair value was $10 million, and as i mentioned, over half of that was related to credit. our servicing asset continued to mark down despite the significant slowdown in prepayment speeds.
and with the sba paying six months of principal and interest on the entire servicing portfolio, it's actually a pretty solid asset right now. and lastly, our fintech losses ran a little higher than the fourth quarter. so all in all, there were a bunch of headwinds on the income statement that masked what was a pretty solid quarter as it relates to the earnings power of the franchise. chip covered the credit stats in the quarter, so i won't go back through them again, and the forward is obviously more important than the stats, but i do think it's worth mentioning that our portfolio was really healthy heading into this crisis.
as a reminder, over $1.7 billion of our loan portfolio is guaranteed by the government, 1.6 billion of sba and 100 million of usda and a total of $3 billion of the loans on our balance sheet are sba loans, including both guaranteed and unguaranteed. and as chip mentioned, the sba will be making six months of principal and interest payments on all of those loans and that's on top of the deferrals that we processed before the cares act took place. you combine that with securing payroll loans for our customers, and we believe that our borrowers have a few unique aspects that will better help them weather the storm. i'll also point out, as i have on prior calls, the diversity of our loan portfolio.
and while we certainly do have some exposure to some of the higher-impacted areas, like hotels, fitness centers and day care centers, we also have some areas, like renewable energy, chicken farms, self-storage and government contracting, that are much less impacted by the current events. in terms of our go-forward thoughts on credit, it's honestly too early to predict the depth of these impacts and the effects the government intervention will have to mitigate challenges that our customers face. but we're actively engaged with our entire portfolio, especially those most impacted. we're staying very close to our customers, having reached out to 100% of them.
we're monitoring their liquidity real time, helping them manage their fixed expenses, working through options around rent and franchise relief and trying to ascertain as best we can when revenues will return to some semblance of normalcy. the initial tools at our disposal, deferrals, payroll loans and p&i support from the sba, have provided critical breathing room and capital to a large portion of our portfolio. as we progress, we're confident we have the capital liquidity we need to provide working capital to our customers that need it to help them through this. as we indicated in prior calls, we did not expect the day one impact of cecl to be material to our loan loss reserve, although the changes in the forecasted macro event were significant.
the day one impact ended up being a $1.3 million decrease to our allowance. and as we closed the books on the quarter, like most other banks, we evaluated which macroeconomic scenarios to use to calibrate the lifetime loss model in cecl. we settled on the rna pandemic scenario, which contemplates sustained high unemployment that escalate throughout the year and ends in double digits. on page 12, you can see the impact of the reclassification to our loan loss reserve that we mentioned earlier, basically requiring us to separate our loan portfolio into those loans held at historical cost and those loans held at fair value, and reallocate our existing loan loss reserve into those two buckets.
as you can see, it really is just balance sheet geography. all in all, our modeling for the quarter generated an additional 13 million in credit reserves previously classified as allowances, which comprised of about 7.6 million in the allowance and a 5.4 million increase in the credit component in those fair value loans. if you look on the far right of page 12, you can see the total of about $61 million of reserves across those two categories. and if you look at that on a really simplistic basis, we have a little over $2 billion of unguaranteed loans or about a 3% protection on those loans.
given the uncertainty of the ultimate outcome and timing and shape of any recovery, we're going to remain conservative as it relates to forecasting and spend all our energy supporting our customers. on the funding side, our deposit platform remained really efficient. and in a lot of ways, the events in the last six weeks have reinforced the importance of digital banking offerings. given the overall stress in funding markets, however, liquidity remained paramount, and our deposit portfolio has not repriced downward quite as quickly as we might have imagined given the fed's actions.
we've seen some pretty rational downward pricing recently, though, and think the opportunity for us to gain some ground here in the near future. if you look at the blended cost, though, it's still a really great source of funding with minimal overheads. we remain really excited about our operating accounts that chip mentioned and building out checking accounts and launching that. and in a near zero interest rate environment, we find ourselves -- the gap between those two costs on a fully loaded basis actually is pretty compressed versus the savings products that we have now.
in terms of our net interest margin, our recurring revenue growth was solid and margin was stable in the first quarter. that said, the fed action in terms of timing came at a pretty bad time for us as our -- 55% of our loan portfolio will reprice with 150 basis points of fed action here at the beginning of q2, and we were just at the tail end of a lot of our q1 cd repricing. so we expect our margin to take a hit in q2, but to recover in the back half of the year as the deposits reprice. we also had warehouse significant liquidity, as chip mentioned, in anticipation of the ppp program and with the introduction of the fed facility funding 100% of those loans at a 35 basis point cost of funds, we find ourselves an extremely liquid balance sheet, which is great from a risk perspective but will also compress nim in the near term.
on the expense side, as i mentioned earlier, we hired into the end of last year, anticipating a banner year of small business lending and technology deployment. the silver lining to that is we found ourselves fortunate to have 600 incredibly talented, incredibly dedicated teammates who rolled up their sleeves and have been collectively working around the clock throughout the ppp program helping small businesses across the country. we repositioned over 200 people into new roles and processed 5,000 loans in two weeks. for context, that's four times more loans than we made in all of 2019 in two weeks.
and we're back to work at that as we speak, committing to getting more funds into the hands of small businesses to help preserve jobs and keep them going through this. so our expense line looks high, largely a result of our team, and we don't plan to change that. one thing to note, as you triangulate expenses and capital, almost $3 million a quarter of our compensation expense is stock-based comp, which help us from a capital perspective. our team is rock solid, and while the long-term path to sustained profitability may be pushed back a little bit, we're more confident than ever in our model of service to small businesses.
aside from salaries and benefits, we had a couple of million dollars in increased expenses related to our technology initiatives as we continue to build what we believe to be the next-gen platform for the future of small business banking. it really feels like our thesis related to technology and banking has only been reinforced by recent events. given some of our experience with hurricanes, distributing 600 people remotely and working in cloud-based technology has become pretty ordinary course for us. and over the last six weeks, we really haven't missed a beat.
in some ways, you can argue that we've collaborated even better with zoom and teams, and our entire company rallying around a common mission. generating these ppp loans at scale requires flexible architecture and great technology platforms. with the help of our partners, we stood up our ppp lending platform quickly. we funded loans on the first day of the program, and we booked loans onto a purpose-built finxact platform, which we believe will dramatically increase our efficiency in the forgiveness process.
in our experience, the importance of robust digital banking offerings, coupled with great customer service, wins the day. we spoke directly to every single one of the 5,000 small businesses that we funded ppp loans for. and while there may be some fully automated solutions out there, the feedback we got from our existing and our prospective customers was extraordinarily positive. we believe the marriage of great people and great technology truly is the winning model.
as chip mentioned, we haven't lost sight of our broader technology initiatives, namely replatforming our entire company on the next-gen platforms, like finxact and aperture, and launching our digital small business checking account. we still believe as strongly as ever in our model bank initiatives, but we paused them for a bit as we turned our attention fully to the ppp program. we're still on track for deployment of our model bank this year, savings in cds, launching on aperture and finxact in the near-term and a checking account close behind. in the payroll loan program, we've proven that we can pivot quickly and redeploy people on the fly.
as we look to launch these new deposit products, our team is energized and excited to focus on the new opportunity in what looks to be a slower lending environment in the near term. meanwhile, our portfolio of companies within live oak ventures continue to perform well, aperture, finxact, payrailz and others. canopy is sitting on roughly $500 million of dry powder to make financial technology investments, and the banking industry now appreciates more than ever the need for next-generation platforms to deliver digital banking services. so how do you wrap all this up? do we go back to the long-term goal slide that we've shown in previous quarters? clearly, we didn't move the needle forward on the profitability side this quarter.
and with new business activity slowing and the need to help our existing customers, our priorities have obviously shifted a bit. but we firmly believe the goalposts remain the same even if it takes us a little longer to get there. sustainable revenues -- sustainable returns will still require additional scale on our balance sheet in a more normalized lending environment. but if the past is any predictor of the future, we expect to see great opportunities to help provide capital to small businesses on the other side of this.
away from the payroll protection program, sba loans have always been critical components of economic recoveries. and we believe we're well positioned to provide working capital to recapitalize small businesses and help them recover from the impacts of this crisis. our long-term mission remains unchanged to become the nation's best small business bank. our current mission and our obsession lies with helping small businesses across the nation through this crisis.
as a company, we focused heavily on the safety and well-being of our people. and our people, in turn, are dedicating all of their energy focusing on the safety of our customers, offering them advice, loan deferrals and payroll loans. we quickly expanded our attention beyond just our existing customers to help small businesses in our communities, both local and within our industry verticals, to help administer payroll loans, to provide critical funds to small businesses. that mission is still under way.
we've been inspired by the tenacity of our customers and by the small business owners across this country. they truly are and will continue to be the american dream. roll the questions.
chip mahan -- chairman and chief executive officer
ready for questions.
",":
operator
[operator instructions] our first question comes from the line of jennifer demba with suntrust. your line is now open.
jennifer demba -- suntrust robinson humphrey -- analyst
thank you, good morning. i hope everyone's doing well. so many questions. so just starting with credit, you guys do have only about two dozen or so verticals that you work with.
just curious as to what you feel like the most vulnerable industries are that you're talking to right now. i know you're -- you've got a unique borrower base with the sba guarantees and what they're going to do above and beyond right now. but who do you feel like is the most vulnerable right now?
steve smits -- chief credit officer
so jennifer, this is steve smits. thank you. so yes, we've identified what we would call our most impacted industries, as you can imagine, dentists, family entertainment centers, early childhood education, wine and craft, fitness centers. that makes up just north of 20% of our portfolio.
now what we've done with them is, first and foremost, where it's come in handy is that we've been very diligent about collecting quarterly financials. so the first thing we do is we look at the most recent precrisis financials that we have in each of these businesses and take a look at their balance sheet, see what their fallback position, their liquidity positions look like. we map that against their income statements and their historical fixed cost overhead, and we've run analysis on how many months can they sustain based on a pretty material impact to their top line revenue. and then as the government programs and interventions kick in, we map against the impact that they will have.
so we did reach out, first and foremost, besides just these most impacted businesses, to chip's point, 100% of every small business borrower of live oak bank on a phone call. we had a very detailed, spent a good bit of time talking to them, assessing how they felt. we immediately reacted with the deferrals. about 19% of our clients expressed the need for deferral.
and then we -- as the government started kicking in with these programs, we saw that flatline and even go down and some of them opting to hold off on the deferral, not the least of which the impact is the six months of payments by the sba. so 76% of our portfolio are sba 7a loans that will have the full p&i payments made on -- for them on behalf of the u.s. government. so that's created some confidence among these folks.
ppp, every small business borrower of live oak bank that expressed a need and a desire for a ppp loan received one. so that also then created some confidence in this group as well. so we continue to map what their liquidity positions look like, how impacted their revenues are and then try to assess the impact of these enhanced programs that are coming out from the government to monitor them very closely.
chip mahan -- chairman and chief executive officer
and jennifer, so i would look at that in kind of four tranches. no. 1 would be payment deferral. no.
2 would be ppp. no. 3 would be, as steve mentioned, the government making payments on their behalf. and then no.
4, we do feel like there's a good shot of more money coming at a 90% guarantee. so our average loan is about 1.3 million. so 25% would be either guarantee percentage toward a 3.750 million bucket. so having additional financing capabilities with a 90% guarantee for working capital to take them beyond this challenge, i think, would be in order.
but we'll see.
jennifer demba -- suntrust robinson humphrey -- analyst
can you elaborate on the economic scenario that was factored into your provision? you mentioned it very quickly, huntley, but could you say that again and just give a little more color?
steve smits -- chief credit officer
yes, jennifer, this is steve smits again. so clearly, the most impactful was because it is a factor that we used for unemployment. so we assumed an immediate impact to an increase in unemployment right off the bat and then sustained and increased unemployment throughout the year. so that was pretty impactful.
that was probably just shy of an $8 million impact to the provision just by making that assumption. time will tell. but right now -- and because cecl looks at lifetime loss scenarios, that had a pretty meaningful impact to the provisions.
jennifer demba -- suntrust robinson humphrey -- analyst
how much participation do you expect to have in the second round of ppp? will you go beyond your current client base? or what are you expecting there?
chip mahan -- chairman and chief executive officer
well, jennifer, we're going to go like a bat out of hell. so we have partners that we're working with, some substantial partners, and we're trying to predict [inaudible] a bit more technology. round one was kind of the concierge, brute force, get it done for our customers tranche. who knows when they're going to hit the starting gun, maybe some have said at 12:01 a.m.
tomorrow. but we're ready, and we're going to go as fast and hard as we can.
jennifer demba -- suntrust robinson humphrey -- analyst
and what kind of -- huntley, you mentioned that some of the hiring that you've done late in the year obviously came through in the first-quarter expenses. so do you feel like first-quarter expenses are a good run rate going forward? what kind of expense control will there be to put in place to kind of offset some of your provision needs?
huntley garriott -- president
yes. it's a great question, jennifer. i think obviously, things are a little hard to predict right now. clearly, things like travel expenses are going to be down for the near future.
our team is in place. we don't expect that to grow at all, but it will stay what it is, and we're going to be redeploying folks. we might have folks going out and finding new checking account customers here before along with folks who historically have been in some other roles. clearly, some of those folks are going to shift into more portfolio management work.
and i think, my gut tells me there was a little bit of noise on the expense side this quarter, but we always have a few puts and takes. so i don't want to say it's thing dramatically lower. but i don't think you should expect it to increase much through the course of the year.
jennifer demba -- suntrust robinson humphrey -- analyst
right. and what about future loan sales? what does the market look like right now? is there any market for sba 7a loan?
chip mahan -- chairman and chief executive officer
brett?
brett caines -- chief financial officer
yes. this is brett. right now, the secondary market is a little bit tough. the buyers that are out there are typically just the buyers that want to buy in portfolio government guaranteed loans.
there's a bit of a, i'd say, slowdown with any buyers who are pooling loans. and that's just sort of during this time difficult to getting a pooling certificate. so there is activity. loans are moving, but given the reduced number of players in the market, premiums are compressed a bit, as huntley mentioned, referencing the roughly four percentage point drop on average for loans that are being sold right now.
jennifer demba -- suntrust robinson humphrey -- analyst
my last question is for chip. chip, what do you think the long-term implications of all this are for your company and for the banks, in general? you just already talked about you think this certainly underscores the need for more technology. but any other implications you see?
chip mahan -- chairman and chief executive officer
jennifer, when i put my head on the pillow at night, i just think about our customers. and as you know, we go see 100% of our customers before we make them along to try to determine if they have the eye of the tiger. and so now we're going to find out because they didn't ask for this, we didn't ask for this. but we're going to swarm them after this ppp thing is over.
and who knows where all that's going to end. but we have a geographic dispersed portfolio. we're in 33 separate industries. the -- i actually think we're in the best position of any bank in the country because of the nature of the sba program and everything that we've talked about previously.
and i think we'll be better on the other side. we have spent the latter part -- best part of the last three years working on these next-gen technology platforms. we were right on the precipice of launching finxact. we're booking loans on a finxact core today in the ppp program.
so america will be back. our customers will be back. live oak is not going anywhere.
jennifer demba -- suntrust robinson humphrey -- analyst
thanks so much.
operator
and our last question comes from the line of chris donat with piper sandler. your line is now open.
chris donat -- piper sandler -- analyst
hey, good morning gentlemen. thanks for taking my question. so with all the other changes going on in the world, i'm making a small change to trying to fill the seat that aaron deer has vacated as he takes the cfo position. what i wanted to have is someone who's new in looking at the story, when i look at your dominant position in the sba market, the 1 billion of loans disbursed under ppp seems sort of small, but can you help me understand that? is it just because you focused on the -- on your existing customers that that limited how large it would be in ppp? i just want to kind of understand the scope of ppp for you, the first round at least.
huntley garriott -- president
yes. so look, i mean, the existing customers most of the banking industry was servicing their existing customers, which is more streamlined from a kyc perspective, you go outside of that and you go into new customers [indiscernible] at scale you got to make sure you're comfortable with fraud, you're comfortable with your kyc criteria or customer -- you're comfortable with eligibility. and we took a bit of a more manual approach in terms of reaching out and talking to people. and so we went through all of our customers over the course of a couple of days.
that went really efficiently and then we wanted to actually see where we could have an impact. so we did -- again, we did four times more units than we did all of last year in the course of two weeks, right? so i think we turned the crank pretty hard there were some fully automated solutions, and i think some folks used to turn massive volume. and we'll see if when the dust settles, if they did a good job knowing the customer, knowing the eligibility, making good loans, being able to get the forgiveness, done the right way and ultimately being able to effect the guarantee when some of these loans go bad. we think about all of those things having been in the sba business for as long as we have.
there are banks that are much, much larger than us that did about the same amount or even just a little bit bigger than us that had 10x more people filling out forms all day long. so we're really proud of what we did.
chip mahan -- chairman and chief executive officer
and chris, just -- i would remind you that our chief credit officer, steve smits, used to run the office of capitalize assets at the sba. so kind of the no. 2 guy at the sba in the last crisis. no one knows more about is that 100% guarantee or not than steve and his team.
so maybe we were a little conservative early and relative to other banks, i just say, well, just let's fly on this because it's guaranteed by the government. maybe, maybe it is and maybe it didn't. we are highly confident that every ppp loan we made is 100% guaranteed by the united states government.
chris donat -- piper sandler -- analyst
got it. appreciate that. and then one of the challenges of this environment is the social distancing. and chip, you talked about how you still meet with your clients and look in their eyes and see if they got the eye of the tiger, how are you handling one-on-one meetings or on-site meetings in a social distancing environment? are you capable of doing those meetings to resume in document exchanges or data rooms or something? or just help us understand how the world shifted for in the last month.
chip mahan -- chairman and chief executive officer
steve, why don't you take that one relative to?
steve smits -- chief credit officer
i'll start, and i'll let huntley add to it. we've -- i've been one that is not real tech-savvy and a wizz at zoom. so out of adversity comes opportunity, right? for me, i've embraced technology and found the wonders of other means of communication that can be as effective and meaningful. so being able to zoom in, have conversations, i would think that actually what we've given up as far as face-to-face walking in the front door, we've gained in exponentially more conversations with our borrowers than we ever have in the past.
and we're already pretty good at it.
huntley garriott -- president
yes. i also think technology has arrived just at the right time in this. we have construction portfolio, right? and so they're managing draws and site visits and inspections, and those are happening virtually, right? and we're seeing collaboration happening in that way. we are, as steve said, incredibly plugged in and in communication with our customers.
would we like to be doing that and also going and shaking their hands? absolutely. for our existing customers, that's actually not really that much requirement. we've met them in person. we've shaken their hands.
now our relationship can be totally virtual for. net new customers, look, as the world evolves, we will be back to face-to-face. we think that's important, too. but we're awfully connected right now.
there's no question about that.
chris donat -- piper sandler -- analyst
got it. and then just last one for me on the economic forecast you're using that huntley talked about. i just want to make sure i got it right. it ends in double-digit unemployment.
huntley, did you give us a time frame for that? i was scribbling.
huntley garriott -- president
so through the end of the year, we'll be -- we'll still be double digits through the end of the year in this forecast and then start the -- some slow recovery after that.
chris donat -- piper sandler -- analyst
got it. understood. all right, thanks very much.

james s. mahan -- chairman and chief executive officer
good morning, all. and thanks, greg. huntley and i could not decide this morning to whether we were more excited about unpacking the accomplishments of 2020, or more optimistic about 2021 and the new products we have to sell. so here's today's agenda. as always, here it starts and ends with safety and soundness. we will discuss our fortress-like balance sheet and the many arrows that we have in our quiver. and yes, the federal government has come to the aid of small business america. as steve smits, our chief credit officer likes to say, our borrowers have been kicking the can down the road, and i will give you an example or two of that and how that works.
we're going to talk about real core earnings. everyone that owns our stock is trying to figure out post this horrible covid thing, to what are live oak's core earnings post ppp 1.0 fees, post ppa 2.0 fees. what will charge-offs be. will live oak release reserves, etc., etc. many of you always ask about how our technology investments are doing, and neil will provide some color on that. and as always, huntley will dig deep into the details of our operations and give you a glimpse into the future.
on to the next slide, micah. of course, there are highlights here. no past dues in the second quarter. no past dues in the third quarter. helpful from the subsidy from the sba. steve has 50 young folks that report to him that are on the phone every single day with our 4,200 customers. and the jump in our watch list ratio from about 8% to 9.5% is quite predictable. and now to the middle of the page, and our fortress-like balance sheet that we -- i always like to talk about. so, sure, $522 million of capital, and ever-increasing loan loss reserve at fair value mark of another $75 million. we have $2.5 billion of unguaranteed paper, so that gives you an effective capital ratio on the exposure that we have in this bank of about 24%, and boost the reserve and fair value mark to about 3% of unguaranteed paper. but wait, there's more. our treasure chest was about flat this year at $1.7 billion. if you mark that, the market is worth between $140 million and $170 million in pre-tax earnings.
and yes, we're going to talk about our tech investments. we put up $18 million to invest in these companies today, a carrying value of 82, last round of financing at 155, so tier 1 equity of 74 on just that alone. when you add all that together, it's a very unusual sale of a fortress-like balance sheet. now kay anderson and i had been in business together for more than 30 years. she helped me start the bank. and i asked her about six months ago to dedicate her life to what we affectionately call the covid 6. so, in keeping with what we said in q3, kay, will you let the investors know how things are going with the covid 6.
kay anderson -- senior vice president of emerging markets
sure. as chip mentioned, i've been tasked with keeping my finger on the pulse of what's happening with the six industries and verticals that we believe that are most impacted by covid. we started our analysis of the six at-risk verticals by bucketing all of the typical bankwide portfolio statistics and examining the characteristics on these covid 6 vertical borrowers, which comprise about 17% of the total bank portfolio or $439 million of unguaranteed exposure. noteworthy here, related to the six verticals, is that while the category criticized and classified assets has increased slightly during q4 as compared to q3, classified assets have actually stabilized. the increase being almost solely attributable to borrowers, who requested a second deferral due to covid, necessitating in some cases a downgrade to risk grade 5, and a trip to the criticized asset category on our watch list.
we continue to recognize the risk in the covid 6 verticals, as state and local restrictions impact in these businesses.
looking at non-accruals, in the hotel categories, there are actually three hotel borrowers on non-accrual. one suffered a fire, three hurricanes and earthquake and now covid. one, transaction, one hotel loan will likely be resolved by the end of january and one is in foreclosure.
turning to the entertainment vertical, again, there are three borrowers on non-accrual, all of which experienced some stress prior to covid. of those, the largest exposure by far has now received the main street loan, as well as other cares act benefits, and is well positioned to come through covid, emerge and return to profitability.
this reflects the break down of assets held for investment by exposure and the credit reserves including fair value mark for the covid 6, as well as the balance of the bank's portfolio. of note, during q4, the majority of the hotels in our portfolio were reappraised, which somewhat impacted what you see here. on a weighted average basis, the loan to value of the hotel portfolio, as of the original credit approval date, was about 59%. while not all of the appraisals have been completed, we are missing four out of 40 i think. the new ltv is roughly 67%, so up slightly.
and those on payment deferrals and receiving subsidy payments are reflective of the cares act benefits received by our borrowers. as of 12/31, the total portfolio exposure on payment deferral was, as you can see, about 11%. today, that number is 4%.
back to you, chip.
james s. mahan -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks, kay. moving on to the next slide, micah [phonetic]?
so, since huntley does such a wonderful job running the bank day-to-day, i've had the chance in the last 90 days to go to 22 cities, and i'm going to give you a glimpse into what's going on in small business america right here right now.
we made a loan in one of these cities to a bowling alley group, right. this is a $4 million loan. this business has been shut down all but eight weeks since the second week in march. they received $242,000 of ppp 1.0. they got an eibl or a disaster loan of $500,000. today, they have $65,000 in cash and a $100,000 line of credit. so about four months to cover their $35,000 a month firm. however, help is on the way. ppp 2.0 is $250,000. $250,000 and $165,000 is $415,000. so that's about 12 months to see this to the end of this vaccine to see if this business can get back to where it was. and where it was, was a $2.5 million revenue business drop in $500,000 to the bottom line. and it was fun and telling to note that of the 22 leagues that these folks operate, in the eight weeks that they were up and running, they have 100% participation of their over 70 league. these folks wanted to get out of the house and back to bowling. so there is an example.
now on a brighter side, in terms of new originations, which we're also excited about, last week, i went to eugene, oregon, portland, oregon, seattle, denver and houston, there were $27 million of loan on the fence, and we're going to get every one of them, offense [phonetic] in 2021.
moving on to the next slide, i would call this underpinnings of optimism slide and the dawning of a new product. and just a word on the new product. so in the last several days, the sba has increased the guarantee on their 7(a) products. so 90% guarantee on $4.167 million, which covers about everything that we do, and a waiver of their fee and their fee on that would be $114.000. this gives us the ability to compete up and down the line even with conventional lenders.
so the essence of this slide you see the last six quarters, we've averaged origination of about $500 million. in the last two quarters, about $879 million. very excited about year-over-year growth of originations from $2 billion to $2.7 billion, that's a 34% increase. all the time around this place we talk about 15%, whether it's originations or eps, the wonderful thing about 15% is it doubles every five years. so, yeah, that's right. $3 billion to $3.1 billion, that's doable for 2021, and we're excited about it.
moving on to the next slide. so here is a glimpse of originations in q4. you'll immediately see that the $1.4 million of average unguaranteed balance per loan is a bit high for us. and this was skewed a little bit about senior lending, which we're getting into senior housing and some main street loans, which are one-offs and this should progress to the norm in the future.
on the right side, you see what the original verticals did, again, the way i expect about the pharmacies, etc., etc., so of that $808 million, about $332 million were the original folks and then 2017 to 2020 are gaining huge momentum, almost $500 million of originations. we're very excited about our general lending group. last year, the general lending group about 18 folks throughout the country, would have been a top 10 sba lender on their own. a lot of excitement about that going forward.
i guess i'd call this slide, the next slide, micah, the object of the exercise today. so really excited about growth in the loan portfolio. 34% year-over-year, $3.6 billion to $4.8 billion, but what even more exciting than that are the growth in non-gaap pre-tax pre-provision, excluding ppp activities, from a little over $17 million in q4 '19 to almost $28 million in 2020. so this is real simple math folks. that's over $10 million, times four for the year is $40 million. that's about $1 share of pre-tax. very excited about that.
so last slide before we turn it over to huntley. neil, as i look at our technology investments, these folks are raising capital with the exception of amateur every 12 to 18 months. and some just completed, some are in process, all at higher valuations. but my view is they're all doing well.
neil underwood -- president
yeah, those are my words. live oak ventures portfolio really continues to perform. super exiting, finxact live. it's opened us ton of doors [indecipherable] we go into contract or implementation. payrailz and defensestorm signing $5 million to $10 million a quarter. greenlight with record december, record month. apiture, you read about, is $10 million. so again, we're excited to update you every so often, but certainly the $155 million number is subject to change, given the up rounds that are forthcoming.
james s. mahan -- chairman and chief executive officer
huntley, over to you. take us on.
huntley garriott -- president, live oak bank
thanks, chip. as we put 2020 in the rearview mirror and focus all of our energy on the year ahead, our priorities have remained unchanged. we are still laser focused on helping our small business customers navigate the remainder of this pandemic, supporting our employees and our community, providing capital to small businesses as they help drive this economic recovery and delivering innovative technology solutions. one common effort that spans each of these that we're really excited about is driving more inclusive small business growth where we've dedicated a team specifically to serve underserved communities.
if you haven't had a chance yet i'd encourage you to review brett, cfo, highlights. he does a masterful job of going through all the details. at a high level, we incredibly proud of what our team has been able accomplish in 2020 and the momentum that we carry through the fourth quarter and into '21.
as chip mentioned, strong loan origination and our strategy of holding more loans on balance sheet drove core loan growth ex-ppp of 7% linked-quarter and 34% year-over-year. the guaranteed loan portfolio, as chip mentioned, was flat quarter-over-quarter as we pulled forward a significant amount of those loans eligible for sale in the third quarter given the sba subsidy program, but we still managed to grow that portfolio 80% year-over-year. our balance sheet remains strong and well equipped to continue to provide capital to our small businesses as they grow.
on the earning side, the biggest contributor remains our loan originations, as chip discussed. second half of the year, we originated about 1,000 loans, totaling $1.75 billion, that's exclusive of the ppp. that spread across the nation and verticals, as chip mentioned. small business america has proven themselves to be incredibly resilient through this pandemic and overall optimistic. we're proud to have been able to serve as many as we did last year.
the loan origination coupled with our efficient deposit model drove net interest income growth up over 20% from the prior quarter, even adjusting for ppp of about 16%. our flexible balance sheet funding model allowed us to regain much of the margin declines we faced with the rate cuts from earlier this year. expenses were up this quarter, mostly predictable as we returned to a bit more of a normal operating environment. we'll cover that in a couple of slides. and all of that drove the number that we look at as core profitability. the mouthful that chip mentioned of our adjusted pre-tax pre-provision income. so at $28 million in the quarter, which is a 4% increase from last quarter and a 60% increase year-over-year.
so we know we don't make it easy for you all to track our core profitability in this quarter. we have a couple of items that were in discussion. you can see them listed here on page 16. first and most material was the vesting of a series of market-based restricted stock units, which is a function of the increase in our stock price during the quarter. followed that by the impact of the c-corp conversion by apiture, which is associated with their total of $30 million of capital raised in the back half of the year, and then the ongoing impact of our ppp activities. let's spend a minute on the market rsus. on page 17, we'll go through some details. as we previously disclosed, the total of 3.1 million of these restricted stock units that were held by employees, with [indecipherable] vesting based on stock price triggers between $34 and $55.
in the fourth quarter, 2.5 million of those satisfied their required trading levels and vested. subsequently, since the start of the year, another 200,000 have vested, leaving just shy of 400,000 remaining. from a financial perspective, there is an increase in salary expense with the acceleration of the remaining unrecognized income and the associated payroll tax. conversely, there is an income tax benefit derived from the value of delivered stock relative to the amount estimated for book purposes. and you can see those numbers here.
in addition, as we net settled those shares on behalf of our employees, we have a cash and equity reduction as well. all-in-all, a modest reduction in book value and the issuance of about 1.4 million shares. after the vesting in the first quarter, we have a little less than 15% of these original rsus remaining, and we've replaced this market-based rsus over the last couple of years with issuance of time vested, so there should be a little more predictable on the balance sheet and income statement. the turning to ppp of the $1.75 billion that we originated, we have about $1.5 billion remaining, drove about $15 million of earnings in the quarter, and we continue to recognize those earnings through amortization and forgiveness. forgiveness accelerated a little bit at the start of the year, but then it took a bit of a pause with the new documentation requirements and then concurrent launch of the new ppp program that we'll talk about.
so as chip mentioned, new stimulus bill came into path at the end of the year, which funded almost $300 billion of additional into the ppp program. that reopened the original program and also introduced a second draw for small businesses with more than 25% revenue decline. we've been actively focused to support our small business customers in that program and have about 3,000 applications currently in flight. separately, as chip mentioned, the bill also made some significant enhancement to the sba flagship programs, namely the 7(a) and 504. and the 7(a) guarantee increases from 75% to 90% fee waivers both to the lender -- to the borrower and to the lender, and then additional subsidies, which you can see on this chart are a little complicated based on the origination date, but provide more payments up to max of $9,000 a month, which will affect the majority of our portfolio and give them additional support for between three and up to eight more months.
so we're really excited about what that is going to do for our origination volume pipelines. putting all these pieces together, on page 20, this is the details of our core earnings. so obviously, a lot going on here. but it's really the way we think about the core earnings power of the bank. adjusting for ppp, which we talked about, some of the unusual event that we mentioned, and we calculate that non-gaap pre-tax pre-provision earnings number of $28 million in the quarter, and that's year-over-year a 40% increase despite 150 basis point rate cut. we mentioned those three large adjustments precise from that, we've got the provision that we continue to feel really good about the performance of our loans, will remain pretty conservative until we come through the other side of this virus.
we've got the usual mark-to-market items, which were down a little more than usual, partially as a mean reversion from the third quarter as prepayments jumped up a bit post the sba's first round of subsidies, and then a little dip in the secondary market at the end of the year as the talf program expired. but overall, this is really the metric that we looked at the growth that we drive here from an earnings perspective.
if you go to page 21, just one more look at the growth of our loan portfolio and how that drives net interest income. really nice trajectory over the last eight quarters of core loan growth. chip talked about origination franchise, pipelines remain consistently high and broadly across our core small business across the core renewable energy platform, and then really its been throughout the bank. so we mentioned these guaranteed eligible for sale portfolio that was flat quarter-over-quarter, sitting at about $1.7 billion. we really do like the way that those guaranteed assets sit on our balance sheet. they provide us with not only earnings but contingent capital and liquidity. for the year, our loan sales were a little below our stated targets, selling 35% of the sba. but we ended up retaining about 70%, and then we sold about -- we retained about 20% of our usda loans.
we sold heavily in the beginning of the year as we positioned the balance sheet defensively, and then we really made up for that with the outstanding loan production in the back half of the year. and going forward, we still think that 35% hold on 7(a) is without the right level, and we'll sell most of the usda production as those are typically longer fixed rate. so a couple of comments on expenses. our operating non-interest expense, we peg it at about $48 million, the largest adjustment being those salary, payroll taxes from the market rsus. your q3 expenses were unusually low. we talked about it a bit last quarter. as we got back in more normal operating environment, travel and marketing picked back up. and we also invested in some resources at the end of the year to support our growth, including salaries and technology and professional services.
we expect to generate significant operating leverage throughout 2021, with continued growth, and we'll invest more in the franchise to try to keep our expenses, sort of well below the growth level in our earnings. the other thing we expect is that we'll return to some of the renewable energy tax investing that we've done in the past, that will show up in the non-interest expense line item, but it'll be more than offset in the tax line to the extent that we do that. our deposit model continues to be a huge driver of value for us in this current environment. the market remains liquid and competition rational. our rates have come down significantly with interest rates and our current products pricing between 60 and 65 basis points. customers across the industry are increasingly transacting digitally, and our service model is perfectly equipped to deal with remote operations. the model also allows a great deal of balance sheet control. total retail deposits ended the year at $4.3 billion and about 62,000 accounts, that's up substantially from a year-ago, but it's flat this quarter, and that was intentional as we we're reinvesting excess liquidity.
we also, you can see, increased the mix of our portfolio. our savings balances are now up to about 50% of our book and that's well up from closer to a third a couple of years ago. so we really like the mix. as you can see, 7 basis points of non-interest cost of funds. we think that the blended cost of this is incredibly competitive relative to funding in the industry. so our cd book continues to roll down the curve with almost $2 billion maturing and repricing this year. all-in-all, at current market rates, that you generate an additional $25 million of annual net interest income from those continued effects this year. so we're really excited about that as well.
on page 26, that repricing along with the continued deployment of our excess liquidity led to significant margin expansion in the quarter. margin recovered 56 basis points to 3.33%. we've gotten most of the way back from what we lost from the market declines -- or the interest rate declines in the beginning of the year. the margin trend continue to look favorable as we head into this year. we should be above 3.5% by the back half of the year after the majority of the positive repricing happen in the first half of the year. and even though we anticipate a little more competition on the lending side, overall, we've been really pleased with our ability to maintain our loan yields.
the loan growth has allowed our liquidity levels to return to pre-covid levels. we probably have a bit more room to run there, given the amount of liquid assets and guaranteed assets on our balance sheet. but we're really pleased with the ability to deploy that cash that we raised in the first part of the year as quickly as we did. all of that leads to a balance sheet that as chip mentioned feels very fortress-like, with over half of our assets guaranteed by the government, and that's not including ppp. we feel really good about our capital and our liquidity positions.
the one capital ratio we paid the most attention to remains our leverage ratio, given the amount of government-guaranteed assets we have, and that dropped at the beginning of the year with ppp and the excess liquidity. we built it back up a bit in the third quarter, the rsu vesting lowered that leverage ratio back almost about 50 basis points. and while we plan to be closer to 9% by the end of the year, we ended up relatively flat from the third quarter, probably tracked that about 8.5%, maybe a bit more as we head into next year, but feeling really solid about that and where we stand overall from a capital perspective.
just quickly on page 29, each quarter we share our progress toward the metrics that we consider to be high performing in the banking industry. and if you sort of overlay that with the growth that we're seeing, we think lead to a really, really attractive story. we'll continue to improve that core profitability each quarter and share these with you.
we've spoken a lot about our technology platform. we're pleased that we're live in production on our new core finxact and apiture and the rest of our partners. and we're closing in on almost 1,000 active deposit accounts on the system as we sit here today. you combine that with the over 11,000 ppp loans and counting, and we're confident in what we've built and the flexibility that it provides to serve our customers. and yes, we do have a limited number of checking accounts that are in production. took another brief detour at the beginning of this year to tackle the new ppp program and then we'll get back to rolling out some pretty exciting enhancements to that product that will make it more attractive for small businesses and we're really ready to start scaling it into the market.
looking forward, we're well aware of the rate of change that's taking place in financial services and think we're really well positioned to capitalize on what we see as a convergence of banking and fintech. we know our small businesses inside now. we'll stay laser focused on them every day. we know the industries they operate in and the specific challenges that they face. we've served these small businesses for over a decade by providing the most complicated financial product available to 7(a) sba loan program. and we have a next-gen technology platform that's going to allow us to expand these products and deliver a really unique customer experience.
we think that at the end of the day, small businesses need a few key element in their banking relationship shown in the middle of page 31. better ways to move money, easier access to capital, consolidated account management, information for the business owner, not necessarily their accountants, and a modern digital experience. and all of that with someone that understands them and is available to help them when they need it. and that's exactly how we've designed our business model. as we go forward, our roadmap revolves around product and solutions designed specifically to satisfy those core elements: better payment tools, rapid small dollar lending, actionable data insights and integrations with key partners in specific verticals. we truly believe the future of banking will marry our traditional lending capabilities with these technology-driven solutions and all of that to further support small businesses. we've got a ton of momentum in our core business that feels really great and we're equally as excited about what's to come.

good morning.
james s. mahan -- chairman and chief executive officer
good morning, jennifer.
jennifer demba -- truist securities -- analyst
there was a lot of noise in the fourth quarter results, and thank you for going over everything so comprehensively. so let's talk about what -- it sounds like you're demand still pretty healthy, but you're expecting a bit more lending competition this year. just curious as to what kind of origination volume you think is possible in '21? and is hiring still a possibility for this year? and how many people did you hire last year? thanks.
james s. mahan -- chairman and chief executive officer
i'll take the front end of that. and, huntley, you can take the back end. so feel real good, jennifer, about $3 billion to $3.1 billion for next year. we have seen some banks sit on the sidelines, not many people are traveling. as i indicated in my comments, we are out there, all day, every day, masks on, sometimes it's fbo, sometimes -- the companies place a business, but we see -- i see the demand coming back, just like the bowling that i told you about the bowling alley. so people seem to be so excited on what's going to happen in the other side, the pent-up demand is going to be absolutely there.
relative to hiring, $3 billion to $3.1 billion with the team on the field. huntley, you can comment on jennifer's last question.

sure. so our headcount was roughly flat for the first half of the year through all of that sort of turbulence, we ended up hiring a bit in the back end of the year, but not much on the front end of the lending side. chip's point, we think that team is largely on the field. there's a few spots on that side. we're going to add a couple in the renewable energy space. we think there is a lot of exciting stuff there. a couple of more generalist, as we continue to find sort of the best in the field there. and then put in a few more younger people often teams to help expand some footprint. but the lending side is largely, we think, in place.
in terms of the rest of the franchise, we'll probably end up growing at about 10% overall as you think about what we need to support that kind of production and that kind of growth. so the balance sheet grow in 20% plus number of customers that we're servicing, we just got to keep up with that across some of the functions, whether it's the servicing, closing, teams like that. so i think 10% sort of headcount growth this year is a pretty good number i think to peg, but it will largely be more in some of the support functions and it will be kind of on the front line.
jennifer demba -- truist securities -- analyst
okay. and, brett, huntley mentioned you guys think with more deposit repricing, your nim can reach 3.50%-ish later this year, second half. can you give us little more color there on what you guys are thinking of the net interest margin?
brett caines -- chief financial officer
yes, sure. i would probably reiterate what huntley said, we feel good that we can maintain our -- lot of our rate offerings on our loan products as we're seeing our existing deposit portfolio continue to reprice down. i'd say for 2021, if you're looking at 3.5% and then maybe some potential upside to that number, maybe a little upside from ppp as well.
jennifer demba -- truist securities -- analyst
okay. and, chip, you said there's a bit -- a bunch of markets in the last few months and you're encouraged by the trends you're seeing. what prompted you to kind of get out there and do the mass visit?
james s. mahan -- chairman and chief executive officer
look, huntley does -- jennifer, you've down here, right. huntley does a great job running the bank. 5,000 meetings a day. i'd like to go see customers and know what's going on out there. so, kay and her colleagues and steve and his colleagues have been pilling on with me and we're usually gone two to three days a week to mainly understand what the risks are in the covid 6, but recently trying to get new business, particularly some conventional loans that we're working on potentially some very, very large usda loans in the energy division.
jennifer demba -- truist securities -- analyst
got you. brett, what do you think about tax rate this year?
brett caines -- chief financial officer
yeah. as huntley mentioned, we are looking at some renewable energy tax equity investments. and so we think we'll have some success there and that will lower our base effective tax rate. it won't be lower than 2020 considering the big impact we had from market price are issued, but rather than an effective tax rate around 25% that's probably something in the mid teens, mid to high teens, most likely.
jennifer demba -- truist securities -- analyst
okay. and do you think you can still grow ppnr this year, ex-ppp loans?
brett caines -- chief financial officer
absolutely.
james s. mahan -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah, sure.
jennifer demba -- truist securities -- analyst
okay. it sounds like you can hold expenses certainly below revenue growth. okay. i'll let some others go. thank you.
james s. mahan -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks, jennifer.
operator
you next question comes from the line of ammar samma with raymond james. he is going to ask a question.
ammar samma -- raymond james -- analyst
hey, good morning everyone.
james s. mahan -- chairman and chief executive officer
good morning, ammar.
ammar samma -- raymond james -- analyst
hey. so the first question is a follow-up on finxact. i believe we've talked in the past about the pilot program being rolled out here in early '21. saw the deposit update from you guys. is there any update as far as adoption from other banks? or just your overall outlook for that product line here in ' 21.
huntley garriott -- president, live oak bank
yeah, i think the pipeline of finxact looks quite robust, during the process actually of the rates. and that's one of the upper outs that i was referring to, and much of the upper out is due to regional and super regional banks committing, but contractually balanced, in some cases implementation. and actually this is probably a pretty large overlap between some of the canapi lps and some of those banks that have selected and implemented.
yeah, a more for us, at the bank, i think we continue to march along, for us it becomes a general availability of checking, when are we ready to block that out broadly. the conversion of our existing 60,000 deposit customers, which will happen middle of this year, and then we move to the broader loan suite beyond the ppp loans to the rest of our of our loans. so we will hit these sort of in these stages and just continue to to make more progress and move more, because the magic of this for us is when we have that singular view of the customer that single ability to create new products to embed our financing in our products into partnerships, that's what i think is really exciting. that's sort of convergence of loan deposit on boarding and servicing and different service and channels.
ammar samma -- raymond james -- analyst
okay, very good. and then on overall fintechs, have you all done any research or work in the digital asset or cryptocurrency space? and if so, what are your thoughts there.
huntley garriott -- president, live oak bank
we have a deal. i think it's one of the major initiatives for canapi with our presentation, from really need from, [indecipherable] and other firms that are really focused, not necessarily on crypto themselves or perhaps of enabling banks to be a custodian or to offer crypto to their end-customers, and so it's something that we're leaning into pretty heavily.
ammar samma -- raymond james -- analyst
okay, thank you. and then one last question from me on the core banks. the reserve plus mark as a percentage of unguaranteed exposure was up a little bit this quarter, back to that 3% number. just given your commentary, how should we expect this number to trend in 2021, and where does it stabilize in a ""normal environment""? thanks, guys.
james s. mahan -- chairman and chief executive officer
i'm going to ask steve smits, our chief credit officer to comment on that.
steve smits -- chief credit officer
so, ammar, good morning, this is steve smits, chief credit officer. so i would say, i have a great deal of confidence in our methodology. i also am cautiously optimistic with how our businesses are going to fair throughout 2021. the reality is there still remains some degree of uncertainty. i will say i have confidence in our underwriting, which provides a strong foundation for our businesses to weather storms. i have confidence in our service and support. we had kay speak to you all today to showcase our commitment to servicing. we've put resources and people and processes to be in front of them. i have confidence in the government intervention. it appears to be working. chip mentioned it tends to push things to the right. however, that is precisely what most of these businesses need. if we look at the bowling alley as a good example. that's exactly what they needed.
so while there is some degree of uncertainty of how they will fare, we have confidence that everything that we're doing, combined with the intervention and help from the government appears to be working. so i would kind of say that i expect our provisioning in our model, in our allowance, will track fairly consistent with how the economy does in 2021.
ammar samma -- raymond james -- analyst
that's it for me, guys. thanks for taking my questions.
james s. mahan -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks, ammar. your next question comes from the line of michael perito with kbw. you may now ask your question.
michael perito -- kbw -- analyst
hey, good morning, everybody.
james s. mahan -- chairman and chief executive officer
good morning, michael.
huntley garriott -- president, live oak bank
hi, mike.
michael perito -- kbw -- analyst
wanted to just start on slide 19 for a second here. two questions, i guess one on the left hand side. when we think about some of the changes from the sba program, i mean, in terms of the fees wave for the borrower, is the right way to think about that in terms of just making this product even more attractive and potentially growing your pipeline even further. but there is also small fees wave for yourselves to write, will that result in some temporary yield pop over the next six to eight months? however long that this program lasts or is that the right way to think about both those pieces of it?
james s. mahan -- chairman and chief executive officer
steve, that's about 55 bps.
steve smits -- chief credit officer
correct.
analyst
yeah, so we get to pick that up as well. and that again is another arrow and equivalent to the sales guys, right. i mean we don't want to give that away. but, yes -- yes to all of the above.
michael perito -- kbw -- analyst
all right. and on -- in terms of the second, the biggest, technically the third round of ppp, or i mean, as i said 3,000 applications. any initial ballpark of kind of what that could look like? i mean, are we talking in like $750 million -- billion type volume, lower, a little higher. any kind of early indications of what that might look like in a range?
james s. mahan -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah, it's a good question, mike. we originally thought that number would be north of 50% of our initial production. over the last couple of weeks i think we've tempered that a little bit and so somewhere between 30% to 50% of our initial production. so $500 to $700-ish million of volume feels about right. but it's interesting because there was a mad rush a year ago. and i think people are a little bit more calm in terms of how they're approaching. this was unclear if we're seeing that volume that we're going to see or if it's just going to keep trickling in for another handful of weeks or months, so we'll see.
michael perito -- kbw -- analyst
but it is fair to -- just given kind of the confines and structure of the [indecipherable] around of the program. i mean, the loan sizes are likely smaller on those 3,000 applications. is that fair. so, you've eliminated the large loans.
huntley garriott -- president, live oak bank
right. you know the cap is $2 million not 10 million. so you've eliminated definitionally some of those large loans, although those were the less fee at a lower fee on them. but our average balance is running a little lower than the first round. but they are roughly the same size transactions as they were a year ago for the most part. people second draw, it's pretty much the same as the first draw with the exception of some of those larger loans, which we didn't do a whole lot of anyway.
michael perito -- kbw -- analyst
understood.
brett caines -- chief financial officer
and then mike.
michael perito -- kbw -- analyst
yeah, sorry, go ahead.
brett caines -- chief financial officer
sorry, mike, this is brett. i had one point of clarification, the 55 basis point on the sba loans. you framed the question as did that benefit yield. and from a reporting perspective, that actually -- it will not be reflected in non-interest expense for those loans. the 55 basis points is not an interest income or yield item.
michael perito -- kbw -- analyst
i got it. so it's a temporary, maybe just two quarter, little -- slight relief on expense essentially until goes away, or presumably.
brett caines -- chief financial officer
it actually carries forward on all the loans that are originated in that window. it will carry forward for the [indecipherable] sampling.
michael perito -- kbw -- analyst
all right. helpful. thank you for that clarification. a couple of other things. i want to hit one on the deposit growth. just curious if you guys have any more feedback you can share about the new business account that you guys have launched, and what maybe kind of targeted customers you've had success with growing that account? and kind of how you view the rollout of that products moving into 2021? and if there is any kind of range bound or early indications you can give us in terms of kind of the deposit mix and how it could start to shift, that would be helpful?
unidentified speaker
sure. so the existing success we've had is our traditional platform. and so those are businesses with excess cash that our deposit might have on the business savings and cd side. and there is some overlap with our core customer base, but not an extensive amount. the new product that we are rolling out the sort of [indecipherable] checking account is where we really plan to focus on our existing customer base, and and that's when we'll start to shift this mix. you saw the mix go to 50:50 savings cds roughly and start to bring in those non-interest bearing checking accounts into the mix. and again, i think it will be relatively slow. our customer bases are not massive dollars balances by and large, although there are some areas we're looking at where we might be able to pick up some large about this, but i think we're a little early still to pick a target in terms of that mix. [indecipherable] could we be a third checking and then a third [indecipherable], that would be great. it will take us a bit of time to get there.
ammar samma -- raymond james -- analyst
sorry, go ahead chip.
james s. mahan -- chairman and chief executive officer
sorry, ammar. neil and huntley and i talk about this all the time, right. so i was looking at a firm in [indecipherable], yesterday, the day before, and a firm's market cap is $25 billion. they had 1,200 employees. they did $500 million in revenues and lost $100 million. and then i looked at fifth third, the other day. they did $8 billion in revenues and made $2 billion, been around since 1858, and there were $20 billion. and then you look at [indecipherable] and you get prepaid or point of sale in the firm and wow, they have built a beautiful interface and a purpose-built core for their customers. and that's what stands out and a lot of us to do. huntley touched on it, but that's what so much fun in dealing with our customers face-to-face and seeing what do you need to operate your business, all the way top to bottom, from payroll to this to that. and as this matures and we continue to pilot the finxact core, then you will see more product innovation from us across all verticals.
ammar samma -- raymond james -- analyst
yeah. makes sense. that's great. and then just if i could sneak one -- last one in here. on slide 31, on the right hand side, you guys mentioned a few things, talking about kind of tomorrow for live oak. and the one -- the channel partnership to me, is it fair to think of that within kind of that embedded finance angle that you guys have kind of touched upon in the past? and if so, any thoughts, chip, that kind of probably plays into some of the products and things that you were just talking about, but any thought in terms of when we could start to see that initiative take hold in terms of the company's overall growth rate?
huntley garriott -- president, live oak bank
so, you're exactly right, like it is that we've got embedded finance and we're having a bunch of great discussions with partners' channel in different verticals, enterprise software and alike. and i think this year really getting our existing product set that we can deliver through those channels, maybe by the back end, we start to get some partnerships on board and then we think it's really going to move the needle next year in terms of when you're really going to start to see the impacts run through the p&l.
ammar samma -- raymond james -- analyst
and is that something you guys plan on kind of -- it might be a stupid question. but in terms of the partnerships as they kind of come to fruition, is that something you guys plan on kind of announcing to the market and keeping us updated on or it will be more just like quarterly broader updates about the growth of the channel partnerships in general?
james s. mahan -- chairman and chief executive officer
i think the answer is yes if they let us.
huntley garriott -- president, live oak bank
yeah, we'd like to [speech overlap] we do.
ammar samma -- raymond james -- analyst
yeah. okay. excellent, guys. thank you for taking my questions. appreciate it.
james s. mahan -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks, ammar.
operator
your next question comes from the line of chris donat with piper sandler. you may now ask your question.
christopher donat -- piper sandler -- analyst
thanks. good morning, everyone. just two i wanted to ask here. one is on deposit pricing. i think, huntley, you commented that it's been rational so far. and i'm wondering, as you think about your competitors on the deposit side, what is your outlook for 2021? because it seems to me like there is a lot of banks sitting on excess deposits. so they're probably not going to put much pressure on. you got some credit card companies talking about some -- like tentatively talking about growth and they're typically big payers on deposits. and i'm just wondering if you feel pretty confident about the rational state of the market being there or is there even some possibility of some lower deposit pricing going forward given the excess deposits at many institutions?
huntley garriott -- president, live oak bank
yeah. look we feel good as we sit here right now. there is, as you said, a ton of deposits in the financial system right now. interest rate, feel, like they're going to be in a range bound in zero for the foreseeable future. and the big banks, as you mentioned, the big players in the market that we see are the same ones and 60 basis points on savings, 60 basis points, 65 basis points, somewhere in there on their cd rate. feels like it's where it is in the market. if we really hit the growth button, we can move the needle down a little bit. and if the market sort of stays where it is, can we drop it a little bit? yeah. but that means we're talking 5 basis points and 10 basis points, not 25 basis points and 50 basis point move as we look at it.
christopher donat -- piper sandler -- analyst
got it. okay.
james s. mahan -- chairman and chief executive officer
well, chris, i look at that the other way. so it is amazing to me, so i would back and i looked at the big four and what they pay on interest-bearing deposits in q4. it's all 4 bps, 5 bps on all interest-bearing deposits. most everyone to money market accounts, 1 bps, ok. so we and goldman and marcus and [indecipherable] were 60 basis points. so when you have these purpose bill cores in fintech companies or like we will be at finxact, when you can change a checking account while you're sitting and standing in lot of chick-fil-a, why am i paying 60 basis points more than big -- why do you leave your money at the big four? i fundamentally don't get it. i think that's going to ultimately be a very level playing field.
christopher donat -- piper sandler -- analyst
okay. i guess related to that i feel like we've seen some tentative efforts on deposit pricing more from -- almost on the asset management side, some of us call them robo advisors that have used deposit pricing as a way to grow assets. it's more of an open-banking play that they've got the access to know that someone has excess deposits at a place that earning 4 basis points or 5 basis points, and then they serve up a message on the app that says, hey, you could move here and get 60 bps. i imagine that's a small thing and you're not really seeing competition from that?
huntley garriott -- president, live oak bank
no, we certainly haven't seen any. there certainly is customer acquisition sort of plays that are going on and then there are companies that have very different sort of goals in terms of profitability and targets and things like that, they can do things for typically shorter periods of time, but the vast majority of the market is staying is pre-existing pretty range bound right now.
christopher donat -- piper sandler -- analyst
got it.
james s. mahan -- chairman and chief executive officer
we might be one that actually go and do that. they do just with the congregation using tools like mx, which -- canapi happen to invest in apiture as [indecipherable] in mx. so it's not likely that live oak would jump out to varying areas since pharmacists looked cd balances where they are getting the 1 basis point and bring them over to us.
christopher donat -- piper sandler -- analyst
got it. that's very interesting. and then, just wanted to ask one about the sort of the state of play for not just your fintech investments but canapi. as we look at the proliferation of facts, does that affect on one end canapi's ability to make investments because these facts are bidding up the prices of potential investments for canapi? and on the other side, is that a positive impact likely on the -- on some of these capital raises you're seeing and ultimately exit valuations for fintech companies, or do you not really think about your fintech investments as places you really want to ever exit or exit at least in the near-term?
james s. mahan -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. look, first of all, you mentioned valuation, certainly they are high, however, canapi has never been more active. last year, we placed $170 million and with the follow-on, call it, $220 million so about it, a third of the fund in blue chip names like [indecipherable] we mentioned greenlight. in some cases some of those have had already up around to double. so we're really excited about the model in our austin bank lte partners. it really is working. we're getting front-row seat. we're getting first look at many of these fintech. so we see that momentum continuing quite frankly at canapi. and it's fact that they done their job and just accelerating the excitement around us. and it's up to -- look, we look at fact relative to lifecycle, it's live oak ventures company as well as our canapi company, so there may be a scenario where we leverage back as a tool, but right now we see it as a net positive.
christopher donat -- piper sandler -- analyst
got it. okay. thanks very much.

operator
good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the first quarter 2021 live oak bancshares incorporated earnings conference call. [operator instructions]
i would now like to turn the conference over to your host, mr. greg seward, general counsel at live oak bancshares. you may begin.
greg seward -- executive vice president, general counsel
thank you, and good morning, everyone. welcome to live oak's first quarter 2021 earnings conference call. we are webcasting live over the internet and this call is being recorded. to access the call over the internet and review the presentation materials and commentary that we will reference on the call, please visit our website at investor.liveoakbank.com and go to today's call on our event calendar for supporting materials. our first quarter earnings release is also available on our website.

i will now turn the call over to chip mahan, our chairman and chief executive officer.
james s. mahan -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks, greg, and good morning, and welcome to our q1 earnings call. as you can see from the agenda before you, we are kicking off today's call with a tribute to our co-founder, kel landis, who passed away on january the 2nd. your board proudly created the kel landis student excellence fund at his beloved university of north carolina kenan-flagler business school. we love you kel.
some things never change. once again, huntley and i will attempt to unpack a healthy, and yes, noisy quarter. as i try to put myself in your position as to what really matters as the pandemic and government assistance to small businesses winds down, steve smits and i are going to discuss the covid effect on our customer base and a brief look ahead. we shall then turn our attention to q1 loan originations and what loan growth looks like for the rest of the year, as most other banks report a decline in loans outstanding and net interest margins. trust me, that is not our challenge. neil underwood will provide a brief update on live oak venture investments as well as what he sees through his canapi lens. lastly, back to the noise, before i turn it over to huntley for greater detail, i'm going to focus on the metric that means the most to me, the core earnings of this business, which is a brief examination of our pre-tax pre-provision income.
so steve, just about a year ago, the world was pretty bleak. and as i recall, you and your colleagues were predicting potential dire circumstances and maybe even losses of over $100 million. you quickly move to isolate six of our verticals and disclosed that the current state of play in each quarter. two questions for you. number one, what losses have we taken from the covid-6? and secondly, what have been the covid losses in the rest of the bank?
steve smits -- chief credit officer
thank you, chip. yes, there certainly was a great deal of uncertainty. i was probably in the $34 million loss expectation in the early days. but to-date, we've taken $11.6 million in charges related to covid. however, $9.8 million of that was related to our hotel markdown. so if you exclude the hotels, we've charged off $1.7 million in loans that are directly a result of covid stress. and of that, $1.2 million was in the covid-6 industries and only $600,000 has been in the non-covid industry.
i do think it's important to note however that we've already reserved an additional $5 million on top of that for loans that were impacted by covid. they may ultimately turn into charge-offs, but we're working very closely with them. we've also reserved another $10.8 million for loans that are experiencing some level of stress due to covid, but i'm pretty cautiously optimistic as they are trending favorably today. so the expectation is we can avoid losses in most of this.
james s. mahan -- chairman and chief executive officer
so steve, clearly, we will be adding reserves for growth. but what does your crystal ball say about charge-offs for the rest of the year?
steve smits -- chief credit officer
while businesses still are not completely out of the woods and we do need to be prepared for potential surprises based on what i know today, i'm expecting charge-offs for the remainder of the year to be more reflective of pre-covid levels. as i mentioned, we continue to work with borrowers still experiencing stress due to covid, but at the same time, we're seeing a notable gain in credit quality across the rest of our portfolio. many businesses are actually stronger today than they were pre-covid and that's thanks in large part to the government programs.
james s. mahan -- chairman and chief executive officer
so steve, our reserve plus fair value mark on our total held for investment unguaranteed loan portfolio was right at $70 million at the end of the quarter or 2.6% of unguaranteed loans, down slightly from year-end of 3%. how do you look at reserves post-covid?
steve smits -- chief credit officer
so chip, i see reserves trending toward pre-covid period levels as a percentage of loans and then barring any surprises i'd expect that we'll see that trend over the next several quarters.
james s. mahan -- chairman and chief executive officer
so two of your verticals in the covid-6, the restaurants and wine and craft beverage may get assistance from the restaurant rehabilitation fund as administered by the small business administration. it's my understanding that there is a pool out there of about $28 million for both restaurants and related businesses. we've heard that the calculation they go something like this; 2019 revenues less 20 revenues less ppp 1.0 less ppp 2.0 equals grant money. how do you see that?
steve smits -- chief credit officer
so if the program funds remain available, there is a small number of our most impacted restaurant borrowers that actually will see really significant benefits from the program. now the good news is that our portfolio in our quick-serve restaurants have actually fared really well, thanks to their delivery and their drive-through services. they may not even need a grant. now with regards to our wine and craft borrowers, this program can be very meaningful to our really our smallest breweries who have historically relied pretty heavily on-site sales in taprooms for example. so again, barring funds being available for the program, we're pretty optimistic that are most in-need borrowers can see significant benefit from this program.
james s. mahan -- chairman and chief executive officer
so let's move on to the site visit slide. thank you, mike. there it is. i call this our standby our customers slide. we try to treat every customer like the only customer in the bank. and when you're in a jam, we're going to be there for you. so to support steve's lack of charge-offs through the pandemic, in the last four months, we've made in the pandemic 121 site visits to these folks and the losses predicted, as steve just did, are rather de minimis. so when you net all this mess out, we generated about $100 million in fees including spread income from ppp and the losses were just like we discussed.
so let's move on to the next slide. let's focus on originations and growth. so how did to go first quarter? so we did originate and close $1.180 billion in loans. $672 million was non-ppp, $508 million was ppp. so that reconciles for $1.180 billion. in addition to that, so far in the month of april, we closed another $280 million. so $280 million plus $672 million gets us to $952 million for the year, which is just about $1 billion. and if you add the $508 million in ppp, that gets you to $1.460 billion or about $1.5 billion. things are good.
moving on to the next slide. so we rarely do this, and we're not going to disclose the actual dollars amount. but what you have here is a bifurcation of our pipe. so proposal to underwriting is the blue and credit approval to closing is the green, both are up 60% year-over-year. just another word, i had the wonderful circumstance yesterday afternoon to spend about an hour with our closures. and to say that we're burning the midnight oil in attempting to keep up with this volume and treat every customer like the only customer of the bank would be an understatement. i also have the chance to visually zoom in and meet six new closures. and another six new are coming on in the middle of may. so in the last couple of quarters, we've added five lending officers, 13 underwriters, 25 closures, 16 servicers for a total of 59. so when the business is there, we're going to go get it.
moving on to the next slide. this is our diversification slide, and the trend continues. one of these quarters we're going to make loans in all 50 states, 45 ain't too bad for 90 days. and it looks like that our new verticals after 2017 are gaining on our legacy verticals late at $280 million versus almost $400 million by the legacy verticals.
neil, talk to us about investments inside the holding company and some of these valuations that you're seeing at canapi, brother.
neil underwood -- president
well, certainly, touch on it in a bit. but first on out, like you just stated, only to say that things are tracking nicely and a lot of the ventures portfolio, most importantly, the software is actually really working. we've had for years, as you guys know, huntley will give you the live oak bank update. but in terms of the companies themselves, they are experiencing greater market adoption, net new logos with larger annual contract values.
cloud-based and api first are proving themselves out, offering better customer experiences, more optimal economics, really lowering the total cost of ownership. all these companies continue to raise capital at appreciating values. in fact, two of these companies you see in the state are in a raise currently. as a reminder, the thesis of live oak bancshares was to leverage the collective r&d budgets of all of these companies, rearchitecting bank infrastructure, which we all know is many decades old. equity appreciation is certainly nice, that's secondary to our first -- to being first out with the new cloud-based tech.
switching gears to canapi, last quarter, we finally closed out the fund totaling $660 million with 40 bank lps, the aba and the icba. and the thesis of working here as well as we continue to win deals away from blue-chip silicon valley venture funds. most notably in q1, we led $130 million-rounded notarize alongside capitalg, which as you know it's google's venture arm. notarize digitizes the notary workflow, bringing gig economy notaries together with large enterprises and their clients. what is even bigger than that in our view, we think of notarize as the uber of trusts.
in terms of the market, we are indeed gypsying this massive valuations, it's super frothy out there. one thing that we're able to do though is actually invest at good valuations, given our limited partner base for the 40 banks, the icba and aba, and that's super exciting to us. we're able to get access to good deals where maybe others won't. we're also able to wedge ourselves in where there is not a formal round, we can actually go in, and given our lp base, so strategic, create around and create an event.
and again, just back to live oak and how canapi affects live oak, in our role at canapi, we define success by surfacing the best in fintech and sharing with the live oak product teams. economics are also very real in the fund structure, but they too are secondary. huntley, over to you.
james s. mahan -- chairman and chief executive officer
no, i got one more slide, neil, but that's a good job, buddy.
neil underwood -- president
chip, over to you.
james s. mahan -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah, yeah. so my last slide. it is my most important slide, and i'm going to attempt to make a case that the $24 million of pre-tax pre-provision income in q1 really ought to be closer to the $30 million. and you know, huntley, i was thinking about this earlier today, i have been in this business almost 50 years, 48 years, and i am convinced myself that you almost have to be a certified public accountant to actually understand a bank income statement.
so i'm going to read something that jennifer demba wrote last night, talking about $3 million of the $6 million of adjustments that i'm recommending that you focus on. she says, as of q1 2021, live oak will not elect fair value for the unguaranteed retained portion of all new government guaranteed loans sold. this decision reduces volatility and drives more predictable revenue for lob. under the fair value option, the unguaranteed retained portion is revalued each quarter. therefore, the legacy portfolio of loans at fair value will remain subject to quarterly fair value adjustments. not electing fair value generally results in a larger discount on the retained loan portion and decreasing net gain on sale revenue. the discount is subsequently accreted into interest income over the remaining life of the loan.
to many that will sound like gobbledygook. let me see if i can unpack that. in relatively good times, we say we can sell a loan for about $100,000 per million. under this new change, that $100,000 will go to $20,000. and the $20,000 will be accreted into income over the life of the loan or if prepaid accreted instantly. so you can change your forecast by that amount over the entire portfolio going forward. this gives us, as jennifer says, more predictable earnings. for the quarter, that was about $3 million. so if we recorded like we historically recorded, that $24 million would be $27 million. the other $3 million are legal fees, which are non-recurring, we certainly hope, in the not too distant future relative to a previously disclosed lawsuit.
and here to really drill down on all those details is our president, huntley garriott.
huntley garriott -- president-live oak bank
thanks, chip. before we get into the numbers, i want to spend just a minute on what's been and continues to be a pretty intense last year for our small business customers, all of our employees and the communities that we serve more broadly. our focus has been and will remain to take care of those customers, to take care of our people and to try to serve as an agent of change in those communities. so the areas of focus are the same, as chip said, hopefully, we're emerging from this pandemic and we're all looking forward to some easier times, but we continue to stay focused.
so on the balance sheet on page 13, the overall growth trends remain really strong. loan growth up 33% year-over-year excluding ppp, 5.5% linked-quarter, driven by the strong loan originations that chip referenced coupled with slower prepayment speeds as borrowers enjoyed some of the additional subsidies from the sba. the eligible for sale portfolio continue to build, although at a bit of a more measured pace than last year.
on the income side, overall with provision down, fair value is moving in the right direction and the tailwind from ppp, the headline earnings number of $0.88 feels really solid. breaking down those key drivers, we talked about loan origination. when you combine that with nim expansion that drove strong growth in net interest income, both year-over-year and linked-quarter. net gain on sale was impacted by the change in accounting, that we're going to talk about, and expenses are up with a few unusual items that we'll unpack as well.
bottom line, the adjusted pre-tax pre-provision earnings number ex-ppp, as chip referenced, up over 35% year-over-year, down a bit from q4, but that still feels really good. and the growth rate of that is what's really going to be important. and we anticipate the net interest income continues to grow, non-interest income and expenses remain relatively stable for the year.
so as chip alluded in his remarks, there's always seems to be a few moving pieces in the quarter and this one is no different. i thought i'll run through four of them. the good news is two of those items are ones that where we think we're going to reduce the noise. and then ppp, we all hope is behind us. so maybe three of these we don't need to spend a lot of time with on the go forward. in april, the last tranche of the market price rsus vested. we talked about those in december. we had two more tranches of those that vested in the first quarter and then finalized those. so those are behind us. going forward, we'll use the more traditional time-vested rsus to continue to reward our people and those have a more predictable impact on earnings.
and then on the accounting side, as chip referenced, we began the effort to reduce the amount of loans that we measure at fair value. and historically given the reliance on the guaranteed loan sales, fair value accounting made sense. as we transform this balance sheet and reduce the amount of loans we sell, electing to carry these newly originated loans at historical cost will reduce volatility and drive more predictable revenue. but as chip referenced and as brett talks about in the cfo highlights, that result is typically a reduction in the upfront gain on sale. and that then is reflected in the carrying value of the portion of loans, so we actually end up with a higher yield and higher net interest income going forward. the end result, the cash flow is the exact same, the timing is different, less volatility. and again, that was about $2.7 million for the quarter and going forward.
another quarter and another ppp program to navigate. again, our team just did an extraordinary job standing up another set of systems and workflows, $500 million got into the hands of over 4,000 customers, so just really proud of the work there. we think that this program, 1.0 and 2.0 did exactly what it was designed to do. steve mentioned how it helped our customers, but just helped countless borrowers and small businesses get to the other side of this. so we're all hopeful this is the last of these programs as we look forward. and that as these flow through earnings again, that volatility will subside.
and then finally, the other noteworthy event, we reentered into the investment tax credit market, which supports our renewable energy lending. these investments are generally in solar projects, expected irr of about 20% and they also often times help fuel our relationship in our lending business. but the income statement geography is a little unusual. the benefit run through the tax line and then there is a corresponding increase in non-interest expense. so you see those numbers as well. it's a great investment, great projects and -- but they show up in some interesting places.
so we got more detail on page 15 on the market priced rsus. i don't think we need to go into those here in too much more detail. q1 -- sorry q2, we have that last tranche about 100,000 shares that we settled and that will have a little bit more modest impact on the income statement and balance sheet in the next quarter and will be done.
so page 17, detailed numbers on ppp. again, originated just over $500 million in the second draw, generated a bit more than $21 million in deferred fees. over the course of the quarter through amortization and forgiveness, we recognized about $19 million through net interest income. we ended the quarter with about $1.5 billion outstanding in ppp loans and about $33.7 million of deferred fees remaining on the balance sheet. so forgiveness continues to roll along. we're about 50% complete with the first tranche balances and now we've got the second to add to that as well, but that's going well.
so turning the franchise highlights, we've really already touched on all of this. solid loan originations, balance sheet growth, margin, and that's the recipe for net interest income growth. on the credit side, as steve described, we really feel good about what we're seeing and the opportunities that we're seeing for new originations in the market. and from everything we can see, it feels like we'll keep this momentum up. we've hired a handful of new lenders already this year and we're circling around a couple of new verticals that we hope to update you all on in the next quarter. so continue to demonstrate really the power of our lending franchise as it relates to small businesses.
so on the loan sales, the market continues to strengthen throughout the first quarter. and we touched on the accounting election, so we don't need to go into that in more detail. we did choose to sell a little bit more paper into this market strength. and then also, we elected to sell some fixed rate loans that manage the balance sheet and the interest rate risk a bit. those fixed rate loans had a bit lower premiums than the typical floaters. so when you look at our total gain per million, it's down over $30,000 per million. and that's a little more than half of that is from the accounting change and then from that mix shift. on the usda side, we did have some loans that closed late in the quarter that we weren't able to sell before quarter end. but that market remains really strong and we'll continue to be active there.
and overall, as you can see on page 20, we remained pretty close to our targets selling about a 35% of the loans that become eligible on the sba side and most all of the usda loans. so again, that can bounce around on any given quarter, but our long-term targets remain the same. and then the bottom of page 20, you can see the loan portfolio and the amount of fair value loans that we have and our intention to have less of those as we choose not to elect fair value going forward.
so turning to expenses, a few items to unpack here. page 21 has the headline number and trends. and then back in the appendix on 35, you've got some details worth noting, namely the $3.1 million in investment tax credit. impairment is in there. there's $900,000, which is an impairment charge on a solar project that's taken longer to get out of the ground than we would like. so think of that more on the credit side. and then the $2.6 million for the market priced rsus. all of those gets you to an adjusted number around $53 million, which we think is kind of more of the number that we think about. chip mentioned that there is elevated professional services legal fees in there and then there is a severance of about $750,000 in there.
so when you net all of that out, you can compare that to an adjusted number of about $48 million in the fourth quarter. chip mentioned the growth that we're seeing on the lending side, the balance sheet side, and we've been working hard to keep up with that growth operationally and hiring. over the course of last year, we just ran incredibly lean. so we've invested a bit more across the franchise. now as you look forward, that $53 million number should probably stay around there, maybe drift up to about the mid-50s on a quarterly expense going forward when you take out the tax equity investments.
on the deposits side, just a really, really solid story. the franchise here feels a little bit like garch-style investing, so growth at reasonable prices. 64,000 accounts opened. that's $4.8 billion of retail deposits, which is up from $4.3 billion at the end of the year. all of that, we pay 60 to 65 basis points and all the new money and we just dropped rates another five basis points for the majority of our products today. i think we still have a little more room likely to tick down over the course of the year.
retention rates have been high on the savings account, given the overall liquidity trends. you see our mix has shifted away from cds more into savings which we like. and the cost to operate the franchise is still under 10 basis points, even with some investment on the checking side. so $850 million were priced over the last quarter, another $2 billion are pricing in the next 12 months. we expect to continue to enjoy the benefits of this operating environment for our deposit model.
turning to margin. the stated net interest margin jumped almost 50 basis points, largely driven by ppp, but also the lowering deposit costs we just talked about. but on an adjusted basis, we enjoyed a 13 basis point increase in margin to 3.46%, even with the spike in liquidity that happened in the quarter, given the strong deposit trends and some lending activity that pushed into q2. so loan yields remained steady holding around 5.4% and we expect that margin, ex-ppp to continue to trend up through the balance of the year.
so chip talked about the metric that we stay laser-focused on this adjusted pre-tax pre-provision income without ppp. and there isn't ever one single metric that you can rely on. but given all the moving parts of the strategy, this one we do stay anchored to. you've got the details on page 25. on 26, we have a waterfall that just shows the changes year-over-year of the key drivers and then the linked-quarter as well.
the year-over-year trend, 27% growth driven largely by that net interest income and then on the linked-quarter we've talked about continue to have really good growth in net interest income and then some of the items that we've sort of already talked about that got that number down. again, that growth in that going forward is where we're really focused and feel good that we'll continue to be able to generate that.
so turning to the balance sheet, still feels pretty fortress-like with strong amount of government guaranteed assets on the balance sheet, excess liquidity, solid capital ratios. the tier 1 leverage ratio ticked back up in the quarter after dropping a bit last year. we're seeing right about 8.50% on the tier 1 leverage ratio, which feels really comfortable now and we think that's going to continue to tick up over the course of the year.
all in all, we feel really good about the performance metrics, recognize some of them are influenced a bit by provision or fair value adjustments. what we did on this page that you'll see new at the bottom of the page, we added a couple of growth metrics because we think that as we achieve high performance and demonstrate that, it comes in three categories; safety and soundness, as chip and steve talked about; profitability that we've been showing here; and then growth. and we feel really good about what we can deliver on the growth side with safety and soundness and profitability in focus.
so a quick update on the technology stack. we are live with our pilot of checking accounts. that's going really well. between that and all the new business savings and cds that we book on the new platform, we have almost 2,000 customers and over $150 million on that core. that's in addition to the $1.5 billion of ppp loans that are on that core. so we put almost $100 million of new deposits on the platform since year-end. we'll continue to expand the checking pilot into general availability and we're planning on converting our 64,000 deposit customers in q3. we're just laser-focused on getting that right and then adding on features and functionality that we've talked about that we think are going to be really unique for small businesses.
i'm going to close with a quick note on our esg efforts. i would encourage you all, if you haven't seen the impact update in our annual report, we've got some great information in there. and we recognize that we and all companies and business leaders and all of us play a key role in driving forward efforts of diversity, inclusion and climate change. and while there's always more we can do and that we will do, we're really proud of our accomplishments and initiatives as it relates to our employees, our board, serving the communities that we are in and then the small businesses that we serve across the nation, plus our renewable energy efforts just feel like they continue to have great tailwinds and some changes in administration and government-backed that will make that even more impactful. so we know many of you are increasingly focused on the topic as well and look forward to sharing incremental data, but also having increased dialogue with you guys on this front.
so with that, head to questions?

[operator instructions] your first question comes from jennifer demba with truist securities.
jennifer demba -- truist securities -- analyst
hi. good morning.
james s. mahan -- chairman and chief executive officer
good morning, jennifer.
steve smits -- chief credit officer
hi, jennifer.
jennifer demba -- truist securities -- analyst
i've got a few questions. number one, chip and huntley, what do you see as the biggest risks to your budget and earnings expectations in '21 right now?
james s. mahan -- chairman and chief executive officer
the biggest risk to our internal budget that you haven't seen.
steve smits -- chief credit officer
i mean, i would start and say prepayment speeds have been really favorable. and if we see a big spike in that in the back half of the year, that will move some of the fair value numbers around. and that's -- again, the budget numbers, that also could reduce the growth of the balance sheet a little bit. but that's maybe the one that's a little bit out of our control, but that would be the one that i think where that i look at. but you want to, chip?
james s. mahan -- chairman and chief executive officer
i would say just examining the pipeline and originations, we still feel really good about what we told you last, $3 billion to $3.1 billion. and steve, i've probably been with 40 customers the last 90 days, and i reaffirm what you say. it just -- it doesn't seem like there are many big credit surprises out there to jennifer's question. i think we're pretty much steady as she goes. you really did...
steve smits -- chief credit officer
i agree.
james s. mahan -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah.
jennifer demba -- truist securities -- analyst
okay. can you give us an update on where the lawsuit stand that you referenced in the press release?
huntley garriott -- president-live oak bank
yeah, jennifer, it's huntley. we've put out the disclosure that we've got and that's sort of all the update we got right now.
jennifer demba -- truist securities -- analyst
okay. all right. in terms of legal fees, do you have any thoughts on what your legal fees might be for the rest of the year?
huntley garriott -- president-live oak bank
we'd always like to have lots of them.
jennifer demba -- truist securities -- analyst
okay. last question. the deposits continue to reprice down. how do you think about positioning the funding base for a different rate environment where fed funds are higher and the current funding mix is not as favorable for live oak?
huntley garriott -- president-live oak bank
yeah. look, that is why we're so laser-focused on building out a checking account and operating accounts, because we know that they have real advantages in a rising and higher rate environment. so we love what we're funding with now. and our goal is to be building out those checking accounts and operating accounts so that if and when that cycle turns, we can capture that advantage.
jennifer demba -- truist securities -- analyst
do you have any specific targets, like, you want to get to x amount by the end of next year or something like that to share with us or can you give us any detail there?
james s. mahan -- chairman and chief executive officer
i think that's too early right now to do any of that.
huntley garriott -- president-live oak bank
yeah.
steve smits -- chief credit officer
we've said that we don't think it's going to have a lot of financial impact this year, and we still stand by that. but if we get that right, if we start to look into next year, well, i think we can give some targets. as we look at our plan for next year, we still don't have that in there. and we still think that we've got a really solid sort of operating model, but we can start to give more detail on our expectations as that -- as we get closer in the year.
jennifer demba -- truist securities -- analyst
okay, great. and you did a great job giving the filing information i think we need in the slide deck and in your monologues. thanks.
james s. mahan -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks, jennifer.
operator
your next question comes from michael perito with kbw.
michael perito -- keefe, bruyette & woods -- analyst
hey, good morning, everybody. thanks for taking my questions.
james s. mahan -- chairman and chief executive officer
hey, michael.
michael perito -- keefe, bruyette & woods -- analyst
chip, like you, i'm a bit more of a plain english guy, so i was wondering if i could maybe just hash through a couple of these items to make sure i'm thinking about them the right way. and i wanted to start -- so i mean, is it correct to assume that given the change on the fair value, i mean, on the incremental gain on sale, your margins are going to move down over the course of the balance of this year and then eventually sell down at a lower rate. is that directionally correct or am i misinterpreting what's going to happen?
james s. mahan -- chairman and chief executive officer
i'm so excited that for the first time in over a year that brett caines is standing next to me to answer that question. six feet away.
brett caines -- chief financial officer
hey, mike. yeah, i think as we look going forward, it's going to look more similar to q1. so if you take what you saw in 2020, probably in q3 and q4 of 2020, and as chip mentioned, about a 20% reduction in gain on sale revenue given this accounting election that we've decided to make, that's probably a good forward way to look at it. i will reiterate what huntley said, the secondary market right now is our premiums being paid are very, very favorable. and i think they're probably at an all-time high right now. so of course, the market impact which we cannot predict, that comes down, that was like more of a change downward compared to q1. but just in a steady market, just the accounting election change is about a 20% drop in the expected revenue on gain on sale.
james s. mahan -- chairman and chief executive officer
we should have probably done this before, michael. i mean, this is kind of like son of servicing asset reval, servicing at reval, down $9 million one quarter, up $5 million in the next. that's why we started holding a bunch of these loans. we'd love holding these loans. this is the same thing. we probably should have done it some time ago to give you more predictability.
brett caines -- chief financial officer
and again, just to reiterate, we do get all of those cash flows back over the life of the loan. and on booking the retained piece, probably about 100 basis points on average of incremental loan yield on that retained piece. so it's not an insignificant benefit over time in the net interest income line.
michael perito -- keefe, bruyette & woods -- analyst
got it. so -- and that there is net interest income benefit to the margin over the life of the loan, near-term, the big gain on sale margins will be more indicative of the first quarter than the back half of last year from an accounting perspective and then we'll have to make considerations for the environment and the demand for secondary loan sales over the course of the future. that seems to be the general gist?
steve smits -- chief credit officer
you nailed it? yeah.
michael perito -- keefe, bruyette & woods -- analyst
okay. and then on the cost side, i was wondering, first, if you maybe could just talk a little bit about the pipeline for additional kind of renewable energy investments. and then maybe just spend a second to talk about kind of some of the risk factors we should be thinking about as you guys, i imagine, consider to do more of these? is it any noticeably different than a typical tax credit type situation or anything else unique we should be thinking about?
huntley garriott -- president-live oak bank
yeah. so our -- when we think about it, we want to -- given the geography of the income statement, we'll be mindful of sort of capacity to do these relative to taxable income. that also drives the timing with which that you can recognize and that drives the irr. so we'll do -- maybe we can give you a bit more color about sort of capacity. but i think, think of it in the context of what we did in this situation relative to our taxable income. so we'll continue to look to do a little bit on a programmatic basis. nothing -- and i don't have any giant spikes, but we'll try to continue to do something similar to this, and they can be a bit lumpy. these projects take a while to get together. so close one in one quarter, one in the next quarter, maybe a little bit lumpy. we're going to try to avoid that.
from a credit perspective, steve, you can pile in. we like these projects from a repayment perspective. the project needs to stay operational in order to secure the tax benefits from the program. so your real risk is that you can't operate the program and we've been in the business long enough to feel comfortable that even if something were to happen with an operator, you can find another operator and keep the lights on. so -- but i don't know, steve, on the credit side, do you have any thoughts?
steve smits -- chief credit officer
you're exactly right. it -- our experience in this space is incredibly important. we've learned a great deal over the years. we've refined our servicing. we have the proper controls in place. so we feel pretty comfortable that we can identify good projects, learn from those projects in order to make smart investments on that side of the equation. so that all comes together.
james s. mahan -- chairman and chief executive officer
brett, do you have anything to add, brother?
brett caines -- chief financial officer
yeah. i would say, mike, as you're thinking about, and all of you as you're thinking about modeling in these type fed investments, probably the simplest way to think about it is take a look at what you're forecasting for pre-tax income. and our investments right all for the probably around 10% of that number and then that helps us target a tax rate kind of in the mid-teens.
michael perito -- keefe, bruyette & woods -- analyst
got it. that's helpful. so that to take that all on the costs side, right, so i think, huntley, you mentioned the adjusted -- i think it was $53 million, obviously, there is still some elevated legal fees and that $53 million, that could hopefully drop off as the year progresses here. but then next quarter, there'll be some additional small hit on the rsus on top of that $53 million. and then potentially in the back half of the year, at some point, there could be some more impairment related to any additional renewable projects that could also possibly come in. is that generally fair? is there anything else significant beyond that, that you would highlight?
huntley garriott -- president-live oak bank
i think that feels good. brett, do you...
brett caines -- chief financial officer
yeah. i think you nailed it.
michael perito -- keefe, bruyette & woods -- analyst
okay. and then just what about growth rate, right? because i feel like there is a dynamic here that obviously you guys are building platforms that are scalable and you're trying to leverage those economies of scale. but clearly there is, as you guys mentioned in your prepared remarks, there is a high need for investment as your bank grows significantly, right? so i mean, how should we think about kind of the cost growth dynamic as we think about adding talent and supporting growth, but also trying to leverage platforms that you built that are highly scalable?
james s. mahan -- chairman and chief executive officer
well, i'll tell you the way i look at it. huntley, you can add to this, right, pretty simple. if we can grow the loan portfolio 15% and eps 15% year-over-year, that's our goal. hopefully, we can beat that a little bit, but that's what we say internally and that's what we shoot for.
huntley garriott -- president-live oak bank
yeah. i think on a balance sheet revenue 15% to 20%. and then if we can keep the expense side closer to 10%, then we're creating significant operating leverage. so those are kind of metrics. again, it gets a little lumpy, but 15% plus on the balance sheet and revenue side and 10% plus -- and 10% on the expense side, feels like a pretty good numbers.
michael perito -- keefe, bruyette & woods -- analyst
got it. yeah. no, i -- the ppp isn't doing anyone any favors in terms of trying to model any of this out. but i appreciate all that commentary. thank you guys for taking my questions.
james s. mahan -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you, michael.
operator
your next question comes from steven alexopoulos with j.p. morgan.
alex lau -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
good morning. this is alex lau on for steve.
huntley garriott -- president-live oak bank
hey, alex.
alex lau -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
hey. on your loan originations ex-ppp of $670 million per quarter, this was a drop from the prior two quarters from around the $900 million range. do you have some color on what drove the lower originations or was it more of a timing thing?
james s. mahan -- chairman and chief executive officer
it's more seasonal, alex. that's what we tried to show in that slide. i can't remember the percentage we were up over last q1. q1s are a slow quarter. and we've made a little bit of a comeback and closed a really large loan in april. but i think we're standing by what we said last quarter, $3 billion to $3.1 billion still feels pretty good. so you shouldn't view that the way you're viewing it because q1 is slow.
alex lau -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
understood. and sorry if i missed this, but can you give some color on the uptick in non-performers in the quarter? thanks.
steve smits -- chief credit officer
yeah. this is steve. several loans for which we've impaired over the quarter, but not anything significant. i mean, it was actually relatively small number of relationships. most of them are tied into challenges that existed pre-covid, where covid just simply was not -- didn't do them a favor. so i put it in the category influenced by covid, but had pre-existing challenges that we continue to work through.
alex lau -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
thank you. and just last one, can you talk about how you're marketing the checking accounts? and do you have a target or a sense of the growth potential for the year? thank you.
james s. mahan -- chairman and chief executive officer
micah, do you want to talk about marketing, and then turn it over to huntley since you're the marketing guy?
micah davis -- chief marketing officer
yeah. so our focus now is to build the pilot out and get the system stable and ready to go. so we don't have any definitive plans yet or definitive budget to market it, but we feel word-of-mouth will be really good and existing customers will definitely want to purchase.
huntley garriott -- president-live oak bank
yeah. we'll start there and then our ultimate goal is to leverage partners for distribution and product enhancements through embedded banking. and so this platform is easily integratable into other software, vertical software in other partners. so that distribution channel ultimately will be our strategy when, as micah said, we're ready to hit the accelerator.
james s. mahan -- chairman and chief executive officer
i think, alex, too we are going to have an investor day when this pandemic goes away probably here in wilmington, where we can describe to you as we've described to most of you in the past what all that means, what is the community looking [phonetic] in the future. so we will march vertical by vertical to create a deposit experience embedded in what you need to operate your business from financial planning to credit books to tax to all these other things, practice management software. and platform we've been working on for four years with finxact in the middle that allows us to do that. cloud-native api first, but that is not something that we can drill down on one question on our earnings call. that's why we're going to invite all you folks to wilmington, when things settle down from this damn disease.
alex lau -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
thanks for all the color.
operator
[operator instructions] your next question comes from chris donat with piper sandler.
chris donat -- piper sandler -- analyst
chip, i wanted to review a bit of your -- the dialogue you had with steve on slide 5 and the site visits. i liked what i heard about guardedly optimistic, but also recognize still not out of the woods. can you just give us a little color on how you think the world might look as some of the beneficial impacts from ppp and various stimulus programs fade over time? like you were just talking about in the last question, there are some businesses that were challenged before the pandemic. i feel like there's going to be some cohort of businesses that really aren't able to bounce back robustly. but i don't know if that's going to mean much for your credit quality. so just trying to understand a bit how this unfolds for small businesses for credit quality as some of the help is withdrawn?
james s. mahan -- chairman and chief executive officer
so i'll start, because steve has to stay back and plant himself at the door of the ball, and i get to fly around and meet with customers, particularly ones that are challenged. so i think the programs, chris, have worked. and i think that our lending officers did a great job of picking folks that had the eye of the tiger. now there were a couple that just gave up and threw us the keys, but there weren't many, and steve basically alluded to the charge-offs earlier in his comments. so just simply put, with all this government money that's out there, the ones that want to fight are going to i think just be fine. i just don't see very many losses. i mean, whatever that total number you came up with a minute ago was de minimis compared to what we thought a year ago. and you may want to tag on to that.
steve smits -- chief credit officer
the government programs are wonderful.
james s. mahan -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah.
steve smits -- chief credit officer
at the same time, we cannot become complacent. so it's not lost on the significant percentage of our borrowers that were receiving subsidy payments, for example, from the government. we could become very complacent with the payments coming in and lose sight of really what's going on with that business. so i talk about the surprises. we will -- how do we minimize the surprises, the throwing in the keys. we call them the subsidy riders. they're riding the subsidy payment, but their plan is to throw in the keys at the end after the government stops. so it's all about servicing and knowing your customer.
we've talked about this in prior earnings calls. we put a stress mark on every one of our borrowers. as we sit today, 97% of the entire portfolio we have a stress mark. you can't put a stress mark unless you have talked to that customer, collected financial data, measured that financial data and assessed the stress. so we have a really good intel on how our borrowers are doing, which gives me great confidence. but i am aware that the march payment, 37% of our portfolio in terms of dollars had a subsidy payment made.
one data point is our payments are the fifth of each month, so we felt really, really good that most burned off in april. in addition, we see that stress mark from high to medium to low trending toward low, and those are based on real numbers. so what matters what does your balance sheet look like? have you made the right thing? have you received government support? has that wound up on the balance sheet to give you some cushion as you get back on your feet? what does your credit look like? what is your status with your vendors?
so we think about, well, what's the next shoe to drop. it's going to be are you in arrears with your vendors? do you have some past rent that you're going to have to make up with? what's your strategy? what's your 13-week burn rate? we're looking at all of those really diligently. so we've invested pretty heavily on our servicing to get as good a feel as we can about what our portfolio looks like going forward. there will be surprises, i've talked about it. that's why we've got reserved for that. hopefully, it doesn't turn into losses. but we feel that we've done everything we possibly can do to have a good feel for the health of our portfolio at this time.
james s. mahan -- chairman and chief executive officer
and i think the conclusion there, we'll stop talking here, as you know, we're just so unusual. we have plenty of capital, stated capital. and you got another $1.8 billion of government guaranteed loans and that's got a value of $150 plus million. you got all of neil's live oak ventures, that's another $150 million. and then basically the ppp numbers is close to $100 million as well, if you add up all the fees and the spread income, as i mentioned earlier in my comments, so we have a balance sheet that is way different than any other bank that you cover.
chris donat -- piper sandler -- analyst
got it. okay. thanks for all the color there. and then sort of related issue here as we think about the future. just the pace of ppp round two originations, it felt like you guys started a little slower than others. and looks -- just wondering what you -- how you're thinking about second quarter or at least through may 31 for ppp originations?
steve smits -- chief credit officer
yeah. i think we've really focused, given everything else we have going on, on our existing customers in helping them through and sort of got through that and are effectively done. i mean, there may be a few other little pieces that come, but effectively i think we served our customers that we could and feel good about that. so it was a big effort to stand that up again and in quite of the luxury of taking the entire company and turning toward it like we did a year ago. so -- but i think for q2 purposes, we're effectively -- you shouldn't think about much new in the pipe.
chris donat -- piper sandler -- analyst
got it. okay. thanks very much, gentlemen.
james s. mahan -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks, chris.

operator
good day and thank you for standing by. welcome to the second quarter 2021 live oak bancshares earnings conference call. [operator instructions]
i'd now like to hand the conference over to greg seward, general counsel, live oak bancshares. please go ahead.
greg seward -- executive vice president-general counsel
thank you and good morning everyone. welcome to live oak's second quarter 2021 earnings conference call. we are webcasting live over the internet and this call is being recorded. to access the call over the internet and review the presentation materials and commentary that we will reference on the call, please visit our website at investor.liveoakbank.com and go to today's call on our event calendar for supporting materials. our second quarter earnings release is also available on our website.
before we get started, i would like to caution you that we may make forward-looking statements during today's call that are subject to risks and uncertainties. factors that may cause the actual results to differ materially from our expectations are detailed in the materials accompanying this call and in our sec filings. we do not undertake to update the forward-looking statements to reflect the impact of circumstances or events that may arise after the date of today's call. information about any non-gaap financial measures referenced including reconciliation of those measures to gaap measures can also be found in our sec filings and in the presentation materials and commentary.
i will now turn the call over to chip mahan, our chairman and chief executive officer.
james s. mahan iii -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks, greg, and good morning to all. as you stare at the last six quarter results, allow me to review today's agenda. it has proven to be our best quarter ever and what a way for brett caines to go out with a bang. brett, it's been 13 short years since i found you in a chemical plant on the cape fear river wearing a hard hat and safety glasses. it goes without saying that it's been an honor to serve with you. in our next call, we will explain brett's next new and exciting role in our company and yes to all who know how this works. today's prezo and each quarterly prezo is all brett. huntley and i just show up. brett, thanks again for all your fine work these last 24 quarters as a public company.
and now, back to the best quarter ever. highlights are $44 million gain in the value greenlight shares brought on by this cash sale of $15 million, causing a remark of our carrying value. it is important to note that we took $4 million of the $15 million in cash gains and gave it to our folks, once again excluding the senior management team. you will recall that we were distributed $7.5 million to our folks at the end of ppp 1.0 given the long hours they spent helping american small business get through this clunky process. this $44 million one-time non-operating gain is a nice addition to tier 1 capital.
secondly originations reached an all time high of $1.1 billion while credit quality continues to improve. third, as the accountants and ppp make the unpacking of our financials more difficult, we're proud to announce the dramatic increase in pre-tax pre-provision earnings as the operating leverage in our business kicks in. lastly, neil underwood will discuss live oak venture investments as well as a canopy update before we turn things over to huntley for a deep dive.
greg, let's move to slide 5 and talk about credit quality. so as you stare at this, i'm going to ask steve as we did last time, a couple of questions. steve, last quarter you discussed where the acl was going. what is your vision over the next several quarters?
steve smits -- chief credit officer
well, chip, as i mentioned last quarter, i've been expecting to see reserves trending toward pre-covid period levels as a percentage of loans. this is proving to be the case and i still expect to see this trend continue and i believe this because, first, we continue to see improvements in the financial condition of some of our most impacted businesses, which is evidenced by favorable trends in the servicing status ratings. secondly, we've also noticed that many of our most impacted borrowers were actually able to build cash reserves during the pandemic and that's a result of the government stimulus and grant programs. thirdly, through our servicing efforts, we started to receive encouraging reports as these businesses reopen and as you say, folks are getting back to work. finally, improving unemployment forecast will, of course, influence our allowance as well. so for all these reasons, i still feel that the allowance will continue to trend toward pre-pandemic levels.
james s. mahan iii -- chairman and chief executive officer
steve, other banks reporting or discussing subsidies and deferrals. how we're doing?
steve smits -- chief credit officer
well, as of june 30, we only have 17 loans on payment deferral, 15 of those are due to covid-related stress. in addition, as of june, 13% of our loans received some level of sba subsidy payment support for their june payment. most of this will burn away over the next few months. so in summary, as of the end of june, 87% of our borrowers are back to making regular payments and past dues continue to be an all-time low for us, which is very encouraging.
james s. mahan iii -- chairman and chief executive officer
steve, as folks are headed back to work, it appears that our watchlist loans, classified assets and non-accruals are trending down. thoughts?
steve smits -- chief credit officer
well, i must caution that businesses may not be completely out of the woods yet and we need to be prepared for potential surprises. i am encouraged by the recent trends that we're seeing within non-covid impacted verticals. we're actually seeing an uptick in upgrades, especially within our debt, our healthcare, investment advisory and our debt care industries. and since the first of the year, we've also seen slightly downward trends in classified assets and non-accruals. of course, we continue to focus a good bit of our attention toward servicing. but i for one, will remain cautiously optimistic that these trends are going to continue.
james s. mahan iii -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks, steve.
let's move to slide 6. relative to the last 12 months/the pandemic, i believe this slide tells it all. on the left, you see losses, on the right, income. on the left, we took $14 million in covid-related charge-offs, of which $10 million was a self-inflicted wound, relative to the sale of $15 million of hotel paper at a discount. through covid, losses of businesses that went down were $4 million noted under that. so, for a total of $14 million. on the right, you see income. government assistance accounted for $2.3 billion in ppp loans and $80 million in fees, plus $8 million in net interest income. so far, covid-related activities have resulted in a non-dilutive capital raise.
moving on to slide 7, i have noticed that many reporting banks are having challenges growing their loan book and nims are struggling as well, not for us. excluding ppp, we've grown the loan portfolio, almost 37% compounded annually over the last 10 quarters.
moving to slide 8. in the last 11 quarters of 14 quarters, we originated roughly $400 million to $600 million in loans. in q3 and q4 of last year, we did almost $1 billion and somewhat surprisingly this quarter we originated $1.1 billion. i get that the investments are going well and happy to put almost $50 million of tier 1 capital on the balance sheet from greenlight. but my gracious, this loan, well, [indecipherable] lost your ever loving mind.
so let's examine what is going on here with more granularity. let's go to slide 9. what we have here is a graphic depiction of the second quarter of 2019, second quarter of 2020, second quarter of 2021 of our legacy verticals that is those started between 2008 to 2017 compared to our more recent verticals started in 2018 to present. while legacy verticals have proven a bit lumpy, the newbies have grown quite nicely, producing $600 million in this quarter alone. again, we operate in 32 industries nationwide.
moving on to slide 10, this slide provides more data on product types. the percentages of loans have remained remarkably similar as production has increased dramatically. again, government-guaranteed loans remained about half of our loan book and we remain confident that originations for 2021 should be in the $3.3 billion to $3.5 billion range.
slide 11's interesting. highlights of this slide of newer verticals yield $426 million in production with an interesting mix of products. on the left, the orange, bioenergy and community facilities are almost exclusively government-guaranteed usda loans. in the middle, green, you have 18 general lenders and 16 cities which are almost all 7(a) sba loans. and just for grins on the right side and for the first time in our history, we're lending money to small businesses with our balance sheet with real capital in the senior housing and sponsor finance space. given the collective use of these five groups, credit quality at this point seems stellar.
slide 12. lastly, in an effort to close out our deep dive relative to the exciting growth in originations, we are proud of this geographic diversity. as you can see, our geographic diversity has not changed in the last 2.5 years. sticking to our guiding principles has worked and we shall stay the course.
slide 13. this is by far the most telling slide of the call, which huntley will describe in a bit more detail. our investments and lenders, underwriters, closers and servicers over the last six quarters is now paying off. pre-tax pre-provision income eliminates a great deal of the noise that always seems to surround us. our ability to double pre-tax pre-provision earnings since 3/31 just five quarters ago in the middle of the pandemic gives us an important base to grow from, in the future.
neil, over to you.
neil underwood -- president-live oak bancshares
thanks, chip.
this next slide represents most of our direct investments at the holding company. while the big news this quarter is around greenlight, it's really important to note that the entire portfolio continues to thrive. each of these companies solves a major problem in financial services.
the footer really summarizes the opportunity where we've invested $26 million at very early stages and the implied value today is $182 million. we expect these companies to continue to raise growth capital at elevated valuations. for all you modelers out there, we know this is a really difficult thing to forecast, but as you can see, this quarter it's real and it's tangible. perhaps more important than the economics is live oak bank's adoption to these technologies forming next-generation cloud-based tech stack that allows us to build best-in-class fintech life products.
let's move on to the next slide, i'll do a quick canapi update. as you know it's the successor to live oak ventures and as a reminder, we closed out $650 million at the end of last year with 44 banks at the aba and the icba. we've been operating for about 18 months and as you can see, we've been very, very busy. the thesis is working and canapi continues to win leads on strategic deals. all these companies offer services that really help banks. much like live oak ventures, our banks benefit by implementing best-in-class technology. we've either already implemented or in the process of implementing companies such as built, alloy, neuro, mx, finxact, notarize and orum.
one highlight this quarter is blend's ipo. we're obviously super excited about that. we actually are [indecipherable] starting the harvest phase of the fund and as a reminder live oak not only invested a significant amount in the fund itself, but recieves management fees and carry all which will be earned and realized over the years to come.
huntley, over to you.
huntley garriott -- president-live oak bank
thanks, neil. thanks, chip. pretty remarkable quarter across the board. well, i'll start on page 16 and we'll get to the financial results in a minute, but really first wanted to highlight just the consistency of our strategy which is shown in this slide for a while and we tweak the key messages that always remains kind of anchored on the same topics. and the other thing i want to do is just take a minute to recognize the tireless effort of all of our folks to execute this. since ppp, we have been running flat out across every aspect of the company and it's really showing up in these results.
so, taking care of our customers has always been kind of vital to our dna and we continue to do that even as our customer base has grown dramatically. we mentioned the covid six verticals that we've been concerned about and watching. we've visited in person over half of those customers and just remarkable to see sort of their positive response to that and an overall sort of strength that portfolio. customer outreach continues to differentiate across all of our markets, both in terms of sales and in terms of our portfolio. it has never been more important to take care of our team as it is today, and we continue to stay laser focused on that. as we've grown, we've continued to invest in them. chip mentioned the bonus that we paid in this quarter. we've also focused on supporting them with flexible hybrid work models and incremental resources. we've also invested more heavily in giving back to our community with an exciting equity investment in a fintech company call philanthropy designed to help democratize donor-advised funds and we've developed new models of impact investing and driving inclusive small business. our mission to be america's small business bank continues and our relentless quest to define the bank of the future reaches an important upcoming milestone with our deposit conversion fast approaching.
so flip to 17. it's an extraordinary balance sheet growth this quarter, both linked quarter and year-over-year. as the ppp loans run off, our stated balance sheet remained roughly flat, but our core loan growth, 10% linked quarter and over 40% from a year ago. through our retained earnings and success in our fintech investing, we've been able to grow our capital base to support this as well.
revenue and earnings growth on the next page really solid as well. the record loan originations that chip mentioned drove our balance sheet. core revenues up 13% quarter-over-quarter and adjusted pre-tax pre-provision earnings as chip mentioned, up 50% over the prior quarter. so talk about notable events and what's notable about these is that there's less of an unusual. so again, our efforts to try to reduce volatility in our earnings and increased consistency. the greenlight gain clearly stands out, dominates the headlines. aside from that, loan origination, really strong gain on sale margins that drives the revenues. and then the last of these market priced rsus that we've talked about over the last number of quarters vested this quarter and so those are behind us now and reduce that ongoing income statement volatility.
turning to ppp, chip summarized these impacts, so we don't need to go into too much detail. we still have over $900 million of ppp loans on our balance sheet. forgiveness was about $500 million in the quarter, but they've really slowed. and as you can see, the revenue is starting to trail-off in the last couple of quarters. the impact of this will continue to decline as that program winds down.
turning to our franchise fundamentals, loan growth is what really stands out here, 10% linked quarter growth again. the other thing that really stands out is our guaranteed loans that are eligible for sale. the treasure chest as we've called it, which has now broken through the $2 billion barrier and it has basically doubled in the last year, so an incredible source of earnings for us, but also a great contingent source of safety and capital. excluding ppp, all of this drives net interest income growth of 15% linked quarter and 70% year-over-year. achieving these levels of loan origination is a combination of all the investments that we've made in our people, our products and our markets. we found ourselves well positioned to leverage the government programs that were designed to support small businesses in difficult times. and as the economy rebounded, we've seen a notable increase in business activity beyond the sba, as well. as chip mentioned, our loan origination remains balanced by product, vertical and geography. we continue to attract great talent to the bank and all of our folks continue to rise to the occasion.
we recognize that we are the beneficiaries of some tailwinds from fiscal stimulus and sba enhancements in our business, but we've not compromised our underwriting or our credit standards in any way to achieve this growth. as we look at the franchise today, our loan pipeline continues to be near our all-time high, even after the quarter we just came off. as the sba enhancements are scheduled to end this quarter, we expect that to impact volume to some extent and our secondary market pricing to some extent as well, but we feel really confident our franchise in a great spot to continue to provide capital to small businesses.
so looking at our secondary market activity, we sold slightly less loans in the quarter, but at a meaningfully higher gain per million. the market overall remained relatively flat at historically high levels. the difference in the increase in our gain per million being that we sold more loans that had these sba enhancements, namely no guarantee fees and the impact that had on pricing. we expect that to continue to see those loans through the third and into the fourth quarter as they run through our pipeline, but once those enhancements run their course, we do expect to see some compression in that gain on sale number. looking at the amounts we are selling, we're still really in line with our overall targets, actually holding a little more of those sba and usda than our target but really no overall strategy shift there.
on the expense side on page 23, really solid story. we continue to grow the team, adding over 60 new positions already this year net. otherwise, expenses are pretty well contained. you'll see the special bonus that we accrued for $4 million this quarter to our employees other than senior management to participate in the greenlight gain as chip mentioned and also just recognize their extraordinary work we continue to gain efficiency overall with an adjusted expense base of about $52 million coupled with strong balance sheet growth drove that adjusted expense asset number down another 5 basis points to 71 basis points.
in the deposit market, page 24, the macro environment and competitive landscape continued to remain rational. industry wide, customer deposits are up and the preference has shifted decidedly toward more liquid savings accounts. our deposit business continued to match our loan growth and balance sheet needs. during the second quarter, we added another $200 million of balances while continuing to lower our cost of funds by 23 basis points, driven by continued cd rollover and lowering our savings rate by an additional 10 basis points to 50 basis points. our savings offering remains well positioned and we do not see much more savings or pricing or mix shift unless something unexpected happened to the market.
we'll continue to see our cd cost of fund decline as lower cost new production replaces the higher cost legacy balances. we look at our total operating cost of funds of 104 basis points and feel if that remains well below industry funding costs when you include all the physical branches and operation cost of running a traditional bank relative to the 10 basis points that it cost us from an operating expected [phonetic] to run these and that includes all the work we're doing on conversion.
late last year, we launched our next-generation deposit platform on finxact by offering savings and cds to new business customers. in 10 months, we've onboarded nearly 3,000 new business customers providing over $425 million of funding. this quarter alone, we added a 1,000 customers on $270 million of growth. our new platform provides a simple and elegant user experience and we remain one of the few providers where a business can open an account end to end entirely self-service with no human engagement. in late august, we will convert all 60,000 of our legacy consumer savings and cd customers onto our new platform.
we're very excited for this moment to bring a new generation of banking capabilities to our customers, but we're equally as understanding of the impact change can have on our customers and are 100% focused on providing a smooth transition, that's priority number 1 for the next couple of months.
once we're fully on our new finxact platform, we expect this to unlock our ability to grow even more efficiently and effectively than before. it will allow us the opportunity to offer new competitive savings products for existing customers, continue making progress on our checking account offering, provide the platform to bring deposits and working capital under one umbrella and to deliver increasingly more sophisticated products and services to them.
to date, we've been very methodical with our checking activities and have been fortunate in the strength of our existing deposit products to fund the bank, focusing only on the offering, the checking account to employees and a small internal pilot. we've done so number one, to maintain strict focus on conversion and number two, to incrementally build services that our future small business customer -- checking customers will demand. following conversion, we anticipate rolling out beta programs local in wilmington and some other select areas. over time, we'll continue to add new products and services to that operating suite that allow businesses to spend, borrow, pay, get paid and manage their business, all in an easy intuitive digital fashion
so, flipping the page to nim and liquidity, the continued strength in our loan yields coupled with a lower deposit cost led to core nim expansion of 17 basis points in the quarter, which was masked in the reported numbers by lower ppp fee amortization. we ended the quarter with a bit more normalized liquidity levels just under 20%, which should continue to drop a bit more over the back half of the year.
putting all that together, we get the eye chart on page 27, which is our non-gaap pre-tax pre-provision income, the core earnings as we look at it. there's a lot to uncover here and there is even a bit more in the reconciliation in the appendix, but overall, really great trend across every line item. core net interest income growth, adjusted for ppp, you can see there, up over $7 million quarter-over-quarter, solid non-interest income growth even without the technology gain, expenses in line when adjusted for the special employee bonus and the final market are a few adjustments, all lead us to $37 million of core pre-tax pre-provision earnings, and that's up $14 million -- $13 million [phonetic] from last year and over doubling from a year ago. we're extraordinarily proud of these results, but we also remain confident, we can continue to grow this in a prudent manner going forward.
so turning to capital and liquidity, capital remains strong with 12.5% cet1, leverage ratio just under 9%, over half the balance sheet remains government guaranteed and we hold a significant amount of liquidity. to grow the loan book 10% linked quarter and maintain capital ratios is a tall order. fortunately, this quarter the greenlight gain helped support that growth. going forward, we don't expect to keep running it quite that pace for our balance sheet growth, but we do continue to have option to manage our capital efficiently.
so turning to 29. so this is our leverage ratio and you can see the greenlight gain there being a meaningful driver in supporting that capital base quarter-over-quarter despite the significant balance sheet growth.
i'll wrap up with a chart we've shown you for a while now and we're really proud that this is the first time that every color on here is green on the screen. even adjusting for the greenlight gain, we've achieved the metrics that we've been striving for in terms of profitability and growth. it's been almost a three-year journey since we elected to start holding more of our loans on balance sheet. we aren't standing still though, far from it. we genuinely believe the best is yet to come from us as we continue to grow our lending franchise and develop technology and products to further help support small businesses.
with that, let's go to questions.

[operator instructions]
our first question comes from steven alexopoulos with jp morgan.
steven alexopoulos -- jp morgan -- analyst
hey, good morning, everyone.
james s. mahan iii -- chairman and chief executive officer
good morning steve.
steven alexopoulos -- jp morgan -- analyst
i wanted to start, so one of the key questions is obviously chip around the origination growth. what was it about this quarter specifically, when i look at the new verticals and how much they really popped up, what was it about this quarter that caused such strong origination growth?
james s. mahan iii -- chairman and chief executive officer
i think it's just comprehensive, i don't know. it's just frickin everywhere as we said, the top of the call geography, different verticals, the general lenders, the 18 general lenders are now going to be probably a top 8 sba lending group by themselves in the country. so we're just beginning to hit on all cylinders. even steve may have something to add.
steve smits -- chief credit officer
yes, i'll agree with that. on the sba side, clearly the enhancements have driven activity and were in the right places and that's across our verticals, that's across the generalists. and so that business just feels like it is really flattering. and then the renewable energy space, there's just a ton of tailwinds in that space and infrastructure build, we've seen a handful of slightly larger deals there. so that was nice -- some nice wins there, timing of a couple deals we've been working on for a while hit. and then across the specialty finance, the sponsor, finance, these are just we're finding really, really great businesses in the right places.
james s. mahan iii -- chairman and chief executive officer
those are the larger deals too. i've spent much time on the road this quarter calling on customers with the sponsor group and the senior lending group. these are much, much larger deals that we're looking at, companies with significant balance sheet. so it's across the board steve.
steven alexopoulos -- jp morgan -- analyst
okay. so, when we look at the guidance, right the $3.3 billion to $3.5 billion of originations for this year, that implies i guess, $750 million, $850 million, somewhere in that range right each quarter, is that just being conservative or do you really expect to step down? it could be fairly material from where we were this quarter.
james s. mahan iii -- chairman and chief executive officer
well, we seek not to disappoint steve. the 90% things coming-off steve smits, i mean, that's going to affect it a little bit. usually, q4 is a pretty good quarter for us. but i would say that we are highly confident that we will be in that range.
steven alexopoulos -- jp morgan -- analyst
okay. then -- thanks. and then finally. so, when we bake everything in the cake, right, there's so many things going on in a quarter, you have ppp still coming-off, you have the sba enhancements coming-off, you have all these new verticals, total loan growth period end was down a little bit with the ppp run-off. how should we think about total loan growth for the rest of this year? thanks.
james s. mahan iii -- chairman and chief executive officer
well, i think you got to take the ppp. we don't really pay any attention to that. that's why we try to focus almost all day every day internally on pre-tax pre-provision earnings on how we operate the business. others may have something to say on that.
steve smits -- chief credit officer
yes, in terms of -- i agree with chip. the core loan growth, ex-ppp, we grew that from $5 billion to $5.5 billion q1 to q2. i think it will be hard to maintain that pace. although there are variables as you know, pre-payment speeds have ticked up a little bit in the last quarter and we expected that from where we were historically really low level through the pandemic, timing of deals that we have that have been in construction to fully fund, how that affects the balance sheet and then what loans we end up selling. so all of those go into the mix. i think the balance sheet growth will continue to be quite strong, a little less than what you've seen maybe in the q2, but still really strong.

our next question comes from jennifer demba with truist.
jennifer demba -- truist -- analyst
thank you. good morning, great quarter.
james s. mahan iii -- chairman and chief executive officer
good morning demba.
jennifer demba -- truist -- analyst
so that coordination topic, everything played on all cylinders. what is the pipeline for future lender hires or any verticals of this? [phonetic]
james s. mahan iii -- chairman and chief executive officer
jennifer, we can't understand you.
steve smits -- chief credit officer
i think, jennifer, you were talking about new hires, right? it was a little scratchy on the phone. is that right?
jennifer demba -- truist -- analyst
am i better now? is that better?
steve smits -- chief credit officer
little bit.
james s. mahan iii -- chairman and chief executive officer
not much.
jennifer demba -- truist -- analyst
okay. all right, hold on one second here. how is that?
steve smits -- chief credit officer
it's good.
james s. mahan iii -- chairman and chief executive officer
little bit better.
jennifer demba -- truist -- analyst
okay. okay. you're hitting on all cylinders? what is the pipeline for new hires and new verticals?
steve smits -- chief credit officer
yes, so we believe that we have a pretty attractive platform right now. we continue to see opportunities to hire great talent. and we now continue to sort of evaluate that. and so finding those great people who have experience in sba primarily, we continue to think we've got great opportunity. in terms of new verticals, we continue to look at a few here and there, they'll be kind of tuck-in ones if from that perspective, no real major splash in the infrastructure space, in renewables, we still see adjacencies there. and then in the sponsor lending that we're doing, we're broadening that just like the generalist and sba broaden that aperture of the industry who look at, so do the sponsor lending group as well. so we broaden out of the specific industries a bit as we go into some of those more horizontal businesses that we're into.
jennifer demba -- truist -- analyst
okay. and the loan loss reserve, you think it could go down further? could you just talk about how well you think it could go? i know, it's hard, based on the loan losses of methodology to kind of make that kind of statement but...
steve smits -- chief credit officer
jennifer, again, really hard to hear you. sounds like the question was about loan loss reserves and maybe provision. is that right?
jennifer demba -- truist -- analyst
yes. so how low do you think that -- how low do you think that loan losses could go?
steve smits -- chief credit officer
okay, jennifer, this is steve smits. i'll take a stab at that because you are correct. as i mentioned earlier on in the call, i continue to believe that is trending back toward the pre-provision which is interesting, because remind ourselves that we went over to seesaw at the first of the year, which is a challenging time to do that. so our -- when you look historically, we were running under a different model. so there's some unknown there and we are getting very close as a percentage of our net flows, i always look at the percentage of our unguaranteed to get a feel for where we're actually reserving against. and we are getting close to where we were before the world changed second quarter of 2020. so how low will it go? hard to say, because there isn't longevity to the seasonal model and how that reacts. i will say that the reserving that we put in place against unknown stress associated with covid, businesses being forced to shut down or curtail or pull back, as expected, that is starting to burn away and the nice line behind that is, it's burning away because the businesses are actually showing very positive signs of health. we're not going to spike the ball in the five yard line at all, we are constantly reminded that there could be another shoe to drop, we're watching it very, very closely, we know that their balance sheets are strong, that has a lot to do with the federal programs. and we've got to see if that has some legs to continue. so again, jennifer, i think -- i feel very comfortable that we're returning to a normal portfolio and feel very comfortable that historically we've always reserved at a very appropriate level. so i do think that it may chop down a little bit as a percentage. i think we're, about 2.5% of net loans, if anyone would like to look at it that feels comfortable to me and that might give back a little bit.
jennifer demba -- truist -- analyst
thank you.

our next question comes from michael perito with kbw.
michael perito -- kbw -- analyst
hey, good morning.
james s. mahan iii -- chairman and chief executive officer
good morning mike.
michael perito -- kbw -- analyst
few questions from me. one, just on the opex side. i think, probably you mentioned kind of the $52 million adjusted run rate for the quarter. just curious if you have any additional commentary about how we could -- we should think about that near-term here i mean, my guess is that there's some upward pressure just given the growth you guys are having, but just wanted to see if that's kind of fair. and if there's any other kind of one-off items in the back half of the year that you expect could have an impact on the cost side whether [indecipherable] i think have run their course or anything else that we should be mindful of?
james s. mahan iii -- chairman and chief executive officer
that's good question. i'll bounce over to brett for any -- his crystal ball as well. i mean, our headcount growth, probably in the 15% range. and so obviously, salaries and benefits is a pretty decent size of the line item. so that growth, we think will continue just our visibility around franchise growth. the rest of the line items, though, i think are relatively range bound, not sort of seeing anything unusual kind of popping up or down out of that. but brett what do you have to add?
brett caines -- chief financial officer
yes, probably the one thing i would agree with everything at least that nothing going forward that we know of but that's kind of the point of that chart is it pulls out those things that aren't routine. and like you said, the market price are issues, those have exhausted themselves. but the one thing i would add to that and i think this is really important part of our growth story, which we reported today. in the past, we didn't shy away from investing in or hiring when we saw new opportunities. and in a lot of ways those past expenses are what led to our $1.1 billion of originations reported today. so i think there are potentially opportunities where we will continue to invest and make decisions like that that'll pay-off in the future. so that definitely will impact non-interest expense. but other than those kinds of initiatives, it's pretty steady [indecipherable].
james s. mahan iii -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes, let me let me support that too just a wee bit, right. so you know, our guiding principle is to treat every customer like the only customer in the bank. and for the past nine months or so, that's been hard. i mean, we did $1.1 billion this quarter, and the pipe is about the same. we've hired about 100 people so far this year, and we're going to continue to stay the course of trying to keep treat every customer like the only customer of the bank. we will continue to have opportunities to hire other folks that are experienced sba lenders as we become a bit more of a nationwide platform in that regard on top of increasing verticals. so, that's all i got to say on that.
michael perito -- kbw -- analyst
so helpful, thank you. and then brett maybe sticking with you just for a second on the margin. it seems like if i'm looking at slide 26, there's a comment that there -- lot of the -- well, maybe not a lot, but there was maybe a bit of loan production that was toward the end of the quarter and some of the liquidity deployment didn't really manifest in the second quarter nim that you guys experienced. just curious if you can maybe take that step further. i mean, is it fair to think that that nim can maybe bounce back barring something really unpredictable happening on the ppp side in the third quarter and kind of get back up toward where you were in the first quarter or are there other dynamics that we should be considering?
steve smits -- chief credit officer
yes, well, i guess first of all, i say on that -- on the slide, you're referencing slide 26, i would say focus on the 3.46% to 3.63% trend, just kind of excluding the impact of ppp on q1 and q2. and then on the right hand side of that chart, liquidity at 22.2%. that is probably a little bit higher than where we will run as normal ops, just had some things going on in q2 as part of our liquidity planning that was just there. but probably somewhere sub 20 is probably would be more normal operation for liquidity percent and yes as that's deployed and some of that excess liquidity runs-off, you could see, a pop or maybe not pop isn't the right word, but continued trend on that adjusted liquidity, the green 3.63.
michael perito -- kbw -- analyst
[speech overlap] yes, i could you say differently, the trend of the green line moving upward, there's still some potential more leverage there. i think you guys have said in the past that the core nim could go to the high 3s, is that still generally a principle that that's still solid?
steve smits -- chief credit officer
yes, i think that's correct. north of 3.5% you know 3.75%, but it's 3.5% to 4% range or high 3s, as we said.
michael perito -- kbw -- analyst
got it. and then just last from me. i appreciate all the color on the call thus far given but just on the sba gain on sale. just curious if you guys have any -- from the first few weeks of third quarter here, have had those margins kind of remained elevated or is there any other kind of market dynamics at play that you guys think could give that higher margin some length here as we move into the back half of the year or is the better base case to-date that there's maybe some normalization there? i'm just curious what you guys think on that.
james s. mahan iii -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes, i'll start and brett can clean up. market remains really strong, obviously a ton of liquidity everywhere, and kind of a start for assets. if you think about the sba enhancements, there's about a 55 basis point guarantee fee that is waived right now. and that's a direct passthrough to the loan buyer. and so if the duration of the asset is four plus years, that's a couple points on that gain on sale, that will continue to enjoy until those enhancements run out. unclear if all of that gets given back just how competitive the bidding market is right now, and we'll say, but we don't see anything that would suggest that that would change as we look at it. pre-payment speeds have ticked up a little bit, but aren't crazy. that enhancement will be the big driver of the market once it starts to roll-off.
michael perito -- kbw -- analyst
helpful. i should probably know this, but do you guys know is there a duration that which that enhancement is good through at this point has that been communicated or...
james s. mahan iii -- chairman and chief executive officer
so the program...
michael perito -- kbw -- analyst
the waiving of the fee...
james s. mahan iii -- chairman and chief executive officer
the waiver is through september 30, subject to availability of funds. so we'll say it'll be no later than 9/30 it will be exhausted.
neil underwood -- president-live oak bancshares
well, and the 90% is in the infrastructure bill that is being kicked around, but certainly don't even think about spiking that ball.
michael perito -- kbw -- analyst
all right, listen guys, thank you for taking all my questions. as always, i appreciate it.
steve smits -- chief credit officer
okay.
operator
our next question comes from chris donat with piper sandler.
chris donat -- piper sandler -- analyst
good morning. thanks for taking my question. just chip on that -- last time about spiking that ball on the infrastructure bill. i don't want you to handicap the prospects of that bill, but an extension of the waiver is something that congress is considering, is that fair to say?
james s. mahan iii -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes, i talked with our government relations person the other day and believe me, none of that's in our projections.
chris donat -- piper sandler -- analyst
fair enough. i just wanted to see if that's in the realm of possible outcomes. i know you've answered a bunch of questions around expenses. but i just want to double check one thing, because i've heard anecdotes from some fintech companies about some more elevated expenses around hiring new employees, but with the people that you're going out and hiring, i imagine you're competing more with banks for like sba expertise, is that a fair assessment of what you're seeing in the hiring market as you're growing your loans originations?
steve smits -- chief credit officer
yes, we're -- yes look, we're hiring across the board. but specifically, the majority of the growth is in the lending side. and that's lenders, underwriters, closers. and to that competitive, i think all labor markets are competitive right now. but we're really in the market with the banks on that front, we are active in the technology space as well. and there is clearly some pressure around that less of a percentage of our overall hiring than the banking side as we sit here right now.
chris donat -- piper sandler -- analyst
okay. and then just for me one last question on competition. thinking about your new deposit platform and is there a way to characterize where you think you stand competitively with banks on one hand and then with companies like square on the other with square making more of a push into they're already there in small business lending and small business payments, but getting more involved in small business checking, is that something you are watching or deeply concerned about or not so much?
steve smits -- chief credit officer
yes, watching very closely, right, and the market continues to evolve, i think we look at both sides as very viable competitors that we are working toward. and i think what we believe we can do is sort of be the best of both. and so the understanding of the client base, if you think about veterinarians, you think about pharmacists, you think about these industries, we've been in for a decade or more knowing that customer and what we can provide if this technology platform is what we have designed to be, it will be flexible enough that we can create bespoke solutions for industries and these industries that we serve with capital and that we know an awful lot about and that's a slightly different model maybe then square which obviously has a tremendous breadth among small businesses and what they're trying to do with more of that small balance loan and then moving that into savings and checking, but they're a very, very worthy competitor, no doubt.
james s. mahan iii -- chairman and chief executive officer
chris. so we have not talked on today's call much at all about core conversions. but you having been in the banking business for a long time know and understand that a core conversion is something like a heart transplant and brain surgery at the same time. but that said, neil, relative to our tech stack, as it emerges past that core conversion to 14 separate vendors, the tech stack that you referred earlier in the call and certainly our call this week with one financial, which has a similar tech stack in the neo bank along the lines of chris's comments, you may just want to comment on how you see all of that playing out.
neil underwood -- president-live oak bancshares
yes, chris i think that from our view fintechs are actually setting the standard in terms of beautiful onboarding customer journeys for this frictionless onboarding. and so to do that they've built purpose built cores, they've got r&d budgets, hundreds of millions of dollars of r&d budgets. we set down a path in 2016 to incubate what is today finxact. and, the best testimonial to that is when we looked at putting ppp loans on a core last year, literally it was six days to build the integration and we set up a brand new product on a core and so we believe -- we talked about convergence where fintechs are going to have to become more like banks over time from a licensing cost to fund perspective, you're seeing that with square, ilc, you are seeing that with radius and lendingclub, borrow, i mean, the list goes on. banks at the same time are going to have to implement these new technology stacks so they can build best-in-class products. and we just see that convergence continuing. we think we're in a really unique spot as a bank because you know, this conversion represents us completely getting off one of the [indecipherable] and now focusing on this next gen core and this is -- this has been a build a conversion. now the fun begins. now we can actually build new innovative products for our small business customers and that's super exciting.
chris donat -- piper sandler -- analyst
okay, sorry. like i said, that was the last one that wasn't entirely accurate. just on the notion -- sorry about that. on the notion of building new products and i think someone used the word bespoke, is that that's really the vision, right? you have the customer relationships, and you're not trying to build something that's self-service for small business. you're trying to -- is it fair to say you are trying to build something that empowers your lenders and other people within live oak to do new things for their customers, not so much for their customers to just go out and do it themselves. is that reasonable?
steve smits -- chief credit officer
i think convergence is the right word, chris, that, we have lived in a world with bankers who know our customers really well, a lot of human interaction, high touch for a high value add larger product. there's a lot of products and services that customers want to self-service. we need to provide those. we need to offer those digitally in a beautiful user experience but be able to help them when they want to do something more value add that they need somebody and to seamlessly integrate that, again back to we're in a pretty interesting position where the capabilities to deliver the technology to self-service when they want to and the experience and the knowledge in the industry is in the verticals and in banking to deliver that touch to and that's really where we're headed.

good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the q3 live oak bancshares inc. earnings conference call. at this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [operator instructions] i would now like the conference over to your host, greg seward, general counsel of live oak bancshares. sir, please go ahead.
gregory w. seward -- executive vice president & general counsel

james s. (chip) mahan iii -- chairman & chief executive officer
thanks, greg, and good morning to all. for today's kickoff of our best quarter ever i would be remiss if i failed to acknowledge that this is our first call since we went public without brett caines. my euphoria over brett's ability to scratch his entrepreneurial itch is only matched by my excitement of being in business with bj losch, who is responsible for this preso, and will take over very shortly. with that, steve, you and i always talk about safety and soundness, and i was thinking this morning that we have been in the lending business for over 85 years collectively. tell us what you think?
steve smits -- chief credit officer
thank you, chip. a rather boring quarter from a credit perspective, our credit quality remains strong evidenced by all the metrics that we like to look at, historically low past dues, stabilized classified assets, and nonaccruals, and relatively low charge-off levels. and also, we continue to remain very focused on our servicing efforts, and i'm encouraged by the financial reports that we're receiving from our borrowers. cash reserves appear to remain strong and thanks to our diligent servicing focus, we haven't seen many surprises. most borrowers are now making their own payments without government support or additional payment accommodations from us. in fact, today, we only have 22 loans on deferral, and all of these borrowers appear to be making positive financial progress. so i'd say i remain guardedly optimistic that credit will remain strong. i'm certainly pleased with the health of our portfolio, but i acknowledge that now is not the time to take the eye off the ball. we will be prepared to deal with any challenges facing these businesses in the quarters to come, we'll remain committed and we'll remain focused. so again, chip, very solid although slightly boring quarter from a credit perspective.
james s. (chip) mahan iii -- chairman & chief executive officer
like boring. thank you, steve. michael, let's go to slide five. just a few opening observations before i turn it over to bj and huntley. i'd like to touch on our unforeseen lending growth acceleration of operating leverage caused by that growth. what does our bank look like in the future? and what are the advantages of being branchless? i will admit to you that we did not see this coming. a year ago, we discussed 2021 production to be slightly more than three billion dollar. as i look at quarterly production from a dollar amount and the number of products sold or number of loans originated, our business has dramatically increased. just a few highlights looking back. so i'm going to talk a little bit about production and number of loans made overall by the company. so in 2018, about $500 million a quarter, 2019, about the same, 2020, $500 million in q1, then we had the pandemic in q2, dropping to $430 million. and then we jumped to $948 million in q3, $809 million in q4. this year, as you know, q1 was $672 million, and $1.1 billion each and q2 and q3.
and the numbers of loans more or less parallel that, historically, about 250 loans a quarter now jumping to over 500 loans a quarter. and what that means in sba lending, particularly, is there's a massive amount of infrastructure underneath the architect of the deal, the underwriters, and the closers. and i would submit to you that being a closer in the sba business and certainly at live oak bank is probably the toughest job that we have, trying to manage 148 documents and multiple closings at the same time. before i get to the punchline, i'm equally excited about what's going on in the general lending group. so we hired outside the theory of verticality, folks from other banks with a great deal of experience in sba lending beginning in 2018. we did $90 million worth of business that year in 2019, $166 million, in 2020, we did $331 million worth of business and so far this year, $300 million. and the numbers of loans are again paralleling that so we've closed 218 loans in the general group in 2020 and 190 year-to-date today.
this is a massive amount of work. so we faced the ppp euphoria, we stayed up 24/7, and then we get hit with this. the result is actually this in terms of the numbers. one year ago, we had 257 folks in the lending area. we have increased that by 109 to 366 today and we do not have a bench today, we are going to build a bench. at the end of the day, we are dedicated to treating every customer like the only customer in the bank and we do not want our people to be working seven days a week, 12 hours a day. so i'm trying to get huntley and bj a little runway in terms of increases in noninterest expense that way. so let's go to -- thank you. you're ahead of me, michael, slide six. i mean this, to me, is the most dramatic thing that's happened in our history. so if you look back five or six quarters, after you take out all the noise of the investments up and down, all the noise of ppp, we were making about $15 million to $17 million a quarter, and now we're about three times that. so the investments that we made in the past and the operating leverage of this business is kicking in. this to me is the key slide of what we're going to discuss with you today. let's go to the next slide.
all of that has allowed us to maintain and increase our lead. we have been, for the last several years, the number one in sba lender seven(a) product in the country. and now we are stretching that lead to over $2.3 billion for fiscal year ending september 30, 2021. number two is under one billion dollar. so what does all this mean? where are we going with all this? these profits will allow us to build never before imagined products on a next-generation finxact core. the overused word embedded banking, not embedded banking, way more than that. renato derraik is going to march across our verticals and figure out how to digitize that which our small businesses need to make their life easier. certainly, payments, loans, again, another overused word, buy now, pay later for both our small business customers and potentially their customers too but more than that, included, but not limited to, budgeting and financial forecasting, tax prep, debit and credit card reconciliation. it is exciting after all of these years to become a real bank.
so let's take it up a notch. what is different about us and how might we turn these differences to our advantage? first of all, we have no branch infrastructure. many of you on this call know tom brown and his weekly interviews with prominent bank ceos. our friend in canapi, limited partner, harris simmons, ceo of zions bank, was on deck last week. tom writes, harris simmons knows the community bank model with its focus on small and midsized businesses is what it differentiates signs. he understands very well that activity in the branches is declining. in fact, he quantified the decline. branch activity is only nine percent of what it was several years ago. consumer transactions are just seven percent of what they used to be, but small business transactions are still 27% of prior levels. so in looking at slide eight and nine, you can see what's going on here. i actually went back and looked it up. so the day i went into the banking business on july 9, 1973, there were 13,748 banks in this country. today, there are less than 4,700 banks as of today, and about 600 of those are publicly traded. and you can see the decline in branches that fundamentally parallel that. so there have been 30 bank acquisitions above $5 billion over the past 36 months. so there, you see in that next slide, about $3.5 trillion worth of consolidation. but it -- so what does that mean? it's more than that. we are an industry with massive overcapacity and poor customer service caused in large part by ancient technology.
the average nps score in our industry is 35, wells fargo is negative, that's pitiful. in addition, the banking business has to tee it up every day against fintech companies that have attracted enormous amounts of capital from venture firms that have zero expectations of profits anytime soon in this incredibly low-interest rate environment. so many in our industry believe the answer to the problem. buy the folks next door, eliminate overlapping expenses. causes disruption and culture change for the acquired customer service falters. back in the operating system war years -- a few years ago between microsoft and apple, microsoft used the term called fud, fud, fear, uncertainty, and doubt. and that is exactly what happens in the ranks of bank integration. folks are nervous. all of the above allows us to be the safe haven for the best and brightest using next-gen cloud-native api-first technology to build out the nation's premier small business banking platform. we still believe that the regulated bank environment with access to the fdic-insured deposits will win the day for small business america. and bj and huntley are going to show you how we're going to do that.
william c. (bj) losch iii -- chief financial officer
thanks, chip. good morning, everybody. it's great, great to be here at live oak and with all of you today. and chip, thanks for that context for what we're doing over long-term of the company. we've got some very exciting things going on. i am not sure that i could have asked for a better quarter to start with as my first earnings call. quickly, on highlights on page ten, $0.76 of diluted eps. more importantly, and chip talked about it earlier, 17.5% adjusted ppnr growth from second quarter to third, driven by 11% revenue growth from second to third, 64%, 64% adjusted ppnr growth year-over-year. so excellent performance. you'll see here is what i would call our opportunity framework that we'll talk about today. our verticality, which is really our core earnings engine and lending model dedicated to small businesses. and you can see some of the highlights here, huntley, i'll talk a little bit more about what chip referred to, which is building out a full-scale bank, building out our platform to serve more customers over time, and we've got exciting things there. and then on the optionality side, building product factory and innovation with our investments in financial technology and insights that are second to none.
so starting on the left side, we talked about $1.1 billion in production. again, this quarter with what you'll see is broad-based strength across all our different verticals, seven percent loan growth from second quarter to third quarter, excluding ppp, which is excellent performance in this environment. steve talked about excellent credit quality, we'll hit that as well. lots of exciting things in terms of net new hires, where we're building our businesses, lending and deposits wise. and of course, we will touch on the exciting finxact conversion of our deposit business. if we go to page 11, take a look quickly at some earnings highlights. you'll see the adjusted ppnr growth that i talked about, along with the revenue growth, net interest income, up 12% quarter-to-quarter, 62% year-over-year on growth, on the balance sheet plus lower deposit costs. our operating leverage is strong with 11% revenue growth linked quarter versus seven percent expense growth. our margin is at 375 on an adjusted basis, up 12 basis points and 47 basis points year-over-year. all of this performance driving continued improvement in the efficiency ratio that you can see on an adjusted basis is at 56%.
taking a look at balance sheet growth on slide 12. here, you see the loan and lease portfolio, excluding ppp, growing seven percent linked quarter and 32% on a year-over-year basis on the deposit line, fourth line down, healthy growth continues to support and fund that loan growth with strong retention, we'll talk about that in a minute. borrowings are down mostly due to ppp liquidity fund pay downs as our ppp loans are running off. and most importantly, at the bottom, top-tier returns on equity assets and very, very healthy tangible book value per growth share, per share growth, excuse me. turning at 13. all of this leads to what we see on slide 13, which is continued favorable comparisons to other banks.
and if we move to slide 15, let's talk a little bit about the originations volume in the quarter, which was, again, an excellent quarter and another one billion dollar quarter. you can see the mix in terms of percentage of government-guaranteed as a percentage of the total loans originated about a fifty-fifty split. and on the right-hand side, you'll see from q3 2020 to 2021, a broadening of the mix that we were producing between sba seven (a) and conventional. moving to slide 16. i thought this would be a great view for everyone. just quickly explain what you're looking at here on the left-hand side. on the x-axis is our 2021 year-to-date originations by vertical. on the y-axis, it's the origination growth year-over-year for those verticals. the size of the bubbles is what our portfolio outstandings are in those verticals.
and the colors represent the different types of businesses, whether it's small business, banking, energy and infrastructure or our specialty finance businesses, the more conventional type businesses. and what you'll see and notice is large, broad-based origination growth across all three types of lending which is very exciting. so we're seeing growth in all of the different types of businesses that we want. we'll also notice in the bottom left, the covid impacted industries have seen very muted growth, and that's positive for portfolio mix and credit quality. turning to slide 17. you'll see how the originations in the quarter, combined with other portfolio changes and our loan sales show up in our loan outstandings. key highlights again is the seven percent loan growth, excluding ppp. and as importantly, if you look at the first four buckets on the waterfall chart, we had 4.2% net growth before loan sales even with ppp, meaning that our originations and our fund ups of our existing customer loans offset any prepayments and the significant decline in our ppp balances so the production engine and the earnings engine of our portfolio is very, very strong. deposit trends are on slide 18. a couple different takeaways here, good deposit growth opportunity continues with a favorable mix shift from savings to cds.
in the bottom right, our savings account retention remains very strong which continues to support our growth. our 12 basis points of noninterest expense to deposits is in a very efficient platform. chip talked about our branchless model, well this demonstrates the very low efficient cost of delivering that kind of deposit growth; and fourth, bottom, continued reduction in our cost of funds from that mix shift is enabling our net interest margin expansion. and if you turn to page 19, speaking of that margin expansion, you'll see that we have relatively stable loan yields over the last few quarters plus those lower deposit costs driving that 12 basis point improvement in the adjusted net interest margin linked quarter and 47 basis point improvement year-over-year. revenue trends are on slide 20.
again, very strong performance both from balance sheet growth and the gain on sales. you'll see in the bottom right, we sold about half of the loans that became eligible for sale in the third quarter, 25% of the sba that did so in the third quarter. those sales were about 2/3 fixed or fixed adjusted to lock in some premiums and reduce rate risk on our books. and we also sold at lower premiums across the board versus q2 so there is some pressure on premiums going forward, but we feel very comfortable with the flexibility that we have with our portfolio, and we'll find opportunities to continue to see healthy gains on sale. expense trends are on slide 21. as chip talked about, we will continue to hire, we will continue to invest in technology but the positive thing here is that our revenue growth is outpacing our expense growth, which will allow us to continue to make our company more efficient.
steve talked about credit trends earlier so i won't hit those on slide 22 but you have some more metrics here that he referred to, very, very strong credit quality metrics across the board. and wrapping up on slide 23 with our credit reserves and capital. you can see in the upper right, our capital ratios remain very strong and if you look at the 23.5% bubble we call out the coverage of our unguaranteed portion of our portfolio is over two times higher than any other bank. so the strength of our reserves plus our capital relative to our unguaranteed portfolio is unmatched across the industry which makes us obviously very comfortable with our balance sheet and that strength. so with that, i will stop and turn it over to huntley.
huntley garriott -- president
thanks, bj, and glad to have you onboard for your first earnings call. if you could keep financial performance like this for the foreseeable future, that would be terrific. on page 25, chip and bj both touched on some of the highlights of the quarter, but it was a significant one in a number of ways. we continue to excel on the lending front, booking over 500 new loans, adding 300 new small business customers, retaining our lead as the nation's sba seven(a) lender for the fourth year in a row, and we continue to bring on excellent new folks across the organization. we reached a couple of notable milestones this quarter, crossing $1 billion of loan production for the second consecutive quarter as well as over one billion dollar in cumulative energy and infrastructure lending and we cross one billion dollar for our business savings deposits and are now have roughly 10,000 accounts in business deposits now across the platform, which is really exciting. we're proud to receive an award from greenwich, the leader in all things customer survey related in their small business customer experience category, and we're incredibly excited about our deposit conversion that we completed this quarter, and we'll talk about that in a few minutes.
despite these accomplishments, though, we really feel like we're just getting started, and we turn our immediate attention to our checking launch this quarter to enhancements to our loan servicing capabilities and setting the road map for additional expansion on our platform. on the horizon, next year is a small balance loan product and the ability to innovate and create specific products to serve small businesses in our industry verticals like chip talked about. so on slide 26, our platform has two complementary components, a high-touch, and high tech. the roots of this company are in great people with deep domain expertise who serve our small business customers extraordinarily well. we've had the good fortune of continuing to attract and retain top talent across the banking and the technology industries. by investing in and building a next-generation technology stack, we have the ability to deliver innovative products and services for our customers and for our employees.
so great teammates paired with great tools allow us to better serve our customers which at the end of the day is what we're all here to do. and that creates a self-reinforcing feedback loop that attract more great folks that want to be a part of this journey and so on. so we continue to be really excited about that. so on page 27 and chip referenced the new technology platform we've been working on and we've been talking about for years now and it's anchored by a cloud-based core finxact that allows us to innovate in ways that a lot of the industry really struggle with. if you were to ask a bank, how long it would take for a traditional financial technology vendor to create a new product for them, you'll get a groan or an eye roll or something because it takes a really long time and we've experienced that as a company ourselves. but on our next-generation platform, we have the flexibility and speed to market to both add new features to existing products and to launch new products. cloud-based architecture gives us the ability to rapidly scale at lower costs. our data lives in one place with multiple positions in a single account, not siloed in legacy systems. that gives us the ability to better understand our customers, to provide them with rich insights, and to help them with their financial decisions.
the system is also real-time, which further helps customer understand their financial position, enhances our fraud and transaction monitoring, reduces reconciliation work, and gives us the ability to keep pace with all the change going on in areas such as payments and across the industry. and finally, the open platform architecture allows us to connect with many digital partners and build a best-in-class ecosystem to take advantage of all the innovations coming out of the fintech space, fueled by the venture capital community. if you turn to page 28, this platform allows us to accomplish something that rarely ever happens in banking, a successful conversion that actually exceeded our expectations in terms of speed, accuracy, customer experience, et cetera. i won't go into all of these stats in detail but the ability for us on this new platform to establish multiple environments for testing to have real-time access to data for reconciliations helped our incredible teammates flip the switch on 60,000 accounts seamlessly.
so we showed this slide before and we spend a lot of time with our small business customers, listening to what they want, and we think this slide encapsulates a lot of those needs, faster access to capital, digital management tools, actionable insights, better payments capabilities and all in an integrated digital experience. there are a lot of neobanks that have come online in the last few years that have identified one or two of these problems and built point solutions to target them, think about early payroll or buying out pay later, expense management, and they've all done extremely well. a lot of these companies haven't necessarily invented anything new, but they've leveraged a modern technology stack that allows them to innovate more quickly and have data that allows them to possess a deep understanding of digital marketing and customer acquisition costs. we believe we now have all these capabilities in-house, along with an incredible team that understands our customers and are willing to go out of their way to help them.
we are just at the beginning of this journey and with our first use cases live, we're excited about the opportunity ahead and the opportunity this platform creates for us to continue to innovate. over time, we expect this to result in even better lending experience for our customers, lower deposit costs as we build operating accounts, lower customer acquisition costs, lower attrition rates as we embed our bank within industry verticals, and the opportunity to capitalize on new revenue streams that are emerging. on that front, i'm going to turn it over to neil to talk about the venture capital space and how our participation in those markets continue to fuel our growth, not just through financial gains, but through intellectual capital and driving our product right map.
neil underwood -- president
thank you, huntley, and welcome aboard, bj, super to have you. let's start off with macro first, and i think we all have heard about this but seeing it on this chart, it's just amazing what's happening in fintech, both the valuation and the amount of capital that's going into it. and i tend to oversimplify this, but in my view, it falls into two categories and those that are bank-friendly and those that compete directly with banks. and on the latter, massive amounts of capital are going into these companies and it's going directly to marketing and customer acquisition costs to the tune of hundreds of millions. we get to look at the income statements of these, and it's going into, and all of them are using best-in-class metrics, like lifetime value of customers, customer acquisition costs, and tuning and optimizing all the way. that's why the search for the right bank-friendly, cloud-native api first, fintech must continually been pretty passionate about this from the start. moving on to the next slide. this is, i think, a good slide that embodies the evolution of fintech investing in live oak bank, and you can tell you we've been on this mission for quite some time, by now, everybody knows the ncino story, i'm sure, but then under the manor of live oak ventures, we incubated and invested in companies that help further revolutionize the entire bank tech stack, much like the fintech competition i was referring to early. any of the logos listed in bold, by the way, mean that we're using them at live oak bank.
they're either live or in an active projects in implementation, and that's ultimately how we define the ultimate resolution between live oak ventures and canapi, if we use the software under service then it's been a big win. the evolution or emission became more formal when we lost the first fintech fund of its kind, $650 million in capital, 40 banks, the aba, the icba. we spent the last three years combining over thousands of companies, combing over thousands of companies, only to find the best, which, again, we intend to implement at live oak bank. and the mission will continue as we work to launch canapi fund ii. moving on to the next slide. you've seen some of this before, but this shows an aggregate view over time of the live oak ventures companies through a financial lens. the company saw, in the previous slide, breaking down the investment amount, carrying value and value if it were priced at the last round. and while the original intent to incubate these companies was for strategic value, the economic benefit has a meaningful impact, as you've seen in recent quarters, and we certainly hope these trends will continue. so with that said, mr. chairman, anything else from you or we could open up to q&a. let's open it up to q&a.

[operator instructions] our first question comes from the line of steven alexopoulos from jpmorgan.your line is now open.
steven alexopoulos -- jpmorgan -- analyst
hey, good morning, everyone. and bj, i think we're as excited as chip and the team to have you on the call, so welcome.
james s. (chip) mahan iii -- chairman & chief executive officer
hi. steve.
steven alexopoulos -- jpmorgan -- analyst
chip, i wanted to start -- so you said when you kicked off the call that you guys didn't see this coming in terms of the loan originations, can you drill down for us so we can better understand what exactly is coming in even better than you expected? and second, do you feel like we could now -- i know i asked you this last quarter but now there were two quarters above one billion dollar, do you think we could stay above there in terms of originations?
james s. (chip) mahan iii -- chairman & chief executive officer
i just knew that you were going to ask some forward questions, steve, i really did. i think it's a couple of things, and then huntley and the team will weigh in. i mean certainly, the 90% guarantee in the seven(a) space has helped the government picking up what usually we pick up on behalf -- through the customer and give to the united states government, the 55 bps, that's helped. subsidies has helped, as steve mentioned earlier. i don't know, huntley, it's a little early for us to predict next year but it feels ok. how would you go with that one?
huntley garriott -- president
yes look, i agree, i mean momentum feels really solid and i think that part of what happened over the last 18 months is that our brands and sort of success sometimes feeds on that. and so the ppp work we did, we worked with small business customers, we work for referral sources, some of these associations that we spend time with, and we serve them well and so we're getting a fair amount of word-of-mouth referrals now until things are coming in. i think the macro trends that we see are still quite positive as it relates to the aging population of small business owners and in that space, some macro trends around industries around healthcare, veterinarian, et cetera. so all of those feel good and feels like we're continuing to attract good people in that space as we grow, and i think chip's right, we may see some headwind as it relates to the sba enhancements going away but pipeline still feel really solid right now so we're kind of taking it as it comes.
james s. (chip) mahan iii -- chairman & chief executive officer
and one other thing. as of last night, right, in the $3.5 trillion reconciliation bill, the 90% guarantee extending for five years plus other enhancements is in that. i don't think anyone sitting around this table at live oak bank and wilmington, north carolina, thinks that we'll make the cut, we'll probably go back to what we were used to, so would not be factoring any of that into the future.
steven alexopoulos -- jpmorgan -- analyst
okay, that's helpful. and chip, i wanted to ask about expenses. you mentioned at one point, the need to build a bigger bench and huntley and bj, giving you a little more runway. what does that mean for us? like what should we be thinking from an expense growth viewpoint?
james s. (chip) mahan iii -- chairman & chief executive officer
that's probably more for you, bj, i just want -- steve, i just want to make sure, we have killed our people the last 12 months. they wake up every day and they really try to treat every customer like the only customer that when they spent three months spending 18 hours a day trying to help out ppp and all this massive volume because we double the volume of the business, and they're trying their very best going home at night, staying up to 8:00, working every saturday and sunday, and i don't want that. i just do not -- that will not continue, and if we need to build a bench to do that, we're going to do that. now how that gets into noninterest expense, bj, that's up to you.
william c. (bj) losch iii -- chief financial officer
yeah so, steve, what i would say is just look at this quarter, right? we had 11% linked quarter revenue growth on seven percent expense growth. i think that kind of revenue versus expense should likely continue, right? there's going to be continued heavy investment like chip said. we had about 70% of our year-to-date hires in lender or lender support, probably more, much more weighted toward lender support, underwriter closer than it was even on the lender itself side. we're making continued investments in technology and the technology platform, not just finxact, but checking rollout in the fourth quarter, loan servicing enhancements, huntley referred to small ticket lending coming next year. so we continue to be on a journey to build out the platform so expenses will continue to go up commensurate with revenue, but our expectation is that ppnr trend continues to be on a steady climb upwards.
james s. (chip) mahan iii -- chairman & chief executive officer
and just one quick other thing on this issue, right, steve. so i think we now have 22 lenders that are -- that came from other banks that are not part of the theory of verticality. and in the future, huntley, we're going to get ahead of that by bringing the infrastructure with them in terms of underwriters or closers, you may want to just comment on that because that's going to affect us.
huntley garriott -- president
yeah, i mean i think, chip, we have had great success in finding these experienced lenders and we've tended to hire them and then a little bit scrambled to provide the support behind them, and we're just going to flip the order of that, so that you'll see as we grow that business, we'll start with incremental underwriting credit, closing bench and then layer on those people because we still see, i think, great opportunity to continue along that strategy.
steven alexopoulos -- jpmorgan -- analyst
that's helpful. and then final question on the checking launch that's coming this quarter, will this be initially a pilot in select verticals? or is this going out more broadly across all of the verticals? thanks.
huntley garriott -- president
yes, i'll start. i mean, we've got a pilot in place now for our employees, and so that is already planned. what we will launch is a product that has base capabilities for small businesses, it won't be vertical-specific yet, that will be the enhancements that we'll layer on. so the base product, i think, will be a very good product broadly applicable for small businesses, and then we'll start to get more specific over time.
steven alexopoulos -- jpmorgan -- analyst
okay but huntley, you haven't tested this with clients yet just internal?
huntley garriott -- president
that's right.
steven alexopoulos -- jpmorgan -- analyst
okay. thanks for taking my question.
huntley garriott -- president
that's it.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of jennifer demba from truist securities.your line is now open.
jennifer demba -- truist securities. -- analyst
thank you, good morning.
huntley garriott -- president
good morning, jennifer.
jennifer demba -- truist securities. -- analyst
so let me follow up on one of steve's questions. based on your pipeline today and what you're seeing in october, do you think you could see another billion dollar origination quarter in fourth quarter?
james s. (chip) mahan iii -- chairman & chief executive officer
hard to say at this point but i would say close, jennifer. you people are relentless on [indecipherable], certainly, i'll acknowledge that but business is pretty good.
jennifer demba -- truist securities. -- analyst
okay. and on slide 16, you have the breakdown of small business lending versus specialty lending and energy and infrastructure, how do you think the loan mix evolves over time, chip, when you look at those three? and are there more other types to come later?
steve smits -- chief credit officer
okay, jennifer, i'll take that. i think we see really good opportunities across all three. i think trying to figure out exactly which one is going to grow the fastest is a bit tricky, we've had a great run on the small business side and so i think you could continue to see a little bit more weighting to the other two. and some of these specialty finance businesses we're really just getting started and so i think we have a lot of white space to run. and then given all the tailwinds in renewable energy, it feels like we've just kind of continue to have a massive opportunity there to continue to grow as well.
jennifer demba -- truist securities. -- analyst
okay. and my final question is on -- bj, can you just talk about what you see for net interest income and the net interest margin when fed funds do start to go up?
william c. (bj) losch iii -- chief financial officer
sure, jennifer. so we continue to obviously think that net interest income is going to climb pretty materially, particularly over the near-term from continued deposit cost declines over the next maybe quarter or two, but then also, obviously, adding all this production and net loan growth is going to continue to move nii higher. in the near term as well, we do think the margin could benefit incrementally from those two things, i think spreads are still pretty good and pretty stable on the loan side, and on the deposit side, cost of funds continues to trickle down. longer-term, we are not as asset sensitive as others, but we do have about 50% of our loan portfolio levered to the shorter end of the curve. so we will see some modest improvement as rates start to rise but more of our net interest income will be driven by increases in volume.
jennifer demba -- truist securities. -- analyst
thank you so much.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of michael perito from kbw. your line is now open.
michael perito -- kbw -- analyst
hey guys, good morning, thanks for taking my questions.
neil underwood -- president
hi mike.
michael perito -- kbw -- analyst
i wanted to start -- i kind of had a question around the debenture investments, i was curious if you guys could maybe just spend a minute refreshing us on how those write-ups or gains actually flow through live oaks consolidated income statement? for example, i saw in the third quarter in september that alloy completed series c, i think the valuation was up four times on the $100 million raise, i mean i'm pretty sure that canapi led that series b so i imagine there's a pretty sizable ownership. i'm just curious if you can maybe just refresh us on how those types of gains flow through moving forward as we probably get a little bit more line of sight on some of these companies that you have investments in and as they raise their valuations.
neil underwood -- president
yeah, i'll start and then turn it over to bj for more clarity, but i think it's important to look at live oak ventures, which are direct investments, and every time there's a raise, there's a mark as compared to canapi which is a fund, and that fund we at live oak bank invested $20 million in but we're also subject to management fees but more importantly, the carry. and that indeed also is market-to-market but would have, i think, a much smaller impact on income as it flows through than a live oak ventures director investment. and i'm going to turn it over to you to clean all that up.
william c. (bj) losch iii -- chief financial officer
no, you got it, neal. the venture's investments are a variety of equity security method and equity method., and so those -- some are market-to-market and some are more flow through. and then, as neil said, anything that's in canapi, we are an investor in the fund and so our stake in that will have value once those things start to get marked and realized, but it will be a much smaller impact for us just given the size of our investment in the fund itself. and then we've got some performance fees that over time may flow their way through as well.
michael perito -- kbw -- analyst
got it. so something like alloy, the actual impact felt in the financials would be far less than something like greenlight where the majority is held within live oak ventures.
william c. (bj) losch iii -- chief financial officer
yep, that's right.
michael perito -- kbw -- analyst
perfect. and then on the cost side, just curious, i mean, it makes a lot of sense, right? i mean, just being on the growth you guys have had and the amount of volume and the launch of the new core and that -- to add to the bench, i think is pretty logical but it sounds like you've already made quite a few of these hires, just curious about kind of the wage pressures and how that is factored in. i mean, is it harder to find talent? i mean, you guys have a fairly unique culture. i mean, i'm sure you guys are pretty -- sticklers at the door, i guess, for lack of a better way of putting it, to make sure you're bringing in the right people. i mean, maybe just a little bit more color around that process would be helpful.
william c. (bj) losch iii -- chief financial officer
so sure, i'll take it. it is a competitive market., there's no question about it, and great folks have a ton of options to where they want to work so we've got to be competitive in all facets, in the mission and what we're doing there, in how we treat people, and that includes compensation and includes a bunch of other stuff, too. and we're out every day trying to find folks and the best ones can go work wherever they want, i think that's especially true in the technology side. and to convince folks like renato and others to come join us is it's kind of fun to actually go out and recruit and try to see what we can build here but it is competitive, there's no doubt about it, very, very competitive.
neil underwood -- president
yes, just an extension of that. hiring other lenders has not been a problem nor do i foresee that being a problem in the future with them bringing their infrastructure staff with them. renato, you may want to comment on -- i know that you've done a couple of searches recently for senior people in your organization, and it's seemingly gone reasonably well.
renato derraik -- chief information and digital officer
yes, incredibly well. there is incredible amount of excitement from folks who are having dialogues with us about the future state architecture, the access to fintech, and also the culture of this place which makes it incredibly special. so we are fortifying and continuing to build our capabilities in the technology space and had no issues at all attracting incredible talent across an industry, including some that will be announced really soon.
neil underwood -- president
yeah, michael, you'll remember that years ago when we started ncino, people used to tell me, like, there's no way in hell you could attract technology talent and wilmington, north carolina. i think ncino has 1,200 people across town today so something is going right.
michael perito -- kbw -- analyst
thank you. i appreciate it. and then just last, i wanted to just clarify an answer to an earlier question about kind of the positive operating leverage moving forward and how revenue growth should outpace expense growth. functionally, though, as we think to the model in the next handful of quarters here, there will be a step back in that operating leverage though, right, bj, just from the ppp revenues that boosted the full year 2021? is -- i mean, i guess, saying it another way, i mean, the efficiency ratio will likely step back up next year before hopefully trending down after that, correct?
william c. (bj) losch iii -- chief financial officer
yes. i think if you're looking at it on a gross basis, if you will, with the ppp and the benefit that we've had there, yes, the answer is yes. on the adjusted basis, i do think, like we talked about, there's still a little bit of margin expansion, there's quite a bit more net interest income growth from the production that we've already put on the balance sheet, we've got flexibility on gain on sale because of what kind of portfolio we have that is eligible for sales, so we can be discerning, pick and shoes on that side, and then all of that should more than cover the increases in expenses as it relates to hiring and investment in technology. so i think the revenue engine is incredibly helpful and supportive for continuing to pay for our expense growth over the next several quarters.
michael perito -- kbw -- analyst
got it. makes sense. thank you guys i appreciate it.
william c. (bj) losch iii -- chief financial officer
thanks michael.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of chris donat from piper sandler. your line is now open.
chris donat -- piper sandler -- analyst
thanks. good morning, everyone, appreciate you taking the questions here. one for steve about the boring credit quality, used the phrases not out of the woods and not taking our eyes off the ball. is -- and chip, i'm going to be another sell-side analyst asking a forward-looking question here but is there any point in coming quarters where you think you might be able to relax a little bit? or just with the pandemic and the macro situation, it's going to be tough to really relax for a while?
steve smits -- chief credit officer
chip, i can take it. this is steve, chris, i'm paid not to relax so i won't. my point is we will never be complacent, we'll never spike the ball, and that's what's been successful and worked for us, and we'll continue to do so. we're not -- we're fully aware that we need to focus on inflation, we need to focus on supply chain, we need to focus on the political environment, we need to train our folks to work with our borrowers, ask the right questions, so we have a very good pulse on our borrowers and how they're doing, and we react to that and try to be as proactive as we can. so again, i think we're in a really, really good place, much better placed than i would have first thought when pandemic first hit. and i think that has a lot to do with the type of portfolio that we've built over the last -- more than a decade and we'll just continue to do what works for us going forward and we won't shy away from the challenges that might or may not be in front of us.
chris donat -- piper sandler -- analyst
okay. and then, steve, just to follow up on that one. when i look at the loan origination graphic on slide 16 with the year-to-date originations and year-on-year origination growth. does what you just comment about, certainly must filter into that. can you just talk about how it does with like inflation concerns, supply chain concerns, all the other more recent developments beyond the pandemic?
steve smits -- chief credit officer
yeah, i'll make a couple of comments. first of all, our model's incredibly powerful and it allows us to expand and contract in various industries based on the pressures in front of them. we do that, also, our domain expertise in so many of these areas is incredibly powerful to give us a very close pulse on what's facing those businesses in those areas. also, i'll make a comment that we also manage risk through participations which has been very successful for us, and we've put a lot of investments in growing that capacity over the years so you can look at senior housing, you can look at middle-market where we're making really good inroads, however, about 50% of what you see there, we manage the risk through participations, and that also gives us a very good tool to control our risk tolerance as well.
chris donat -- piper sandler -- analyst
got it. thank you very much steve.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of william wallace from raymond james.your line is now open.
william wallace -- raymond james -- analyst
hi, thanks for taking my question, maybe like to just try to put a bow on the expense line of questioning. if we kind of just think about the comments that you made about some investments in people, i believe in the press release, you talked about t&e starting to normalize, et cetera. so some expense pressures there but revenue growth driving continued operating leverage. if we think about it from an efficiency ratio perspective, maybe just help us think about any current interest rate environment where efficiency could trend to, say, in the next year and a half to two years?
steve smits -- chief credit officer
so let's kind of put aside ppp and runoff and all those types of things, right? and just think about where we sit in third quarter at a 56% efficiency ratio kind of on an adjusted basis, and that's been trending down given our strong ppnr growth. if we can continue to generate ppnr growth which as you know is just simply revenues minus expenses, we're going to inherently spend less to make $1 and the efficiency ratio is going to improve. so over the next couple of quarters, i can think about it continue to trend down a couple hundred basis points over that time and our longer-term goal would continue to move that even further down as we build the earnings in here.
william wallace -- raymond james -- analyst
okay, thank you, that's helpful. and then there's been -- there's a couple of comments made about the premiums on loan sales under pressure a little bit, correct me if i'm wrong, the incentives ended at the beginning of this quarter, correct? and if that's the case, can you just talk a little bit about how premiums have trended quarter-to-date?
steve smits -- chief credit officer
yes, we really started to see a change in the premiums really actually mid-quarter of this quarter so really in august, it started to change, and premiums, they're going to be different for different products but on balance, maybe 150 to 200 basis points lower so we did a little bit of work in the third quarter to sell a little bit more on the longer fixed-rate side to take advantage of what we saw with historically higher premiums and to take a little bit of interest rate risk off the books. we'll look this quarter to be a little bit more opportunistic in terms of looking at premiums and the mix between fda and usda going forward. so premiums are going to continue to be under pressure because of the reintroduction of the sba fees and the dealer excess inventory that's out there, particularly going in the year-end, but again, all of that to say is we have better insights arguably than anybody in this industry as it relates to sba and premium trends and what's going on in the secondary market, and so the flexibility that we've got with the guaranteed portfolio and our ability to pick our spots on when and how we sell, it's going to be really helpful to us.
william wallace -- raymond james -- analyst
okay, thank you. and then my last question, you had a slide, i think it's slide 28 that just gave some stats around how successful the conversion to finxact was. i'm wondering if you could just provide us with any updates on how the beta testing is going with several of the larger banks.
james s. (chip) mahan iii -- chairman & chief executive officer
i think it's going pretty well, don't you, neil. i don't know how much frank would wants to disclose.
neil underwood -- president
yeah but i think having live oak as the first bank that's live has actually done a conversion from the old chore is a meaningful inflection point, and while i think you would be happy with this sharing, he's got over 12 banks in the implementation right now. it just bodes well for the velocity and the momentum of that company and their product-market fit.
william wallace -- raymond james -- analyst
okay. i really appreciate it. thank you very much. it's very helpful.

2021-Q4,LOB,2022-01-26 08:30:00,"prepared remarks:
greg seward
thank you, and good morning, everyone. welcome to live oak's fourth quarter 2021 earnings conference call. we are webcasting live over the internet, and this call is being recorded. to access the call over the internet and review the presentation materials and commentary that we will reference on the call, please visit our website at investor.liveoakbank.com and go to today's call on our event calendar for supporting materials.
our fourth quarter earnings release is also available on our website. before we get started, i would like to caution you that we may make forward-looking statements during today's call that are subject to risks and uncertainties. factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations are detailed in the materials accompanying this call and in our sec filings. we do not undertake to update the forward-looking statements to reflect the impact of circumstances or events that may arise after the date of today's call.
information about any non-gaap financial measures referenced including reconciliation of those measures to gaap measures, can also be found in our sec filings and in the presentation materials and commentary. i will now turn the call over to chip mahan, our chairman and chief executive officer. 
chip mahan -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks, greg, and good morning to all who have joined to review our performance for 2021. i am speaking to you by recording as cell coverage in my current location is a bit spotty. i will kick things off with a few brief overarching comments on the state of our business with a peak into the future and then turn things over to bj and huntley to describe our best quarter and best year since inception. we're going to talk a lot about growth today, both in the past and in the future.
that said, we never strayed from our guiding principles of soundness, profitability and growth in that order. we're beginning to see a few things. our government-guaranteed lending platform is scalable. we have grown from lending money to veterinarians; one industry, one vertical, and now, it's 35.
we've accomplished this. credit quality for these small businesses with very little or no capital is unprecedented. total nonaccrual loans in this bank today are $23 million or 67 bps on a total unguaranteed portfolio at year-end of $3.5 billion. $15 million of our non-accruals are continuing to pay as agreed.
this is remarkable in this segment. it has taken us 14 years to prove it. and more recently, over the last few years, we've expanded beyond our theory of verticality. our general lending group has grown from eight highly skilled wells fargo lenders to 22, adding similar quality individuals from other banks.
so where does that leave us on the loan side of the balance sheet in terms of the future sba opportunity? in the last 24 months, 1,800 banks have made an sba loan. my guess is that there are at least 4,000 sba lenders trained with primarily two skills. one, is it a good loan? does my bank want to lend money to a small business operator that has no capital? the sba prefers that their banks prove that the borrower cannot find credit elsewhere. secondly, does the loan meet the highly technical and stringent requirements of the sba's 500-page standard operating procedure book? my guess is that 100% of the 4,000 lenders in this country have heard of live oak bank.
my secondary guess is that their view of us, in all likelihood, is favorable. given that, we're going to launch a new business unit to determine who are the best and the brightest of this lot. and yes, we will be searching for the appropriate support staff of underwriters, closers and services. this group will also support growth in our conventional specialty lending group that has grown nicely following our customers' upmarket.
you got to spend money to make money. we've proven we can do that over the last 14 years and more recently with our general lending expansion. and we're going to do a lot more of it. but is it worth it? here's how we look at it.
assume a lender can produce $30 million of loans a year. in five years, that lender's portfolio has grown to $150 million, expected payoffs begin in six years. let's assume the portfolio levels out of the 150, times a 4% net interest margin yields pre-tax pre-provision earnings of $6 million. this is a highly liquid, highly profitable book of business supported by a staff of only five live oakers.
now, on to phase two. what about deposits? here's the way we're thinking about the future of the liability side of the balance sheet. huntley and renato will tell you where we are on completing the cycle of the total finxact conversion. that is door no.
1 and essential to create the product factory that we have discussed before. door no. 2 is to build out a bespoke bank for each of our deposit-heavy verticals. door no.
3 is our developer portal, which will make banking as a service the easiest to use in the industry today. so yes, creating noninterest-bearing deposits at scale is just around the corner. but what does it mean? here's what i think. take first republic bank.
jim herbert has created an organic growth machine by creating unmatched service to the right customer. those customers grow on their own and then refer like-kind friends, which enhances that growth. only a small percentage of frc's growth comes from strangers. as jim says, ""spend more money on service, not advertising."" all of that for his bank translates into the nps score of 73.
our overall lending nps score is 67, our overall deposit score is 42, the combined is 47. so what's going on here? our loan repeat customers are 20%. but why? we're an sba lender. the agency's proclaimed lender of last resort.
our borrowers want to graduate. we're building more that they can graduate to. frc surrounds you with service from day one. most interaction is on the deposit side: wires, overdrafts, notary work, etc., etc.
imagine opportunities to excel where renato fully digitizes our customers' experience by tying together bank stuff, like loans, access to the payment system, plus elegantly interfacing with practice management software, plus budgeting and forecasting, plus tax prep, plus payroll, etc., etc. so many touch points, so much stickiness. and remember, a recent mckinsey study reminds us the loan-to-deposit ratio of small businesses with revenues under $5 million is 20%. that's right.
deposits are five times what they borrow. our industry has done a terrible job of taking care of these businesses. we have the capital and the earnings power to finish our mission and build this new platform to enhance the performance of small business america. bj and huntley will provide details on our financial performance for last year and how we're going to get there.
bj, over to you first.
bj losch -- chief financial officer
excellent. thanks, chip. good morning, everybody. as chip said, we finished 2021 on quite a high note, building on the significant momentum we've seen really over the last two years in production, profitability, growth and talent acquisition.
our quest to be america's small business bank continues and 2021 was a year that saw significant milestones toward that goal. 2022 will be more of the same. the unique power of our core lending model dedicated to small business creates significant revenue that allows us to both deliver meaningful current earnings and growth while also aggressively investing for the future. as you can see, starting on slide five, 2021 earnings per share were $3.71.
we generated 75% growth year over year in adjusted ppnr, driven by 37% revenue growth and 19% expense growth. the revenue growth was driven by outstanding loan production of $3.9 billion, up 46% from the prior year. even with selling about 35% of our guaranteed loan volume, we still generated 32% loan growth on the balance sheet. this outstanding core business performance, coupled primarily with the benefit of a $44 million gain on one of our ventures investments, resulted in 23% growth in tangible book value per share.
excellent value creation. we delivered key accomplishments across the three dimensions of our business: verticality, scalability, and optionality. first, in our core lending model focused on small businesses, founded and built on the theory of verticality and knowing your customers and their businesses deeply, we saw high-quality, profitable, balanced, and sustainable loan growth across our small business, specifically finance and energy and infrastructure groups. second, we continue to scale our capabilities, talent, product and technology-wise which will enable further growth, deepen customer relationships, increase retention and provide both a high-touch and a high-tech experience for our customers all on a next-generation technology platform.
thirdly, we're uniquely positioned to thrive in the future banking landscape. we've proven capabilities, a focus on innovation and strategic investments in financial technology that we use for both improvement in customer experience and as a source of growth capital. turning to slide seven. let's take a look at some highlights from the fourth quarter.
reported eps was $0.66 in the quarter on 11% growth in pre-tax income and 8% growth in adjusted ppnr. you may have noted that both net income and eps for the quarter were impacted by a much higher-than-normal effective tax rate of 37% versus a full year effective tax rate of 21%. this was roughly a $0.06 impact to eps in q4. investment tax credits associated with renewable energy investments that were anticipated to close in '21 and reflected in our tax rates reported in the first three quarters were delayed by supply chain issues related to the pandemic.
therefore, the q4 effective tax rate was adjusted for this full year impact. these credits are expected to close in the first half of 2022. few quick highlights on the fourth quarter. strong pre-tax earnings and ppnr growth continue to be driven by outstanding loan production and balance sheet growth.
we experienced our third consecutive $1 billion loan origination quarter, resulting in 7% loan growth, excluding ppp. credit quality continues to be very healthy with virtually no net charge-offs in the quarter and a reduction in non-accruals. we continue to attract talent, particularly in our lending and technology groups. we introduced our operating account called tidal and made loan servicing enhancements that continue to improve our customer experience, all moving us toward our goal of building the community bank of the future.
and live oak ventures made one investment during the quarter. the fintech space remains very active overall, and we see a lot of exciting innovation occurring across the fintech landscape. both huntley and neil will give you a lot more color on these last two topics in a moment. turning to slide eight, you'll see more detail on our adjusted earnings highlights.
adjusted ppnr growth of 8% linked quarter was made up of both revenue and expense growth of 8%. the net interest margin expanded nicely again, up eight basis points linked quarter to 383. and due to the strong positive operating leverage in the business, we again saw a decline in the adjusted efficiency ratio, which has declined 700 basis points since 4q '20. diving a bit deeper into the revenue drivers on slide nine, you see the total revenue growth of 8% linked quarter and 40% year over year was driven by the strong loan growth and resulting net interest income which was up 7% linked quarter and 50% year over year.
on the fee income side, we continue to see healthy sale premiums on our guaranteed loan sales with the average net gain in the fourth quarter of 110%. turning to expenses on slide 10. as we discussed on the q3 call, we anticipated having a strong hiring quarter, and we did. we added 39 net new live oakers, which was the driver of our expense growth in the quarter and over the course of 2021, we onboarded 164 net new people, growing our employee base by 26%.
importantly, over 80% of those new hires were revenue-generating lender or lender support personnel. turning to the balance sheet and returns on slide 11. both linked quarter and year over year loan growth and deposit growth were excellent. loan growth, excluding ppp, was up 7% and 32% linked quarter and prior year quarter, respectively.
that strong loan growth was driven by our third consecutive quarter of greater than $1 billion in originations across our lending platform, well balanced among sba and conventional products, as you can see on slide 12. and on slide 13, you can see that the strong originations with 54% of that volume fully funded in the quarter more than offset prepayments and continued ppp runoff, resulting in that 7% net loan growth before loan sales. our efficient deposit platform continues to provide fuel for our loan growth with both strong retention and new balance growth, as you can see on slide 14. the introduction of our new business checking account will positively impact our funding mix over time as well.
this strong loan and deposit growth has been achieved with well-disciplined pricing. average core loan yields have remained stable. deposit costs declined nicely over the course of 2021, leading to that strong net interest margin expansion of 50 basis points to 383 and almost 70 basis points on a reported basis to just over 4%. turning to credit on slide 16.
our long-standing practice to frequent contact with existing customers and prudent underwriting remains a top priority. you see that our non-accruals declined, past dues remain very low and we had virtually zero net charge-offs in the fourth quarter. on slide 17, you see in the upper right, our capital ratios remain very strong. note the green 22% bubble we call out on the graph which is the capital plus reserve coverage of the unguaranteed portion of our loan portfolio, which is almost two times higher than most other banks.
this, plus the $2.9 billion of highly liquid guaranteed loans on our books give us better comfort and balance sheet flexibility. wrapping up on slide 18 with a look at our performance versus industry peers, as chip said earlier, soundness, profitability and growth in that order is what we strive for, and we're hitting on all cylinders. with that, i'll turn it over to huntley and neil to give you a little bit more color. huntley?
huntley garriott -- president, live oak bank
thanks, bj. chip and bj mentioned our 2021 performance. it really was a phenomenal year, and we think it sets us up incredibly well for the future. core revenue growth of 37%, expense growth of 20% drove 75% increase in ppnr.
it's pretty amazing operating leverage. let's spend a few minutes talking about the strength of our lending franchise and then about our technology platform and how we think all that fits together. so if you look at our lending franchise on page 21, small business lending continues to be the major driver of growth and profitability for us and that success has allowed us, as bj mentioned, to invest heavily into developing our next-generation technology platform. from our roots as an sba 7(a) lender across just a handful of industry verticals, we've diversified into over 35 verticals that you can see on the left-hand side across three distinct business segments: small business, specialty finance, and energy and infrastructure.
on the right-hand side of the page, you can see that over half of our origination volume in 2021 still comes from that traditional sba customers. but increasingly, we're serving a broader mix of customers with a broader suite of lending products. as we've grown as a company, we've also grown with our customers, increasingly following them up market and into covering the institutional capital providers that serve them. in our specialty finance division, we serve businesses primarily in the $2 million to $10 million ebitda range, and we continue to see significant capital flows and great financing opportunities there, whether it be from founder-owned companies, small institutional sponsors, search funds or self-funded acquisitions.
our work with dsos, the consolidators in the dental space, is a perfect example of how we've grown in the industry, and we plan to expand that model into other sectors like veterinarians and medical. specialty finance accounted for almost 30% of our loan origination in 2021, and we expect it to be an important driver of our balance sheet going forward. one of the most significant tailwinds in our lending across small business and specialty finance has been the amount of business acquisitions that we're seeing in the market. these transactions account for a little under half of our overall volume, and we believe the macro trends will continue as baby boomers look to continue this trend of transitioning ownership.
our third lending division is the renewable energy and the infrastructure space where we're really proud not only of the impact we're having on carbon reduction, but also our position in the industry and we're really excited about the future growth potential. investment capital continues to flow into the renewable space with private equity and venture capital in renewable energy and clean tech hitting another record in 2021. the legislative environment remains accommodative, both at the federal and the state level, and we see the potential for meaningful increase in investments if the bbb bill passes. we also have a dedicated team serving rural markets and helping to support the infrastructure and businesses there.
our sweet spot in this space remains the usda lending, but we're increasingly spending time across a broader range of customers and technologies with a broader suite of lending products. at just 15% of our total origination, we believe there's meaningful opportunity for us to grow in this business. our overall growth prospects across all of our lending platforms come down to three elements. one, as chip mentioned, finding the top talent to join us.
two, is providing them with the best platform and that's culture, benefits, technology, support. and then three is continuing to enter into new verticals and markets where we see opportunity. despite our lending success, we recognize that we still have areas to improve. our focus has and always will be on credit quality, which remains really solid, but we're also laser-focused on improving our customer experience, which primarily means getting faster.
lending volume this past year was significantly greater than we anticipated. you all may recall, at the start of last year, we expected a little over $3 billion in origination volume when we ended the year just shy of $4 billion. that's definitely a high-class problem, but we got behind in our support infrastructure and we had to lean hard into hiring folks to catch up. we now have that infrastructure in place and our growth will be more proportionate as we go forward.
in 2022, we'll continue to focus on tracking talent, but we'll also focus on reengineering our lending technology and our processes as we roll out a new onboarding experience for loan customers and improve our document and data management capabilities. we'll be leveraging the latest generation of ncino for that loan origination work, and we're also working to unify our customer experience across all our products and channels, which will ultimately set the stage, as chip mentioned, to convert our loan customers to the finxact core. turning to our technology platform. this past year was truly a remarkable one for us as it relates to the build-out of our capabilities.
after years of hard work, we successfully completed our deposit conversion onto our next-gen core and launched our small business checking account just 10 weeks after the deposit conversion. it's a pretty remarkable feat and something that i think would be virtually impossible on a legacy core. and this foundation has set the stage for our entire technology road map where we will add features, design products and integrate offerings at a pace that's far superior to what we could do on legacy platforms. importantly, as we head into this year, we're focused on enhancing loan origination processes, adding more features to small business, checking and launching a score-based small balance lending product.
bj talked about the investments we've made primarily in hiring and that will continue. it will continue to be predominantly tied to revenue, including additional talent in the lending areas, building out some new deposit verticals and technology talent. on the technology side, we've kept our team lean by design, leveraging our ecosystem partners like finxact and aperture as much as possible. with our core live now, we've reached the stage where we can further build out our own team focusing not only on enhancing our customer experience, but importantly, on delivering technology designed to drive revenue.
for example, building out api-as-a-service capabilities along the lines of what plaid and stripe have done, but specifically for small business banking. we're expanding to seven sprint teams across lending, deposits, infrastructure and data that will roughly double the size of our development team and dramatically accelerate the pace of our innovation. two of these squads will be 100% focused on improving our existing efficiency and velocity of our core business and the rest designed to build out the net new opportunities. as you all have heard by now, we launched our small business checking account product, tidal, that complements our business savings and cds.
one of the key features of this digital onboarding for small businesses has a loan driven our business savings and cd balances to over $1.3 billion in just over a year. and in the last month of our launch, we put on about 100 small business checking accounts without any marketing. page 23 lays out the features that we believe small businesses are looking for as it relates to banking. what we've witnessed in the market is the creation of some really innovative products around some of these, primarily coming out of the fintech space, like merchant pos, invoicing, expense management, etc.
and all of these products have a really important role and they're helping small businesses, but very few of them are able to integrate and centralize these products together to make life easy for the small business owner. our product today out of the gate is basic by design and serves the needs of our smallest businesses. but our road map is clear, and with the ability to build or buy each of these point solutions will quickly and methodically enhance the functionality to better serve a broad range of small businesses. upcoming releases will include quickbooks integration, merchant capabilities and working capital product.
perhaps the most important piece of this road map is our small balance working capital product, which sits at the top of almost all of our small business customers wishlist when we ask them what they need. the industry overall has struggled to make quick credit decisions for small businesses and efficiently fund these loans. when we roll out this product in the middle of the year, you'll see the tangible benefits of our new platform: seamless customer experience, limited data entry and integrated product offering, and lightning-fast delivery. we think all of these products and services come together to deliver what we call the community bank of the future.
and what do we mean by that? we think community banks have and will continue to play a vital role, especially supporting small businesses by combining local knowledge and personalized service. where many community banks have struggled is in delivering a world-class digital experience. we think increasingly communities are defined not by geography but by shared interest, like veterinarians. on the next-generation technology stack, we'll create bespoke banks for each of these industry verticals, as well as new verticals.
and it's called these community banks, each one dedicated to serve a specific constituency with specific products and integrations. and like ligo blocks, we will add and remove these products to create a tailored experience for these customers. the banking features and insights required to run a dental practice are very different than those required to run a restaurant. and our ability to customize that is at the core of why we built this new technology stack.
our deep domain expertise in these areas, coupled with the flexible technology, will allow us to deliver these bespoke community banks quickly and cost effectively. a key element of delivering this community bank is our ability to embed our bank and partners that serve these small businesses. in many industries, small businesses rely heavily on practice management software for appointments, billing, inventory. with an api-enabled banking solution, we'll integrate banking products directly into the software and partners that our customers use, improving their experience, leveraging rich data sets to inform credit decisions and provide targeted insights to customers, as well as driving low-cost customer acquisition.
if each industry vertical has its own community bank, then each partnership with a practice management software or application could be considered a branch in this digital community bank. this embedded banking opportunity, as we call it, is a critical component to our strategy to become america's small business bank, and we're really excited to see it come to life. the strength of our core lending business continues to provide us the opportunity to invest in what we believe is the future of the industry and our company. this final slide we think of as the flywheel is central to the success of live oak.
at its core, it's all about the people; attracting, retaining, developing and engaging them. that's mission one. then all we ask is that they take care of their customers. to do that, we build the proper technology infrastructure, we deliver products and services, and we have deep domain expertise to serve our customers, all designed to truly help them.
the customer then gets the best of both worlds, the high-tech and the high-touch. with that, i'll turn it over to neil to talk about the investing side of the business, which continues to be a meaningful driver of our strategy.
neil underwood -- president, live oak bancshares
thank you, huntley. so moving on to slide 31. i really like this slide because it talks to the evolution of fintech investing in live oak bank. after ncino's success, we formed live oak ventures, and the goal is to directly invest in best-in-class apps for our customers and employees.
you've seen some of those in the slides previously. it's important to note that live oak ventures continues to flourish as we see direct investing as a core strategy of the bank. a great example of that, by the way, is our latest investment in an early stage company by the name of able.ai. and these guys are great.
there's 10, 10 times stanford engineers implementing real ai around document ingestion and classification across the entire lending continuum. this solution will arm our lending team with yet another weapon to speed up the lending process. moving to the right. you guys know about canapi fund i, we launched it three years ago, $650 million, have been super active, i mean, actually to the point where we're now coming to a close as we've invested in the lion's share of the capital in the companies you see here.
and the thesis is working. we're winning the lead against the blue chips in new york and silicon valley. we're getting greater allocation, better economics. and we're sitting on boards and really, we're right in the middle of all the information flow, which is super important.
we're excited to announce the launch of canapi fund 2. we are targeting $750 million. we are receiving very positive feedback and responses from our current bank lps. we expect the first close actually in march.
and like fund 1, the bank will share in the two and 20 economics. moving on to the next slide. nothing really new to see here, just a few minor adjustments to the positive. the important thing is we'll continue to track this, and the live oak ventures portfolio broken down by the original cash investment carry value and applied value.
and the next slide, again, is just to emphasize that live oak ventures will continue to remain very active in direct investing with dedicated resources at the bank and that will be comprised of obviously follow-ons to support the existing portfolio companies and then net new investments categorized as follows. one, that helps the bank, like bank infrastructure, able is actually a great example of this. second category, those that help our smb customers. so huntley briefly mentioned investing or practice management software to support embedded banking.
that's going to be really important. we think there will be investment opportunities there as well. and then lastly, across the spectrum incubation where we will continue to create net new companies, pre-product, pre-revenue. and we'll continue to update you on these as the time -- as they roll out.
so bj, back to you.
bj losch -- chief financial officer
all right. thanks, neil, huntley, and i think we can open it up for questions.
",":
operator
[operator instructions] our first question comes from jennifer demba with truist securities.
bj losch -- chief financial officer
hey, jennifer.
jennifer demba -- truist securities -- analyst
thank you. good morning. so with the hires you've made over the last several months and the ones you intend to make in '22, what kind of loan origination outlook does the company have over the next few quarters?
bj losch -- chief financial officer
jennifer, it's bj. i'll start, and huntley can certainly jump in. but we finished the year quite strong, and we're very pleased with that, and we're very optimistic about the outlook as well. the pipelines that we see are still quite strong.
the new lenders that we hired last year had a partial positive impact, and they're going to have even more of an impact on a full year in 2022, and we'll be continuing to add incremental net new lenders in 2022 as well. so 3.9 was a good year. we certainly see origination volume over four for 2022 and with the incremental new hires that we have, plus the momentum that we see in the business, we continue to think that that could even move higher and that it could also certainly help. that's still moving through the process in d.c., of course.
we don't assume that we're going to get continued enhancements there, but that would be gravy on top of what we currently see as very positive outlook. huntley?
huntley garriott -- president, live oak bank
yes. well said.
jennifer demba -- truist securities -- analyst
thanks, bj. what kind of hiring plan do you have budgeted for this year versus with the 164 new hires last year?
huntley garriott -- president, live oak bank
yeah. i think you should expect probably a similar pace of that. and i think it is, like we said, the majority of that will be revenue producing on the lending side. we talked about the technology side, so probably a quarter of that will be in the technology side and then a bit scattered around that.
but pretty similar, i think, net numbers.
jennifer demba -- truist securities -- analyst
ok. and just one more question for you, bj. with higher fed funds likely over the next several quarters, what do you think that does to the net interest margin outlook for live oak given your deposit mix now and how it may be changing over the next couple of years?
bj losch -- chief financial officer
sure. yeah. so jennifer, we put a few characteristics on our margin page, just to kind of outline some of the dynamics that we'll see. but if we start q4 '21 with a 402 margin reported and 383 on an adjusted basis, we see over the course of 2022 that those should converge more toward the adjusted nim number by the end of the year.
so we still see very, very healthy net interest margins. but as rates start to increase, particularly in the back half of the year, we would see that conversion happening accordingly.
jennifer demba -- truist securities -- analyst
ok. thanks so much.
bj losch -- chief financial officer
sure.

our next question comes from steven alexopoulos with j.p. morgan.
steven alexopoulos -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
good morning, everyone.
bj losch -- chief financial officer
hey, steve.
huntley garriott -- president, live oak bank
hey, steve.
steven alexopoulos -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
i wanted to first follow up on chip's comments that you need to spend money to make money. so expenses were up almost 20% in 2021. what's the outlook for 2022?
bj losch -- chief financial officer
yeah, i'll start, and huntley can certainly jump in. first, i think it's really important to say that we fully expect to grow revenues much faster than expenses. and as i said at the beginning, we are very fortunate here to have the core business lending model as a significant revenue growth engine that allows us to invest in new lenders, new technology that's going to propel us into the future. so positive operating leverage should definitely continue.
with that, though, on the expense side, what i would say is, we saw a 26% growth in headcount over the course of 2021. if you annualize that for a salary and benefits impact, that's probably a good proxy for salary and benefit increases from '21 to '22, plus little bit more for partial year incremental hires that huntley talked about. we'll have those investment tax credits that flow through the expense line, but that have a benefit on the tax line that will come through, as i talked about in the first half of 2022. and then pretty much all the other line items generally speaking, should grow with inflation.
so that gives you, i think, hopefully, steve, a pretty good amount of color on how to think about the expense growth for next year.
steven alexopoulos -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
ok, bj. so said another way, it sounds like it's a similar outlook for 2022 than what we saw in 2021? is that...
chip mahan -- chairman and chief executive officer
steve, can you hear me? this is chip. sorry, guys. can you hear me loud and clear, huntley?
huntley garriott -- president, live oak bank
yes, sir.
chip mahan -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. so i'll end up screwing up bj's comments, probably. so here's an example, right? the m&a in this business is the gift that keeps on giving, right? so the old compass bank became bbva, it was purchased by pnc. we did a bit of a lift out down there and now i think we have 12, 14 folks lenders, closures, underwriters.
and as all that continues across the country, just who knows. i mean, we now have a group that is totally dedicated to recruiting. and if we can replicate that and soon to be 100 cities in the united states over the next three to five years of the best and the brightest sba lenders, as i alluded to in my opening comments, we're going to do that. we're going to find the best and brightest.
and how you budget that, i mean, as articulate as bj was, if we did another lift out of 15 or 20 folks, i mean, you're going to put expenses in front of revenues for a wee bit.
steven alexopoulos -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
ok. so you'll clearly remain opportunistic. but from a core basis, chip, we don't know what's going to happen on the hiring side. it sounds like a fairly similar setup, but it could be a little higher if more revenue opportunities present themselves.
ok.
bj losch -- chief financial officer
i think that's fair, steve.
steven alexopoulos -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
i think i got it. ok. bj, i want to understand your commentary around the margin. so if the forward curve plays out so we see four hikes, in terms of the core net margin or ex ppp fees, it sounds like you're expecting the core margin to lift.
is that correct?
bj losch -- chief financial officer
yeah. i think, again, we start the core margin at 383, right, and the reported nim at 402 and so i say converging down to the 383. yeah, i think we see the adjusted margin as being fairly stable. just under 50% of our portfolio is variable.
we do think that the first handful of moves will -- a lot of the deposit lag will occur. so again, by the end of the year, maybe it's converging, but we still see the adjusted nim staying pretty stable throughout the course of the year.
steven alexopoulos -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
ok. that's helpful. and then, finally, i appreciate the optimism that originations can stay above $4 billion in 2022. should we think about -- if that plays out, should we think loan sales stay pretty consistent around this $200 million per quarter range? and what's the outlook for gain on sale margin for 2022?
bj losch -- chief financial officer
yeah. so we generally target about 35% of eligible sba volume that's generated in any given year to be sold and that's exactly what we did in 2021. so it might fluctuate every quarter based on the opportunities that we see. but generally, we think 35% of sba and about 100% of the u.s.
da volume. so we'll keep that as a consistent framework. but as production is growing, that also means that eligible sales are growing as well. and so we do think that gain on sale dollar amounts will be growing through 2022 at a pretty healthy clip.
huntley garriott -- president, live oak bank
yeah. the other thing i'd add to that is we've had a fair amount of construction projects that we've entered into over the last couple of years, the usda projects largely and then some across our sba. as those projects finish, they then become eligible for sale. so just the amount of production we've had in the last couple of years, you'll see a bit higher eligibility coming from prior production until that i think will flow through.
bj losch -- chief financial officer
yeah. and that's a great point. and in terms of premiums, to huntley's point, sba will be average net premiums around maybe 109% or 110%. the usda is usually in the 115% range or so.
so again, i think we see pretty healthy premiums going into next year, maybe a bit of a modest decline, but higher eligibility for sale, maybe a little bit more mix toward usda, which has generally higher premiums, and therefore, the dollar amount of gain on sale seeing a pretty continuous increase.
steven alexopoulos -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
ok, perfect. thanks for all the color.
bj losch -- chief financial officer
sure. thanks, steve.
operator
our next question comes from michael perito with kbw.
michael perito -- keefe, bruyette and woods -- analyst
hey, good morning. thanks for taking my question. i wanted to just spend another second on the topic we just -- you guys were just discussing. so i mean, just to summarize, make sure i kind of capturing it accurately.
i mean, it sounds like the originations you guys are -- the pipeline suggests that you guys are comfortable -- are hopeful that you can do another $4-plus billion a year, but i guess, just is it fair to assume that the trends in the back half of this year with the conventional lending group being a larger percentage of that that will continue, i imagine, and make up for maybe some loss just general volume. obviously, i know you guys expect to gain market share, but just general volume of the sba 7(a) approved fundings come down a bit from a very elevated 2021? is that generally a fair way to summarize the set up?
huntley garriott -- president, live oak bank
yeah, michael, i think that's right. i think we continue to see a lot of opportunity on the sba side. and even if the market is down a bit, where we play in primarily business acquisitions and expansions, we continue to see real momentum in that space. so we think a little bit were less, maybe less volatile to the total sba market and think we'll continue to drive that.
but i think the mix should be probably about consistent across the product set as we look into this year.
michael perito -- keefe, bruyette and woods -- analyst
ok. and when you guys say that the -- you guys have a hope to kind of see continued growth in the gain on sale for next year, is that -- i guess, can you compartmentalize that a bit more for me? is that year-on-year or is that based off the run rate you guys had at the back half of the year, which seemed a little higher than what was normal or any more color you can provide there?
bj losch -- chief financial officer
yeah. i think, steve -- or excuse me, mike, if you look at q3 to q4, we sold about the same amount of guaranteed loans, but we had maybe $1.5 million more in gain, and that's simply related to the mix of what we sold. i think we sold about 60% in the quarter that was variable versus 40% fixed or fixed adjusting and the sba versus usda is going to make a difference. but overall, i think growing -- if you take q4 and then just look forward, we do think that there is incremental growth quarter over quarter in 2022 from an aggregate gain on sale perspective because of what huntley and i just talked about, continuing to grow the sba-eligible sales, no.
1. and no. 2, more volume of usda product that will be coming on eligible for sale at higher premiums.
michael perito -- keefe, bruyette and woods -- analyst
and on that last point, so i mean, if we look back kind of pre-pandemic, i mean, you guys -- i think the margins were in the 8% range. but i guess to put some numbers around it, i mean, you guys are saying that, not being too specific, i mean, it could very well remain north of that 9% you guys have been doing just because you're selling more usda loans than you might have been two years, two-plus years ago relative to -- in the mix of loans sold?
bj losch -- chief financial officer
yeah. that's fair.
michael perito -- keefe, bruyette and woods -- analyst
ok. thanks for that. and then on the embedded finance initiative and the banking-as-a-service stuff that huntley was mentioning in his prepared remarks. so just wondering if you guys could break down a little bit more what that could look like? i think historically, you guys have said that you want the live oak brand incorporated.
you're not so much into kind of the sponsorship model when the name is just on the back of a debit card or something like that. but obviously, there are some funding opportunities out there and those types of relationships. and it seems like from a tech stack standpoint, there really is nothing holding you guys back from exploring some of these opportunities. so i'm just curious if you can maybe break out a little bit more with some -- generally what some of those opportunities could look like, i'm sure you can't be too specific, but my guess is somewhere in the works, if you're planning on launching this year? so i just would love a little more color if you can provide it.
huntley garriott -- president, live oak bank
sure. i'm happy to, and i can start and if we want to get technical, renato's here, too. from a go-to-market strategy, as we look at this, we're really focused still on the small business customer and helping them and our ability to integrate into the practice management software, the networks, the associations, the buying groups, the wholesalers, all of these different application service providers that deepen the relationship with the small business and where we can embed our banking product, that is really our primary mission and where we are going to market. we do believe, as you think about banking-as-a-service and providing banking product, whether it's through fintech or otherwise, we do think we have a cost advantage, a flexibility advantage and just overall a technology advantage, and so we're looking at that and maybe a couple of little things pop up here and there that we want to do.
but that isn't our primary focus as we think about it right now, it's really focused on what software and what applications touch the small business and how can we deepen those relationships with integration.
michael perito -- keefe, bruyette and woods -- analyst
so is your expectation that anything you do in this arena, would it be something more tilted toward trying to generate lower cost funding at this point? i mean, whatever it looks like, i guess, we'll have better color when you announce something, but is it fair to assume that that's where the focus is?
huntley garriott -- president, live oak bank
yeah. i think there's three primary places. we think that this need for small balance credit is a real opportunity and with better data and credit decisions, we think that that is -- will be a driver, and that's a great product that we want to offer. that typically comes with the operating account.
and so then those noninterest-bearing deposits, especially now that rates are starting to rise, the value proposition in there continues to increase. and then third, it puts us squarely in the middle of payment flows, and we think there's a big opportunity around that too. so that's how we're thinking about it, mike. definitely, the checking balances is an important driver, but there's really, i think, three main categories that we're pushing on.
michael perito -- keefe, bruyette and woods -- analyst
helpful. and then maybe a question for neil kind of on that last point that huntley brought up. for the fund 2 within canapi, any broader thoughts of where you think the focus of that fund could shift? i mean, there's a lot going on in the payment -- stable coin, blockchain-based real-time payments, b2b payments world. i imagine you guys are looking at that at stuff although i don't know that a lot of formally has been announced for live oak.
but just curious if you can maybe provide any thoughts about where you think that fund could trend, and if those are areas of focus that there could be overlap?
bj losch -- chief financial officer
yeah, i think there are. canapi, we haven't announced yet just had a large investment in a company that helps banks be a custodian of crypto. so holding on to bitcoin trading, bitcoin and so there's -- obviously, you've seen a lot of activity on that side. we tend to stay away from tokens and maybe nfts.
we tend to really like anything around kyc, kyb, fraud prevention and obviously, the infrastructure and the custodian side of all that is crypto. crypto means many things to many different people. so we love blockchain. we love infrastructure.
there are some things that we're staying away from. but all of it makes banks be better on behalf of the customers. and relative to the actual overall strategy for fund 2, look, there's 250 billion lines of cobalt code that drive financial services right now. i think we're 20% through the total retooling, moving it to api first cloud native.
and so we're going to continue to invest in companies that help evolve those strategies. and the api stuff is really important because it supports the embedded banking strategy. so as we embed our bank into practice management software providers, you asked a great question, i mean, it's going to have we think, pretty significant effects on the cost of funding over the next -- over the many years to come, none of that we could have done without a brand-new core with finxact because you just can't scale and the api sets are not rich enough in some of the 30, 40-year-old code out there. so some more of the same in canapi 2.
we'll probably do bigger investments, larger, just given the fund size is going to be bigger, but with all of our bank lps in mind.
michael perito -- keefe, bruyette and woods -- analyst
got it. and then sorry, i'm going to sneak one more, and i apologize if i missed this, i was going to jump in between stuff this morning. but just i heard the commentary about why the tax rate was still high, but was there anything about what you guys expect it to be next year?
bj losch -- chief financial officer
yeah. i think, mike, a good assumption is in the 20% to 21%, 22% range. if we do more investment tax credit business, which we expect to do, it certainly could go lower. but i think having that range is your current assumption is probably a good one.
michael perito -- keefe, bruyette and woods -- analyst
got it. great. thank you, guys, for taking all my question.
bj losch -- chief financial officer
thanks, mike.
operator
our next question comes from chris donat with piper sandler.
chris donat -- piper sandler -- analyst
good morning, everyone. thanks for taking my questions. neil, i wanted to start with you, and i'll ask the question, and i suspect you're not going to answer it the way i want to, but we'll understand. with those live oak ventures remaining active, can you quantify how much capital is expected to be committed there? i know you said opportunistic, so i imagine it will depend on a lot of things, but any range or ballpark based on historical activity would be helpful?
neil underwood -- president, live oak bancshares
yeah. i think probably not right now. i think we're talking with the board about interesting ways to downstream capital, also investing at the bank. i think -- the thing to think about though, and i think the thing that makes this really interesting, is that many of these companies, able is a great example, are really early stage.
so we don't need to invest a really large sum of money to own a meaningful piece just given the stage and the maturity and that allows us to be really efficient with our capital and still get significant upside, assuming these companies go with the right trajectory. so i maybe look at it through that lens instead. at some point, we may be prepared to talk about some ranges, but that's kind of how i respond.
chris donat -- piper sandler -- analyst
ok. that's helpful. once you said opportunistic, it seems like there's a lot that will depend to understand that. and then i wanted to just go back to one issue on gain to sales, bj.
is there anything we should be watching with the potential mix of originations on the sba side with rising rates in terms of the percentage of fixed versus variable? or is that not something that should really change that much in a rising rate environment?
bj losch -- chief financial officer
yeah, that's a good question, chris. i think micah davis and walt phifer in our treasury group and our secondary group do an excellent job really kind of trying to study the market and seeing how we can maximize what we're doing from a sale perspective, and they look at the mix of variable fixed, fixed adjusting sba, usda, etc. to see what makes the most sense. i do think that, generally speaking, we're looking at trying to sell product that maybe has a higher propensity to prepay.
we're also looking at maybe selling some more fixed or fixed adjusted at certain points of time to manage our balance sheet and our interest rate risk. so a lot of things go into the rubik's cube of how we look at what we should sell and what we should retain on balance sheet for the carry income, but back to my earlier comments, i think looking at all of that sitting here today, we do still continue to see pretty healthy opportunity to increase gain on sale each quarter going into next year.
chris donat -- piper sandler -- analyst
ok. and then just wanted one clarification on expenses. just looking away from compensation, but you have had increases in professional services and data processing. i thought i heard the comment that basically all other expense lines other than comp should be kind of with inflation, is that effect -- that covers professional services and data processing, right?
bj losch -- chief financial officer
it does. i think, yes, to put a little bit of a finer point on it, chris, you're right. data processing probably continues to go up. maybe it's a little bit more than inflation because of the technology investments that we're making.
loan expenses as it relates to originations will maybe go up more with production, but professional fees should likely come down, some of the other line items come down. so in general, i was trying to say, it all -- the rest of it grows with inflation. the biggest driver, of course, is going to be our salary and benefits line as we continue to add talent.
chris donat -- piper sandler -- analyst
ok. that's helpful, bj. thanks. appreciate it.
bj losch -- chief financial officer
thanks, chris.

operator
good day, everyone, and thank you for standing by. welcome to the first quarter of 2022 live oak bancshares earnings conference call. [operator instructions] please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. i would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, general counsel, live oak bancshares, mr.
greg seward. thank you. you may begin.

chip mahan -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks, greg. it has certainly been an interesting last few months in the capital markets and live oak bancshares has participated in that volatility. so welcome to our q1 earnings call or should i say stay the chorus call or better said by winston churchill, stay calm and carry on the call. greg, let's go to slide 5.
i cannot tell you how pleased we are with the growth and the core earnings of our business. variances with ppp and the marks on the live oak bancshares investments make it difficult to understand the true operating earnings of the business. key in this analysis lies in the understanding the risk in our loan portfolio, at this point in the cycle, i am still proud and amazed that our loans over 30 days past two were just a little over $4 million on a loan book of almost $7 billion. bj's credit quality slide, also notes non-accruals of $25 million, interestingly over half are making payments as agreed or in the process of being placed back on accrual.
all expected losses have been charged-off or are properly reserved. this metric tells us more than any other relative to the growth and the true earnings of our business given how we lend money to small business america. moving on to the next slide, slide 6, greg, this is our best first quarter ever. as you can see, although q1 is historically our slowest quarter, we grew 29% over last year and over the last four years, our compounded annual rate of growth for the first quarter was a healthy 21%.
so just a couple more comments before i turn the call over to bj and huntley, ok. i want to talk a little bit of about the future of our business and the future of our industry in general. all $280 billion lines of software code that run every bank on the planet is going to get swapped out over the next decade. to support this point, we need to look no further than the microsoft and amazon recent earnings releases.
amazingly two days ago, a not microsoft announced earnings of $17 billion on $49 billion in revs, revs on a very large base grew 18% year over year and earnings of 8% year over year. shockingly, the cloud business was up 32% with $23 billion revenue. so $23 million of the $49 million was cloud-based. microsoft now has 20% of that market up from 7% in 2016.
market leader amazon web services owns 40% of that market, in q1 amazon's cloud infrastructure services business grew a whopping 46%. relative to taking advantage of these cloud native api first initiatives and building banking products on next-gen core processors, we were first. the sale of finxact to fiserv obviously created a $120 million gain, $125 million in pre-tax cash. we've started that business with the sanchez brothers in december of 2016, with the help of frank bisignano, who at the time was ceo of first data.
first data sales to fiserv, frank assumes the helm there and immediately acquires the company as fiserv's next-gen core processing platform. fiserv will provide the sanchez brothers the capital over a $100 million and importantly related implementation capabilities to allow the beginnings of the digitization of our industry. for affirmation to change in our industry, one needs to look no further than the wall street journal article last week outlining the efforts of one william hockey. william is the co-founder, plaid, a fintech payments company.
the article is titled, plaid co-founder takes aim at rickety banking tech. he bought northern california national bank for $50 million. he renamed the bank column. he developed his own banking platform from scratch over the last three years primarily to serve fintechs.
let's review the success of his first company founded in 2013 while a student at emory university, raised capital in july of 2013 at a $13 million valuation. two years later, $53 million, june of 2016, $225 million, december of 2018 value of the business is $2.6 billion, tried to sell the visa for $5 billion that was canceled in january of 2020 raised one year ago, $425 million in cash at a $13.4 billion valuation. for our industry to take an occ regulated silicon valley start-up lightly would be a mistake. the point is we have been building toward this since 2016.
we are going to stay the course bj and huntley are going to tell you just where we have been and how we're going to do it. bj?
bj losch -- chief financial officer
great. thanks, chip. appreciate that. good morning, everyone.
look at the quarter and talk about how we did and what we're looking like going forward. so starting on slide 5, you'll see that our first quarter earnings per share were $0.76 a year-over-year basis, we generated 91% growth and adjusted ppnr driven by 44% revenue growth on 24% expense growth. the revenue growth was driven by loan production of $865 million, as chip said, up 29% from q1 last year and our highest first quarter of production ever. we generated 30% loan growth on the balance sheet and the outstanding core business performance along with continued success with our ventures investing resulted in 19% year-over-year growth, intangible book value per share, excellent value creation.
we delivered and continue to do so on key accomplishments across the three dimensions of our business. verticality our core lending business scalability, which is growth in our lender platform, our products and our technology and our optionality, which is our fintech ventures activities that foster innovation and create organic capital. turning to slide 9. you'll see more detail on our adjusted earnings highlights on a linked quarter basis adjusted ppnr was down 5% on revenue growth of 3% and expense growth of 10%.
i'll get into revenue and expense growth drivers in more details starting on the next slide. the loan loss provision was again modest and credit quality remains strong. turning to the revenue slide. on slide 10, you'll see total revenue growth of 3% linked quarter and 44% year over year was driven by the strong loan growth and resulting net interest income, which was up 5% linked and 44% year over year.
net interest margin expanded again up another basis point -- 8 basis points linked quarter to 391 with a reported net interest margin of 402. on the fee income side, we saw healthy sale premiums on our guaranteed loan sales in the first quarter with the average net gain of 109%. as you can see in both the table in the bottom left and the commentary in the bottom right, we sold $220 million of total guaranteed loans in the quarter disproportionately waited toward sba sales. two things we saw during the quarter led us to lean to end sba sales this quarter.
number one, as you can see in the table usda volume was very light, eligible, usda sales volume shifted out of the first quarter into future quarters. and secondly, while premiums remained relatively stable with recent trends during the first 45 to 60 days of the quarter, we did start to see some meaningful changes in demand and pricing due primarily to shifting market sentiment on the fed's rate and economic outlook. so with the fintech gain of $120 million booked in the second quarter, we will take the opportunity to moderate our guaranteed sales in the second quarter and allow the markets to further digest the fed's rate moves. turning to expenses on slide 11.
as we discussed on the q4 call, we anticipated another strong hiring quarter and we had one, we added 44 net new live oakers in the first quarter. and as we discussed on the last few earnings calls, we've been working hard to help our lender support teams, underwriters, and closers, primarily to catch up to the significant ramp up in volume we saw in 2021. good news on that front, we have caught up and have already seen a 10-day improvement in average time to close from last year's level. in 2022, there will be more of a hiring emphasis on technology talent, which you can see in the chart on the left, 35% of our net new hires in q1 were in technology with 45% in lender and lender support.
huntley is going to give you a little more color on the tech hires in just a moment. turning to the balance sheet and returns on slide 12, growth was again strong both linked and versus prior-year quarter as were returns on equity and assets and tangible book value growth year over year. slide 13 has more information on originations which chip discussed and huntley will cover in a bit more detail. turning to slide 14.
this shows a waterfall of our loan growth quarter to quarter where it came from with net loan growth before sales at 7% linked quarter, very solid performance. turning to slide 15. strong loan and deposit growth has been achieved with well disciplined pricing. average core loan yields have remained stable in our deposit cost declined over the course of 2021, leading to strong net interest margin expansion of 45 basis points adjusted for ppp, the 391 and a reported name of just over 4%.
so while we're clearly headed into a much different interest rate environment, a nim starting point of 4% is surely a nice one to have. turning to credit on slide 16. our long-standing practice of frequent contact with existing customers and strong underwriting remains a top priority. as chip talked about, you'll see that our non-accruals and past dues remain low, and we had very low net charge-offs again in the quarter.
on slide 17, you'll see in the upper right capital ratios remain strong, note the green 21.3% bubble we call out on the graph, which is the capital plus reserve coverage of the unguaranteed portion of our loan portfolio, which is almost two times higher than most other banks. this plus the $2.9 billion of highly liquid guaranteed loans on our books, give us both comfort and balance sheet flexibility. slide 18 shows continued top quartile performance versus industry peers and soundness profitability and growth metrics. and before i hand it over to huntley, i just wanted to wrap up with a few slides that might help provide some context for the future environment.
sometimes it's helpful to take a look back before we take a look forward. so on slide 19, as i talked about a little earlier related to premiums in what we're seeing in the gain on sale market. here, we provide two views of the sba secondary market and gain on sale premiums over a several year period, including 2016 through 2018, which was a period where the fed funds rate moved up 200 basis points. the first -- the top half or the first graph in the upper left is for variable rate product and the second is for five-year fixed product, two of our most common guaranteed sba sales.
so few takeaways here. number one is the variable rate product due to its relatively steady spread characteristics and pooling ability tends to have relatively steady gain on sale premiums through various rate cycles. the second takeaway is gain on sale premiums for fixed rate product tend to fluctuate a bit more in different environments. as you can see, driven by a combination of wider spread variability, prepay speeds and due to its lack of pool ability will be more susceptible to changes in demand due to a smaller set of buyers.
so what's the point? the point is in an unsettled market with large moves and funding costs and appetite, we have to continue to be discerning about what we sell versus hold on the balance sheet, particularly until markets digest, the large anticipated moves and rates due to the fed actions. wrapping up on slide 20, perspective on long-term performance is helpful as well. and as you can see, live oak through both rising and falling rate cycles has been consistent in delivering strong credit quality, growing loan originations on our balance sheet, leading to healthy nii growth we'll continue to strive to do the same going forward. so with that, i'll turn it over to huntley to give a little bit more color on where we're growing and investing.
so over to you, hunt.
huntley garriott -- president, live oak bank
thanks, bj. another busy quarter here. you can see some of the highlights on point two. i'm going to touch on a couple of key themes this morning, again, the strength of our core lending business, the talent acquisition, and the strategy there, and then our technology and product roadmap.
so if you look on 2023 on the lending side, we continue to do what we do best, which is provide capital to small businesses. as chip mentioned, the first quarter does run traditionally a little slower than the rest of the year, but we still originated $865 million across the franchise up 29% from last year. small business division had a great start to the year. as you can see in the bubbles led by some of our flagship verticals, healthcare, veterinarian, investment advisors, and then support from our generalist strategy.
we've also seen some success in some of our newer verticals like rv parks, and we have a handful more that were in the early stage of exploring. the generalist strategy for us has been one. i'll talk about it more in a minute. that's been quite exciting as we continue to add folks around the country, focused on business acquisitions.
the demographic trends of the aging and retiring small business owners continues, the silver tsunami as they call it. and we think we're well positioned to support business owners in those change of control transactions. our specialty finance business was similarly strong led by our middle market sponsor and our government contracting teams. and as a reminder, we tend to focus on companies with ebitda between $2 million and $10 million in that sector.
and we continue to follow the flows of equity capital that are coming into that space. the renewable energy business was off to a slow start this year with some construction projects impacted by supply chains and some pressure on certain environmental attributes. overall though, the demand for and in the investment in clean energy continues to accelerate. and we feel really confident about opportunities for us there and the pipeline there look really good.
so turning to page, we've talked about this in the past. this is a quick map of the u.s. and the dots are where we have generalists scattered around the country, working in those markets and around those markets on business acquisition loans. as you can see, we've got 24 of those lenders currently year to date.
we've hired seven folks in towns like cincinnati and minneapolis. and there's a lot of great, great markets that we haven't touched yet. and we will continue to look for putting great people on the field. all in all, the momentum feels really strong.
and look, we don't see it in our numbers as it relates to credit or pipelines or anything, but we also are cognizant that we're headed into a more uncertain macro environment with interest rates and the economy. so as we prepare for these environments, i think it's worth noting that our sba expertise has an element of countercyclical to it. in the past, we've seen conventional lenders tighten their credit boxes and the sba products become more prominent in certain markets and oftentimes with enhanced government guarantees. so we think we're ready for whatever comes our way.
so as it relates to people across the bank, we just continue to attract incredible folks here. and as bj said, our primary focus has been on lenders, lender support, and increasingly in building out our technology team, but it's really across the company. in a competitive talent market, we're competing not only with banks, but fintech companies, private equity firms and lots of others. so we brought on 48 net new folks in the first quarter, that pace will likely moderate a bit in the back half of the year, but we'll continue to take opportunities to bring the best and brightest folks together here and we think it's a real competitive advantage for us.
in that vein, we brought on someone this quarter to launch our first deposit vertical. so that's in the 1031 exchange space, and we're excited about more to come on that space as well. so turning to 25, chip went through the rationale of the finxact sale, but unlocking $120 million of capital allows us the ability to do a few things. first and foremost, it allows us to keep growing our balance sheet without having to raise dilutive equity, which is pretty unique among high growth banks.
the second is it allows us to accelerate some of our technology initiatives and redeploy some of the capital into fintech investing. and then the third, it allows us to give a little bit of it back. as in the past, we've shared a portion of special gains, whether it's from ppp or greenlight with our teammates, we intend to do that again. and we also plan to give a portion of it back to our community to continue the work we're doing to help support underserved small businesses and other community efforts.
so turning to technology and product, our small business checking account, which we call title went live recently. and we have a little over 300 small businesses and a couple million of deposits. pretty early days, but that's with a basic first gen product and basically no marketing. but what we have is a baseline to build off of and the ability to add features at a pace that few banks can match.
one important feature is an efficient working capital solution, which our customers consistently ask for. and we believe will be important to drive adoption of our overall operating account. we'll start rolling that product out in early q3 along with incremental checking account features. and you've heard us and a lot of folks in the industry talked about embedded banking.
let me spend a minute on what that means to us. at a high level, all the work that we've done to build a cloud-based api first bank will allow us to create not only unique products and solutions, but also to deliver them in unique locations. and we'll do all that leveraging our deep industry expertise. in this context, if you look at companies that have been successful like plaid or stripe that have made it really easy for technology first companies to embed financial services solutions, data in the case of plaid, payments in the case of stripe.
and they embed those into product offer rings through a simple developer portal with well-structured apis. in the small business space, there are literally thousands of verticalized software companies, many of which we know well through the verticals we serve. at the end of the day, embedded banking will provide us with two critical elements. the first is unique distribution channel.
you can think of each of these software companies as a branch that will allow us to source low cost customer acquisition of these small businesses. the second is increased stickiness of these customers as their financial services embedded in their day-to-day business. so aside from embedded banking, we also see a lot of opportunity and what we call platform banking, where we can leverage this technology stack to allow third party fintech companies to build and launch products faster and easier than with their current providers on legacy architecture. we call it platform banking, people have other names for it.
we've got a small, but growing pipeline there, and we're excited about opportunities as well. so we'll continue to build and invest in this platform all anchored on the finxact core. ironically, the gain from the finxact sale to fiserv will allow us to accelerate our development by continuing to hire world class technology talent. with this gain, we're able to invest in incremental $10 million to $15 million per year in technology, some of which is already showing up in our first quarter numbers.
these investments will be spread across all aspects of specifically around development, cyber, data, and leadership. the major areas of this technology investments for us include customer acquisition, where we already see the benefits of having easy account opening, where we've opened over 10,000 small business savings and cd accounts. and the growth in those balances is over 70% in the last year. customer experience is another critical area, where the challenger banks have truly excelled and it's critical for us, both offensively and defensively to be best in class.
and as we fully get onboarded onto this new technology system, there are meaningful opportunities for us to improve efficiency, specifically around data quality, data entry. and finally, we're always thinking about disruption. we think we're still in the early stages of some tectonic shifts that are set to occur in the way small businesses bank, the ease with which they open accounts. they access capital, they move money and they receive actionable information, where they choose to bank namely within the software they used to run their business.
so we think of this as effectively building a challenger bank for small businesses within live oak bank, leveraging our deep domain expertise, our incredible teammates and this next generation platform. and while this investment has taken longer than we expected to deliver, we're still equally as excited for what's to come in the back half of this year and beyond. i think we've proven to be reasonably good stewards of capital as it relates to technology investments over time from ncino, apiture, finxact and we view this the same way. to be turned to page 27, you look at our investment strategy.
we continue to have two main areas of focus for our external investing. one live oak ventures, which is our direct investing arm will continue to support the existing investments in our portfolio. we'll augment that with investments in banking infrastructure, similar to what we've done in the past, like finxact, companies where they're just strategic overlay like these verticalized software companies that support small business. and then third, we'll also look to incubate businesses internally.
in q1, we made one incremental investment in that middle category in the partnership space, and we have more in the pipeline. the other area we continue to be active is in canopy, where we plan to invest $20 million into the second fund that's currently being raised. the first fund is made 18 investments in some fantastic fintech companies, many of which we're using or evaluating for use in our technology stack today. so turning to page 28 and wrap this up a little bit.
regardless of the economic environment, we have the same core components of our strategy, great people that understand and truly want to serve small businesses, a technology platform purpose built for them. and on the technology front, we're willing to admit that we're playing the long game. and that at times is in favor and at times less in favor with investors. but in the near-term, we have a rock solid balance sheet, a small business lending franchise that's second to none, the best team on the planet.
and it allows us to simultaneously grow our core business and drive profitability there and also invest for the future. we have an enormous sense of urgency to do all this and confidence we're on the right track. so with that, why don't we turn over for questions.

operator
thank you. [operator instructions] our first question is coming from steven alexopoulos of j.p. morgan. your line is open.
go ahead.
steven alexopoulos -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
hey, good morning, everyone.
chip mahan -- chairman and chief executive officer
good morning, steve.
bj losch -- chief financial officer
hey, steve.
steven alexopoulos -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
bj, i wanted to first follow-up on the commentary to moderate loan sales in the second quarter. is this only the second quarter, where you plan to moderate sales and maybe how should we think about the level of gain on sale revenue for 2q and then for the full year.
bj losch -- chief financial officer
yeah. so steve, as i said during my commentary, particularly on the fixed rate product, if you think about what's going on there and how we price those loans that then go into the secondary market. they are largely based on a prime plus type rate quote. so prime hasn't moved up as substantially as we know it's going to both the funding markets have clearly anticipated that.
and so spreads on that product and yields on that product relative to have been compressed. so the point was, is that gain on sale premiums, particularly around fixed rate products are under quite a bit of pressure until the market moves through the rematch, if you will, of the appropriate spreads between yields and funding costs. so what we'll do is we'll continue to look at the mix of what we want to sell variable versus fixed rate and respond accordingly, particularly in the second quarter. yes, we do plan to moderate the sales for two reasons.
one is, the one i just said, let the market settle a little bit, because gain on sale premiums have compressed probably a bit more than what we think they'll ultimately settle at. but then secondarily, because we anticipated the finxact gain, which flows through non-interest income, we didn't feel the need to be selling into an environment that wasn't favorable to us. so we'll moderate the second quarter and then we'll evaluate third and fourth as we see what the market is shaping up to be.
steven alexopoulos -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
ok. so i take you choose not to give us a range, where you think gain on sale revenue could move to.
chip mahan -- chairman and chief executive officer
that would be correct.
bj losch -- chief financial officer
yeah, that would be correct. we'll see where the markets are in the second quarter and then we'll go from there.
steven alexopoulos -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
ok. so does this imply more on balance sheet loan growth? i mean, should we be gain on sale margins going down? so if we think about year over year roughly 30% growth in the origination. should we be dialing up the long growth expectations for this year?
bj losch -- chief financial officer
yeah. so i think we start with what our outlook is for production, right, which we still feel very strong about. so again, first quarter was very strong record quarter relative to other q1s, our pipelines are very, very strong. not quite at records that we saw at the second half of last year, but pretty close.
and so we're very encouraged by that. so our production outlook still looks pretty strong. and to your point, if we're not selling through to the secondary markets, we do maintain more balance sheet, which will obviously generate more carry income over time. so yeah, i mean, it's kind of nice to have the flexibility that we do with the balance sheet plus, a very liquid secondary market to manage both gain on sale income and interest rate risk.
so we do still feel pretty good about originations at this point.
steven alexopoulos -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
ok, good enough that i think the prior expectation was about $4 billion for 2022. is that still intact, bj?
bj losch -- chief financial officer
yeah, i think we still feel pretty good about that.
steven alexopoulos -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
ok. and then finally, it's interesting with your stock. i think you're more than double my typical bank in terms of short interest. and the thesis has been gain on sale margins are going to collapse as rates rise in the nimble, shrink is rates rise.
and i think you're telling us that yes gain on sale margins are going to shrink a lot in the second quarter. maybe could we at least level set on net interest margin, right, strong starting point, but assuming the fed does go maybe 50 basis points per meeting? can you walk us through where that would take net interest margin to? thanks.
bj losch -- chief financial officer
say that last piece again, steve, if you could.
steven alexopoulos -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
so if the forward curve plays out, let's just say, we get 50 basis points at each of the may and june meetings. where should we expect net interest margin to move to?
bj losch -- chief financial officer
yeah. so i'll start with what i think i said last quarter on the call, when we thought maybe three rate increases were on the horizon for this year. and we thought at that point that we -- that our net interest margin would float down more toward, where we were seeing our core margin at that point, which was the 3.75, 3.80 range. i think with faster rate increases and more rate increases.
i think funding costs go up more quickly than loan yields reprice. and so there's more pressure on that in the near-term. so if rates rise faster, i think we're below that 3.75 range, above 3.50, but below the 3.75 range. and then once rates start to settle out, we start to see more yield and spreads kind of normalize, then we should start to see a steady increase from there.
steven alexopoulos -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
ok. and this is -- i'm sorry i monopolize the call. this will be my last question. and this might be a dumb question, but i'm going to ask it anyway.
so if you look at the industry more broad, the asset sensitive banks, whether it be a zions, comerica, keycorp, huntington, they're all increasing their use of swaps to pull some of the benefit forward, right. so they're doing receive fixed swaps to reduce their level of that sensitivity. why can you guys be on the other side of that exact trade increasing your asset sensitivity?
bj losch -- chief financial officer
yeah. we're looking at different things to do that. it obviously depends on how quickly you think rates are going to rise. but yes, we're looking at different options to be able to capture some of that.
steven alexopoulos -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
ok, thanks for taking my questions.
bj losch -- chief financial officer
thanks, steve.
operator
and our next question is with crispin love of piper sandler. please go ahead. please go ahead.
crispin love -- piper sandler -- analyst
thank you. good morning. so last quarter and also this quarter, you talked about investing back into the business and increasing headcount. but i'm just curious, have you had any recent issues with recruiting new employees, retaining employees, and then just the impact of having to pay up for employees based on huntley's comments? it didn't really seem like you had too much trouble adding, but just would appreciate if there's -- if you have any more color there, any more detail.
renato derraik -- chief information officer
yes. hi, good morning, everyone. this is renato derraik. we are actually seeing the opposite of what people would typically expect.
every single position we're opening in the technology space has a range of 60 to 90 people apply, 6-0 to 9-0, driven by how modern our architecture is, the fashion that people have for the velocity unless bureaucracy. and also by the great culture that the organization brings and the new leaders that we brought into the organization. so we are actually seeing the opposite effect and our organization continues to grow, and we have a very large talented pool of folks that are really interested in live oak to leverage.
crispin love -- piper sandler -- analyst
renato, how many folks have you hired since you -- when did you join exactly? what day?
renato derraik -- chief information officer
yeah. i joined in june, second week of june of last year. we hired 30 -- approximately 30 engineers, leaders in data, technology, cyber across our organization.
crispin love -- piper sandler -- analyst
thank you.
bj losch -- chief financial officer
i think a similar trend across the lending side of the franchise too, we've got a lot of momentum of people that want to be a part of the platform, the culture. and look, we pay competitively and we will have to do that. and that's a fact that everybody is dealing with, we'll continue to be competitive, but we're seeing great, great folks across the franchise right now.
crispin love -- piper sandler -- analyst
all right. thank you. that's all helpful color. and i heard your color on overall production, but i'm just looking to get a little bit more detail on sba.
so sba originations were down sequentially in the quarter, and i think that's likely due to some seasonal aspects of concerning they were up year on year. but curious what your sba origination expectations are for 2022, at least qualitatively sba had a really strong 2021. but would you expect a pullback in sba in 2022, as there were some tailwinds in 2022 that helped 2021 production or just how are you thinking about that.
chip mahan -- chairman and chief executive officer
i'll start huntley or you starting out then i'll point out.
huntley garriott -- president, live oak bank
yeah, look, i think there's a couple of things. i think the -- from a -- we definitely had a tailwind last year in terms of the sba enhancements and those aren't around, so got that. i think we also look as rate rise that does affect the eligible market for some deals that don't cash flow as well in a higher rate environment until prices of acquisitions settle out. so again, you could say there's a couple of headwinds.
at the same time, we continue to see just, i mean, like bj said, our pipelines are at or near records, we're bringing on people. we'll bring on a general lender in a market, who's got a 20-year experience and that person will do $40 million of sba lending for us in a 12 month year. and you think about their ability to do that. we put seven people on the field so far this year, and our ability to do that, we add a couple more verticals.
it feels like we've got a lot of winds still at our backs to offset that, the macro trends of expansion in certain areas and business acquisition continues to be really strong. and we just continue to try to get faster and better at what we do. and i think we're -- we feel really good about where we are.
chip mahan -- chairman and chief executive officer
the only thing i would add to that question would be, you have to bifurcate that, which was ostensibly huntley touched on. you have -- the theory of verticality in 33 verticals and people in your business have typically asked us, what is the organic growth per vertical? doesn't work that way, right? you just can't map that. it's up one year. it's down one year.
that said on the other side and the general side is completely different. that is where the growth is going to come. 100% of the sba lenders in this country have heard of live oak bank. and we are actively attacking probably at least 50 markets.
we're in 20-some-odd markets today. i would be shocked if we didn't have well over 100 lenders in a meaningful short period of time from the 24, what it was on that earlier slide. so we are becoming the platform of choice for these very experienced, not only sound this and profitability and growth and debt service coverage ratio and like you do in analyzing a normal credit, but also in understanding how to architect the deal in lines with the sba guidelines.
huntley garriott -- president, live oak bank
all right. thank you. thanks for taking my questions and for all the color.
chip mahan -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks.
operator
our next question is from michael perito of kbw. please go ahead.
michael perito -- kbw -- analyst
hey, everyone. good morning,
chip mahan -- chairman and chief executive officer
mike.
michael perito -- kbw -- analyst
i wanted to drill down on the operating expense line for a second here. so you guys were at just over $65 million in the first quarter. you -- huntley, you mentioned the $10 million to $15 million of annual kind of investment because of the finxact gain, which some of which was in that run rate. so i mean is it reasonable to add maybe another million or two to that run rate for the to accelerate tech investment and then grow that kind of low-double digits moving forward as you guys continue to hire and grow or would you frame it differently?
chip mahan -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes. i mean i'll start and huntley can give a little bit more color, but two things. one is last quarter, we did talk about what we thought expenses would grow at. and so i kind of said the fourth quarter was kind of a good jumping off point and we had fourth quarter 2020 to fourth quarter 2021, i think it was growth of 25%-ish in salary benefits.
and so i think that that's probably still a good pace for us at this point. it may be a little bit heavier because we're leaning into technology investment because of the finxact gain. so i think that that's still a good number, all the other operating expenses generally growing with inflation. but really the bulk of our expense growth is going to be on the salary and benefit side.
i think the other way to look at this as well, and huntley might give a little bit more color on this, $10 million to $15 million in incremental annual run rate for technology investment that is going to have what we believe large payoff in the future also means that, the core expense line is much lower. it's $10 million to $15 million lower. so if we were simply just running a company for the short-term, we have far less expenses relative to the revenue that we're generating, which obviously would be nice short-term, but we're building something for the long-term. and so this investment we think is absolutely appropriate.
michael perito -- kbw -- analyst
understood. that's helpful. thank you. so -- and then secondly, really appreciate huntley your comments on around platform banking and embedded banking and the business checking and all these initiatives you guys have going on, which seem to be on track.
i guess the question is, when you guys talk about some of the benefits of these initiatives, it would seem to me that that one financial benefit over time would be the ability to have lower deposit data and lower funding costs relative to what historically have performed at. and i guess the question is, is that more of a next cycle benefit at this point though? or do you think some of these initiatives as they launch over the course of this year could grow fast enough where you could see some benefits to the deposit equation toward the middle to latter half of this tightening cycle?
huntley garriott -- president, live oak bank
yes, mike, good question. and obviously, as rates start to go up, the value equation gets larger and more attractive for lowering deposit costs. we talked for a while about our funding costs in a zero interest rate environment was about as good as anybody. and now we have the ability to capture some real value.
i think that what we're doing here in the back half of the year is going to set us up really nicely. and i think that we will see benefit next year in our cost of funds and in our balances, we are working every day toward it. and it's a little bit of a race against the clock here, but we feel really good about where we are. and i do think that in this cycle, we're going to see some impact on our balance sheet.
chip mahan -- chairman and chief executive officer
michael, just a thing though. huntley, i thought you had a good point a minute ago about embedded banking and branch. so if you think about the bank of america, where michael used to work, you sitting across the table, if 5,000 branches took them a hundred years to build 5,000 branches. so we're not -- when you think about the architecture that you have created here, and you think about huntley's earlier comment about plaid and stripe and how fast those companies grew in a developer friendly environment.
maybe take a minute and explain to michael perito what you built from an architectural standpoint and the speed with which it might answer his question.
bj losch -- chief financial officer
yes, absolutely. huntley mentioned briefly about the developer portal and how we're basically structuring our apis so that it's really easy for third parties to integrate more effectively with us. our goal is still to allow engineers and chief technology officers from these organizations that we're partnering with to be able to understand how to connect with us and leverage our services within a period of 30 minutes. that's a quality of the technology architecture that we're putting in place.
so it can lead to an incredible amount of growth has no incremental acquisition costs for the organization.
michael perito -- kbw -- analyst
great. thank you guys for all the color there. and then just lastly, and i'll hop back in the queue. listen, but just on the platform banking, can you guys give us a sense of what that pipeline looks like or are we looking at fintechs that are more likely to be like in your venture investment arm, like early mid-stage, or you guys looking at more larger companies, even broader than fintechs that are looking to offer services or just how do you guys think about that pipeline and the types of opportunities within it? thanks for taking all my questions.
huntley garriott -- president, live oak bank
absolutely. i'll start with this one. look, there is at least one company that's in our ventures investing right now that we're looking at. i think what we started as a framework is, are there ways that we can help small businesses out and are there fintech companies that serve small businesses? and that's a natural extension of what we do.
so there's a body of fintechs out there clearly that are serving small businesses in one way or another. and can we help partner and leverage that, that's not exclusively the case. i think we've been less apt to go after the largest fintech companies in that realm to date and really focus on where maybe we can have a bit more of a strategic relationship, but also drive the economics either on a per unit basis or by generating some low cost funds, etc.
michael perito -- kbw -- analyst
thank you.
operator
and our next question is from jennifer demba of truist securities. please go ahead.
jennifer demba -- truist securities -- analyst
thank you. good morning.
chip mahan -- chairman and chief executive officer
hey, jennifer.
jennifer demba -- truist securities -- analyst
wonder if you could kind of give us some more color on where exactly you are with the embedded banking and the plans for the second half of the year roll out where you are. is it still -- is that product still going to be for vets?
chip mahan -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. we're basically in the process of the building our critical foundation in this quarter. it has to do with the safe and secure way of exchanging communications that that the developer portal that i was just describing. and starting in q3, we're going to basically be putting specific services in our new portal and establishing the initial partnerships with the companies that huntley was describing.
huntley garriott -- president, live oak bank
and jennifer, to your point, the first couple of partnerships and companies that we're -- they're spending a lot of time with are in our traditional vertical. so veterinarian healthcare still the place, there's some others as well, but it would -- will be consistent with, i think what you've heard before in terms of those early pilots and partnerships.
jennifer demba -- truist securities -- analyst
when you move on to other industry verticals after you have the vet product rolled out, how fast will the development -- how much faster do you think the development can go in those subsequent verticals?
chip mahan -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. it can take less than a week for us to board the new partner in the new -- with the new technology foundations that we're creating.
jennifer demba -- truist securities -- analyst
ok. ok. and my other question, most of our questions have been asked, but just curious your asset quality's been terrific. what do you see as the most vulnerable loan buckets as rates go up in terms of below higher...
chip mahan -- chairman and chief executive officer
steve smits [inaudible]
steve smits -- chief credit officer
jennifer, thank you. this is steve smits. first of all, my comment is have pretty good confidence in the health of our portfolio today also really good confidence. and what it looks is going to look like going forward, because at we know our customers very, very well.
so we've always been best-in-class and servicing would continue to be do so, if anything we've gotten even sharper throughout the past two years. so we feel like we have a good i would say less about specific verticals because we really don't see right now any systemic trends to a specific vertical, more about themes that we watch very closely labor market, of course. so we -- every vertical to some degree has some challenges around the labor market that we need to understand. so we're very specific about understanding that with each of our customers and then of course inflation and fuel.
so we have small exposure to businesses that have a heavy reliance on fleet for example, but certainly a few customers that we look at very closely and how they're navigating, how sensitive is their pricing to their end customers, if they can keep up with the inflation pressures. i would say those are the pressures that we look very closely at and however i will say we feel even with the labor market while they're all experiencing some degree of stress. i feel really good that they're navigating quite well. and i don't have really a huge concern that they're not doing the right things and that we're going to be in good shape there.
chip mahan -- chairman and chief executive officer
i would just add to that, jennifer, i mean, this is a blast for me, right? but you think about -- and we were a much smaller company in the last recession. it was wonderful for us. typically, in a year, we'll go to 450 trade shows. if we do have a recession and the credit guys are running the bank, we will continue to stay the course.
i mean yes, an sba lender theoretically is the lender of last resort. and yes, somehow our charge-offs have been one-tenth of every sba lender in the country over the last 13 years. but knowing and understanding the industry and staying in the business, when the credit guys run the bank and the sales guys are sitting at home, throw us in that briar patch, we're ready.

chip mahan -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks, greg, and good morning to all. let's move to slide 4 to kick things off. for today's agenda, i'm going to kick things off with a few overarching comments before repeating our normal quarterly cadence of bj reviewing our financial performance and huntley highlighting our operational priorities. let's move to slide 5.
over the next few slides, we will discuss our mission to extend our nationwide government-guaranteed lending platform and how that effort has led to an all-time high pipeline. as always, we will discuss the quality of our loans and will reflect on this volatile rate environment and its effect on sba loan premiums. clearly, the most recent correction in the capital markets has led to deterioration in the valuation of nascent fintech companies. i am proud to report that live oak ventures investments have continued to thrive and grow and seem to have dodged the downturn at least for now.
huntley and bj will have much to say about the finxact sale to fiserv. i am happy to learn from the fiserv earnings call on tuesday that the company for the second straight call puts finxact's next-gen core processing system at the center of their future strategic plans. let's move to slide 6. this slide highlights the organic growth in our lending business over the past 5.5 years.
the bottom of this slide shows the growth in our vertical sba lending units. in 2018, we added seven new industries. and so far this year, we've added 3, bringing us to 17 in total. on the lending side, we have added 10 new lenders this year that gives us a total of 30 generalists in 27 cities.
this is a new point of emphasis for us. recently, we sent 700 emails to sba lenders at 85 banks. we will approach sba lenders at an additional 25 banks in the next two weeks. if you are an sba lender, there is a 100% chance you've heard of us.
there is a reasonable chance you've heard good things. in the 700-week contact that we currently have a pipeline in various phases of 168 folks, many are happy at their existing bank, and we want to stay in touch. the point is we have built a culture and a technology platform that is scalable in an industry that views sba lending somewhere in between the porter let of the banking business to just a side car to their other small business initiatives. this is what we do.
we want the best lenders to know that we are coming to a town near you. lastly, our pipeline for proposal to close has increased roughly up from $1.5 billion in may of 2020 to a little over $3.1 billion today, again, an all-time high. slide 7. and now for some fun facts as we consistently and forever, concentrate on soundness, profitability and growth in that order.
in the late '80s, one of our banks and another company i started, made their first sba loan. we had to get five declination letters from other banks before we can qualify the loan. we had to prove we were the lender of last resort. even today, the sba has, you cannot find credit elsewhere tests.
as interest rates rise and beating drones of pending recession get louder, we often have to answer the question. are you at the tip of the spear at live oak bank, your customers have no capital, are you worried? let me answer that. no. here are the facts.
on roughly $7 billion in loans, we had $3.4 million of over 30-day past dues or just 9 bps. moving on to worst loans, loans on non-accruals were $16.6 million or 43 bps. that said, of the 16.6% 8.6% or 53% of the total were paying as agreed. i am overwhelmingly proud of our lenders and credit folks who have chosen the right operators and entrepreneurs.
so back to slide 7. in the past 10 years, we have averaged 30 bps of charge-offs, while all other sba lenders report more than 10 times that at 4%. almost half our loan portfolio is guaranteed at 44%, while the rest of the industry holds tight at a rounding error of 3%. the pricing of our loans were considerably better with a net interest margin of just shy of 4%, as you can see, while the rest of the industry was nearly 100 bps lower at just under 3%.
since inception in '08, we have originated $19 billion in loans, two-thirds of which were in the sba 7(a) program. and as you can see, $14 billion or 74% of our $19 billion in originations were loans to small businesses. let's go to slide 8. as mentioned a minute ago, the last 6 months in the capital markets has not been much fun.
we often say around here that capital is king and bj will cover that shortly. he also likes to talk about optionality. i like to talk about different arrows in our quiver. this is the same slide we showed on our ipo road show exactly seven years ago this week.
many investors were unaware of the tiny sba loan sales market. as you can see, the pricing has been incredibly stable the last 22 years, saved the great recession, the pandemic and now. how fortuitous for us that at precisely this point in time, my friend, frank sanchez, decides to sell finxact to fiserv and become their vice chairman. we have said to you many times, the 280 billion lines of code the industry runs on is going to get swapped out in the future to a next-gen cloud-native api-first solutions like finxact.
the fact that he and extensively we will be partnering with a $67 billion market cap brand name is good for live oak bank. frank's subsidiary will operate separately and be supplied the necessary capital to attack the broader market. slide 9. how wonderful for us that the finxact $120 million pre-tax gain mirrors the disruption of the 7(a) premiums decline.
the finxact gain is 1.5x what we raised in our ipo and also exceeds our secondary offering in 2017. the finxact profit equals all of our 7(a) loan sales for the last 14 quarters and exceeds all of our 7(a) and usda loan sales over the last eight quarters. so what did we do or didn't do. we did not sell and what historically seems to be a down market.
bottom left to slide 9 shows what we did in q1. we sold $211 million in paper at a $110 handle generating $20 million gain on sale dollars. this quarter, we could not cherry pick enough to get to $110, but we did sell 50 of 108 generating $4 million in pre-tax earnings. had we chosen to sell $2 million -- $211 million of paper, the best we could have done would have been a $105 handle generating only $12 million earnings.
so let's keep the loans at roughly a 4% spread and generated $7 million in recurring net interest income. we have a long runway to continue to do just this as we wait for the usually predictable 7(a) market to come back to historic norms. and i can't stand it. just before i turn it over to bj and huntley, i want to briefly mention my 14-year torturous relationship with the income statement line item servicing asset revaluation.
i often wonder who i love less, lawyers or accountants. so let me see if i got this right. the accountants tell you that your cost of service alone is 40 bps, then they tell you the average life of the loan is seven years, and you need to take the remaining 60 bps of servicing over the next seven years. and the net present value of that, we take that into income.
but we already got paid in cash for a loan yesterday. then we go to the black box once a quarter and value the accumulation of all our loans added together. after we took the company public, this servicing asset reval number, over three consecutive quarters was one quarter up $5 million, the next quarter flat, down $9 million in the next quarter. we decided to sell less loans and reduce the volatility of reported earnings per share.
this quarter's negative $9 million or $0.16 a share is in the appendix on slide 40. rest assured, we think the $7 million in servicing revenue we receive annually is worth far more than the $28.5 million the beloved accountants say it's worth. bj, over to you.
bj losch -- chief financial officer
all right. thanks, chip. i have a good set up. i don't know if i'm going to be able to deliver the financials nearly as well as chip has did, but good morning, everybody.
we'll start with some highlights on slide 11. our earnings per share, as you saw, were $2.16 driven by both the previously announced finxact gain and strong net interest income and loan growth, both linked quarter and year over year. our net interest margin of 3.89% held up really well in q2 during the beginning of the fed's rate increase cycle, loan production was solid at $960 million. and as chip mentioned, pipelines are at all-time highs.
we continue to be a talent magnet, adding 13 net new lenders in the quarter. and our core business performance along with continued success with our ventures investing continues to add significant tangible book value per share, resulting in a 19% increase from the second quarter of last year. as chip mentioned, though, the current environment is not without its challenges, particularly as it relates to our secondary markets for guaranteed sba sales, which shows up in two primary ways on our income statement. first impact is on our guaranteed sales and gain on sale income.
as we discussed during the first quarter call, we saw secondary market dynamics shifting rapidly. therefore, we telegraphed that we would moderate sales in q2 and we did. our guaranteed sales in the quarter were 70% lower than q1, with the resulting gain on sale income of around $5 million versus $20 million in the first quarter. and as chip mentioned, it's important to understand that this income is not permanently lost.
we are simply going to earn it over time in the form of net interest income, as chip highlighted on slide 9. because of the flexibility we have from both the finxact gain and the ability to hold and fund high-quality assets, we will continue to remain patient with secondary market activities until premiums start to normalize. also related to secondary market dynamics, as chip talked about, our servicing asset reval was very high this quarter at $8 million write-down versus $1.6 million in q1, primarily due to the rapid decline in market premiums. though our servicing asset is a non-cash item, and it's insignificant from a balance sheet perspective at less than 4% of capital, fair value changes do flow through our income statement.
so from here, we expect more modest changes in that fair value for the servicing asset as premiums eventually normalize toward long-term averages. turning to slide 12. you'll see adjusted ppnr was down two to that intentional reduction of guaranteed sales. despite not a strong net interest income growth of 7% linked quarter and lower expense growth of 4% linked quarter, credit remains very healthy with provision up $3 million off a low base.
breaking down the components of revenue on slide 13, you'll see total revenue growth still up 13% year over year despite this quarter's lower gain on sale income, driven by strong loan growth and resulting net interest income, which was up 34% year over year. balance sheet trends look good on slide 14 and 15, with 5% loan growth linked quarter and 7% before loan sales. and as you can see on slide 16, net interest margin held strong in q2 at 3.89% with the decline from q1 largely due to higher liquidity levels. we still expect some compression as the fed continues to raise rates rapidly and funding costs move more quickly than loan pricing, but we are very encouraged by the resiliency of our margin.
turning to expenses on slide 17. we had another strong hiring quarter, adding 49 net new live oakers, majority of which were in our lending groups to support revenue growth. in addition, we continue to attract technology talent, which made up the majority of our hiring outside the lending groups, and huntley will talk a little bit more about both of those in a few minutes. credit trends on slide 18 and 19 look great.
as chip discussed at the beginning of the call, having 45% of your total loan portfolio government guaranteed is both a great comfort and a great responsibility that we take very seriously. non-accruals and past dues remain at historic lows as do net charge-offs. on slide 19, you see just how strong our credit performance is over time with cumulative, not annual cumulative charge-off rates of 29 basis points on small business loans originated since '08, 18 bps and 48 bps on our specialty finance and e&i loans since 2016. on slide 20, you'll see in the upper right, our capital ratios are very strong, particularly with the addition of the finxact proceeds.
note the green 23% bubble we call out on the graph, which is the capital plus the reserve coverage of the unguaranteed portion of our loan portfolio, far higher than other banks. this, plus the $3 billion of highly liquid guaranteed loans on our books give us both balance sheet strength and flexibility new banks can match. to recap, pipelines are strong. we continue to attract talent.
credit quality is excellent. the balance sheet is profitable and growing. expense growth continues, but at a more moderate pace. secondary markets remain in flux and gain on sales, premiums are depressed, and our ventures investments continue to provide us with organic capital and optionality.
with that, i'll turn it over to huntley to give more color on where we are growing and investing. hg?
huntley garriott -- president, live oak bank
thanks, bj. i'll pick up with some highlights on page 22 and turn out to be repetitive. again, a really solid quarter, especially in light of everything going on in the markets and the macro environment. the quarter highlighted with nearly $1 billion of diversified loan origination.
we just continue to find great opportunities to provide capital to small businesses, 5% linked quarter loan growth, 25% year over year. equally as exciting on the deposit side, we saw really strong growth in our business savings product with 18% linked quarter growth over $1.3 billion of business savings accounts. now that product continues to resonate with our small business customers. we also launched our first deposit vertical serving the 1031 exchange market and already have $30 million of deposits there, excited about where that can take us and the ability to expand into other verticals as well.
we've been really cautious in launching our small business checking product. as chip mentioned, this journey with finxact, we want to make sure that this platform is hardened and ready to take on scale. we've got 500 customers on there now, and we're ready to step on the gas. looking forward, we're excited to continue to enhance and grow that small business deposit product, launch our working capital product here in august, expand our embedded banking offering, where we recently went live with our first customer and upgrade our loan origination platform.
so as always, a lot going on around the bank. on page 23, you can see an overview of our loan origination platform. again, great quarter of origination. and as chip and bj mentioned, even more encouraging is that our pipelines have returned to all-time highs after a bit of a slowdown in the first part of the year.
from a mix perspective, on the right-hand side of the page, you'll notice a bit lower proportion of usda lending in the quarter, which is a function of reduced bioenergy production and some funding shortfalls at the usda. but despite our overall pretty cautious outlook on the economy, we remain really optimistic about the second half of the year and beyond. as you've heard chip and bj mentioned, we'll remain vigilant in maintaining our credit quality, but small businesses are proving themselves to be unbelievably resilient. and the overall themes we've highlighted of business transitions and the prudent expansion of great small business operators continues to prove themselves out.
page 24 has the granularity of the loan portfolio and really shows the power of our diversified platform. highlights for the quarter include many of our flagship small business industry verticals like healthcare, veterinarians and investment advisors, along with strength in our middle market lending and the conventional side and our general sba lending team that chip mentioned, which continue to source attractive opportunities across the nation, across a variety of industries. we also continue to find interesting new verticals and are excited about exploring with efforts underway in our departs, managed service providers, law firms and pest control to name a few. as i mentioned, one area we saw muted activity was in our bioenergy group where the combination of rising interest rates, supply chain delays, construction costs, also met specific declines in carbon credit markets.
but the tailwinds in renewable energy overall remain extraordinary, and we still see tremendous opportunity in that space for us. flip to page 25 and a little more information, as chip mentioned, on our sba general lenders, where we hired nine folks in the first half of the year and a couple more in the pipeline and that momentum seems to continue. what we see is that the platform that we've built is really paying dividends. and from an investment perspective, even when we hold loans on balance sheet, on the outside, this is about an 18-month payback for each of these new lenders, but typically much quicker than that.
flipping to 26, a few thoughts on the finxact gain. on the one hand, this gain was a culmination of a bunch of hard work of our teammates and our partners to build this company to where it was and got to. it also provided a non-dilutive capital raise for us that allows us to manage our balance sheet, invest in our team, our community and our technology. but on the other hand, we're just beginning to unlock the value this platform will provide for us and we're as excited as ever about the future.
last quarter, we shared some plans for the proceeds, employee bonus of $7.5 million, a charitable donation into a foundation of $5 million. and we said that our goal was to reinvest in the technology about $10 million to $15 million. we're doing that primarily through hiring where we've hired about 20 new folks in our technology team year-to-date, which accounted for almost half of our increase in the adjusted earnings quarter over quarter. and we plan to hire about 25 more people to complete the build-out that we referenced of this technology team.
when you include all these people and a little bit of professional services, that will add about $7 million to $8 million annually run rate to our expense base. and the way we look at this is it finxact gain allowed us to pull forward this hiring by about two years to accelerate the delivery of our road map. all in all, our technology spend in the quarter was about 14% of our adjusted non-interest expense, which for a bank without branch distribution network, feels pretty reasonable. so importantly, what are we building with all this technology and the platform.
on the lending side, we're enhancing our loan origination platform to better serve our customers, to increase our speed to close and to allow us to make smaller balance loans more efficiently. but the majority of our efforts remain focused on building primary operating relationships with small businesses to generate low cost deposits. while our consumer and small business savings products continue to be well received, we know the importance of driving down our funding costs through non-interest-bearing deposits. after a long journey, our small business checking account is finally ready for the mass market.
and by the end of the year, we'll have an enhanced operating account with treasury management features for our larger clients, a working capital loan product, additional deposit verticals and additional embedded banking partnerships. and for many of you, this will be unpopular that's taken this long, and we've been talking about this, but we remain committed to building out this technology stack the right way and to do that has been a journey and that's taken time. we really believe that we're setting ourselves up for a massive increase in velocity and a future proof of this company for the next decade of technology innovation. so in addition to the finxact gain, you can look at our ventures activities on page 27.
we followed on investing in apiture and defensestorm along with two exciting new opportunities that we invested in, which are both great stand-alone investments but also provide us opportunities in the embedded banking space. as chip mentioned, it's not lost on us that valuations have reset in the technology market broadly and in fintech. we feel really comfortable with the strength of our portfolio. likewise, the canapi portfolio, which we included in the appendix on page 39, continues to perform well.
and with that second fund coming online, we're excited about the opportunity to invest there at more reasonable valuations. the flip side of the fintech market reset is that many of our challenger banks that we've been competing with lately have witnessed increasing the cost of capital, availability of capital and need to demonstrate their profitability, which has forced them to adjust their business models. for us, with a rock solid balance sheet, profitable core business, we can remain consistent in our mission and our technology road map. four years ago, we made the decision to begin to hold more loans on balance sheet, a move that insulated us from the capital markets dislocation like we saw during the pandemic and that we're seeing now.
and we know that shift to hold more loans adjust the trajectory of our reported eps, but we feel it's absolutely the right decision for us and for our shareholders. and we also know we have other elements of volatility in our earnings, as chip mentioned, servicing assets and our technology investing. but those we accept as well in our effort to build this uniquely differentiated model and one that has and will continue to deliver exceptional returns for shareholders. the model and the finxact gain has allowed us to generate earnings and capital to grow our business in a non-dilutive way and sets us up for continued growth and profitability.
despite these moving pieces in the quarter, our mission remains unchanged to be america small business bank. to do that, we have to continue to assemble the best folks across banking and technology who are dedicated to treating every customer like the only customer. we'll leverage our next-generation technology stack to create products and solutions that better serve these customers, which in turn helps attract and retain and motivate our folks. and at the end of the day, it all comes down to serving our small business customers and the dedication of our folks to do that.
so with that, chip, any words or we'll open up the questions.
chip mahan -- chairman and chief executive officer
let's go to q&a.
",":
operator
[operator instructions] our first question comes from the line of steven alexopoulos from j.p. morgan. your line is now open.
steve alexopoulos -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
hey. good morning, everyone. 
chip mahan -- chairman and chief executive officer
good morning, steve.
bj losch -- chief financial officer
hi, steve.
steve alexopoulos -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
i wanted to start on the deposit side, i saw online, you guys are offering a pretty wide range in terms of rates, one and a half to three on cds, 1.4 on business savings. what's the blended spot rate on new deposit dollars coming in today? and how quick could your current deposit costs reset to market rates?
bj losch -- chief financial officer
yeah, i'm happy to start. the bulk of our activity is in savings and on the shorter end of the cd curve. there really is not a lot of activity, the sort of the longer duration cds that are more in that high 2%, 3%. really, there's just not a lot of activity.
so you should think of the bulk of our money coming in today in that 1.4 and then some of the cds in the high one sort of rate, and that's really where the bulk of our growth is coming from in terms of the market-based products that we're growing with.
huntley garriott -- president, live oak bank
steve, that will continue to increase, obviously, right? so our savings beta, you can assume is more in the $70 range with each move. so we'll continue to be competitive from that perspective and it will continue to go up. but on the flip side, we've got 5% of our loans variable rate quarterly adjusting. so as prime continues to go up, we will benefit from that as well.
so there's a little bit of a timing issue as we manage our margin. but with the 3.89% this quarter, that held up pretty well and we're pretty encouraged by that.
steve alexopoulos -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
ok. so bj, if we follow that through. previously, you talked about a nim in the 3.50%, 3.75% range, i think you pointed to the lower end. is that still -- is that guidance still intact? and i think that was by the fourth quarter?
bj losch -- chief financial officer
yes. i think i'll stick to that. but i am more optimistic that we'll be toward the higher end than the lower end now that we've seen in the second quarter.
steve alexopoulos -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
got you. ok, that's helpful. and then shifting to the loan side. so over the last two quarters, average loans held for investment have increased about a mid-teens annualized pace.
is this what we should expect is reasonable for the next few quarters?
bj losch -- chief financial officer
yeah, at least in the near term, steve, and it's related to us intentionally holding more on the balance sheet. so even though those -- we're holding those guaranteed loan sales, we're going to held them -- hold them, excuse me, for sale in case the market does come back, and we decide to sell into the secondary market.
steve alexopoulos -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
ok. and then final question. in terms of the secondary market for sba, what's the backdrop where the secondary market should resume more normal operations? thanks.
huntley garriott -- president, live oak bank
yeah, so there's a couple of different dynamics going on right now, right? one is, obviously, there's very little fixed -- adjusting or fixed demand out in the marketplace for various reasons because of how quickly funding costs are going up relative to yields. there are less buyers in the marketplace for fixed rate or fixed adjusting product. and there are some other alternative investments that have similar terms that are more attractive right now because of secondary market dislocation, things like agencies or treasuries, etc., that normally don't compete very well from a yield perspective with sba. so as that kind of washes through, we think that, as chip highlighted at the beginning, we've historically seen dislocations anywhere from two months to nine months.
and we've got the balance sheet and the liquidity to weight it out. so we'll just -- we'll do that and resume our sales when appropriate and when we think we get paid for it.
steve alexopoulos -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
got you. ok, thanks for taking all my questions.
operator
and your next question comes from the line of crispin love from piper sandler. your line is now open.
crispin love -- piper sandler -- analyst
thank you. good morning. and i actually have a follow-up on the loan sales, kind of similar to the previous question. but the way that kind of thinking about it for the third quarter, i guess if i'm looking at the second quarter loan sales, the guaranteed volume sold as a percent of total originations was around 7%.
as you're looking at the third quarter, would you think that should be somewhere in the 7% to 10% range compared to kind of recent levels, it kind of historically in kind of the mid to high teens. i'm just trying to get a little bit of a finer point of how you're thinking about loan sales in the third quarter.
bj losch -- chief financial officer
hey, crispin. it's bj. so short answer is, again, it's hard to say. we've said a couple of different ways that we're going to be patient that we're not going to just sell into a core market and take a discount on paper that we think is much more valuable to carry.
with that said, we're hopeful that premiums are bouncing around the bottom here, particularly on variable rate product. fixed is a little bit more finicky for the reasons that i just talked through. but we're optimistic that whether it's next quarter or whether it's fourth quarter, we start to see a little bit of normalization back toward acceptable premiums, in which case we'll again get more active.
crispin love -- piper sandler -- analyst
all right. thank you, guys. that's helpful color there. and then just one on the pipeline, it seems like the pipeline is very strong based on your commentary during the prepared remarks in the call.
i appreciate if you could just provide a little bit more detail there. like where do you see the majority of the activity coming from to kind of drive those really strong pipelines? and then relatedly, do you still feel confident in that $4 billion plus origination target for the full year?
huntley garriott -- president, live oak bank
sure, crispin. it's huntley. and i'll kick off. it's pretty broad, i would say, the small business pipelines have been pretty consistent dipped a little in the beginning of the year, starting to see more in the way of business acquisitions where i think when capital markets sort of earlier in the year really started to move, rates started to move, buyers and sellers had a hard time figuring out pricing.
and so they took a pause and we saw that through the first part of the year. and we're starting to see a bit more transactions finding the mark there. so really starting to see that. across our specialty finance, the middle market or the lower end of the middle market companies to $8 million or $10 million of ebitda with some institutional capital behind them.
just some really interesting opportunities there, reasonably low leverage. it feels like a space that we've got a lot of opportunity. so those are probably the areas where the pipeline is most active, but it's pretty widespread. i mean i think the business activity still, despite all the headlines, feels pretty good on our end.
in terms of the -- that $4 billion number, i think the back half of the year looks pretty solid. if we continue at this pace, we should be wrapped around that number, plus or minus a little bit from what we see right now.
chip mahan -- chairman and chief executive officer
i'd just add to that, as i'm looking at whatever slide micah has got up here different verticals that we're in, it's very flattering to us that when we publish things like this on a call, it just seems that other banks show up at the verticals that we just attacked. so that's all kind of fine. that said, last week, we had an all-hands meeting. so we have 700-plus people here in wilmington, and i had the glorious time to spend with what we call our generals, those 30 lenders in 27 cities.
and to say that maybe some of this going on has affected silver tsunami is probably accurate. those guys in galls basically said in the last couple of months of the last 6 weeks or so, the phone seem to be ringing off the hook. and again, those are mainly business acquisitions and their referral sources. so i agree with huntley said.
i mean i think that the second half will be pretty good. remember, too, that relative you're comparing originations year over year that we lost the subsidies last september, right, bj?
bj losch -- chief financial officer
september 30.
chip mahan -- chairman and chief executive officer
so a lot of that growth last year through september was due to the sba subsidy. so trying to match that year over year. it's been somewhat difficult, but we're on a roll.
crispin love -- piper sandler -- analyst
great. thank you for answering my questions.

so question on expenses. huntley, you said you're looking at $7 million to $8 million more in expenses from 25 more tech hires you're going to make this year. can you give us a little bit more detail on where you think expenses could go in the second half of the year when you incorporate whatever lending and support hires you might make?
huntley garriott -- president, live oak bank
yeah, i will say, jennifer, just that number. there's about $600,000 in the quarter, so call it $2.5 million of run rate of that $7 million to $8 million is already in the numbers you see now. so the incremental from there is more like four and a half or five. so just to give you of the incremental technology that we're thinking.
i don't know, bj, do you want to talk about sort of the broader in terms of people. i mean, really, we'll continue to add lenders and technology in the numbers that were talked about, but i think the headcount growth will really start to flatten from here outside of that. those are the two areas. if we find great lenders with a short payback put them on the field.
yes, they are support to that in terms of underwriting, closing, etc. the technology squads that are going to be hands on keyboards, delivering products and features that have real returns in the market. and then i think the overall headcount is going to slow down the growth outside of that pretty dramatically from here.
bj losch -- chief financial officer
yeah. and i would just add that if you look at slide 17, it really is helpful to look at the adjusted expenses linked quarter, up 4%, but up 32% from last year. so what does that mean? it means that our expense growth trajectory is moderating. and that is in line with what we've been talking about the last couple of quarters.
we said that the end of 2021, we were playing catch-up, particularly as it related to lender and lender support, underwriters, closers, servicing in our business analyst group, etc., to keep up with the big step up in our production. and then we shifted a little bit more of our focus this year toward, again, lender expansion as well as pulling up that technology investment that huntley talked about. so we kind of went through a bubble in the second half of last year and the first half of this year. so i do expect that our expense growth will moderate from what you've seen over the last year.
and over time, we're just not investing in technology talent to invest in technology. those investments are going to have a significant return for us over time as we build out our title operating account, our cash management and treasury management capabilities for the larger end of our customer set for our embedded banking and they have multiple partnerships that are coming online toward the end of this year and into next. so there's a lot more revenue coming behind that technology investment that we'll start to see in 2023 and beyond.
jennifer demba -- truist securities -- analyst
great. question on the business checking. you said it's ready for prime time now. so can you talk about how you're marketing that product? how you incent the employees to sell it?
bj losch -- chief financial officer
sure. we've got micah davis, our chief marketing officer here, who can jump in and start on that one. 
micah davis -- chief marketing and communications officer
yes. thanks for the question, jennifer. so we're right now just starting very small. we've been primarily focused in the carolinas, and we're expanding across the country in various specific markets that coincide with where our general teams are and where we have strong presence in some of our verticals.
so relative to our teams, sellers and our lenders talking about title checking, that will happen over the next, call it, 6 months. and then we will be significantly investing in the digital marketing side to expand our presence there.
jennifer demba -- truist securities -- analyst
thanks so much.

chip mahan
thanks, greg, and good morning all. i will kick off today's earnings call describing how we think about capital and a potentially declining economy, followed by bj on results, and we'll close with huntley describing how we operate the business and where we are going. let's move to the next slide. here are some household names indicating a recession may be around the corner.
bezos says batten down the hatches. goldman's ceo says there's a good chance for a recession. and jamie dimon says, a recession is likely in the next six to nine months. next slide.
certainly, the world is not coming to an end. it is our belief that capital is king in any environment. therefore, a properly managed balance sheet yields a flight to quality for our customers, our folks and you, our shareholders. none of us has a crystal ball.
there is little doubt that uncertainty is everywhere from runaway inflation to higher interest rates to an unsettling political environment, and we could go on and on. the truth is we operate one of the most highly leveraged, highly regulated businesses on the planet. in the baseball business, batting 400 gets you to in the hall of fame. making 60% of your shots in basketball does the same thing.
in our business, making good loans over 99% of the time is essential. let's talk about recessions on the next slide. reflecting on the recessions that i have lived through, one glaringly comes to mind, and that is the third from the bottom, the recession in the early 2000s. i had started an internet banking software company in the late '90s, and i was sitting on the runway at atlanta's hartsfield airport, enroute to meet with the senior management team at the abn amro bank in amsterdam.
we were no. 25 for takeoff. my company's market cap was higher than delta's, and we were losing $60 million a year. how could that possibly be? i met with the abn amro team at the airport for an hour, took the same plane back to atlanta and called an emergency board meeting.
in the next several weeks, we raised over $300 million from our customers that were using our software and not from wall street, then the dotcom crash. without that capital, i'm not sure the company would have survived. recessions provide lessons learned. we are often asked how will your small business customers handle the downturn? how will your origination engine operate? if the past is a proxy for the future, how have we managed your balance sheet these past 14 years? let's take a look at that on the next slide.
organic growth in our equity account is accelerating. so let me unpack this slide for you a bit. if you'll follow the blue boxes above the timeline, you can see that since inception, we have grown considerably while absorbing little dilution. the bank was capitalized in 2008 with $13 million.
shortly thereafter, we issued $5 million in preferred stock, followed by the sale of 24.9% of the business in 2014 to wellington asset management, while we converted from an s to a c corp. a $50 million dividend was paid to the original shareholders, thereby recouping their original investment plus some. we then took the company public in the summer of 2015 and completed a secondary offering in the fall of '17. along the way, we created encino and spun off its 65% ownership in the early days to existing shareholders.
from inception, we have raised $243 million, and the shareholders' equity at the end of q3 was a little over $800 million. note the blue line from our fintech investments had a great deal to do with our non-dilutive capital generation. so let's examine that on the next slide. here's a bit more color on our fintech profits.
since 2015, we have invested $52 million in all companies noted above. we have received $163 million in cash from the exits of finxact and payrails and the sale of $15 million of greenlight shares at a cost basis of $1 million. in addition, the value of all other private companies totaled $158 million based on the last round of financing. we are confident of investor support at those levels, notwithstanding current market conditions.
moving on to the next slide. just as we did last quarter, we would like to reiterate just how good we are at lending to small businesses. the average charge-off ratio for other sba lenders is over 13x hours, while 66% of the $20 billion in loans we have originated since inception have been within the sba 7(a) program. so if we have proven that we can grow the business organically in a unique way, are there other arrows in our quiver, if economic challenges arrive? let's move to the capital side.
the conservative nature of this slide goes beyond the tier 1 capital ratio of 13.2%. our adjusted capital ratio, which equals tier 1 capital plus allowance for credit losses plus the fair value mark divided by our unguaranteed loan exposure equals an unprecedented 22.9%. the addition of implied pre-tax value of fintech investments mark-to-market adds another $158 million to the frenzy. while sba premiums have declined, our mark-to-market profit on our guaranteed portfolio has historically been in excess of $100 million.
excess capital is freedom and flexibility. let's move to the continuum cycle. next slide. so what does all this mean? first of all, there is no evidence of a recession yet, we are loitering in the first column.
if the downturn occurs and credit losses begin, bank credit officers typically react and underwriting guidelines change dramatically. this has always created an enormous opportunity for us to not only stand by our existing customers but allows us to actively seek new opportunities as the competition pulls back. again, if any of this occurs, there will be a flight to quality, and we will be in the thick of it. bj, let's talk results.
bj losch -- chief financial officer
excellent. thanks, chip. good morning, everybody. we'll start with quarter highlights on slide 13.
as you can see, our earnings per share were $0.96, driven by strong net interest income and loan growth, which we'll talk about a little bit more. and of course, the previously announced payrail gain. net interest margin of $3.84 held up very well again in the quarter, declining just five basis points from the second quarter despite 150 basis points of rate hikes during the third quarter. our net interest income growth, you'll see is up 26% year over year on 23% loan growth.
loan production, again, changed $1 billion and pipelines are still near all-time highs and credit quality remains quite strong despite the uncertainty of the economic outlook. our core business performance, along with continued success with our ventures investing, as chip highlighted, continues to add significant tangible book value per share at 15% year over year. turning to slide 14. you see our adjusted results and the notable items that make up those adjustments.
the biggest which, of course, is the payrails gain. another one i'll quickly highlight is the renewable energy tax credit impairment as we've had a few of these over the last several quarters. these investments are a good thing and a net positive. when we make these investments, the accounting treatment is to impair a substantial portion of it immediately, which flows through the expense line.
this is more than offset by a larger reduction to our tax expense and effective tax rate over the course of the same year. that is why we adjust out the expense when looking at adjusted ppnr or pre-tax earnings and also while our effective tax rate is lower than statutory rates. we'll continue to have more of these investments from time to time, including one in the fourth quarter that we currently estimate to be about $12 million. adjusted ppnr was up 21% due to strong net interest income growth of 5% linked quarter and higher fee income driven by $9 million of gain on sale income versus $5 million in q2, which more than offset continued investment in people and technology.
as i said earlier, credit remains quite healthy. while our allowance for credit loss reserve coverage stayed steady overall at 123 basis points, net charge-offs were actually lower in the quarter to only $1.7 million. provision was up quarter-to-quarter due to strong loan growth, along with portfolio and macroeconomic changes as we proactively look ahead to a potentially less benign credit environment. breaking down the components of revenue on slide 15.
you'll see total revenue growth up 12% year over year despite significantly lower gain on sale income, thanks to 26% year over year growth in net interest income. as we discussed on last quarter's call, we've seen secondary market dynamics for guaranteed level sales shifting rapidly due to the current aggressive fed rate tightening cycle. as you know, we moderated sales in the second quarter. and this quarter, we saw modestly better opportunities in sba variable rate sales, but the market for fixed rate sales remains unattractive.
again, it's important to understand that this income is not permanently lost. we simply earn it over time in the form of spread income as evidenced by our strong loan and net interest income growth. because of the flexibility we have with strong capital and liquidity levels, we are more than happy to hold more high-quality assets and will remain patient with secondary market sales until further normalization. turning to slide 16.
you'll see our loan originations remain diverse across our multiple verticals with particular strength in both some of our most established small business verticals such as vets, investment advisors and agriculture and in some newer verticals such as our sba general lending group and our middle-market sponsor finance group. in energy & infrastructure, solar remains quite strong, and while bioenergy lending is down from last year, both of these should benefit significantly going forward due to the clean energy incentives in the recently passed inflation reduction act. balance sheet trends look great as discussed on slide 17 and 18. and as you can see on slide 19, and as i mentioned earlier, the net interest margin again held strong at 384.
and while we still expect some compression as the fed continues to raise rates rapidly, we continue to be encouraged by the resiliency of the margin. our lenders have done a great job adjusting loan pricing upwards with market funding costs, and our deposits team has continued to fund our growth with disciplined yet competitive pricing with betas remaining just under our assumed range of 70%. turning to expenses on slide 20. we've been incredibly pleased with the quality of talent that has joined live oak in our various groups across the company.
going forward, while our need for talent will continue as we grow, we've largely worked through our hiring bubble to rightsize our lender support to accommodate our significant step-up in production post pandemic. and in addition, as we have discussed, we accelerated our technology hiring this year, thanks to the finxact gain. that is also largely complete. going forward, we will continue to be opportunistic on hiring, particularly for revenue producers but we expect to see our expense growth moderate into 2023.
credit trends, as i discussed on slide 21 look great, having 43% of your total loan portfolio government guaranteed is both a great comfort and a great responsibility that we take very seriously. nonaccruals and past dues remain at historic lows, as do net charge-offs. but we know there's clouds on the horizon. so we'll continue to be proactive with our outreach to existing customers.
we have strict well-established concentration limits for higher risk portfolios and verticals, and we're doing stress testing on those portfolios with various recession scenarios to anticipate impacts. set a recap, production top to billion, pipelines are strong. balance sheet is profitable and growing. guaranteed loan sales opportunities are modestly improved, but still muted.
expense growth is moderating, credit quality is great, and our ventures investments have and should continue to provide us with organic capital and optionality. so with that, i'll turn it over to huntley for some additional color on the business.
huntley garriott -- president, live oak bank
 thanks, bj. i'm going to wrap up today by focusing on three questions. the first is how our small businesses are doing overall. the second is what's the opportunity for us at live oak to serve them.
and then, third, what are we doing to address that? we get a lot of questions about the overall health of small business given where we sit. and three years ago, we started a quarterly survey of small businesses, along with barlow associates. its one of the preeminent research firms serving small businesses. and we wanted to share a bit of information from their most recent survey to give you a sense of how small businesses are feeling, but also it indicates some of the opportunities that we have to serve them.
people say that we're at the tip of the spear as it relates to small business in america. and if that's the case, so far, small businesses are waging a pretty impressive battle. so on page 23, you can see the overall sentiment certainly has deteriorated, which shouldn't come as any surprise. although interestingly, it looks as if views on the economy may have bottomed out recently, although they still remain decidedly negative.
expectations of the financial performance of companies have also deteriorated but remain more positive than views of the overall economy. it's clear that the majority of small businesses expect a slowdown and are positioning themselves for a weakening economy. and that's still in contrast, as chip and bj referenced, with our current credit performance, which remains outstanding. looking at the right-hand side of this page, we see that only 20% of the surveyed small businesses applied for credit in the past year.
and if you drill down a layer deeper into that data, you'll see that the majority of those that applied apply for working capital, not the growth capital that we typically provide. so the opportunity for us to serve small businesses with working capital products and deposits can dramatically expand our addressable market. you've likely heard the term 'silver tsunami' to reference the generational shift among small business owners occurring in the u.s. on the bottom right, you can see that almost one-third of small business owners expect to transition ownership of their company in the next five years.
these change of control transactions are right in our wheelhouse, both for lending, but also an opportunity to change primary banking relationships. and while the uncertainty in the economy and volatility in the market has put some of these transactions on hold, we believe the overall macro trend of small business acquisitions will continue to provide us significant opportunities. anecdotally, across our portfolio, we hear a consistent set of concerns, labor markets, inflation, supply chain being at the top of the list. and while we see overall sentiment more cautiously, we also witness every day the resiliency and entrepreneurial spirit of our small business owners as they navigate this cycle.
so what's the opportunity for us? turning to page 24. the sba data says there's 32 million small businesses in the u.s. but we know the majority of these are very small solopreneur businesses. we look at our primary market as the roughly 6 million small businesses in the u.s.
that have between 200 and 500 employees, which generate, on average, $100,000 to $10 million of revenue each. currently, across our small business lending, our savings and our new checking businesses, we serve about 17,000 small business customers. so you can see our market share is pretty tiny. and if you add to that, very few of our customers, who we actually have multiple products with, are repeat customers.
and you can see that despite being pretty good at what we do, we still have a lot of runway to better serve small businesses and deepen these relationships. so what are we doing to address this? on slide 25, first and foremost, we continue to invest in our lending franchise. over 15 years, we've built a small business lending platform that effectively marries great people and great technology, and we continue to work to improve that every day. you've seen over the last year, expense growth related to hiring, not only in new lenders but also in folks needed to support the process.
and while we still will be opportunistic on new hires, we're in a really good place overall. and you can see the production numbers and our pipelines reflect that. you'll also see that headcount and expense growth, as bj mentioned, are going to slow down into next year. we're also in the process of finalizing the migration to a new loan origination platform, still leveraging salesforce and ncino, but with some pretty high-powered enhancements that we've built in-house.
the new platform is designed to further reduce application to funding cycle time, improve efficiency and deliver a best-in-class portal for our customers and partners. we're already observing some enhancements in key areas, and we're excited about what we can accomplish on modern architecture. the timing of this couldn't be better as it allows us to better react to potential changes in the sba programs that are being contemplated. turning to the deposit side.
we're particularly excited about the success we've had generating business savings in cds. with over 10,000 customers now and over $1.8 billion in deposits, it's becoming an increasingly important part of our funding at almost 30% of our total deposits, but also a critical component of our customer acquisition strategy. as we introduce more products and services, we have a growing base of customers to better serve. so the wait is finally over.
we officially have a checking account in the market. this product offers balance protection, improved account funding, next-gen bill pay and quickbooks integration among other features. and our marketing efforts have really just started, but we're seeing, on average, 40 to 50 new accounts a day, and we currently sit at over 1,300 accounts and about $10 million in balances. so we're off to a good start.
while this product serves a smaller end of the small business market, our next milestone is to deliver a treasury management product, which we expect in q1, that will allow us to serve the upper end of our customer base as well. we're also excited about the start of our first specialty deposit vertical, serving 1031 exchanges, and we ended the quarter with about $60 million in checking balances, and we're actually close to $100 million already as we move into the fourth quarter. so a couple of big wins on the technology front, but we're certainly not slowing down, bringing our entire platform together on modern architecture anchored by our modern finxact core remains our top priority. we believe that will open up incredible opportunities for us in areas like embedded banking, customer insights and payments.
in the short term, we'll continue to deliver treasury management capabilities, working capital solutions and our initial embedded banking partnerships. so where does that leave us. on page 26, i think bj summed this up well. our lending platform is solid.
credit quality is excellent, although we remain vigilant and are certainly not declaring victory. secondary markets are strong enough to support our balance sheet. we remain a premier destination to work in both banking and in financial technology. deposit businesses are starting to yield tangible results, and we remain confident in our technology strategy, both on the investing and the software development front as we continue to build the small business bank in the future.
so with that, let's move to questions.
",":
operator
[operator instructions] please stand by while we compile the q&a roster. our first question comes from the line of stephen alexopoulos of j.p. morgan. your line is open, steven.
steven alexopoulos -- jpmorgan chase and company -- analyst
hey, good morning, everyone. i want to start first on the cost of deposits. if we look at the cost of interest-bearing deposits, it is around 1.5% in the quarter. if we look at your online rates, it looks like it's between 2.75%, 3.75%.
so first, how quick does the overall cost of interest-bearing deposits move into that range? and do you expect more incremental funding to come from the online savings, right, which is the lower end, or more from cds, which is the upper end?
bj losch -- chief financial officer
steve, it's bj. so, our team has really done a great job managing deposit rates up through this point. it started off slow in terms of beta as we all would have imagined, but it's significantly heated up probably in the last four quarters. what helped in terms of our overall deposit costs, both last quarter and this quarter is that a lot of the big moves in rates from the fed happened toward the latter part of the quarter, which meant that there wasn't nearly as big of an impact on the overall portfolio in the quarter as you would have expected.
i think now with the fed moving earlier in the quarter, going into the fourth, as well as what they did in the third, you're going to start to see our portfolio costs move more toward where our spot rates are today. in terms of the mix, we still believe that savings is really where we're seeing most of the volume. we have had and tried some attractive offers more in the 12 to 24 month range on the cd side, but there just hasn't been a lot of appetite for that, given how rapidly online savings rates have been going up. so we certainly expect deposit cost to continue to rise, but on the left side of the balance sheet, loan yields, we are very, very pleased with what our lending officers have been able to do to adjust quickly.
we're seeing loan yields really start to move. october 1st was a big deal for us because that's when our quarterly adjusting loans, of which we have quite a bit, adjust up 150 basis points. so our loan yields are keeping up with our deposit costs growing, and that's why we've been able to do such a good job on holding the net interest margin, and we expect that to continue.
steven alexopoulos -- jpmorgan chase and company -- analyst
so bj, if we stay with that, previously, we talked about on these calls, 350, 375 nim for the fourth quarter. how are you trending in that range? and can you frame for us what 2023 could look like? where could nim bottom?
bj losch -- chief financial officer
yes. so as we said last quarter, i expect it more to be at the higher end of the range. i still feel very good about that based on, again, what i just talked about a little bit. as rates -- as the fed stops, its tightening cycle or at least slows it down significantly, we think that our net interest margin starts to stabilize as well.
and again, because we're cycling through and readjusting our loan yields, in particular, to the market and funding costs, we think the margin stabilizes into 2023, depending on when the fed stops raising rates, we could start to see it modestly moving up again.
steven alexopoulos -- jpmorgan chase and company -- analyst
got you. ok. and then, finally for me on the expenses, just following up on that slide indicating that spending requirements are moderating a bit. i mean, the growth rate has been very elevated on expenses.
can you help us think about what's a reasonable growth rate of expenses from here?
bj losch -- chief financial officer
yes. so if you look at adjusted expenses up 30% year over year because of our bubble. i think that should come down by at least 25%, if not more, in terms of the rate of growth. and so, we still see very healthy revenue growth, both from net interest income, as we just talked about.
but then into 2023, starting to see further normalization on the gain on sale. so strong revenue is far outpacing the expense, but the expense will moderate.
steven alexopoulos -- jpmorgan chase and company -- analyst
ok. thanks for taking my questions.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of crispin love of piper sandler. your line is open, crispin love.
crispin love -- piper sandler -- analyst
thanks. good morning, everyone.first, on the venture portfolio. you've had some nice exits from m&a year-to-date. but i'm just curious how you're looking at the full portfolio.
chip, you made some comments earlier in the call to make it seem like you're confident in the current valuation there. so i'm just curious for the key reasons for that as vc-backed companies broadly are seeing lower valuations and less activity there?
chip mahan
so neil underwood has joined us on the call and neil just got back from money 2020 for four days' worth of what is the current state of the fintech business. i think my comments, neil, to turn this over to you, are more about how well we know these companies, how will we know the other investors on those boards and how they seem to be, at least from my perspective, recently, very supportive of the current, and some of these valuations are as much as a year old. so why don't you take that and maybe say a word about the future.
neil underwood -- president, live oak bancshares
sure. first of all, the reason we were out there, as you guys know, canopy and live oak ventures or two of our investment vehicles and filling the top of funnel for live oak ventures is equally as important to -- as looking at expanding canopy. and so, when you look at live oak ventures, i think chip nailed it, it's really the quality of the investors around the table and the timing for which we got into these investments. many of these investments we've gotten into many, many years ago.
and the last valuations can actually stand up. clearly, there has been a discount across the board on mostly, what we see are mostly of the b2c, the heavy, heavy discounts. if you recall, our strategy is around b2b selling to banks, bank infrastructure, payments, tech and so forth, which has held up pretty strong from a revenue perspective and a growth perspective.
crispin love -- piper sandler -- analyst
thanks, chip and neil. i appreciate the color there. and then, just one more on the interest-bearing deposits. bj, are you able to give any color on what spot rates currently are for deposits?
bj losch -- chief financial officer
you mean just what savings rates are and those types of things.
crispin love -- piper sandler -- analyst
yes, exactly. kind of like what you're seeing right now.
bj losch -- chief financial officer
yes. so really, where we're at in terms of online deposit rates for savings is more in the 2.25% range is what we're seeing for the more established online banks moving up pretty quickly. i think today, actually, it's higher after our recent moves. so it's 2.75% today, apy, and that's kind of where some of the largest online players are and one-year cd rates more in the 3.75% range.
crispin love -- piper sandler -- analyst
all right. thank you. i appreciate you taking my questions.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from michael perito of kbw. your line is open.
michael perito -- keefe, bruyette and woods -- analyst
hey, good morning. thanks for taking my questions. i wanted to start on the business second launch. so the customers are already up to 1,300.
it sounds like from the 70, 75 at the end of the quarter. i mean, do you guys have a sense of like what the average balances on these deposits that are coming over as we try to type of frame a growth opportunity here over a realistic time period?
huntley garriott -- president, live oak bank
yes, mike, sure. so we've got about $10 million in balance across 1,300 accounts. so they're in the $5,000 to $10,000. the majority of them are in the $5,000 to $10,000 range.
so like we said, the smaller end of small business right now. and that's what we're seeing. i think as we go to market, ideally start to push up a bit with that. but like we said on the call, this product doesn't have the treasury management capabilities some of the largest small businesses need, and we'll be coming at that end of the market in the first quarter, which we think is where we'll get to some of the more significant balances in the market.
michael perito -- keefe, bruyette and woods -- analyst
did the marketing like kind of branding and sales effort need to change at all as you try to make that transition? or is it pretty consistent across both customer bases, it's more just the product capability that needs to evolve as you target the bigger businesses.
huntley garriott -- president, live oak bank
yes. i mean, look, the marketing itself is pretty consistent across our brand and who we serve. in certain verticals, we'll be able to go a lot deeper with a broader product set and do some more targeted marketing and sort of building out these community banks in some of these verticals that we've spoken of. what we have now is a more, call it, a mass market, small business product, and we're kind of marketing that accordingly.
michael perito -- keefe, bruyette and woods -- analyst
ok. and then, the 1031 exchange balances, the $60 million, are there any other verticals that could become upsize that are on your radar that you can share with us at this point? and then just secondly, kind of as a backup to that, just on the embedded finance side. any timing updates on whenn you think those numbers could start to really maybe impact the nim and the financials a bit more, the growth opportunity there, rather?
huntley garriott -- president, live oak bank
sure. so on the specialty deposit side, we are looking at a handful of them. the hoa space is one that we spend a fair amount of time on. and i think it's obviously a reasonably competitive marketplace but trying to figure out exactly where our niche could be and where we can differentiate ourselves and have some ideas there, we've been spending some time on.
so that's probably the one that's the next, the closest behind 1031, and it actually dovetails into some of the work we're doing in embedded banking where, looking at areas where software providers in a space may lead us to deposit opportunities in some specific industries that maybe we're not in so far. and i think hla can be a nice example of that, for an example. we should have pilots. we're in pilots now.
we've got a couple of small ones that are up and running. but we think it's going to be into next year before we really start to see embedded banking numbers that move the needle on our balance sheet.
michael perito -- keefe, bruyette and woods -- analyst
and not to put you guys on the spot but let me asking steve's question in a different way here. i mean, what do you guys think. obviously, your noninterest-bearing mix is below where you'd like it to be, right? i mean are you guys thinking at all about where you think that mix can move next year? or is there any kind of framework or guide rails around that you think that's reasonable that we should be thinking about? as you kind of like take everything you just said together, huntley and think about all the growth opportunities cumulatively?
bj losch -- chief financial officer
yes. so i think we sit today at maybe 3% of our deposit mix in noninterest-bearing, which is negligible. next year, it moves up modestly, but not meaningfully, maybe a couple of percentage points. but i think if we're sitting here five years from now, it's probably 10 times the size in terms of mix that we're at today.
so i think what huntley just talked about with our title mass market, small business type products rolling out early next quarter, our larger treasury management offering and then embedded, i really think that by the end of 2023, you'll really start to see some momentum, particularly from the first two. and then, embedded as it layers in over the next 12, 24, 36 months really driving our future growth and that shift in mix.
michael perito -- keefe, bruyette and woods -- analyst
great. and then, just lastly for me, maybe a question for chip. but just from a high level, right, i mean, if you think about the second, third quarter, hopefully, we're in the last quarter of who knows what 2023 has in store, but the last quarter of the 75 basis point fed hikes as we move toward the end of the year here. just curious how you guys, as we think about next year and kind of where the margin environment is, hopefully, a stabilization in the sba secondary market once we're through these massive fed hikes, i mean, any updated thoughts on the balance between selling and holding loans as we look to next year? because it's been a little choppier on a percentage basis recently just because of the environment.
just curious if there have any updated thoughts there that we should be mindful of?
chip mahan
so i'll start that, and you guys can add to that. i mean, i think what we have talked to our lending officers about. and remember, our lending officer base is expanding daily. i mean we've added, what, 12 or 15 lending officers just this year, primarily in the sba area.
and certainly, the secondary market for fixed rate sba paper has been a blood bath and a disaster recently. and so, our lending officers are now being quite successful on the variable rate side because there are a number of borrowers out there that are saying, like, this thing may turn. maybe i should not take an 8% 25-year fixed rate, maybe ought to get a low floater here. and then, the prices for those loans in the sba second day market have held up and are coming back quite nicely.
so i think we're seeing more lending officers being more aggressive on, a bit lower, right? not two or two and a half over prime, but something slightly less than that. and i think we'll see that continue over the next several quarters. and you guys may want to add to that.
bj losch -- chief financial officer
yes. as a matter of fact, chip, to your point, over the last three quarters, we've seen our percentage of variable rate production double over the last three quarters. so i think, yes, there was a lot of demand for fixed and fixed adjusting production. but to your point, customers are starting to maybe see the crest.
our lenders are doing an excellent job providing customers options. and many times, the customer wants the variable rate option because near term, the rate is lower, and they also think that it could float down over the course or the term of the loan. so all of that, i think, is pretty good. on broadly, just thinking about our gain on sale income and mix, though we didn't necessarily want the tightening cycle to happen like it did, we've gone from maybe 15% to as much as 20% of our income in any given quarter being gain on sale to down to about 6% to 8%.
we've been intentionally moving that down as we've originated to hold more. but this has given us a step-down opportunity, if you will, to kind of reset the base and then be a lot more thoughtful about what we keep and what we sell and, quite frankly, give us a lot more flexibility going forward to maximize our gain on sale across our different portfolios. so i think that's going to help us in terms of more consistent earnings going forward.
michael perito -- keefe, bruyette and woods -- analyst

chip mahan -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks, greg, and good morning to those dialing in today. if i had your job, bank analyst extraordinaire, my first question would be, tell me about your loan loss provision? moving to the next slide, michael. before we unpack the provision in our last quarterly call, we talked about some very famous folks predicting a recession. so are the last two substantial increases in the provision, a proxy for the future.
let's drill down. next slide. let's go way back to pre-cecl. the provision in 2018 and '19 was between $0 and $7 million, mainly in the $2 million to $5 million range.
then in q1 of 2020, we implemented cecl at the beginning of the pandemic. we were predictively conservative providing $10 million per quarter during the covid peak. we were equally predictable as the government provided ppp funding and our provision came down in 2021, as you can see from this slide. the title of this slide is regression to the norm.
we're about back to where we were three years ago as our allowance for credit losses or 2.2% of unguaranteed loans compared to 2.4% in 2019. we do not see the q4 provision as a proxy for the future at this point in time. moving to slide 6. in the old days of running banks, we typically added to our loan loss reserve that which we charged off that quarter, not anymore.
as you can see, our addition to the reserve has far exceeded actual net charge-offs. bj will be walking you through some calculations on how growth in the loan portfolio has a great deal to do with these differences. let's move to slide 7, michael. as always, back to credit quality and the underpinning of a building of a healthy allowance for loan losses, once again, soundness, profitability and growth in that order.
so here are the facts, watch list is down year over year. past dues are flat, nonaccruals are down 10 bps. as we discussed last quarter, surprisingly of the total nonaccruals at year-end of $26 million, over half, or $15 million, we're paying as agreed. charge-offs in '21 were $9 million and $10.7 million in 2022, de minimis on a loan book of $4.1 billion of unguaranteed paper.
slide 8. now, that we have examined the past and reconciled the history of our loan loss reserve and our current credit quality ratios. what does the future look like? what better place to turn than our customers? i have known john barlow for a long time. john started his data-driven consultancy 43 years ago.
we ask john and his team to ask our customers a number of questions about the future of their businesses. after a thorough review and list cleaning, 4,600 loan relationship customers were invited to participate in an online survey between late september and early november. 768 customers or 17% of the total responded. as you can see from this slide, most were upbeat and over 60% thought they could grow their revenues in 2023.
nearly 25% of our customers plan to borrow money to finance that growth over the next 12 months. relative to customer challenges, difficulty in hiring and increased material and supply costs top the list. half of our customers believe they are understaffed. over the past 12 months, most customers have increased their prices over 10%.
over the next five years, 25% of our customers believe they could sell their business. this doesn't feel like a recession, does it? over to you, bj.
bj losch -- chief financial officer
thanks, chip. good morning, everybody. thanks again for joining us. let's start on some full year 2022 highlights on slide 10.
earnings per share were $3.92. from our core earnings results perspective, they were driven by healthy production growth, $4 billion of production in the year, leading to strong loan growth. this, combined with net interest margin resiliency, led to excellent net interest income growth. and then, of course, we had significant gains from successful exits of two ventures investments, which gave us the flexibility to moderate our guaranteed sales activity due to market dislocation and continue investing in our people and technology, while adding meaningful organic capital.
put some numbers behind the highlights, the full year 2022 net interest margin of 3.87% held up incredibly well ahead of expectations. this is a testament to the excellent discipline our lenders demonstrated to balance production and profitability, along with the great work by our deposits team to manage deposit pricing in a very highly competitive, rapidly rising rate environment. our adjusted net interest income growth was up 31% year over year on that $4 billion of loan production and 24% loan growth ex ppp, along with 25% deposit growth. this balance sheet growth was made even stronger by the guaranteed loans we did not sell.
while gain on sale income was down meaningfully from last year due to secondary market dynamics, that income was not lost forever. those loans, that we kept, will be a strong tailwind to our balance sheet and nii growth in 2023. as chip said, credit quality remains quite strong despite the uncertainty of the economic outlook. and of course, our history of successful incubation and investment in fintech ventures again served us well, generating significant gains in organic capital for future growth.
all of this led to significant tangible book value per share growth as well, 12% year over year. and as we look at slide 11, we also know that our 2022 results had a lot of moving parts that didn't make it easy for investors. a few comments on these as we head into 2023. i'll make five quick points: no.
1, ppp loans and associated impacts are immaterial at this point and won't be a factor going forward. no. 2, while we will continue to mark our servicing asset each quarter as required, we are working on ways to better forecast and minimize its impact on our quarterly results. no.
3, while we will continue to make tax credit investments when attractive, we are modifying our strategy to lessen the earnings volatility associated with those investments. no. 4, we plan to keep gain on sale income as a percentage of total revenues more in current ranges, which will afford us additional flexibility and stronger recurring spread income growth. and no.
5, while we continue to find our existing live oak and canapi ventures investments attractive, and we'll continue to make further investments, we are not currently anticipating any exits in the near term. turning to slide 13. let's take a quick look at q4 '22 performance where you see our adjusted results and the notable items that make up those adjustments. adjusted ppnr was down 12% quarter to quarter as continued strong net interest income growth of 4%, linked quarter was offset by lower gain on sale income and continued investment in people and technology.
as chip discussed earlier, our credit remains quite healthy, we did build our provision proactively in anticipation of a potential recession in '23. i'll get into credit trends a little bit more fully in a few minutes. turning to slide 14, we generated almost $1.2 billion of loan production in the quarter and $4 billion for the year. you see our loan originations remain quite diverse across our multiple areas with particular strength in numerous small business verticals and our middle-market sponsor finance vertical.
in energy & infrastructure, solar remains quite strong, while bioenergy lending was down from last year. both of those verticals should benefit from the clean energy incentives in the recently passed inflation reduction act. breaking down the components of revenue on slide 15, we see very strong and encouraging revenue trends, particularly in net interest income. while linked quarter revenue was down modestly as continued nii growth was offset by lower gain on sale income, total revenue growth was up 16% year over year even with significantly lower gain on sale income, thanks to 31% year-over-year growth in net interest income.
given the fact we held more loans on the balance sheet and expect a continued healthy nim, we are optimistic about continued strong nii growth in 2023. secondary market for sba and usda fixed rate sales remain unattractive and pricing for variable rate sba is recovering, but still not quite at normalized levels. so we expect to continue to hold more assets on the balance sheet. again, it's important to understand that lower gain on sale income is not income that is permanently lost.
we simply earn it over time in the form of spread income. and because of the flexibility we have with strong capital and liquidity levels, we are more than happy to hold these high-quality assets, and we'll remain patient with secondary market sales until further normalization. digging deeper into net interest margin trends on slide 16. margin, again, held strong in q4 at 3.76% and for the full year at 3.87% versus last year's 3.86%.
while we still expect some downward pressure as deposit competition shows no signs of easing. we continue to be very encouraged by the resiliency of our margin due to the excellent work by our lenders in adjusting loan pricing commensurate with market funding costs. turning to expenses on slide 17. we have been incredibly pleased with the quality of talent that has joined live oak in our various groups across the company.
we have now largely worked through our hiring bubble to rightsize our lender support to accommodate the significant step-up in production and balance sheet growth over the past two years. and in addition, as we have discussed, we accelerated our technology hiring in 2022, thanks to the finxact gain, that is now also largely complete. so going forward, while we will continue to be opportunistic on hiring, particularly for revenue producers, we expect to see our expense growth moderate considerably into 2023 and significantly improve our operating leverage and ppnr growth going forward. few more points on credit trends on slide 18.
as chip discussed earlier, credit metrics remain quite strong. we continue to actively monitor the existing portfolio and do not currently see any glaring weak spots. net charge-offs and nonaccruals remain quite low. 30-day past dues remain low as well.
in fact, the q4 dollar amount of $19 million you see in the upper right is down to only about $3 million as of yesterday. yet we grew the provision well in excess of the $1.4 million of net charge-offs we experienced in q4. and as you can see in the upper left, 40% of that provision was due to strong balance sheet growth. to me, that's good provision.
55% of the growth was continued proactivity in building appropriate reserves for a less certain outlook and regressing to the norm. with what we see combined with a conservative outlook, we currently feel very well positioned with our current reserve coverage and levels. slide 19 shows the advantages of the lab boat business model, having 42% of your total loan portfolio government guaranteed, a stronger net interest margin than most and reserves over twice the industry average, it's quite unique and comforting. add to that, our overall capital strength on slide 20, we believe we're incredibly well positioned to thrive in whatever environment lies ahead.
with that, i'll turn it over to huntley for a little more color on our outlook and areas of focus for '23. huntley?
huntley garriott -- president, live oak bank
thanks, bj. i'll try to wrap all this up on page 22. despite what was admittedly a noisy quarter and the continued sort of macro uncertainties, we head into 2023 with a lot of momentum. from day one of live oak, you've heard chip articulate our priorities as a company, safety and soundness, profitability and growth in that order, and we remain committed to that.
our balance sheet, as bj went through, is really well positioned with ample capital, significant loan loss reserves and the flexibility that we require to support our growth. our loan portfolio remains healthy, and we're committed to staying close to our existing small business borrowers and we're optimistic as they navigate a slower growth economy. that said, we still see tremendous opportunity to continue to lend prudently, especially if history repeats itself and lenders pull back from small businesses in choppier times. in 2022, we demonstrated our ability to maintain our net interest margin despite the rapidly rising rate environment.
and that, coupled with continued loan growth, should position us for significant net interest income growth. as bj mentioned, we've been spending a lot of time focusing on how to reduce the volatility in our earnings to make your jobs as investors easier to see our core fundamentals and expected to demonstrate that in 2023 as well. on the expense side, our team is firmly in place as we start the year, and our headcount growth will dramatically slow versus the last couple of years. our lending franchise is stronger than ever.
our technology team is fully built out with clear road map, and we're seeing tangible efficiency gains in both our technology investments and our operational improvements. all that should allow our revenue growth to significantly outpace our expense growth and result in strong ppnr growth throughout the year. on the technology front, you'll see continued improvements in our origination and servicing platforms designed to speed up our lending process and improve our customer experience. you'll also see our embedded banking developer portal that will drive customer acquisition and deeper banking relationships through software providers that serve small businesses.
i'll wrap up with the topic that i'm sure you've all been waiting for an update on checking. as you all know, we currently have a checking product in the lower end of the small business market with about 2,000 accounts, but it doesn't have all the capabilities that we need to serve our core customers, the veterinarians, the professional services firms and the rest of small business america that require some version of entitlements and money movement. in the next couple of weeks, we're going to onboard our first customer on our fully functional business checking account that's complete with treasury management capabilities. and that will allow us to serve all of our existing small business clients and the broader small business market as well.
it's been a long wait for everyone, but we're excited to finally prove our ability to drive low-cost deposit growth at live oak. we remain laser-focused on our mission to become america's small business bank, and we look forward to translating that into predictable earnings growth throughout 2023. with that, let's turn it over to questions.

operator
[operator instructions] our first question will come from steven alexopoulos of j.p. morgan. your line is open.
steven alexopoulos -- jpmorgan chase and company -- analyst
hey, good morning, everybody. i want to start -- so bj, you guided the nim several quarters ago to 3.50%, 3.75% in the fourth quarter. you're at 3.76%. i think you won both showcases with that forecast.
what do you see as the range one year from now, 4q '23?
bj losch -- chief financial officer
yes. i think i would probably still say the 3.50% to 3.75%. and hopefully, again, under promise and over deliver. as i talked about earlier, i feel really good about how quickly our lenders adjusted loan pricing and still put up record loan production as well.
so it's not like we sacrificed quantity for profitability. so very pleased with that. the deposit pricing was very well managed by our team in the first half of 2022. and then, it significantly ramped up in the back half and shows no signs of slowing.
so i do expect in 2023, particularly in the first half of the year to see downward pressure on the nim as it relates to deposit pricing because we won't see quite as much loan repricing that was helpful to us. but in the back half of the year, i see us continuing to build our margin as potentially the fed stops raising rates and rates in general are more stable. so i still feel really good about the margin and our ability to produce. so happy with what we've seen so far.
steven alexopoulos -- jpmorgan chase and company -- analyst
bj, if the fed does not cut rates the way the market thinks and they move up a couple more hikes and then pause, do you still think nim can hold in that range? or is it really contingent on seeing rate cuts in the back half?
bj losch -- chief financial officer
no, it's a good question. we essentially are assuming what the market forward curve looks like. so another two or three fed moves of 25 basis points and then a cut either late, late december '23 or early 2024. so our margin assumptions for '23 really don't have any rate cuts that would have a meaningful impact.
steven alexopoulos -- jpmorgan chase and company -- analyst
ok. that's helpful. and then, to follow up on the comments around dialing down the expense growth. can you help us think about what's a reasonable range for 2023?
huntley garriott -- president, live oak bank
it's a good question, steve. look, i think if you look back in 2021, that's really in that sort of post-pandemic or sort of capital flows and then our lending volumes really stair stepped up. and so, we hired a bunch of lender support to keep up with the -- that opportunity. and then into 2022, it was really in the technology side where we really invested heavily, and we talked about that as it relates to some of the gains that we had that allowed us to accelerate that.
both of those are really in place. and so, i think that if you thought about from a headcount perspective, we may still grow a little bit, but it will be certainly less than 10% across the board. and that's assuming that our production still looks like it will be at or above where we came in last year with everything we see right now. and that's obviously the driver -- the largest driver of our expenses is on the people side.
steven alexopoulos -- jpmorgan chase and company -- analyst
so are you saying only high single digit. is that about what you're implying?
bj losch -- chief financial officer
if you look at '21 to '22, so take out kind of some of the noise or the onetimes, that kind of thing, we had about 25% expense growth from '21 to '22. i would see that more in the mid-teens range this year as we put more of that investment in people and technology to work.
huntley garriott -- president, live oak bank
yes. i think, steve, the other way to think about it is we had a lot of growth throughout last year. so looking at q4 and that sort of core expense number, i think we'll be in the high single digits or mid-single digits of growth over that kind of, call it, less than 10% growth on that number. but to bj's point, that will translate year-over-year higher just given the ramp-up over the course of last year.
chip mahan -- chairman and chief executive officer
steve, i think the only thing that could offset that, right, is back to your earlier point, right? if this is a true recession and if the credit guys end up running these banks and if there are opportunities to hire other lending officers, we will be in that hunt, but that is not applicable at this time.
steven alexopoulos -- jpmorgan chase and company -- analyst
yes, yes, yes. and if i could squeeze in one last one. just on credit, the commentary around a small number of relationships you talked about impacting credit quality. anything to read into there? any industry one-offs? just give a little bit of color there.
steve smits -- chief credit officer
steve, this is steve smits, chief credit officer. no, no systemic or anything to read into it. i would say that's based on a handful of relationships that are going through some turmoil with their management teams, still paying as agreed. however, we opted to reserve against those because we'll be potentially navigating some uncertain times.
and so, i don't suspect that that is going to turn into losses, but it's kind of a conservative approach that's reserve against that. because just -- and see if these management issues with our borrowers escalate, we'll be prepared and ready for it. so it's kind of a conservative approach, but not anything systemic that jumps out. these are unrelated and -- issues.
steven alexopoulos -- jpmorgan chase and company -- analyst
got it. ok. thanks for taking my questions.
steve smits -- chief credit officer
thanks, steve.
operator
[operator instructions] our next question will come from crispin love of piper sandler. your line is open.
crispin love -- piper sandler -- analyst
thanks, and good morning, everyone. first one is on sba gain on sale margins. so they were at 5% in the quarter, well below recent quarters, but you did sell more sba in the fourth quarter than you did in the third. so i'm just -- can you speak a little bit to your strategy there and why you didn't balance sheet more loans in the fourth quarter, similar to what you did in the second quarter? and then, just your expectations for selling versus holding on the balance sheet in early 2023?
bj losch -- chief financial officer
sure, crispin, it's bj. one thing that has been particularly surprising and impressive about what our lenders have been able to accomplish is, beginning of the year, about 30% to 35% of our production was variable rate. so 65% to 70% was fixed rate. and that obviously was, as we talked about, difficult to sell.
by the end of the year, we were over 50% variable rate in terms of the production that we were booking. variable rate market was still relatively healthy from a gain on sale perspective. and so, we had more capacity and more eligible loans for sale that were attractive to investors. so as we looked at where we would want to manage interest rate risk, what kind of balance sheet we wanted and what kind of gains that we felt we could take in the fourth quarter from sba sales, we decided to sell a little bit more of the variable knowing that we had quite a bit of it on the balance sheet already.
so that was part of the math there.
crispin love -- piper sandler -- analyst
ok. that's helpful. and then, do you have any early reads on the first quarter for margins? have they begun to firm a little bit? or do you expect a little bit more of the same for near-term trends?
bj losch -- chief financial officer
yes. so i'd say that the variable rate sba market continues to heal. it's probably still a couple of hundred basis points from normal levels, but there's healthy activity and there's buying if we choose to be in the market and sell usda and sba fixed rate product is still virtually nonexistent from a buying perspective. so we'll be holding those.
so like i said at the opening, we're just expecting pretty muted activity from a gain on sale perspective in the first half of the year and hoping it opens up in the second half. but one other thing i did say that i wanted to reiterate, now that we've got our gain on sale as a percentage of quarterly revenue, somewhere in the 7% to 10% revenue range and gives us a total revenue mix of, let's say, around 80% spread income, 20% fee income versus historically, over the last couple of years, we've been more 70-30. i think that's actually a pretty good place for us to be. it minimizes our gain on sale and, frankly, reliance on gain on sale every quarter allows us more flexibility to sell more if we see attractive pricing, sell less if we want to hold more.
but then importantly, it gives us much more recurring revenue through nii and balance sheet growth, which we think is certainly more predictable and, obviously, attractive to us and to investors. so this has actually given us an opportunity to kind of reset what our gain on sales strategy is and grow more balance sheet.
crispin love -- piper sandler -- analyst
i appreciate that. and then, just one last one for me, kind of dovetailing off your last point, but just curious what your outlook is on loan and origination growth? in the past, i think several quarters ago, you've talked about kind of longer-term trends of 15% origination growth, do you think levels like that is still attainable right now? or do you think growth like that needs to come down given the current environment?
bj losch -- chief financial officer
you think in balance sheet or origination growth, crispin?
crispin love -- piper sandler -- analyst
origination, but also looking for both as well.
huntley garriott -- president, live oak bank
yes. so on the origination side, we continue to add lenders last year. and i think we have the franchise in place to do that. so we did $4 billion of total origination last year.
to think that we could grow that 15% in sort of a normal environment seems quite reasonable. i think we're obviously being pretty conservative right now, looking at the implications of a slowing economy, interest rates, construction costs, largely m&a market, things like that. so we feel good right now kind of at where we are or up. but certainly, the franchise is in place to do that sort of 15%.
and as we look at just the overall size of the market, the overall trends in the silver tsunamis and the transition of ownership, as chip talked about, it still feels like there's just a ton of opportunity for us to continue to expand the lending franchise. we're just going to do it really prudently as we kind of look and see what 2023 looks like.
crispin love -- piper sandler -- analyst
thanks for taking my questions.
operator
[operator instructions] our next question will come from michael perito of kbw. your line is open.
michael perito -- keefe, bruyette and woods -- analyst
hey, guys. good morning. thanks for taking my questions. i wanted to start kind of two bigger picture questions.
one, just on how are you guys thinking about -- there's been some discussion on this call about expense growth moderating, positive operating leverage, nim having some more pressure, but then hopefully stabilizing kind of taking it all into sort here. i mean, what's the updated thoughts you guys have on kind of structurally what the targeted roe should be for this business? i mean, you guys are now growing the balance sheet a bit more, maybe there's a little less gain on sale, maybe that weighs on a little near term. but just curious if there's any kind of profitability thoughts you're willing to provide, as you guys kind of look out over the next couple of years with what you know today in terms of what you think is reasonable or should be targeted for the type of business you're building?
huntley garriott -- president, live oak bank
yes, it's a great question, mike. we talked about that a lot here. we've consistently grown our balance sheet north of 20% actually. i think over a sustained period of time, we still think that 15-plus percent balance sheet growth makes sense for us as a franchise as we look at sort of where we're going.
the simple math says a 15-plus percent roe allows you to self-fund that and continue to grow without having to sort of tap into capital markets, which is nice. it creates a lot of sort of flexibility for us on that path. as we look at our franchise, a 15% roe, i think, is quite reasonable, especially as we start to turn the dial on the he deposit side that we've been talking about and start layering in checking accounts, which is a pretty capital efficient place to grow earnings by lowering our cost of funds. so i would love to think that we could turn that dial to be a 20% roe and a 20% grower.
that's sort of, i think, the optimistic case, but pretty reasonably think that a 15% roe to support our growth is pretty reasonable. bj, if you have anything on that?
bj losch -- chief financial officer
no, i think that's right. and kind of our arrow in the quiver, so to speak, is we're a -- if you normalize some of these onetime costs and the gains and all this, we're a 15% to 20% roe business today with a deposit platform that is market rate. and as huntley mentioned, this is our year of checking and really getting focused on that. and so, over the next several years, as we continue to grow our business and build out a small business bank, we're anticipating that that funding cost is going to be a tailwind to us as we continue to improve profitability.
michael perito -- keefe, bruyette and woods -- analyst
got it. that's helpful. but it's fair to think that -- on a gaap basis, there will be a process to build back up to that 15%, right? i mean, over the next year or two, as some of those initiatives take hold and rates stabilize, etc. is that fair?
bj losch -- chief financial officer
yes, i think that's fair, mike.
michael perito -- keefe, bruyette and woods -- analyst
ok. and then, kind of dovetailing off that, you guys kind of brought this up, but i think, bj, you mentioned that at this point, you're not expecting any exits in 2023 on the venture side. and kind of from a timing perspective, it feels like 2023 will be a year where the balance sheet growth outpaces the roe at least as it looks right now. so i'm just curious all the capital front, particularly with the mindset now of holding more of your production.
could you also just maybe remind us internally what you guys are thinking about in terms of capitalization of the bank and what's kind of the target range? and if you were to go above or below that, what would be kind of your priorities to rightsize that?
bj losch -- chief financial officer
yes. i think if you look at where we sit today, kind of the common equity tier 1 ratio of 12.5% is quite solid. where we have our binding constraint as we continue to grow is really more on the leverage side. and we are unique in that 40% of our loan book is government guaranteed.
and so, leverage is a little bit less relevant to us, but obviously still an important and headline ratio. so that's one that we continue to watch. we're at 9.3% today, from a holding company or a bank shares perspective, which still remains very healthy. even if we grow the balance sheet faster than the retained earnings, we still have a couple of years of runway before tier 1 leverage gets down at the bank shares level toward 7.5% or 7% range, in which case we would probably have to think of something else, absent more ventures gains.
so we do have some runway as the balance sheet grows.
michael perito -- keefe, bruyette and woods -- analyst
very helpful. and then, just lastly for me. i know it's hard, but any thoughts on a range on the tax rate for next year, bj, just given some of the credit activity you've done already? and is there any guardrails you can give us on that?
bj losch -- chief financial officer
yes, i know that's a tough one -- honestly a tough one for me too. i would say our statutory rate blended is going to be around 23%. i would use 20% as an effective tax rate to model. now, it's going to kind of go up and down quarter to quarter, but that's probably the best range.
if we are -- if we do see attractive tax credit investments that we want to make that could certainly shift and be more positive. but right now, 20% is probably the best place to land.
michael perito -- keefe, bruyette and woods -- analyst
