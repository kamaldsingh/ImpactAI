mark morelli -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, lisa. good morning, everyone, and welcome to our first-quarter earnings call. we had an outstanding start to 2021. our team's strong execution drove double-digit core revenue and earnings growth.
we delivered adjusted earnings per share of $0.63, an increase of 43% year over year and $0.08 above the high end of our guide. our results this quarter are a clear demonstration that better prioritization and embracing our core values drive robust improvements. i cannot underscore enough the importance of unlocking value by combining our heritage with a greater focus and fresh perspective made possible by the separation of vontier. our renewed discipline enabled us to better prioritize our highest-return opportunities and pursue strategies to transform our portfolio.
we are taking advantage of secular trends to win share with north american emv solutions. importantly, we're also gaining momentum on initiatives to deliver growth beyond this regulatory driver. i'd like to give additional color on our profitable growth initiatives and operational milestones as this is indicative of the significant runway of opportunities available to us. we continue to drive deeper deployment of vbs and build momentum.
we revamped our performance and incentive programs to solidify accountability through our aggressive strategic and operational agenda. the right linkage is in place to ensure emphasis on the critical few areas of growth, innovation, and simplification. accordingly, we are repositioning to streamline the business while investing for more profitable growth. early wins, share gains, and new product launches are driving this accelerated growth.
in the first quarter, we delivered mid-teens core revenue growth in non-emv sales, including greater than 25% core revenue growth in high-growth markets. we saw strong growth in retail solutions, driven by 30% growth in point-of-sale offerings. additionally, we continue to see accelerated growth in diagnostic and repair technologies with high-teens core revenue growth. lastly, we're continuing to make important progress returning teletrac navman to more profitable growth.
to summarize, we're advancing all of our priorities as we outlined last october, and this is unleashing our earnings growth potential. and so as i mentioned, we're off to a strong start to the year. however, we will be facing continued supply chain constraints and inflationary pressures going forward as the sourcing environment for steel and electrical components, among other things, is challenging. but this is another area where our team has executed exceptionally well.
we're leveraging vbs to derisk our supply chain. we were able to more than offset inflation in the quarter with price. and i'm confident in our team's ability to continue to manage these headwinds. we remain vigilant as we expect to see increasing challenges with supply chain, logistics, inflation, and covid-related impacts centered on india and other parts of the world.
however, we always come back to the vontier way as our guiding principle. our commitment to integrity and our people is the foundation of our success. we've escalated programs to support our employees and their families in the most impacted areas, and that will remain our highest priority. moving to the outlook.
given our strong performance in the first quarter and expectations for improved demand, we are raising our full-year 2021 adjusted diluted net eps guidance to $2.55 per share to $2.65 per share. this includes raise assumptions for low to mid-single-digit core revenue growth and core adjusted operating margin expansion of 60 to 90 basis points. we're also initiating our second-quarter adjusted diluted net eps guidance of $0.50 to $0.54, which includes assumptions of 23% to 25% core revenue growth and core adjusted operating margin expansion of greater than 200 basis points. with that, i'll turn the call over to dave.
dave?
dave naemura -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
thanks, mark. adjusted net earnings for the first quarter were $108 million, an increase of 44% from $75 million in the prior-year period. this translated to an adjusted net earnings per share of $0.63, compared to $0.44 in the prior-year period. the double-digit increase in earnings was primarily driven by volume growth and strong fall-through, which led to 380 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion in the quarter.
core revenue growth in the first quarter was 14.3%, driven by broad-based non-emv growth of approximately 15% in the quarter, supplemented by the continued strength of the emv rollout in north america. in gvr, core revenue grew mid-teens with bookings growth of high teens, while matco had high-teens core revenue growth and more than 20% bookings growth. high-growth markets were also a significant contributor in the first quarter, growing more than 25% year over year and low-teens growth sequentially. within the high-growth markets, we saw particularly strong growth in india and in latin america, driven by mexico share gains.
adjusted operating profit for the first quarter was $151 million, growth of 41% compared to the prior-year period, primarily driven by strong core revenue growth and continued cost management in both cost of goods sold and operating expense. to that end, we drove 90 basis points of gross margin expansion and 380 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion, continuing the progress we made in the back half of 2020 as we leverage vbs to execute our profitable growth initiatives and manage through a very dynamic supply chain and inflationary environment. our earnings growth continued to translate through to very strong cash flow performance, with adjusted free cash flow of $156 million, a conversion of 145% in the quarter. q1 is historically the low point in the year for free cash flow conversion as we normally build working capital coming off the year-end low in what is typically a seasonally lower-volume quarter.
however, this quarter, we further improved working capital through targeted receivables and payables actions while also satisfying high volumes. in the first quarter, we closed on $1.6 billion of senior notes at an average interest rate under 2.5%, lengthening the maturity of our debt structure. we subsequently retired $1.4 billion of our temporary debt financing, including repaying our two-year term loan, which was put in place to facilitate our october 2020 spin. this had the impact of opportunistically increasing our gross indebtedness by $200 million to approximately $2 billion, better positioning the company to execute on m&a.
our growth in earnings, along with our strong free cash flow generation resulted in our net leverage decreasing to 1.9 times from 2.2 times at the end of 2020 and 2.6 times at the time of the spin in october of last year. looking at the top-line performance of our two platforms. mobility technologies had core revenue growth, 12.7% primarily due to mid-teens core growth in gvr, partially offset by teletrac navman. the strength in gvr was multifaceted.
we saw strong demand and high teens growth in non-emv sales driven by retail solutions point-of-sale, aftermarket, and environmental solutions, and 30% growth in high-growth markets. and we continue to see strong demand from emv in north america ahead of the deadline. as mark mentioned, teletrac navman continues to improve, and we remain optimistic that the business will return to growth by the end of the year. in our diagnostics and repair technologies platform, core revenue growth was 18.6% and driven primarily by accelerated strong demand at matco.
matco experienced high-teens core growth as the demand environment remains strong with substantial same-store sales growth. we continue to add to our distribution base, posting our third consecutive quarter of strong net franchisee additions following the pause that we saw during the height of the pandemic. looking at total company sales regionally, the growth was truly broad-based. as i mentioned, high-growth markets grew more than 25%, and our developed markets in total grew low double digits with mid-teens growth in north america, partially offset by softness in western europe.
in addition to executing on the growth opportunities in our markets, we also made progress on our profit improvement actions that will better position the company as we progress through the year. we recognized a restructuring charge of $4 million in q1, which is part of the approximately $20 million charge that we continue to anticipate for the full year. this charge is excluded from our adjusted net operating profit, as we discussed last quarter. we expect to have these actions substantially complete in the year, positioning our exit rate to achieve the benefits of these actions in 2020 -- 2022, sorry.
taking a closer look at our outlook assumptions. we now expect our weighted average share count to be approximately 170 million for the year, down from 172 million in our prior review. and as a reminder, during the second quarter last year, we acted quickly and decisively to reduce our cost base by about $20 million and in line with the pandemic demand environment. given the v-shaped recovery in the majority of our markets, we saw about $15 million of those costs return in the third quarter of 2020.
we have contemplated the return of these temporary cost actions and the impact from the supply chain constraints and inflationary pressures in our guidance for both 2q and the full year. our adjusted free cash flow conversion of 145% this quarter was unseasonably high for a first quarter of the year. historically, we have built working capital in q1 and have seen this as the low point for conversion in the year. for 2021, we anticipate that q1 will be the high point for conversion and q2 will likely be the low point for the year.
we expect to see conversion from -- down from q1 levels for the remaining three quarters as we work to better align working capital with demand. furthermore, as we noted last quarter, we will have five federal tax payments in 2021 as compared to three in 2020 due to the dynamics of the spin. the actual payment will occur in q2. all that said, we still anticipate full-year adjusted free cash flow conversion of around 95%.
importantly, we enjoy a healthy balance sheet with liquidity in excess of $1 billion and ample near-term m&a capacity. overall, a robust start to the year, operating from a strong financial position and with a meaningfully -- and with a meaningful raise to our full-year expectations for core growth, margin expansion, and earnings growth. with that, i will turn it back to mark.
mark morelli -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, dave. indeed, our team delivered another quarter of strong execution resulting in top-tier financial performance across all metrics. i'm extremely proud of our employees and encouraged by our ability to deliver against our most important priorities. you may recall that last quarter i characterized 2021 as an important springboard to a multiyear transformation, and it's imperative that we deliver on every step of this journey.
since separation, we've more than delivered on our commitments. and now with first quarter behind us, we are even better positioned to navigate the growth and comparison dynamics ahead. our improved full-year guide remains a tale of two halves. the first half reflects broad-based strong growth, including continued demand for emv, coupled with a favorable comparison due to the impact of the pandemic in the second quarter of last year.
in the second half, we have much more challenging comparisons because we benefited from the v-shaped recovery and accelerated demand for emv and mexico regulatory solutions in the back half of 2020. given the improved growth outlook from environmental and point-of-sale solutions, high-growth market initiatives, and matco, we now see first-half adjusted earnings-per-share growth of approximately 40%. this is partially offset by more favorable expectations of a second-half decline in the low double-digit range. to wrap up, we had a strong start to the year as we build momentum and establish a successful track record as a stand-alone company.
i just want to reiterate how pleased i am with our team's execution this quarter to deliver top decile operating leverage and growth. a greater focus and deeper deployment of the vontier business system is the driving force behind our success today and tomorrow. we are well-positioned for capital deployment due to our strong free cash flow conversion. we are confident in our organic and inorganic opportunities.
and we expect to drive compounding growth, thanks to our market-leading positions and compelling long-term secular growth drivers. with that, i'd like to turn the call over to lisa.
lisa curran -- vice president of investor relations
thanks, mark. that concludes our formal comments. dorothy, we are now ready for questions.

[operator instructions] your first question comes from the line of andy kaplowitz with citigroup.
andy kaplowitz -- citi -- analyst
hey, good morning, guys. nice quarter.
mark morelli -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, andy.
andy kaplowitz -- citi -- analyst
mark, you adjusted your second-half '21 expectations slightly higher, down low teens versus down mid-teens what you had last quarter. can you give us a little more color into that expected improvement? is it more because of improved profitability you're delivering? maybe reopening is positively impacting your businesses? or is emv sunset not as bad as expectations? and i know last quarter you suggested emv adoption would be in the mid-80% range by the end of the year. what's your current expectations for that?
mark morelli -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. andy, listen, i think it's both better top-line visibility, and that's really on the backs of our ex emv growth initiatives. as you know, we've really down-selected to a critical few priorities. and one of those is driving some growth that's coming not from the secular driver in emv.
and particularly, i spoke about them on the call, but it's also important to reiterate here, we're getting better traction in high-growth markets. as you know, they can be lumpy. where we're getting a really good backlog there, and we've raised the outlook for full year. we've also got a lot better traction on some initiatives around retail solutions, and that gives us a lot of confidence.
also, matco is showing some strength, and we're also carrying a good backlog there. so a lot of really good initiatives that are paying off for us, and we feel really good about it. at the same time, emv, by the way, while we won't make comments on that, but we are gaining share in emv. and i think we feel pretty confident in that view.
the drop-through has been great. and i think the initiatives that we're doing on simplification and driving better margin improvement and our focus there is beginning to pay off, as you can see. so i think that the combination of both those really give us more confidence to raise our outlook in full year.
andy kaplowitz -- citi -- analyst
mark, can i just ask you a follow-up on high-growth markets? obviously, you guys are pretty big in india. and given the unfortunate events there, how are you guys thinking about from high-growth markets in general, including india? have you sort of discounted any covid disruption in any of those regions?
mark morelli -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. that's a great question. look, the situation in india is tragic and it's still developing. first and foremost, we're prioritizing our safety and the health of our employees.
and we've contemplated some of the india risk in our guide. but as you know, it's a developing situation for full year. when you look at other high-growth market opportunities, middle east and africa represents good growth, as well as some opportunities in latin america as well. so i think we're -- we feel good about our initiatives there.
and i think we feel good about our outlook, but obviously working through some hotspots with covid that is -- it's quite significant and very heartfelt for our team and our employees.

your next question comes from the line of john walsh with credit suisse.
john walsh -- credit suisse -- analyst
hi. good morning, everyone. i wanted to ask about kind of the m&a priorities pipeline, if you can give us any metrics around that, either the number of opportunities, the size, etc., because, right, you did delever nicely on the free cash flow generation this quarter. so just love to get a little bit color around the pipeline and the timing, please.
mark morelli -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. happy to do that, john. look, the delevering is absolutely a part of this equation to generate strong free cash flow and to compound that into m&a. and on the m&a question, specifically, we have this healthy pipeline.
and by the way, it's focused on non-ice targets, and the cultivation is very active. what i can say specifically about these opportunities is that they will accelerate our strategy. and specifically, the characteristics are focused on non-ice. they're accretive to growth and cash flow.
it's a very disciplined process. the targets that we're looking at are near end. we can think about them as retail solutions, certain areas in smart cities, and possibly telematics. and of course, our pipeline is broader than that, but these are -- i'm trying to add a little bit of color for you as to the areas that have particular interest for us.
and certainly, it's a competitive dynamic out there in the markets, but we see deals getting done. and deleveraging, like i said, is part of it. and just as a reminder here, john, as you know, it's difficult to predict exactly when deals will happen because they're a bit episodic.
john walsh -- credit suisse -- analyst
and then maybe that leads into the follow-on. you've taken your share guidance down here by $2 million. maybe just a little bit of more thoughts around deploying some share repo to that.
dave naemura -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
hey, john, it's dave. obviously, our capital deployment priority will remain m&a. but we're, first and foremost, focused on returns. i think the adjustment you saw in the guide was just us kind of getting in the stream here and understanding the impacts of stock comp and other things as it's our first year as a public company.
but i would steer you toward thinking about m&a as our top priority -- continuing to be our top priority for capital employment.
john walsh -- credit suisse -- analyst
makes a lot of sense. nice quarter again, and i'll pass it along.
dave naemura -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
thank you, john.
john walsh -- credit suisse -- analyst
thank you.
operator
your next question comes from the line of nigel coe with wolfe research.
nigel coe -- wolfe research -- analyst
thanks. good morning, everyone. i'll keep this to one question. can you maybe just give us a bit more definition around what you've seen? now we've passed the emv deadline, how is the backlog looking at this point? it seems that we're still working with these $100 million to $150 million headwinds for the year.
how much of that hits in 2q? and how much in the second half of the year? that would be helpful. thanks.
dave naemura -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yes. thanks, nigel. it's dave. i'll answer that.
so we have not updated our point of view, and we continue to stay in that $100 million to $150 million range for the impact of the decline from the peak year of 2020. we saw emv come in about as expected in q1. the backlog is strong. i think what we've always said is we want to get through the adoption deadline, which is past here a few weeks ago, and see some behavior through q2 before we update that, then we'd come back with an update.
when we look at q2, we're still growing year over year. but sequentially, the emv dollars that we ship will be lower than what we shipped in q1. and so we do see sequentially a reduction, but still growth year over year. so we would anticipate the back -- or the impact of the year-over-year decline being a second-half dynamic.
nigel coe -- wolfe research -- analyst
great. i'll get back to the queue.
dave naemura -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
thanks, nigel.
operator
your next question comes from the line of julian mitchell with barclays.
julian mitchell -- barclays -- analyst
hi. good morning. maybe my question is just around the margin outlook. so i guess one aspect of that is, it looks like the guide is embedding a second half sort of down margin year on year, maybe 50 bps, but up 200, 300 bps half-on-half.
so maybe just help me understand if that math is roughly correct for the 2h. and what's driving that big half-on-half uplift as the emv rolls? and also tied to that, it looked like your restructuring charges guidance, at least on a per-share basis, has gone up from $0.07 to $0.12. maybe help us understand kind of what's driving that and what the in-year savings will be next year?
dave naemura -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. thanks, julian. i think -- if you'll look directionally, i think you're reading the first-half, second-half dynamic correctly. pretty good step-up in second half, profitability, and margin from what we're experiencing in the first half.
and that's about what you historically would see from these businesses. what makes it a little bit challenging is the compare. obviously, we saw a dramatic improvement last year, some demand shifting out of the second quarter and getting satisfied in the second half, immediately coming back to mid-single-digit growth in q3 of 2020 and high single-digit growth in q4. so that skews the year-over-year compare dynamic.
but sequentially, i think you're in the zone. why do we see the margin improvement? well, it will be -- we anticipate on a little bit higher volumes. and also, this is where a lot of the profit improvement actions that we've talked about come into play. part of that, as you know, is the restructuring, where we're still on $20 million for the year.
we talked about $20 million previously, and we're still on the $20 million. so we haven't changed our restructuring assumption. we believe that that will happen throughout the year, probably a little more weighted toward the back half of the year. the goal being we'll see some in-year savings kind of partial year obviously, as they happen throughout the year, but positioning ourselves for the exit rate.
and regarding also the impact of emv on the first half, second-half dynamic, i think what we talked about on the last call was the ebit level being about $0.38, call it, $0.28 at the eps net earnings level. and we said we felt good about offsetting that. given that we've brought the guide up and we haven't changed the emv assumption, i'd say our confidence continues to be high in our ability to offset the impact of emv, which includes the mix impact as well.
julian mitchell -- barclays -- analyst
great. thank you.
dave naemura -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
thank you.
operator
your next question comes from the line of andrew obin with bank of america.
david ridley-lane -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
good morning. this is david ridley-lane on for andrew obin. could you tell us about the incremental margin assumption in the second quarter? are you assuming the full $20 million of temporary costs come back? is price/cost still positive? just give us a little bit more of the pieces around the margin assumption in 2q.
dave naemura -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
sure. thanks, david. as you know, $20 million out last year, i think the majority of that is back in this year in the run rate, maybe not quite all the way up to the $20 million because there's some -- maybe some travel and other things that aren't back in, but that, for sure, is back in the number, and that impacts the year-over-year incrementals. also, we have kind of a different dynamic in opex associated with what we call the expo event at matco, our big annual sales event is a q1 item.
it was in q1 of 2020. this year, we kind of switched the sales side of that to a big virtual event, but we'll still hold expo. it will be in q2. so i think we captured a reasonable amount of sales in q1, but the event cost itself, which is significant, moves to q2.
so there's dynamics such as that as well. also, with the strong backlog that we have, we get pretty good line of sight into what we're going to ship. and we have -- between kind of product and geo mix, we see some mixed sequential headwinds when we look at q1 versus q2. so that goes into the calculus as well.
as far as price/cost, we would anticipate that being positive for q2. but as we said, it's a tough dynamic environment.
david ridley-lane -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
got it. and just as a quick follow-up, what was pricing in the first quarter? what was cost inflation? and are you planning to take further pricing actions in this year?
dave naemura -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. just to frame it up for you, price was greater than cost. price was about a point, maybe a little bit more. we would anticipate positive price for the full year.
and we think that point of positive price even comes up a little bit over the course of the year, and we end up maybe closer to 1.5 points, again, dynamic environment, but that's how i'll color it for you.
david ridley-lane -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
thank you very much.
operator
your next question comes from the line of david raso with evercore isi.
david raso -- evercore isi -- analyst
hi. good morning. my question relates to your comment about the m&a landscape and your vision of what the areas you're focusing on. you mentioned retail solutions.
just a big-picture question. i'm curious how you see retail solutions fitting in with the current refueling stations and maybe a change how folks use refueling in the future just to give us a better sense of how you're thinking about retail solutions going forward.
mark morelli -- president and chief executive officer
look, there's a number of areas where the retail solutions, which, by the way, we absolutely believe is non-ice. retailers have had a growing format for many years, and these are profitable growing venues that are part of our local fabric that will continue to grow even as we get into electrification. the things that are really interesting here is that we're pretty uniquely positioned in the market because we penetrated into the point-of-sale systems, the head office, back-of-sales solutions here that really help manage how these retailers make money. and by the way, they make money, in many points, actual -- most of the money they make is not through pumping gas.
it's through all of the other retailing aspects. and so this is really their focus. of course, they want to make money and they want to grow. and we are -- have embedded ourselves into how they do that, and we're part of that making money.
so as we build that out on security of payments, as we build that out on financial or fintech, as we build that out on services that are being done there and point-of-sale systems, we think that's a robust area for growth.
david raso -- evercore isi -- analyst
and the geographic focus right now, would you say the opportunities are as prevalent in north america as they are internationally?
mark morelli -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. listen, i think when you look at the buying dynamic of the convenience store by country, there's a lot of evolution to this. and even if you look in the nordic countries in europe, there's pretty strong evolution of these formats in the areas that i'm talking about. and so this is absolutely an important area for growth in europe, north america.
and then high-growth markets, well, high-growth markets are going to build out the petrol refueling infrastructure for sure. countries like india have a lot there. but they're also moving up in their sophistication on automation and in the areas that i'm exactly talking about. not only that, there's a big opportunity on environmental solutions, things like vapor recovery.
i mean, these are big areas for growth. and that infrastructure is going to be in the ground for a long period of time. so there's lots of solutions there that are quite relevant to us based on our position.
david raso -- evercore isi -- analyst
thank you very much.

your next question comes the line of jeff sprague with vertical research.
jeff sprague -- vertical research -- analyst
good morning, everybody. hey, two for me if i could squeeze two in. first, just on matco. can you elaborate a little bit more of just kind of what you're seeing kind of underpinning the demand? would you view it as just kind of a bit of a pent-up recovery? i would not suspect that maybe the shortage of new vehicles or anything is impacting aftermarket demand yet.
but if you have any thoughts about that, that would be kind of an interesting footnote maybe to the main question.
mark morelli -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. matco is up. it's been a great business for us for a long period of time. and if you see what happened in third quarter with this really strong v-shape recovery, it shows the resiliency of serving the last mile.
and it's one of our more profitable businesses, as you know. what's really interesting there is that where we're seeing growth come from is really strong same-store sales. now what's happened to this industry historically is that miles driven has typically been the major driver. but miles driven is actually down year over year.
so it's not the major driver right now. and the technician count is actually down a little bit as well. but what's happening is these [technical difficulty]
operator
ladies and gentlemen, we are currently experiencing technical difficulties. please stand by while we reconnect our speakers. one moment. you may proceed.
mark morelli -- president and chief executive officer
hey, jeff, this is mark morelli. you know, it's never happened to me before over the years i've done this, but we actually lost our line, so i apologize for that. but jeff, did you hear the answer to the question on matco? or is there anything you want me to reframe?
jeff sprague -- vertical research -- analyst
no. you know, where we -- and interestingly, i think there's eight or 10 conference calls that have blown out this season. maybe our telecom infrastructure in the country has fallen apart or something. it's very strange.
mark morelli -- president and chief executive officer
yes.
jeff sprague -- vertical research -- analyst
but you know, what i said was driven -- down and tech count is down. and you were going to get to the -- yes, but we're driving because and i -- or the -- we're growing because -- and i did not get that.
mark morelli -- president and chief executive officer
ok. well, that was the punchline. you missed it. so let me reiterate that, i apologize.
look, it -- so what's driving it is the strong same-store sales and the technicians have more disposable income, so they're actually spending more on tools. the second aspect that is also really important to us is the net franchisees adds are up for us. we've deployed to a virtual way of adding franchisees. and we have a net positive.
and by the way, this is kind of unique to us. we've got about 30% of our territory in north america and canada that is not yet served by our distribution network that we continue to build out. as you know, this is one of our more profitable businesses, and we think it's a steady grower for quite some time.
jeff sprague -- vertical research -- analyst
and then just as a -- i mean, i guess it's kind of a big follow-up in a sense. but just coming back to kind of some of the point-of-sale opportunities and the like. i'm just curious, is there any decent information? or do you have a sense yourself of how much in-store traffic at dc stores is driven by a stop to fuel up? i'm sure they're highly correlated, but i'm wondering if it's 90% of sales, 80% of sales, or if you have any data around that question.
mark morelli -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. actually, we do have some data. first of all, it depends quite significantly by country. so there's a lot of spread there by country.
so i know a lot of people make an opinion on their own personal experience, but you think about this $650 billion market for convenience worldwide. it's a big market with a lot of variation that happens globally. but if you start looking at that data, you actually see the numbers of transactions that are actually occurring. and the number of transactions is a little bit of a different story than actually where the revenue comes from and where the profit is made.
so there indicates that there is a lot of pull actually for numbers of transactions that are actually beyond just refueling. and also, like i said, most of the money is made beyond refilling. so if you look at people like 7-eleven, circle k, wawa, sheetz, buc-ee's, how they're building out their franchises and retailing. it's a very interesting part of our local fabric that we think has growth opportunities.
jeff sprague -- vertical research -- analyst
great. thank you.

richard eastman -- robert w. baird & co. -- analyst
just a quick question. in the guidance for the full year, you raised the core guide -- core revenue guide by about 3 points. and given your commentary around gilbarco and the dispenser business, it sounds like that revenue dynamic is still in place, so a decline of $100 million to $150 million. so a question around this 3-point bump in guide.
is that highly weighted toward the diagnostics and repair business? and if so, is the price component that you're getting in diagnostics and repair at matco much than the 1% overall?
dave naemura -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
hey, rick, it's -- thanks for the question, rick. it's dave. i would say, first of all, the increase in the guide is balanced between the two platforms. we are definitely continuing to see strong demand in matco, and that's helped out.
but more broadly across the gvr business as well from the non-emv aspects of that business is a big driver as well. i would say, from a price standpoint, look, we're seeing price across the board. it's important in this inflationary environment. but as it relates to the guide, the price assumption that we brought into the year that we started the year with is about the same we're at now.
so we anticipate an inflationary environment and kind of built in our ability to take price, which we've historically proven the ability to do into the guide, and we've kind of stayed with that.
richard eastman -- robert w. baird & co. -- analyst
ok, ok. very good. and then just a follow-up question. on the telematics business, could you just maybe sift through -- again, we have another decline here, which i think is kind of at-plan for the first part of this year.
but how much of this decline now would you attribute to the hangover from eld? is there still a lot of churn going on here? or has that settled down? and then again, you have this dynamic around subscription growth and obviously the impact that can have on revenue growth. so maybe just sift through that a little bit. and is this telematics expected to be what platform for your smart city growth rate that you speak to on the m&a side? a lot there, but maybe you could just speak to that.
mark morelli -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. let me chat about that. so first of all, as you know, we've been working on turning this business around, and i'm very encouraged on the steps that we're making. this is the first quarter that we actually have positive annual recurring revenue, which is an important step to making organic growth in the business, which, of course, given that 95% of this business is saas, you amortize the sale over the life of the contract.
so it takes a while for that to begin to catch up to actual organic growth. so the real metric here is to watch annual recurring revenue and make sure we're growing it. so first of all, that's a big step in the right direction to be able to achieve that. that's also a function of annual contract value, as well as it's netted against churn.
so we're starting to see some growth on arr, which is important. and then to your question, we're continuing to see moderation in churn. the director platform, as you mentioned, had eld problems actually for many years. and we worked a lot last year to be able to stem some of those problems.
and more importantly, we have launched a new platform called tn360, which is a real-time ai-based platform. we're actually launching our eld offering in that here shortly, which will be an important aspect in north america. and so as we continue to work through that and build that out, that gives us opportunities for growth. and then you mentioned sort of smart city.
because telematics touches a lot of things. it's a big market. there's a lot of niche areas to grow in. one of the interesting areas that we have or we're beginning to untap is actually combining our technology with tn360, this telematics real-time operating system that includes ai, as i said, with our presence in cities through our gtt business or global traffic technologies.
and as you know, we have a market-leading brand in gtt called opticom, it controls stoplight. so when we incorporated telematics with the control of stoplights in a very contemporary sense, we call that opticom 360. we just launched that product. we got an iot award for 2021, actually fairly recently for that offering.
so i think there's lots of areas for us to be able to uncover to tap into growth niche markets where we have a unique area to play that we're going to continue to build out in.
richard eastman -- robert w. baird & co. -- analyst
and with the investment in that business, is that running at breakeven-ish? or is that still a losing a bit of money and not meant to --
mark morelli -- president and chief executive officer
no, it's tipped to profitable.
richard eastman -- robert w. baird & co. -- analyst
ok, ok.
mark morelli -- president and chief executive officer
but you know, it's not  you know, i think there's a lot more profit opportunity there. when you look at some of these businesses like telematics, obviously it has a big runway in front of it. we've got other businesses like hennessy. they're well below fleet margins as well.
so i think what we're doing is we're really trying to bottom out these opportunities to bring up those well-below fleet margin businesses. and we've got line of sight where we're beginning to get on the mend on these, and we think that's going to give us some meaningful uplift over the longer term.
richard eastman -- robert w. baird & co. -- analyst
got it. ok. great. thank you.
operator
your next question comes from the line of john inch with gordon haskett.
john inch -- gordon haskett research advisors -- analyst
thank you. good morning, everybody.
mark morelli -- president and chief executive officer
good morning.
john inch -- gordon haskett research advisors -- analyst
i want to start  good morning. your working capital is really impressive. and i want to know on how are you accomplishing this. and how do you guys think about kind of normal working capital to sales? sort of -- what sort of investments do you have to make as the business continues to expand? because i'm not -- to the naked eye, it's questionable whether this is sustainable, but maybe it is.
if you could comment on that, that would be great.
dave naemura -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
hey, john, thank you. it's dave. we are in, clearly, an unprecedented situation relative to working capital. i mean, when we exited last year, we exited kind of in a high single-digit percent of ltm sales, which was, frankly, better performance that we had seen in a long time.
well, i think that we have an -- kind of recorded history here. and it was -- in result of 2020, we saw a significant reduction from where we ended the year. so as we came into 2021, i've always talked about needing to add working capital. and i would have anticipated, frankly, entering the year that we would have added working capital in q1.
but again, unprecedented situation, and we actually saw further decline in working capital. so look, we have a real cost improvement culture around here, so i'm not going to say that we can't achieve these levels. but i would say that we don't think in the near term, at least, this is sustainable. and i anticipate still in our free cash flow guide for the year that we would add back 1 point, 1.5 points at least of working capital here.
and that's some of what we've factored into our thinking here. so we'll see how it develops. how are we doing it? we have significant playbooks. i won't go through all the pieces.
but i will tell you that we're seeing a lot of cash receipt easier than we had in the past. i think i have some theory around work-at-home environment. i have some theory around constraint of supply where people wanting -- want to get -- want to pay you and ensure they're getting delivery. and also inventory is low as some of the supply chain areas are constrained.
so i think we do see working capital normalize somewhat with demand, not back to historic levels, but i think we'll come up from here. but again, unprecedented situation where there's not a lot of past to look on. so we'll see how we work it.
john inch -- gordon haskett research advisors -- analyst
well, you guys are a continuous improvement company. as sales continue to climb for lots of different reasons, right, does inventory, can you call that, the inventory, in particular, to sales at a constant rate? or does that have to kind of get built back up and maybe more so because of the environment, right, just with various pinch points around supply chain and so forth?
dave naemura -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. i think that's the right characterization. i think given the environment, we want to see some more inventory come into the system right now. yes, we'll always look to get more productive from a working-capital standpoint.
but right now, we'd like -- there are some areas -- or there are some areas, of course, where we don't, but there's some areas where we'd like to see a little more inventory come into the system.
john inch -- gordon haskett research advisors -- analyst
the follow-up here is just on the dt order growth, slide 7, of 20%. dave, i think you mentioned that technicians have a lot of money, which is a curious comment. what was that number -- like in a good way, what would that number look like if you were to compare the dt order growth on a per-head basis or per-franchisee basis? trying to sort of understand what's really going on here. and i heard a little bit of mark's answer, but i'm still not quite sure.
i appreciate what the dynamic is that's driving this. is it sort of pandemic-related? is it new product-driven? is it a combination? is there one -- or maybe you could rank order the things. i don't know. any color there would be great.
thank you.
dave naemura -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. so we are -- first of all, at the -- we are seeing the spend per tech come up or the average sales per distributor to come up, combined with more distributors on the road. and that's not just from the new ads, but we're -- we have delinquencies at an all-time low. we're seeing fewer people on credit hold.
so -- and to your theory, what is driving that? well, yes, you've got to have new products. you got to have desirable products for people to buy, of course. but i also think the competition for share of wallet with the rest of life here has gotten a little bit easier. we're not competing with a disney cruise maybe, and people are deciding to not spend money on that vacation and buy tools and do other things.
so it's tough to tell exactly, and we spend a lot of time with distributors trying to understand. but it is clear in the point mark was making that people aren't spending money somewhere else. and the technician environment is healthy. they have money in their pockets, and they're choosing to spend it on tools.
john inch -- gordon haskett research advisors -- analyst
yeah. very impressive. thank you both. appreciate it.
dave naemura -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
thank you.
operator
you have a follow-up question from the line of nigel coe with wolfe research.
nigel coe -- wolfe research -- analyst
thanks for the follow-up here. i just want to maybe dig into the supply chain constraints that you've been referring to now for the past three or four months. it sounds it like you want to rebuild inventory a little bit, maybe that helps, but maybe just dig in a little bit deeper in terms of where you're seeing the real pressure points and the degree to which it's strolling your sales growth, or maybe causing some share to shift around a little bit here. any idea there would be helpful.
mark morelli -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. so look, this is supply chain managing that logistics. it's a knife fight on a daily basis. it is, no question, a lot of hard work that's being put in for the team.
and i do want to thank the teams because, in many times, it's thankless work. i mean, the time i hear about it is when it's not going as well as it should. and it's -- what's really the color behind driving it, clearly, chips around electronics for dispensers, that's clearly an area that is hard to manage. obviously, thinking that through, having a plan for every part, being able to forecast on manager suppliers appropriately.
that's all just hard work that is part of our vbs. and i couldn't be more proud of the -- their ability to do that. at the same time, on matco, a little bit of a different supply chain dynamic because, as you know, we source a lot of our products, and there's a long time on the water for much of this. and so managing that, quite honestly, if we could -- if we had worked down 50% more of our backlog, we would have hundreds of points -- of basis points of higher growth in the quarter.
and that's just a different dynamic altogether. and i think we're doing admirably well. but i wish we could be doing better on matco supply chain. it's just it's a little bit different dynamic than some of our competitors in the market where they build things and they can control it more in-house.
and given sort of the extended supply chains -- by the way, we're introducing new products all the time there. we have a vitality of about 30%, which means that 30% of those products are new that we're bringing to market. and so you've got to establish that supply chain, and it's all done through suppliers. so it's a different beast.
i think we're getting through. we're managing it much better quarter over quarter. but i'm pretty confident with our abilities here. i think we're doing better than most.
and i think we're going to continue to lean into that. but we're not out of the woods. there's no question about it. there's more to come.
there's more inflation to come. we'll be raising price. all these things are part of managing that. but thank you for the question.
nigel coe -- wolfe research -- analyst
thanks, mark. that's great. and then just quickly on tritium. i think at the end of this year, you got a decision to make regarding that option.
i know you're bound by confidentiality clauses, but is the cost to take control, is that market value kind of market price-based? or was there some option price already priced -- already negotiated there? any color there would be helpful.
dave naemura -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. hey, nigel, yeah, i understand. i think those aspects of the mechanisms and things are, i would say, are kind of captured in that confidentiality of the agreement, so we wouldn't be able to go there.
nigel coe -- wolfe research -- analyst
ok. i understand. yeah, all right. thanks, guys.
dave naemura -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
thanks, nigel.

and your last question comes from the line of richard eastman with baird.
richard eastman -- robert w. baird & co. -- analyst
yeah. thanks for the follow-up. mark, could you just speak to emea as a region? i think you referenced softness. i don't know if that was to western europe being down or if it just grew at a mid-single-digit rate.
but just speak to the softness that you were seeing there, obviously, on mobility side of the business, but --
mark morelli -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. so our emea business were -- i would say not emea, i would say europe to be more specific. that was down low double digit, but that was also impacted a lot by shutdowns and covid impact. so that was the issue that kind of came up in q1.
but middle east and africa is also a growth opportunity for us. so i would definitely separate a very different dynamic there that's happening. hopefully, that's helpful color.
richard eastman -- robert w. baird & co. -- analyst
and that slowdown on, you know, the covid side, does that business just end up in backlog then? i mean  or it just wasn't -- there just wasn't any orders there because of that?
mark morelli -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. no, i think there's clearly a backlog that can be served.
richard eastman -- robert w. baird & co. -- analyst
ok. ok, fair enough. thank you.

at this time, i'll turn the conference back over to mark for closing remarks.
mark morelli -- president and chief executive officer
yes. thank you, dorothy. look, our greater focus on a critical few items, growth, both taking advantage of emv to gain share, as well as ex emv growth, our focus on innovation, our focus on simplification to drive greater margins, i think all these things are gaining traction. and i couldn't be more proud of our team to have a strong start of the year to build momentum.
so more to come, folks. thank you for joining on today's call.

my name is emma, and i will be your call facilitator this morning. at this time, i would like to welcome everyone to the vontier corporation's third quarter 2021 earnings results conference call. [operator instructions] i would now like to turn the call over to ms. lisa curran, vice president of investor relations.
ms. curran, you may begin.
lisa curran -- vice president, investor relations
thank you, emma. good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on the call. with me today are mark morelli, our president and chief executive officer; and dave naemura, our senior vice president and chief financial officer. we will present certain non-gaap financial measures on today's call.
information required by sec regulation g relating to these non-gaap financial measures is available on the investors section of our website, www.vontier.com, under the heading financials. please note that, unless otherwise noted, the presented financial measures reflect year-over-year increases or decreases. during the call, we will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including statements regarding events or developments that we expect or anticipate will or may occur in the future. these forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, and actual results might differ materially from any forward-looking statements that we make today.
information regarding these factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements is available in our sec filings and subsequent quarterly report on form 10-q. these forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and we do not assume any obligation to update any forward-looking statements. with that, i'd like to turn the call over to mark. 
mark morelli -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, lisa, and good morning, everyone. i'm very proud of our third quarter performance. the team is making significant progress toward our profitable growth initiatives and portfolio diversification through the course of 2021. the team's exceptional execution features continuous improvement and deeper deployment of the vontier business system.
we delivered another quarter exceeding our guidance on all metrics despite a very challenging backdrop. we achieved nearly one point of core revenue growth and nearly 10% core revenue growth, excluding emv. given the supply chain headwinds that every other company is also encountering, i believe the real standout measure for vontier this quarter is our margin performance. we drove 90 basis points of adjusted gross margin expansion and 70 basis points of adjusted core operating margin.
this strong performance driving our earnings growth reflects the efforts by our world-class supply chain team and swift price and specific actions taken across the businesses to counter persistent inflation and worsening material availability as well as labor shortages. demand for our solutions is solid, with order growth, excluding emv, up mid single digits. and our ability to price continues to outpace inflation. we've managed positive price costs even in the face of dramatic cost increases associated with expedited freight, but it's becoming more and more challenging given the pace and rate of the inflationary and logistics headwinds.
and while we were able to reduce backlog during the quarter, levels remained elevated. and so at the end of the day, our ability to deliver growth really comes down to the availability of materials. as many of you know, the vontier businesses are short-cycled and we are continuing to derisk our supply chain through our simplification initiatives and by leveraging local partners with a diverse network. we are hyper-focused on securing this supply base.
daily management, one of the hallmark fundamentals of our business system, is critical to our success in this environment. global cross functional teams are collaborating virtually in real time to navigate a multitude of issues, for example, procurement and r&d engineers dynamically problem solve and rewrite softwares to accommodate alternative components. we are shipping by air when necessary. we operate with long-term value creation as our highest priority and that's why our mantra is delivery ahead of cost.
to that end, we remain diligent in our efforts to capitalize on growth opportunities. this was clearly evident at our recent vbs growth and innovation conference. we had nearly 70 of our senior commercial and engineering leaders together to share best practices. teams shared lessons learned ranging from simplification to improve focus and lean portfolio management to experimentation and digital transformation.
tbr leaders shared how they utilize an agile development process to collaborate closely with customers and to accelerate new product time to market. the recently launched vontier data and analytics hub helped automate complex analytics to reduce costs and respond to customers much more quickly at gtt. there are many more examples like these to illustrate how we're building better innovation capabilities. importantly, our efforts to improve return on every r&d dollar invested are gaining traction, and i look forward to keeping you updated on our progress.
in september, we completed our annual strategic reviews for the first time as a stand-alone company. i've never been more excited about our organic and inorganic growth and portfolio diversification opportunities as these reviews highlight the strength of our positions and the runway potential in our markets. our recently closed acquisition of drb exemplifies the playbook importance of focusing on attractive markets and company characteristics that deliver value. the drb team is making an immediate difference.
i'm excited about the depth of experience they bring with predictive analytics and behavioral economics. they uniquely engage and understand the consumer and deliver solutions to their customers solving high-value problems. they've invested wisely for growth. and you will learn more about their high-value workflow solutions and innovative business model in just a couple of weeks during the retail solutions virtual teach-in.
moving to the outlook. we're raising our full year 2021 adjusted diluted net eps guidance to $2.82 per share to $2.86 per share to include the impact of drb. this represents year-over-year growth of 14% to 16% or greater than 20% excluding the expected impact from emv. this includes continued assumptions for high single-digit core revenue growth and core adjusted operating margin expansion of more than 125 basis points.
we expect free cash flow conversion of approximately 90% to 95%, reflecting the lack of linearity due to the supply chain pressures on working capital. and just as we communicated at the beginning of the year, the tale of two halves comparison dynamics provide the best perspective for the second half growth rates. with that backdrop as a reminder, we are initiating our fourth quarter adjusted diluted net eps guidance of $0.77 to $0.81. this assumes a mid-single-digit core revenue decline and 50 to 75 basis points of adjusted core operating margin contraction as we look to manage the decremental in the 30% range.
we believe the unprecedented supply chain constraints limit upside opportunity, making the middle of the eps range the highest probability outcome. with that, i'll turn the call over to dave to provide the financial. dave?
dave naemura -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
thanks, mark. adjusted net earnings for the third quarter were $137 million, an increase of 2% from $134 million in the prior-year period. this translated to adjusted net earnings per share of $0.80. the increase in earnings was primarily driven by continued growth in our non-emv businesses and strong price, which offset the impact of material inflation, resulting in strong fall-through and approximately 70 basis points of core adjusted operating margin expansion in the quarter.
core revenue growth in the third quarter was approximately 1% amid strong demand and against the prior year q3, which benefited from a sharp recovery from the pandemic lows as well as regulatory-driven demand in north america and in the high-growth markets. the tale of two halves as we referred to it. sequentially, revenue grew mid single digits, directionally consistent with our historical seasonality. in the third quarter, core revenue growth was driven by our non-emv businesses, which grew approximately 10% and was mostly offset by the anticipated roll-off of emv and the regulatory driver in mexico, which benefited the second half of last year.
adjusted operating profit for the third quarter was $188 million, a growth of 4% compared to the prior-year period, primarily driven by revenue growth and solid operational execution as we managed through persistent inflationary pressures and supply chain disruptions across our operating companies. as mark stated, through broad pricing actions and the team's continued focus on executing on our profitable growth initiatives, we drove approximately 90 basis points of adjusted gross margin expansion and 70 basis points of adjusted core operating margin expansion, more than offsetting a headwind of approximately $10 million from raw material inflation and logistics. in the third quarter, we generated adjusted free cash flow of $119 million, a conversion of 87%, reflecting some build of working capital during the quarter, which remains at very low levels. importantly, year to date, our free cash flow conversion is more than 90% and approximately 100% after excluding the incremental federal tax payment paid in the second quarter of this year relating to our 2020 spend.
additionally, our net leverage stands at 2.9 times adjusted ebitda, up 1.2 turns from the prior quarter, reflecting the completion of the drb acquisition, which was successfully closed in september. looking at the performance of our two platforms. mobility technologies core revenue declined 1% as gvr declined slightly due to the roll-off of emv in north america and the fiscal regulation in mexico. excluding the impact of emv, gvr core revenue and bookings grew low teens and high single-digits, respectively, which highlights the continued demand momentum, especially in retail solutions, environmental solutions and further progress in high-growth markets.
in the high-growth markets, revenue grew low single-digits in the third quarter as continued momentum in india and middle east and africa was partially offset by the compare against the prior year mexico fiscal regulation. on a year-to-date basis, core growth in our high-growth markets is up high teens. core revenue growth in our diagnostics and repair technologies platform was 7%, driven by high single-digit demand at matco and compares with the third quarter of 2020 which saw a strong recovery from the pandemic impacts. matco continues to experience a strong demand environment and a growing distribution base, reflecting our fifth consecutive quarter of strong net franchisee additions following the pause during the height of the pandemic.
diagnostics and repair technologies backlog continues to remain elevated as we work through supply chain challenges in this robust demand environment. looking at total company sales regionally. as i mentioned, high-growth markets revenue grew low single-digits as a result of the tough mexico compare. and we continue to make progress in strategically important markets, including india, the middle east and africa, and latin america.
growth in the developed markets in total was up slightly in the third quarter as growth in western europe and in the non-emv portions of our north america business was offset by the impact of emv on our gvr north america business. we also continued to make progress on our profit improvement actions that will better position the company for the remainder of 2021 and beyond. we recognized a restructuring charge of approximately $3 million in the third quarter. we now anticipate that we will recognize a charge of around $15 million in 2021, a bit lower than we were previously planning as we continue to align the pace of actions relative to the strong demand environment.
this means a remaining charge of approximately $5 million would be shifted from q4 to the first quarter of next year, and we anticipate that we will still achieve our original savings objectives for 2022. turning to the outlook assumptions. for the full year 2021, we are maintaining our core revenue guide of high single-digit growth and our core operating margin expansion target of greater than 125 basis points in 2021, reflecting continued execution on our profitable growth initiatives and cost management and partially offset by persistent inflationary pressures, supply chain and logistics constraints and mix. that said, we are raising our outlook for adjusted earnings per share to a range of $2.82 to $2.86, growth of approximately 14% to 16% year over year, reflecting continued momentum and execution in our core business, combined with about $0.04 to $0.05 contribution for the in-year impact of the acquisition of drb.
we anticipate our full year effective tax rate to be around 23%, reflecting some benefit from tax planning initiatives that were implemented in the third quarter. and on free cash flow conversion, we have seen working capital increase for two consecutive quarters while still being at historically very low levels. we believe this will put some pressure on our free cash flow conversion and see that being around 90% to 95% for the full year. this, of course, includes the additional federal tax payment that we had in q2.
and excluding this, our conversion would be around 100% level that we typically expect. shifting to the fourth quarter. we expect a core revenue decline of mid-single digits as a result of the emv compare dynamic, while non-emv revenues are expected to still grow low single-digits despite a tough compare. looking on a two-year stack basis, given the uniqueness of the 2020 compare dynamic, non-emv growth is expected to be up high single-digits.
adjusted core operating margin is expected to contract 50 to 75 basis points. this primarily reflects the difficult comps related to the strength of matco, emv and mexico fiscal regulations in the prior-year period, consistent with the tale of two halves dynamic that we communicated when entering the year. as mark stated, this translates into adjusted earnings per share of $0.77 to $0.81. overall, the third quarter demonstrated our ability to execute in a very dynamic environment.
and as we round out the year, we are on pace with our planned actions to more than offset the earnings impact of emv sunset and to direct resources to take advantage of other growth drivers in attractive end markets. with that, i will turn it back to mark.
mark morelli -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, dave. before i wrap up, i want to remind you of the retail solutions teach-in on november 19, where aaron and dan will give you a deep dive into our gvr and drb retail-focused businesses. it will feature a high-quality portfolio of scale with a long runway of attractive expansion opportunities and secular growth drivers. in closing, i hope you see what i see, exceptional execution, our culture of vbs at work, and important progress on our profitable growth initiatives and portfolio diversification.
we're growing into a more focused, higher-quality, industrial technology company. we're excited about the opportunities that come with that to build better teams, better innovation and a better planet. we're well positioned to deliver sustainable mobility solutions to the market. our track record of transformation, strategic optionality, and strong cash generation drives our long-term value creation by will.
and we're committed to staying laser-focused on delivering more profitable growth and compounding returns. with that, i'll turn the call over to lisa so we can get to your questions.
lisa curran -- vice president, investor relations
thanks, mark. that concludes our formal comments. emma, we are now ready for questions.
",":
operator
[operator instructions] we'll take our first question from andy kaplowitz with citigroup.
andy kaplowitz -- citi -- analyst
mark or dave, could you give us more color into the puts and takes of your margin performance? obviously, good performance in q3 with the incrementals greater than 40%. and the swing to 30% decrementals in q4 isn't overly surprising. but as we think about that q4 decremental, you mentioned a big part of the issue is the tough comparison for emv strength and matco. but can you update us on how you're thinking about price versus material and logistics costs in q4 and really into '22, if possible? i know you mentioned price risk cost is positive in q3, but does that swing to negative in q4?
dave naemura -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
thanks, andy. this is dave. as we look into fourth, we anticipate that we will still be price/cost positive as we have been year to date. obviously, it's a pretty dynamic environment.
we want to see where we exit the year before giving you guys an update or steer toward 2022. what i can tell you, as we look toward the end of the year, we'll see where we exit. but as we sit here today, we don't anticipate any improvement next year in a meaningful manner, so we're going to position ourselves for that accordingly. staying price/cost positive was by far the biggest kind of margin action out there.
and as we work through the tale of two halves and we see emv coming off, that's obviously pretty good revenue. so there can be a mix headwind associated with that. but i think you've picked up on the [inaudible]. and i would finally add that, from a supply chain standpoint, the third was pretty dynamic, and we don't see things improving as we get into the fourth.
in fact, probably a little bit worse. and so we've kind of built some of that caution in as well. you talked about the incrementals and decrementals. we incremented well in the third.
that obviously probably has a little bit to do with the loss small numbers as we saw some uncertainty in the revenue conversion timing. we took some actions that have a magnified impact on incrementals given the lower growth on top. and as we look to the fourth against the tough compare, the way i think about it is we're decrementing at 30%, which is a much lower rate than we've incremented through the course of this year.
andy kaplowitz -- citi -- analyst
very helpful, dave. and then you mentioned gvr orders, excluding emv, grew high single digits, which seems relatively good, but maybe you can give us a little more color into how you're thinking about mobility as emv continues to wind down. i know you told us last quarter that there'll still be a similar headwind in '22 from wind down in '21. so do you see enough demand, for instance, from healthier developed world customers or faster-growing customers in developing countries such as india to promote growth as we go into '22?
mark morelli -- president and chief executive officer
yes. thank you for that question. look, i feel really good about the initiatives we're taking that are really driving that ex emv growth there. i think you're seeing it show up continually.
and what gives me some confidence there is that we have a set of profitable growth initiatives that are really taking hold and they're reading through. we saw strong growth in environmental, retail solutions, of course, auto repair through matco, as well as our spare parts business. so i think you mentioned the high-growth markets. there's a number of initiatives there, particularly out of india, middle east and africa, that have been really strong.
so we've lined up a pretty good slate of initiatives that we continue to deliver on, and we've got a lot of momentum around that. at the same time, when you go into next year, we got drb for a full year. they performed really well in the last -- the two weeks we had them. we've been really impressed with what we see so far.
so we're excited to add that to our portfolio, and i think you're going to see that read through really nicely next year, too. 
andy kaplowitz -- citi -- analyst
appreciate it, mark.

we'll go next to nigel coe with wolfe research.
brian lau -- wolfe research -- analyst
good morning, everybody. this is brian lau on for nigel. maybe i just wanted to talk about matco quick. so five strong quarters in a row of franchisee adds.
backlog remains elevated. just could you provide an update on the amount of geographies still available for franchisee adds? and then how are you thinking about all these franchisee adds ramping into 2022 perhaps driving some growth?
mark morelli -- president and chief executive officer
yes. thanks, brian, for the question. look, i understand why you're asking that. the business is performing really well.
to be really concise on your answer, we've got about 30% of our territories that are open and available to us, which is kind of unique to compared to the higher-quality peers in that space. and we've been building that out, and we feel really good about the progress they've been making. the backdrop here is a really strong environment for technicians that continue to buy. they're flush with cash, and they're out there investing in their businesses.
and that's reading through in our product lines. when you look at diagnostics, which is a higher-price item, they're continuing to -- actually, i would say, not continuing. they're actually stepping up purchases as well as high-dollar toolbox. and so when you think about sales, that's a real advantage.
the other thing that bodes well for it is that -- for this business is that we've got a really strong vitality, which means that every year we bring about 30% products that are new to market. and so the key here is to continue that vitality, particularly as we go into next year, which i'm very confident we can because we're providing solutions that technicians want and will continue them buying. so we're going to take advantage of the strong backdrop, and we're going to keep pushing it forward.
brian lau -- wolfe research -- analyst
great. and then just a quick follow-up. with some of the revenue, it sounds like pushing to the right, do you have any more visibility into 1q '22 versus what's normally a seasonally weaker quarter sequentially?
mark morelli -- president and chief executive officer
look, i think the way we're thinking about '22 is a strong setup, but we'll give you more color on that in february as we normally do. but the backdrop there is strong, great demand environment as well as these tremendous momentum from these profitable growth initiatives. so i think the setup is good.
dave naemura -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
i would add, brian, that we'll probably enter '22 with more backlog than we entered '21. but again, like the fourth quarter, it's going to come down to the supply environment. so we really want to see how that develops, and that will go a lot toward our visibility.
operator
we'll go next to steve tusa with j. p.  morgan.
steve tusa -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
can you maybe just talk about what you see today? if you kind of snap the line, what kind of price/cost would look like for next year?
dave naemura -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
well, look, year-to-date price/cost, and we anticipate through the end of the year has been pretty favorable. and as you know, this is always a big focus area for us. i think it's -- we're going to have to get a read on the inflationary environment for next year. as i said earlier, steve, i think we're assuming the worst as we make our plans for next year, but we have to see how that develops.
and that will clearly drive our actions. part of the setup for that is the fourth, and we're leaning into it. but i would also say that there's items beyond price/cost as we think of the profitability impact from inflation. we need to work all parts of the p&l in response to that.
mark, do you want to add to that?
mark morelli -- president and chief executive officer
yes. thanks, dave. look, steve, i think the key is that this environment is not going to change quickly. in other words, there's a lot of headwinds that are in this.
and we feel really good the way that we've worked through it so far. we have a really strong set of initiatives that are paying off. i'm happy to get into any detail that you all would like. but it's pretty clear we've been ahead of this curve from early on based on those initiatives.
and as we go into next year, we're counting on this environment to be underway, and we're rolling out even more initiatives that dig deeper. i think that's the nature of this continuous improvement mindset that we have as we continue to peel the onion on this.  a great example of that is our simplification efforts that actually reduce the number of skus that we need to chase, and it enables us to get better alternative sourcing and dig deeper on the components that really matter. and so i think that's sort of a new envelope that we're going to be pushing into next year that can even pay off more.
operator
we'll take the next question from andrew obin, bank of america.
david ridley-lane -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
this is david ridley-lane on for andrew. i'm just wondering in mobility tech, have you seen any slowdown, maybe anecdotally, around your customers' ability to complete projects and willingness to start new projects around labor availability, cost inflation, some of the supply chain issues? just wondering if your sort of orders -- we're hearing from your salespeople that these are sort of negative factors affecting your order pace.
mark morelli -- president and chief executive officer
yes. it's a fairly short answer, no. i think that there -- i understand the labor-constrained markets out there. and certainly, we're working through those ourselves.
but i feel like there's ways of finding solutions to that, and we've been pretty effective at doing that. and i think most of our customers are really in that. i'm not saying that, that doesn't exist, maybe in some pockets out there, but it doesn't read through when you add it all up.
david ridley-lane -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
got it. and then just -- i think we have most of the components on bridging the core operating margin expansion from third quarter down to the fourth quarter guidance. could you kind of give us a rank order of those in terms of some of the benefits, onetime benefits you were getting in the year-ago quarter versus what's getting incrementally worse?
dave naemura -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
well, look, it's tough for me to do the full bridge here in this venue, but i will say that i would steer you back to our 30% decrementals. and within that, obviously, the top line decline is associated with our emv product line, which is a reasonably high-margin item. so there's some mix impact associated with that. the price/cost assumption, we should assume that we continue to offset the margin impact, but that i would say that dynamic has continued to tighten as the years progressed, so we probably see the margin upside from price/cost tightening up as we go.
i think those are the big items.
operator
your next question comes from julian mitchell with barclays.
trish gorman -- barclays -- analyst
this is trish gorman on for julian. and so just back on the supply environment, can you guys talk a little bit more about its impact on gvr relative to diagnostics and repairs and then maybe if that's changed your expectations for emv headwinds in 2022 at all?
mark morelli -- president and chief executive officer
yes. happy to take that question. look, when you look at the environment for gvr, the biggest issue that we got to work through and the risk that we've been predominantly managing has been through some of the specific gvr factory-related material availability. and as i've said in our remarks, i think we've really worked through that admirably well.
i think we're really proud of the efforts that we're doing there to pay off. you talked about diagnostics and repair. of course, we've got a factory there for toolboxes. and we've got a lot of supply chain issues because we source a lot of products there.
but on both accounts, there's been risk, no question about that. and we could have shipped more, as dave said in his prepared remarks, if we can solve that better. and so that's clearly a work in progress. but i think when you think about how we think about risk there, it's mostly on material availability, somewhat on labor shortages and supply, as i said, but it doesn't rise to the specter of the material availability issues.
and we continue to work through it admirably well. so we're a little bit cautious on the environment, but we're optimistic we can continue to work it.
dave naemura -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
and on the emv point, i think we're going to see how the fourth comes together where we exit the year. but as of today, no update to our emv outlook for 2022 that we previously provided which is that the impact could be similar to what we see happening in 2021, which is $75 million to $100 million year-over-year decline.
trish gorman -- barclays -- analyst
great. that's very helpful. and then just maybe a follow-up. can you just remind us how typical pricing works in both of these segments, maybe just like ballpark, what is it typically in a normal year kind of low mid-single digit maybe? and then just the cadence of from when you announced the price increase, typically, how long does that take for it to become effective?
mark morelli -- president and chief executive officer
yes. so we had a number of price increases this year that were not sort of in schedule -- within schedule is a pricing increase for the end of the year that sets you up for the beginning of the year. and we've been pretty good at that, i would say, on a normal basis. what we started actually last year about this time was some deep analytics on strategic pricing that we could take.
we did not actually know that the environment for 2021 was going to be as inflationary as it's been. but we got an early start because we recognized there was a strategic pricing opportunity that came out of our simplification efforts. and so that read through on a number of price increases through the year based on getting -- and we got an early start accordingly. so i think maybe that gives you a little color on how we think about it and how we're going to continue to prosecute this -- what i view as a net opportunity for us in the market.
operator
[operator instructions] we'll take our next question from andrew buscaglia with berenberg.
andrew buscaglia -- berenberg capital markets -- analyst
so a lot of the near-term price/cost stuff is kind of taken, so i just want to ask kind of a more philosophical question. so i think drb was a great deal. it definitely serves the purpose that helps offset the emv headwind. but i think the market, the multiple, kind of beyond at that acquisition, and i'm wondering with m&a still a priority.
what -- where do you like investments in some of the kind of longer-term growth-year-type deals or acquisitions or investments? how are they prioritized, i think, going forward? i know that won't help you financially near term, but i wonder if the stock would just be more sensitive to kind of showing some strategic change toward some growth areas, albeit long term?
mark morelli -- president and chief executive officer
look, i think that's a great question. i do want to touch on drb, but just give me a minute because i want to answer your question really specifically. we see a range of deals in our pipeline. we are super excited about the cultivation that's been going on.
i mentioned in my prepared remarks we're coming out of our strategic reviews. and i think there's an excellent balance of really growthy-type deals out there. but we're looking at bolt-ons. we're looking at adjacencies like drb.
and we're looking at this growthier space that would provide early stage technologies that are more strategic over the longer term. and i think that balance is something you should expect both hardware and software. and we're excited about it. i think the space is to think about our retail solutions, telematics, smart cities, just to name a few.
but let me just touch on drb because i think it's really indicative of kind of also where we're going. this is a great asset. this is an end-to-end technology platform. it combines this deeply embedded point-of-sale technology and layers on top of it workflow and monitoring software.
it's got a great recurring revenue base. and it does things like integrated payments and digital marketing solutions. and so what's happening is you see a business moving up the technology stack. and that's exactly the kind of things that we also like as well.
so more to come. 
andrew buscaglia -- berenberg capital markets -- analyst
ok. yes. helpful. i agree.
i agree with that. it might just take some time for the market to kind of realize that. and i think -- if the stock is still kind of hanging out here into next year, where does share buyback -- where does that fall in your priority list? and if the stock is still kind of floundering, do you -- would that move up in your priority list?
dave naemura -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
look, i think our focus is always on providing the best opportunity for shareholder return. and we continue to think that's through deploying capital on m&a. obviously, things can change in the future, but that maintains our primary capital allocation priority right now, i would say.
operator
we'll go next to rob mason, baird.
rob mason -- baird -- analyst
i wanted to see if you could -- you spoke to the growth in environmental this quarter. i was curious how you view the runway on environmental here in the fourth quarter into next year and maybe juxtaposition against how you see that versus the retail solutions side of the business.
mark morelli -- president and chief executive officer
i think environmental has got drop to it. the fundamentals are clearly there. it's less impacted by emv. a great set of products and solutions that are connected as well as workflow solutions there.
and so we're continuing to push that opportunity, outstanding growth that you've seen. and so we've also launched a number of really innovative products to market this past year. and i think they're helping us really get better traction in that marketplace. so we feel good about where we are, and we're going to press every opportunity on that.
so i also feel good about that going into next year, a lot of momentum.
rob mason -- baird -- analyst
in retail solutions perspective as well?
mark morelli -- president and chief executive officer
well, the great thing is we get to talk to you on retail solutions on november 19. so we're pretty bullish on that opportunity. we'd love -- we're excited to showcase that to you, a number of really sticky customer-serving problems that not only help us sort of line up how customers can do better business and convenience retailing as well as what we are looking at in terms of car wash. so really happy to talk about that more in depth on november 19.
rob mason -- baird -- analyst
very good. we'll sit tight on that. and then just as a follow-up, there was the mention that you took backlog down some. was that the case in matco's business? or was that more in gvr?
dave naemura -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
that was more in gvr. we wish we had taken it down further. we talked about being supply chain constrained, and we would have been able to get more revenue out the door and more backlog off the books, for sure. so we're running at very high levels.
we talked about almost 40% year over year higher. but matco and gvr, were where we saw the primary challenges in getting backlog down and probably a little more gvr than matco.
operator
our next question comes from julian mitchell, barclays.
trish gorman -- barclays -- analyst
this is trish on again. just a follow-up for me. you mentioned backlog year over year, and you mentioned orders growth kind of ex gvr being up mid-single digits. what were the total company orders growth in the quarter? and i don't know if you have that by matco versus gvr or if you'll disclose that?
dave naemura -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yes. on an orders basis, on a year-over-year basis, we were down kind of that mid-single digits total up. it's really the emv dynamic. and heading into that tale of two halves that we talked about here.
so sequentially, we tend to see orders come down a little bit, but it's really the impact of emv on a year-over-year basis that i'm seeing here in the third. so continued robust demand environment and really most all things non-emv, what we see the emv dynamic picking it.
trish gorman -- barclays -- analyst
and just maybe following up on that with the emv dynamic. can you just talk about kind of margins by subsegments? because i would think we'd see a little bit of a difference there given those dynamics.
dave naemura -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yes. look, we don't get too granular on the margin impacts here, but emv is clearly above fleet average margin for, i would say, for vontier all up and definitely for gvr as well. and so as we work through that, that's a lot of the profitable growth initiatives that we see. but also matco hoped a lot because matco's a really strong margin business for us that we get some benefit from.
operator
there are no further questions at this time. i will turn the program back over to mark.
mark morelli -- president and chief executive officer
yes. thank you, emma. look, i want to take this opportunity to thank the supply chain team for their outstanding work and for the entire vontier team for embracing our core values for more than a year now and particularly the driven of core value because i believe that's been important establishing vontier as a company that achieves results. thanks for joining us on today's call, and have a good day.

mark morelli -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, lisa, and good morning, everyone. the fourth quarter close out a defining year for vontier. our team delivered another strong quarter ahead of earnings expectations. continued focus and execution positions us well for long-term success.
before moving it to the details of the quarter, i'd like to review the important progress we're making to drive portfolio diversification and unleash earnings growth potential. i'm pleased to report that we've met or exceeded plan in 2021 expectations in all areas. the team delivered a strong finish to the year in the face of an exceptionally challenging environment and an emv the top line headwind of roughly $100 million. full year 2021 adjusted earnings per share of $2.88 grew 17%, driven by 6% sales growth, which includes 7.4% core revenue growth and 160 basis points of adjusted core operating margin expansion.
excluding the emv headwind, core growth for the full year was approximately 15%, a testament to the team's unyielding execution. in addition to delivering double-digit earnings and top line growth, we delivered adjusted free cash flow conversion of 96% for the year, 102% when excluding the extra tax payment related to the spin. our cash performance is one of the financial hallmarks of our portfolio, and merits recognition for its mid-teens free cash flow margin. rigorous application and continuous improvement of the vontier business system is advancing our profitable growth initiatives and enhancing our competitive advantages.
we improved our return on r&d investment, more than doubling the gross margin contribution from new products. we gained share in core markets, drove continued matco franchisee growth, and improved profitability by over 200 basis points at both teletrac navman and hennessy. we successfully accelerated our portfolio diversification strategy, and deployed $965 million with the successful acquisition of drb. drb's excellent performance will be highlighted later.
we also established a $500 million retail solutions portfolio, which is accretive to our enterprise growth, margin, and software enabled profile. as highlighted in the november teach-in, this portfolio [audio gap] and on runway of attractive adjacencies for future m&a, [audio gap] compelling secular growth drivers. adding to our key achievements this year, our esg program continues to progress rapidly thanks to our recent commitments and accomplishments. in december, we commitment to reduce absolute scope one and scope two greenhouse gas emissions by 45% by 2030 from a 2020 base year, and a net zero goal by 2050.
in support of the paris climate agreement. we held our first energy kaizen at veeder-root in altoona, pennsylvania. harnessing vbs to reduce emissions, drive cost savings, and develop and engage our employees. on the employee safety front, we held our first ever vontier safety week and published our goals to achieve osha top quartile results in all of our businesses.
we're also active throughout our communities. in addition to donations through the vontier foundation, the vontier scholarship program awarded 10 new scholarships and 6 scholarship renewals in 2021 to the children of hard working employees. vontier also recently received a number of inclusion and diversity accolades. these include achieving a perfect score on the human rights campaign corporate equality index and earning our status as a 2022 military friendly employer.
our esg efforts are critical to our corporate strategy, and to the vitality of our organization, and i could not be more proud of our progress here. now i'd like to spend a couple of moments highlighting last week's energy transition investment announcement. we're committed to tackling decarbonization and transformative ways with our commitment to invest more than $500 million over the next five years. vontier is at the forefront of solving next gen mobility and transportation challenges, and this investment advances our industry leading efforts to address the global low-carbon energy transition.
part of this strategic pledge is the acquisition of driivz, a leading provider of ev charging and energy management software. the acquisition accelerates our portfolio diversification and e-mobility strategies. it also positions us well to capitalize on global ev charging, long-term secular growth drivers. driivz provides us with market leading technologies within the highest growth, most profitable network management software market segment.
while the transaction will be initially dilutive, we believe it provides a prudent opportunity to participate in an early stage grill technology company. business models in this sector are still developing and continue to evolve, with significant capital yet to be invested across the value chain. to that end, given our focus on the software segment, we chose not to exercise our option to buy tritium, but we remain supportive and expect them to realize their value proposition of which we are beneficiaries. given our 16% ownership position, this provides upside value to our stock, and the potential to add further dry powder for capital deployment.
these important outcomes demonstrate that we are realizing our vision of vontier as an industrial technology company focused on smart, sustainable solutions, and that we remain committed to building a better, stronger, more focused growth portfolio. the vontier value creation flywheel is taking effect, and we are well-positioned to continue to post strong results in 2022 and beyond. with that said, we're initiating our full year 2022 adjusted diluted net eps guidance range of $3.05 to $3.15, which includes our core revenue growth expectation of low to mid-single digits. adjusted core operating margin expansion of 30 basis points to 60 basis points.
and free cash flow conversion of approximately 100%. also included in our full year outlook is the accretive impact from the acquisition of drb, which will contribute high-teens to eps. furthermore, driven by drb's technology leadership and new side activity, we believe drb will contribute more than 300 basis points to the top line or high single-digit total growth at the enterprise level. our core growth outlook includes a more favorable view of the 2022 in the headwind of '25 to $50 million.
subsequently, we believe that 2023 will be the emv sunset trough with a year-over-year headwind of $300 million to $350 million. we are confident in our ability to more than offset these headwinds and expect earnings, and cash flow growth through this period. lastly, as part of our continued focus on creating shareholder value, we expect that we will be in a position to opportunistically purchase our stock early this year under our previously announced share repurchase program. we are also initiating our first quarter adjusted diluted eps guidance of $0.64 to $0.67.
in spite of the challenging comparison that resulted in a 14.3% core growth in the year ago period, we expect first quarter 2022 total growth of mid-single digits or a flat to low single-digit decline on a core basis and flat adjusted core operating margin. our first quarter outlook reflects continued supply chain impacts to backlog and sales conversion, but we are encouraged that the supply demand imbalance improves in the second half of the year. with that, i'll turn it over to dave to provide for the fourth quarter results and financial detail. dave. 
dave naemura -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
thanks, mark. adjusted net earnings for the fourth quarter $141 million, a decrease of 4% from $147 million in the prior year period. this translated to adjusted net earnings per share of $0.83. the decrease in earnings was driven by lower sales conversion as a result of the ongoing supply chain constraints and component shortages.
our strong price actions and better than expected bottom line results from our acquisition of drb partially offset the emv and ongoing inflation headwinds during the quarter. reported growth declined 3% and core revenue declined approximately 8% in the fourth quarter due to the expected decline of emv, as well as a tough comparison to the strong recovery that we experienced in q4 of 2020, which included not only a high point in quarterly shipments of emv, but also benefited from the mexico regulatory driver and overall high single-digit growth in our non-emv revenues. on an ex-emv basis, reported revenue grew high single-digits and core revenue was about flat, despite the otherwise difficult comparison. adjusted operating profit for the fourth quarter was $194 million, a decrease of 3% compared to the prior year, primarily driven by the lower revenue volumes, which was partially offset by 140 basis points of adjusted gross margin expansion, largely resulting from the accretive additions of drb.
adjusted core operating margin for the quarter decreased 70 basis points, reflecting the impact of the core revenue decline. adjusted operating margin was in line with the prior year at 24.6%. we continued to effectively offset the impact of raw material inflation with price actions, which was about net margin in the quarter. we did see some margin headwind from mix due to the size of the emv decline, and this was offset by the positive impact of drb on our operating margin.
in the fourth quarter, we generated adjusted free cash flow of $148 million, a conversion of 105%, reflecting a slight decrease in working capital during the quarter. working capital dollars at the end of q4 were 6.1% of the last 12 months sales, an increase from 5.6% low point in q1, but still very low historically. our full year adjusted free cash flow conversion was 96%, which included the additional tax payment in q2. shifting to liquidity, we ended the quarter with a cash balance of $573 million and had no borrowings under our $750 million credit facility.
our net leverage stands at 2.8 times adjusted ebitda at the end of 2021. as mark noted, we anticipate the deployment of some capital toward share repurchase as market conditions warrant and we will continue to assess this opportunity. looking at the performance of our two platforms, mobility technologies core revenue declined 11%, which reflects a low double-digit decline in core revenue at gbr. growth in environmental and services was more than offset by the decline in emv as well as lower sales conversion in both developed and high growth markets, given the impact from supply chain constraints and covid.
after including the revenue contribution from drb, the mobility technologies total revenue declined 4.5% [audio gap] q5 was our first full quarter -- q4 was our first full quarter with the drb in the portfolio, and we could not be more happy with the momentum and performance they have exhibited. drb delivered high-teens sales growth, primarily driven by double-digit growth in point-of-sale control systems. poor revenue growth in our diagnostics and repair technologies platform was 2%, driven by low single-digit growth that matco reflecting the continued strong demand environment against the recovery, compare from the prior year, partially offset by supply and labor constrained environment across the platform. diagnostics and repair bookings grew at a mid-single digit rate, demonstrating the continued demand backdrop, and also the challenges of sales conversion.
matco demonstrated a strong year of net new franchisee additions, which will be additive to the expected solid growth from same store sales in 2022. looking at total company sales regionally, the emv and other compared dynamics read through quite clearly. developed markets core revenue declined mid-single digits as a result of the emv impact in north america. in our high growth markets, we declined about 20%, compared to the mid-teens growth in the prior year q4, reflecting not only the challenging comparison but also supply chain and covid impact sales conversion.
high growth markets will, of course, remain lumpy, but we remain confident in areas such as india, middle east and africa, and latin america as long-term opportunities for outsized growth given future regulatory drivers investment in fueling infrastructure in our physical presence in these strategically important markets. we remain committed to our profit improvement actions that will better position the company in 2022 and beyond. during the fourth quarter, we recognized restructuring charges of approximately $4 million, slightly lower than we previously planned, as the timing of certain actions have now shifted into 2022. we now anticipate we will recognize 2022 charges of about $15 million, which is a continuation of posts in actions to drive simplification globally, and to align resources with our highest priority future growth opportunities.
we continue to expect we will achieve our original savings objectives for 2022 from 2021 [audio gap]. turning to the outlook assumptions for the full year 2022, we expect core revenue growth of low to mid-single digits, which includes an expected emv headwind $25 million to $50 million. our price actions have largely been priced into our backlog, and so we expect to be price cost positive in 2022. our core operating margin expansion target is 30 basis points to 60 basis points, reflecting continued execution on a profitable growth initiatives and cost management, partially offset by persistent inflationary pressures, supply chain and logistics constraints, and mix.
that said, we are establishing our full year outlook for adjusted earnings per share at a range of $3.05 to $3.15 , reflecting continued momentum and execution in our core business, as well as an expected high-teens cents contribution from the full year impact of the drb acquisition, partially offset by some dilution from driivz in the high single-digit cents per share range. we anticipate our full year effective tax rate to be around 23% as we capture the benefits from our ongoing tax planning initiatives. we enjoy a capex light business model with capital expenditures in 2021, a $48 million, or about 1.6% of sales and we expect capex of about 1.5% of sales in 2022. ask for free cash flow conversion, after seeing working capital increase in the second and third quarters of 2021, working capital decreased to very low levels again in the fourth quarter.
while we anticipate some normalization of working capital levels in 2022, we expect free cash flow conversion for the full year of 2022 to be approximately 100%. moving on to the first quarter of 2022, we expect core revenue will be a decline of low single-digits to flat as mid-single digit core growth in our non-emv businesses, only partially offset to the ongoing sales conversion headwinds, and reflects the difficult mexico compare and the continued tough comp on emv, which was strong in '21 ahead of the adoption deadline. adjusted core operating margin is expected to be flat, reflecting our continued execution in a supply constrained environment. as mark stated, this translates into a [audio gap] per share of $0.64 to $0.67 in the quarter.
with that, i'll turn it back to mark. 
mark morelli -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, dave. to wrap up, as i said a year ago at this time, 2021 would be an important springboard to a multi-year transformation with a long runway of opportunities. i'm incredibly proud of our team's execution this past year and the progress made toward our strategic and financial priorities, but there still remains much to do. while we expect supply chain and covid related headwinds to extend into early 2022, we're encouraged by the underlying demand for our solutions, order growth, and backlog trends.
in fact, at the matco sales expo, which was held just last week, results exceeded our expectations as orders per franchise [audio gap] record levels with double-digit growth versus pre-pandemic levels. and so we honor 2022 from a position of strength. we have strong, steady demand pricing power, and a track record of successfully navigating unprecedented headwinds. and we're leaning into what's ahead.
we're positioned in the portfolio for accelerated profitable growth, and making incremental investments targeting high return growth opportunities. i'm confident in our ability to continue to successfully execute organically and inorganically to deliver accelerated earnings and cash flow growth through the emv sunset and beyond. we remain committed to unlocking shareholder value for the long-term. we will continue to compete for your investment through prudent, and disciplined capital deployment, as well as continuing to deliver strong financial performance.
one last item before we move to q&a, i'm pleased to announce that our 2022 investor day will be held in september in new york. we look forward to sharing a more in-depth view of our portfolio strategy and key growth initiatives in addition to providing long-term targets, highlighting the power of the vontier value creation flywheel, and compounding growth algorithm. with that, i'd like to turn the call over to lisa. lisa.

[operator instructions] and we will take our first question from steve tusa with jpmorgan. your line is now open.
steve tusa -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
hi, guys, good morning. can you just clarify a little bit around the, i'm sorry to start to kick it off with an emv question, but can you just clarify the revenue trajectory here? you said $300 million to $350 million of headwind in '23 and then that'll be, i guess, the trough of that revenue base. what was that revenue base in '21? just as a starting point, maybe we could just like really clarify those statements?
dave naemura -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. sure, steve. so obviously, we still have significant revenues in emv, even though it's declining. so we were in the low $600 millions, i would estimate for 2021, i think when you look at '21 and '22 combined, we had talked about kind of previously, '21 being 75 to 100 and '22 being a similar decline.
i think what we saw be the high end of our decline range in '21 and part of that is due to supply and component problems. we probably shipped a little more emv backlog into 2022 maybe, 2020 $5 million or so, i think we're still in the range of what we were thinking. when we think it was then 23% decline, i think what we're trying to articulate is our current view of the shape of the tail. so the peak to trough is in the range of what we've always thought here, steve.
but i think what we see is a little more robust activity falling off, adoption happening a little faster. there's a whole bunch of variables that go as obviously as you guys know. what people will buy any share shifts that happen, the ultimate rate of adoption among thousands of customers. so it's tough to predict, but we've been pretty consistent here updating you folks with what we know when we know it and we exit the year, which is always a good time for updating our assumptions here with with this view to how the shape of the tail play out.
steve tusa -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
so, when you say trough of the -- do you mean trough of the of the year-over-year revenue headwind? or do you mean like that that actually that revenue base is now at a floor level and then just like a stable from there.
dave naemura -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. that's right, steve. so we've always thought that we had this compressed cycle as a result of emv. and what happens is we return to more of a normalized run rate.
now, one of the things that will impact that at the end of the day is getting back to its normalized refresh rate in the u.s. dispenser market. but ultimately, what we're talking about is the year decline to get back to a baseline business for u.s dispensers and payment systems.
mark morelli -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. what's new here, steve, because we've always said it's $400 million to $500 million. what's new is that we're defining the size in the shape of the tail. we're not changing the overall guidance we've given prior on the magnitude.
it's just that's the largest year-over-year decline is going to be 2023 and then we move on from there because it's done.
steve tusa -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
ok. so it's $600 million, is what you said is this a revenue base? and then that'll go down 25% to 50%, then it'll go down $300 million to $350 million. and then, we move into '24 or '25, it will basically stay at that level going forward. is that what you're saying?
dave naemura -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
then we get back to more of a normalized market condition. i think we're a little over $600 million. so, more like probably $640 million. ok.
then we get back to a normalized run rate in the u.s market and then we wouldn't experience. we don't think any material shift from emv going forward and we get back to growth in that market. i think, talking about the decline, it's also mark noted that we have significant actions to offset here. we continue to have our ex emv, non-emv portions of our business have historically been and we believe will continue to be steady growers in that mid-single digit range.
and as we do deals like drb, we tend to mix up that growth rate. so i think that fundamentally gets us to offsetting a significant amount of that year-over-year headwind in '23, it gets you to that low single-digit decline range or maybe close to flat. from there, it would take just a modest amount a between now and then to see your way to flat or even growth. and that's why mark noted, we would anticipate earnings and free cash flow expansion to the extent we're able to completely offset the headwind in that year.
that's how we're thinking about it today.
steve tusa -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
yeah. ok. and say sorry, one last quick one. what was the year-over-year revenue in that $640 million for '21? what was that in '20 so the year-over-year headwind this year?
dave naemura -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. in '21, we came down roughly $100 million -- and so then 2020 was the peak year.
steve tusa -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
great. thanks. so sorry for all the details. it's just obviously, with the way your stock is behaving, it's the elephant in the room.
that's just is helpful to clarify. so sorry for all the focus, but just want to get these revenue numbers right.
mark morelli -- president and chief executive officer
no, steve. i'm glad you're asking the question so we can make sure we're really clear on it. and i think what's happening in today's call is not only the size in the shape of it, but it's also our confidence to offset that because we have conviction around our roadmap there. so that's also news.
steve tusa -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
ok. great. thank you.
dave naemura -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
thank you.

we will take our next question from andy kaplowitz with citibank, or citigroup. your line is now open.
andy kaplowitz -- citi -- analyst
good morning, everyone.
dave naemura -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
good morning.
andy kaplowitz -- citi -- analyst
just focusing on '22 for a second, when you hosted your retail fueling day in november, i think you talked about expecting flattish organic growth for '22. and now you're talking about low to mid-single digits. so what's the difference here? what's the drivers? i know emv headwinds a little bit less in '22. and have you seen any improvement yet in logistics related issues? or omicron disruption that gives you more confidence in that second half ramp?
mark morelli -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. so first of all, i think we've got a lot of confidence in exiting the year and entering 2022 on what we call the profitable growth initiatives. so very significant traction we made there. so just let me give me a minute so i can just talk about that, give a little color around it.
first of all, we doubled our operating profit target based on simplification efforts, strategic pricing, better drop through on new products, as well as focus on high growth markets. and keep in mind, we have underperforming assets in our portfolio like hennessy and teletrac navman, that improved 200 basis points of all [inaudible] last year. so we're carrying a lot of momentum from our initiatives into 2022. of course, there is some backlog.
we left some revenue on the table in '20 in the in the end of the fourth quarter. and so we've got certainly the benefit of that. but i'll tell you, it is getting better on the supply chain elements, but it's still something that is, as you've heard a lot about in earnings calls it folks continue to work through. it's mostly around electronic components and semiconductors, printed circuit boards.
we are seeing some improvement in that. but clearly, i think by the second half of this year, we're going to see a better improvement. dave, you want to add any color there? 
dave naemura -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
that's sound great. ok. 
andy kaplowitz -- citi -- analyst
thanks for that, guys. and then maybe just mark, if you could talk about your decision to invest the $500 million in energy transition over five years? now that you brought out driivz, could you talk about driivz's growth in margin profile and what kind of a foothold does the company give you and the ev infrastructure focused software, quickly growing? i know you said it's dilutive, but you give us more color on the margin profile and where vontier goes from here in the ev infrastructure?
mark morelli -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. happy to talk about that. we're really excited because this announcement of these investments is, we're placing meaningful dollars to diversify our portfolio away from ice. and i think is providing a compelling opportunity.
so let me talk about what you just brought up here about driivz. first of all, it's a sub $10 million sales today. it's expected to grow high double-digits over the next five years. and i think when you look at what driivz provides, it is really a very compelling opportunity because it's an intelligent, cloud based software subscription business that is supporting the ev charging infrastructure.
and the question that you are is what are the margins? this is a very high margin segment of the business. it's very attractive because they provide this operating system. it's software, it provides operations management, energy optimization, billing, and roaming capabilities and driver self-service apps. and so think of this as a white label software business.
they're a leader in this space with 20% market share. it's not profitable on the bottom line because we're investing for growth, but on a gross margin, this is a very attractive place to play and it positions us in the highest segment of the market. dave, you want any color?
dave naemura -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. andy, you can imagine this is an early stage technology business, right? so we're not managing it. like we say, would a normal business that we might acquire in our normal operating company structure? it's not profitable and frankly, that's ok. that's where it should be.
what we're focused on is capturing the market and investing for growth. so i think more to come over the over the coming years. it should have a good software margin profiles and scales growing significantly at that early stage, high double-digit type rates. so we're really excited about the opportunity here for what this as an anchor asset here around the ev charging infrastructure space.
andy kaplowitz -- citi -- analyst
appreciate it, guys.
operator
and we will take our next question from andrew obin with bank of america. your line is now open.
mark morelli -- president and chief executive officer
morning andrew, can you hear us?
andrew obin -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
can you hear me now? sorry about that. 
mark morelli -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, we can. 
andrew obin -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
yeah. apologies. i still haven't figured out how to do the mute function. yeah.
so the question on pricing, can you just give more details as to what pricing was specifically in the fourth quarter? and what are your expectations for '22? or if you don't want to go there, what's the annualized benefit you'll get in '22 for pricing actions year-to-date?
dave naemura -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. so in the fourth quarter, we continue to see good price. we roundtrip a little bit of the early price that we took coming into '21, but we continue to see good price in the probably, close to 3% range as we were. as i noted in my remarks, price cost favorable in the in the fourth quarter, we did continue to see the gaap close, but we were accretive on the dollars in the margin standpoint from a price cost perspective.
as we look to '22, we carry in good price. we'll continue to price for inflation, and we anticipate that contributing to the year. we've talked about the full year low to mid-single. if you think about it from an ex emv perspective, probably maybe more like mid-to-high single growth perspective and revenue contributing a decent amount of that growth, and being price being price cost positive again in 2022.
andrew obin -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
and just a philosophical question, managing this downturn and emv for the next two years. if you look at industries with decent structure, if you look at electric [inaudible] is doing in the channel, if you look at the scope of price increases that hvac industry is able to achieve, given a favorable industry structure in north america, how do you think about potentially pushing the pricing further in the emv space? i doubt that your competitors would object. so, how do you balance volume versus price in emv as volumes continue to go down? why not accelerated? why not push pricing harder and just accelerate the decline and be over with it? just how do you think about it? thank you.
mark morelli -- president and chief executive officer
well, andew, the way that we think about price is we first of all, started last year with strategic pricing. i think it turned into structural pricing, and it is a really great underlying benefit that we started early last year that we're always going to price for this market in this opportunity. i think we've been, in my view, a leader on the pricing front, and i think we're going to take advantage of that going forward, particularly as emv rolls off and we are a market leader in the space. and so i think there's a lot of good things that have been happening on price, and we anticipate we're going to press that opportunity to the fullest.
andrew obin -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
thank you, appreciate the insights. 
operator
we'll take our next question from david raso with evercore. your line is now open.
david raso -- evercore isi -- analyst
hi, good morning. thank you for the time. i was just curious the conversations are being had at the board level, as well as top management level regarding capital redeployment. just given the way the stock's been acting really since the spin and you've made some fairly attractive acquisitions from drb to driivz your commitment to where you're going to invest.
the streets view of your earnings in '22 have gone up 24% since you spot on the stock's down 10%. so just looking at your evaluation, 9 times ebitda roughly 9 times the new eps guide. how are we balancing? clearly a story the street is not least appreciating when you look at how some of your peers trade, some of the parts would suggest stocks to be significantly above where it's trading. so i'm just curious.
i understand the portfolio transition needs, but what is the conversation right now about share repo and the significance of it versus some of these m&a opportunities that you're contemplating?
dave naemura -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
hi, david. thanks for the question. i guess what i would share is that, we've talked about m&a being a priority for us historically because of the portfolio transfer in that we're undergoing, which will take significant period of time, but also that we're focused on returning shareholder value and that share repo and m&a are not mutually exclusive. we agree with you, there's been a dislocation of value and especially in recent months here, we've seen stock traded what feels to us like a significant discount to intrinsic value of the stock.
and that's why you heard us come out on this call and say we would opportunistically be looking to buy depending on market conditions. in our own stock bath. so, again, not mutually exclusive. i think you've heard a little bit of a change in our direction here when it comes to the capital allocation.
so we'll see what market conditions bear here. but i think we're aligned with the sentiment market anyway. 
mark morelli -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. i think the important thing to say. it's also said in my remarks is that we compete for investment and we're focused on shareholder value and we don't see this as an or but certainly an opportunity of the current stock prices for  excellent returns. 
david raso -- evercore isi -- analyst
i appreciate that just the term opportunistic, where the stock has been for a while now and especially now, the opportunity seems readily available. so i'm just making sure we understand there's some understanding at the board level of the frustration with some shareholders and suspend because you're executing well. the m&a seems very logical and clearly, value creating, but there's some mismatch with how the street's perceiving the portfolio. so i  appreciate the comments.
and if we can just one more time clarify the '23 emv decline, the $300 million to $350 million is a one year decline that's not cumulative from the '21 level?
dave naemura -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
correct. that would be the decline '22 to '23, one year.
david raso -- evercore isi -- analyst
but your comment that you can offset it where you expect earnings to grow. the idea is you can offset roughly half of the revenue decline, but from cost outs mix, i assume some m&a, some repo. you would still expect eps to grow in '23. -- yeah, terrific.
dave naemura -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. which is based on an assumption that we offset more than half of the revenue decline, as you've noted. so i would see us offsetting, more than half a significant amount of the revenue decline, which would get the annual all up decline down to, say, a low-single digit, maybe in a little bit better decline to be flat and fully offset. if we saw some modest m&a between now and then, we think that would put us into that flatter better territory.
and really, that's if we were in that zone, given the activities we've already commenced upon. we would anticipate expanding earnings and free cash flow.
david raso -- evercore isi -- analyst
terrific. thank you very much, i appreciate the time.
mark morelli -- president and chief executive officer
oh. thank you for your feedback, david.
operator
and we'll take our next question from brian lau with wolfe research. your line is now open.
brian lau -- wolfe research -- analyst
hey, good morning, everybody. just wanted to touch on tritium briefly. you remind us this the status of the commercial agreement there. and when that lock-up is over?
mark morelli -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, absolutely. i said in my prepared remarks, we had 16% of outstanding shares, the lock-up ends in jul, and i just comment about tritium. we're very supportive of tritium and as they fulfill their value proposition. but keep in mind, whether we choose to remain a long-term shareholder at some level or monetize all or a portion of our stake, we believe there is value upside to vontier from the possible gains as well as additional dry powder.
so we're really happy with our position here.
brian lau -- wolfe research -- analyst
great. and then regarding teletrac navman, can you just talk a little bit about what drove the 200 bps of margin expansion and kind of what you're baking into the guide for 2022? and then also in the guide, is there any of that repo baked into the 305 or 315 number? just given the share count of about $171 million on your slides? thanks. 
dave naemura -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
let me take the second part first and then turn to mark for some of those details on the improvement. it's tough to know because we're going to be looking at market conditions here, but i think at a baseline i would [audio gap] minimum we're offsetting the impact of a dilution as a result of stock comp, which is called a $0.15 $0.02.
mark morelli -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. let me take the teletrac navman question. look, as you know, it's a turnaround story and we've been making really solid progress on it. we essentially applied vbs and we really reframed the opportunity on some more of the profitable growth segments, and as we understood the business model more.
also, with new management in the business, then we could really reframe it in a way to position it more for profitable growth. i think the other thing is really paid off for us is that we talked about churn in north america. and churn has been a tough thing for us to wrestle, but we've made really solid progress on that, of course, that helps pretty significantly. i think more importantly, with this turnaround story that in q4 and for the full fiscal year of 2021, we posted positive low-single digit arr growth or annual recurring revenue growth, and that's a really solid step in the right direction.
we haven't had positive arr growth in that business in a long time. so clearly with the reposition with the new platform tn360, the reducing churn that this is a step in the right direction. i think it really sets us up for accelerating into this fiscal year. so, i think the issue when you look at organic revenue growth, it takes a bit for arr to drop through to the [inaudible] because of the sas model and the length of the contracts, but clearly making really solid traction in the business.
operator
and we will take our next question from julian mitchell with barclays. your line is now open.
julian mitchell -- barclays -- analyst
thanks a lot. good morning. so just, maybe one last time on the emv, so you're revenue in year in 2023 from emv is saying is about $300 million, is that fair? and that compares with the $740 million number back in 2020. i just wanted to make sure i understood that.
and what you're then saying is off that three $300 million ish base. you then flat or slightly down thereafter. and also wanted to double check all of that in year $300 million to $350 million drop. should we assume a sort of 50% or so decremental margins still?
dave naemura -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. julian, i think you've directionally got it all correct. we return to that base, we'll see where we end up $275 million, $300 million ish by the time we get through the decline, hit the trough. we wouldn't expect large moves up and down then as a result of emv.
and this is above fleet average margin. i think 50% for a decremental is a reasonable thought. obviously, we're looking to realign those resources and do other things. and some of the revenue that comes on to offset some of this growth comes on at actually rates around there or better also.
so those are things we're focused on as we work through the offsets that mark talked about.
julian mitchell -- barclays -- analyst
that's helpful. thank you. and then i just wanted to clarify on the free cash flow guidance because dave you've mentioned some of the working capital moving parts for this year. so maybe put a fine a point on how you see working capital playing out? and just wanted to double check is that 100% conversion guide relative to the adjusted net income? for the 3, 10 or so of eps or relative to the gaap net income of 270 ish per share.
dave naemura -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
adjusted free cash flow conversion against adjusted net income. and to your point on working capital, julian, look, we've run it. we're really at unprecedented levels. we entered last year levels we hadn't seen, and then we enter this year, it even improved levels from that.
i personally given some of the activities that we have endeavored upon that i think will help us hold on to some of the benefits we've seen through the pandemic, as well as some of the structural improvements from doing acquisitions like drb, which has a really nice free cash flow profile. i would anticipate that we would not return to pre-pandemic levels of working capital in the business. having said that, there'll be headwind to the levels where we're operating at today as inventory, with some inventory safety stock back into the system where maybe today we're dissatisfied with the level it's at. but even with that, we anticipate being able to achieve that 100% conversion ratio.
julian mitchell -- barclays -- analyst
perfect. thank you.
dave naemura -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
thank you, julian.

and we'll take our next question from jeff sprague with vertical research. your line is now open.
jeff sprague -- vertical research partners -- analyst
thank you. good morning, everyone, jeff sprague here, just coming back to driivz if we could. just interested in the level of investment this might take, this obviously is going to be a very competitive space. and to the earlier point, i think maybe where dave raso was right, buying an expensive software business, when you trade at this [inaudible] and taking losses on investment is just a lot of friction in the p&l as you do that.
so when we think about this earnings headwind that we're dealing with in 2022 on driivz, do you think that moderates from here? or does this business require a substantial level of additional investment to get it to scale and make it competitively viable?
dave naemura -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
good question, jeff. i'll just make a couple of quick points. so we see this maybe at the op level starting out here being dilutive in the teens, millions of dollars. and yes, dilutive to our business model, for sure.
but we do believe there's a real opportunity here for value creation in this early stage asset. we were very fortunate to be in the position to have the option that we entered into really two years prior and given the developments that i've had over the last couple of years, we felt pretty fortunate. so yes, it's a headwind, but we really do believe it's a real opportunity for overall value creation for the broader vontier here. it'll take some investment, but we're really focused on the growth side of that investment and we think the longer term value creation opportunity here is very good.
i would make one more point that we have talked historically about a range of types and sizes of deals and where most of the m&a we look to prosecute in our funnels in our day-to-day work is much more aligned with something like a drb. we've said that these types of deals earlier stage more strategic, higher growth opportunity could be out there and this is surely one of those. mark, do you want to add anything? 
mark morelli -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. i think when you look at how we've made decision on capital deployment, that it's very disciplined, it's very much strategy led. this is something that we've been very close to in terms of this market timing. you see us, we did not buy into tritium.
we actually made that decision based on our strategy with our capital. but where we are stepping forward in this space because of our what we think is our ability not only to add value but to win in this space, and it will position us great for the mid and long-term. but going back to the capital allocation coming up in the near term because that's a long term play. and we announced $500 million of both inorganic as well as organic investment over five years.
but i think when you think of capital allocation, maybe more in the near term, it's really middle of the fairway deals like drb that you should think of.
jeff sprague -- vertical research partners -- analyst
right. and maybe just totally switching gears to a different topic. just looking at the auto aftermarket with what's going on with the shortage of new vehicles and what it's done to use car prices and the like. i just wonder if you see any discernible change in behavior in the auto aftermarket pricing power on tools? or big picture, if you could put a little bit of a bow on that question for us to be helpful.
dave naemura -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
just one thought. clearly, we're seeing a really healthy and market continue in matco, and a lot of that is tied to the health of the end-customer, which is the professional auto mechanic. so that remains a very healthy environment. we see that through and credit profiles and demand levels.
so it remains a very strong environment. i think we just had a recent matco expo. mark, you want to talk a little about -- 
mark morelli -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. really strong demand there, we continue to see things like diagnostic scan tools, where we launched maximus 4.0 last year, making great progress part of, i think that backdrop being such a strong market as well as toolboxes. so there's a pretty wide range of things that are being sold into the aftermarket, and we anticipate this will continue, there's legs to it'll continue for some time.
jeff sprague -- vertical research partners -- analyst
great. thank you.

[operator instructions] and we will take our next question from andrew buscaglia with berenberg.
andrew buscaglia -- berenberg capital markets -- analyst
hey, good morning, guys. -- so, one last emv question. please don't shoot me. but obviously, it seems like a little bit of new news, and i'm wondering why i guess why is that 2023 item kind of new? i guess why is it? is it something new to you that you weren't expecting? i guess, all the confusion is just like, i guess the street was not set up for modeling that in or are going to model that in now? it seems like a little bit bigger hole to fill than we were initially anticipating.
i'm just wondering what change on your end that you didn't have that visibility before?
dave naemura -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
well, it's always been i would say, it's really been about the shape of the tail. so we knew 2020 was going to be a peak and we would return at some level to more historical levels of performance in our us dispenser market. but it was at what pace we got there. we really have always understood what the larger customers were going to do, but there's over half of this market that's made up of 5,000, 6,000, 7,000 smaller customers that we service through distribution.
so it was really getting through. the adoption deadline seen how demand behaved and for us to get a little better view as to how the shape of the tail would play out. i think what we see this see happening now is adoption by folks not extending as long being pulled in and ostensibly completed here by the end of 2023. so i think the new news is dimensionalizing in the shape of the tail.
and over the last couple of years, i think we've tried to share what what the view was as contemporaneous as we've as we've had it. and there's so many assumptions that go into this we tried to be as transparent as we could when we had conviction around something. and i think, you hear us doing that again.
mark morelli -- president and chief executive officer
let me just jump in here, too -- i think the other thing that is new is clearly the the lens that we're bringing that, ok, fine, we know the shape of it. the magnitude didn't change, but we know the shapes who articulating that. but we're also articulating the confidence around this. look at the underlying growth rate for x in the bookings at mid to high single-digits.
and it is averaging higher with the acquisition of businesses like drb, and in the progress we're making on the profitable growth initiatives, the momentum that we have. so, we thought long and hard about how do we figure out this tail and also the offset to it. and i think you see the evidence of those offsets at work, particularly with that underlying ex emv, the bookings growth driver. and so, that's the confidence that we're also bringing in today's call.
andrew buscaglia -- berenberg capital markets -- analyst
ok. and maybe just one last one in a different area, that telematics business seems to be progressing well. we've got some new information with [inaudible] that's gone public and there's obviously a couple of bigger players in the space horizons. just kind of what is your how do you expect to compete with these powerhouses in telematics? or what makes you guys feel like you're different and continue to hold their own with a lot of the impressive competition that's out there?
mark morelli -- president and chief executive officer
look, it's a great market. it's a high growth market. it's very fragmented. there's lots of different ways to play that market.
truth be told, we had to get our feet under ourselves and recover from the technology that i think we're positioned well for that. but we have we have a strong global presence. we're number one in australia, new zealand, very strong presence in the uk, and the offerings that we have now are very contemporary and very reliable. but there's niche ways of playing this market because it is so big, so frothy, and so fragmented.
so i don't think you go and play head to head with some of the bigger players in the market, but there's lots of niche areas around that for us to further deploy our capabilities and strategy around. so keep in mind, this is a $180 million business, 95% sas. so there's a little bit of breadth to it. and really great positions to move in this market.
so excellent market.
andrew buscaglia -- berenberg capital markets -- analyst
ok. thanks.
operator
and we will take our next question from rob mason with baird. your line is now open.
rob mason -- robert w. baird and company -- analyst
yes. good morning, guys. where did backlog in the year?
dave naemura -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yes, backlog [audio gap] reasonably well on an apples to apples basis, about 25% year-over-year.
rob mason -- robert w. baird and company -- analyst
what does your your '22 guide, the low single, the mid-single-digit core growth, what does that assume in terms of backlog reduction within that?
dave naemura -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
i can't give you the exact percentage here, but clearly we anticipate some backlog reduction in that continuing as emv comes off. but, as we think ex emv, look, we talked about the year being low to mid-single digit core growth as we think ex emv for 2022, that's more of a mid to maybe to maybe high for the year. and i would say we would anticipate seeing similar performance on the order side. so i think the punch line is, i would frame it is that solid mid-single digit plus demand environment is what we expect from the order side continuing, once you sort through the emv and other compare noise here.
rob mason -- robert w. baird and company -- analyst
ok. that's helpful. and then last question, just you mentioned you're still on track with your repositioning restructuring effort. just remind us again, what the savings expectation was for '22? and any thoughts on the cadence of that? how that faces in?
dave naemura -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. so we look we spent just a little under $15 million this year. sorry, in 2021. we had anticipated spending a little more than that, we're seeing some actions push into 2022.
that's really us timing things and phasing things with things like emv, or we're taking some corresponding actions and we'll have a better than one times pay back on that spend that we had in 2021. so think closer to $20 million of savings. and that's the exit rate would exit the year at and the benefits we'll get in 2022. then we talked about some additional spend.
and really these things relate to this multi-year positioning around the simplification, profitable growth initiatives, and repositioning some resources to take advantage of emv and then reposition to other areas of growth as we make this large multi-year.
rob mason -- robert w. baird and company -- analyst
i see. thank you. i'll pass back.
operator
and we will take a follow up question from steve tusa with jpmorgan. your line is now open.
steve tusa -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
hey. sorry, guys, just one last quick one here. on the acquisition, you'd said a 3% contribution, what's that annual run rate now for drb? that's a little bit lower than i think what we had in our model. what's that business? what do you expect for annual revenues for that business in '22?
dave naemura -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. so this was $170 million ish business last year, maybe came in a little better. we saw really good growth in the fourth growing, double-digit mid-teens here in 2022.
steve tusa -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
ok. so $170 million and it'll grow mid-teens in '22. got it. ok.
thanks a lot. appreciate it. thanks.

we have reached our allotted time for questions. i will now turn the program back over to mark morelli for any additional or closing remarks.

thanks, britney. look, i'd like to take a moment just to thank the vontier team for their ability to focus and execute, and deliver a really strong year in the face of significant headwinds. we also made really important steps on our portfolio diversification and the progress in momentum positions us very well into 2022 and beyond to accelerate profitable growth. so thanks for joining on today's call.

thank you, katie. good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on the call. with me today are mark morelli, our president and chief executive officer; dave naemura, our senior vice president and chief financial officer; and ryan edelman, our incoming vice president of investor relations. we will present certain non-gaap financial measures on today's call.

mark morelli -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, lisa. good morning, everyone, and welcome to our second quarter earnings call. once again, our strong execution, price cost performance and capital allocation drove double-digit earnings growth, more than offsetting supply chain inflation and other headwinds. we delivered adjusted earnings per share of $0.72 or an increase of 18%, despite a challenging comparison year over year.
these strong results reflected positive operating leverage and a top-line beat. the beat was driven by double-digit growth at drb and environmental, more than offsetting underperformance in diagnostics and repair technologies, which i'll come back to. drb delivered yet another quarter of robust growth highlighting the strength of our capital deployment and portfolio strategy to accelerate non-ice business growth. furthermore, we leveraged the strength of our portfolio's cash generation and balance sheet by deploying $14 million of capital in the quarter toward share repurchase and followed with an additional $17 million in early july.
today's announcement of our bolt-on acquisition of invenco, and further actions on the planned divestitures that dave will discuss in more detail are important milestones toward building a better stronger, more focused growth portfolio. we're excited to acquire industry leader invenco and expand our software-enabled workflow solutions and subscription business model. invenco is a leading global provider of open platform retailing and payment hardware and software solutions. its disruptive edge computing technology road map and modular solutions offer extensibility across other retailing verticals.
this acquisition accelerates our digital strategy and better positions us to serve our customers' growing demand for digitally agile software systems. invenco is one of the top suppliers of retailing and payment solutions to the convenience retail industry worldwide. invenco's innovative, secure solutions are well-positioned to enable retailers to customize digital payments and consumer services as the energy markets evolve. invenco's expected 2022 revenue of $80 million with mid-40s gross margin, enhances vontier's growth and recurring revenue profile.
the acquisition purchase price is $80 million and is expected to achieve a very attractive 20% return on invested capital in three years. while we are still in the early stages of developing our m&a track record as a stand-alone company, i'm very pleased with our results and return profile. drb is pacing nicely toward delivering 10% roic within five years. and collectively, our $1.5 billion of capital deployed since separation is delivering double-digit returns in approximately three years.
we're also continuing to advance our profitable growth initiatives, and i'm encouraged by the progress and earnings potential in front of us, but we have more work to do. we have a strong runway of opportunities where we've made important early strides with strategic pricing and product line simplification, which is beginning to take hold. as an example, in gvr, we're on a multiyear journey to reduce our global dispenser platforms from 32 to 8. so far this year, we've eliminated six dispenser lines.
this is indicative of the cost structure opportunities we have to improve our efficiency, cost position and follow-on improvements to working capital. before moving to the outlook, i'd like to provide more color on the supply and demand environment, and broader backdrop. i'm incredibly pleased with our team's ability to deliver on profitable growth initiatives, leveraging vbs. strong price cost execution and drb performance resulted in an adjusted gross margin expansion of 100 basis points in the quarter.
strong execution rigor enabled us to deliver nearly 30% incrementals in the face of supply chain and inflationary headwinds. we expect supply to remain tight, but not get worse through the back half of the year. and while we are seeing deflation in some inputs like steel and aluminum, we're also forecasting higher freight. net-net, we have taken cost measures to protect our margin expansion outlook for the full year.
reflecting the strength and resiliency of our portfolio, the overall demand environment remains solid despite some pockets of softening at hennessy. and while we always expected a decline in order rates this quarter given peak growth of over 50% for non-emv orders in the prior-year period, underlying quarter trends and elevated backlog levels position us well for accelerated growth into the back half of this year and into 2023. that said, the dp businesses did underperform against our expectations in the second quarter, even though demand remains above pre-pandemic levels. we did not reduce backlog or growth or macro franchisee count as planned, primarily due to labor challenges and higher separations.
importantly, we've developed countermeasures to address the challenges within dt, including ramping up company-owned stores. and looking into the back half of the year, we subsequently lowered our assumptions for dt and also high-growth markets due to timing of large tender orders shifting out. that said, we are still maintaining our full year core revenue growth outlook primarily due to continued outperformance by drb and expectations of improving backlog. moving to the outlook.
we are holding our full year 2022 adjusted diluted net eps guidance to $3.20 to $3.30 per share. our core growth and adjusted core operating margin expansion assumptions remain the same at low to mid-single digits and 30 to 60 basis points, respectively. reflecting continued poor sales linearity and assumptions for increased working capital or expecting adjusted free cash flow conversion of approximately 90%. we're also initiating our third quarter adjusted diluted net eps guidance of $0.85 to $0.90, which includes assumptions of low single-digit core revenue growth and 20 to 40 basis points of adjusted core operating margin expansion.
looking beyond this year, i continue to have strong conviction in our ability to offset the peak emv headwind and deliver earnings growth and strong free cash flow conversion in 2023. dave will be walking you through a more detailed view of our assumptions to achieve this performance and our road map for accelerated growth that we introduced last quarter. with that, i'll turn the call over to dave to provide the financial results. dave?
dave naemura -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
thanks, mark. i'll get started with a brief summary of our performance in the quarter. adjusted net earnings for the second quarter were $116 million, an increase of 11.5% from $104 million in the prior-year period. this translated to adjusted net earnings per share of $0.72, an 18% increase compared to $0.61 in the prior-year period.
revenue grew 7.2%, with core revenue up 1.6%. our non-emv core growth was mid-single digits on a difficult compare, particularly for our diagnostics and repair businesses, where prior-year core growth was over 50%. growth was primarily driven by gvr, which grew mid-single digits on an overall core basis with growth in both developed and high-growth markets. gvr growth was driven by environmental, aftermarket and our cng business.
our compressed natural gas business has grown greater than 65% year to date off a relatively small base. and although not core yet, drb continued to demonstrate strong growth of high 20s. adjusted operating profit for the second quarter was $167 million, an increase of 10% compared to the prior-year period. gross margin expansion of almost 100 basis points reflected continued effective price cost management and the benefits of drb and other higher-margin solutions.
these favorable items helped offset production inefficiencies from a very back-end loaded quarter, driven by timing of supply, which i will elaborate on further in a bit. the increase in operating profit and strong execution drove incremental margin of nearly 30% and modest adjusted core operating margin expansion. excluding the $0.02 or $3 million dilutive impact of our energy transition investments, our incremental margin is high 30s. looking at the top-line performance of our two platforms.
in our mobility technologies platform, core revenue was three and a half percent, reflecting growth in gvr in developed and high-growth markets, particularly in north america, more than offsetting the sunsetting emv impact of nearly $15 million in the quarter. total growth in mobility technologies was 11% as drb continues to increase market share and increase share of wallet, while benefiting from their industry-leading position and a very strong market backdrop. drb has continued to outperform our expectations during this first year of ownership and will become core near the end of q3. in our diagnostic and repair technologies platform, core revenue declined 3.6% in the quarter as a result of both a difficult compare against the 57% growth in q2 of the prior year and also normalization of matco to a more typical growth and operating profile, but still above pre-pandemic levels.
the demand backdrop remains healthy as technician employment and auto repair remain at high levels. as mark referenced, we did experience some labor and other production challenges that prevented us from reducing backlog as much as we had anticipated, which remains an opportunity in the second half of the year. looking at total company sales regionally, north america core revenue grew low single digits due to gvr growth in non-emv applications more than offsetting a decline in emv. developed markets overall grew low single digits as strength in north america was partially offset by a mid-single-digit decline in western europe.
high-growth markets, which are typically lumpy, grew low single digits with strong double-digit growth in india, being partially offset in other areas, including eastern europe and china. we anticipate increased lumpiness in high-growth markets due to the broader macroeconomic and geopolitical factors as well as timing of tender orders. that may impact growth rates some in the near-term, but overall, we remain confident in this profitable growth initiative in the middle and long-term, given the attractive long-term secular drivers. moving on to the balance sheet.
we ended the quarter with a cash balance of just under $130 million and had $14 million of borrowings under our $750 million credit facility. our net leverage was 3.3 times adjusted ebitda at the end of the quarter and temporarily elevated due to the large cash outflow year to date related to share repurchase and acquisition activity and a temporary shift in the timing of free cash flow generation from first half to second half of the year. the quarter became significantly back-end loaded given supply chain issues and this lack of linearity shifted free cash flow from q2 to q3. further, we saw additional working capital build in inventory.
we maintain our commitment to investment-grade credit ratings and expect that our leverage will end the year below 3x net leverage, with our targeted range being between two and a half times and three times net. we will also have capacity for further free cash flow deployment in 2022, which will fund the announced acquisition of invenco and also additional share repurchase of approximately $100 million. these assumptions, of course, are influenced by market conditions and further m&a opportunity. in q2, we refreshed our repurchase authorization back up to $500 million and subsequently have deployed $31 million against that.
our total year to date share repurchase stands at $288 million as of today. these assumptions on leverage and capital deployment capacity do not consider any additional capital raise through divestiture activities. today, we disclosed assets for sale, and those being considered are the hennessy and gtt operating company. these businesses comprise about $175 million of annual revenue at a combined growth rate that is below the non-emv fleet average.
the impact of selling these businesses will be accretive to enterprise gross margins and operating margins by greater than 60 and 40 basis points, respectively. we anticipate the proceeds from divestiture will be used for some debt reduction and then also providing further available capital for deployment on m&a and/or share repurchase, which would more than offset the reduction in eps resulting from removing these businesses. in our full year 2022 guide, we have assumed approximately $0.12 to $0.13 of contribution from these combined businesses. returning to adjusted free cash flow conversion.
on a year-to-date basis, our conversion is 23%. we talked previously about the poor linearity we experienced in q1, which is typically a low point for free cash flow generation, and we saw further deterioration in q2. we anticipate that this dynamic will normalize over the second half of the year, but we also are seeing some upward pressure on our working capital levels, mostly in inventory as we build stock to satisfy demand. we anticipate that a combination of these factors will have some impact on our full year free cash flow conversion, and we will more likely be around the 90% range rather than the typical 100% portfolio generates.
turning to the outlook assumptions. for full year 2022, we are maintaining our core revenue guide of low to mid-single-digit growth, with non-emv growth of high single digits, as emv is still expected to be approximately a $50 million headwind. we also continue to expect core operating margin expansion of 30 to 60 basis points, reflecting our leveraging of vbs to dynamically adjust our cost structure to effectively adjust to demand levels and offset inflationary impacts. our confidence in delivering these results reflects continued execution on our profitable growth initiatives and price cost management and the resiliency of our portfolio through the cycle.
the full year eps guide is unchanged and adjusted earnings per share range of $3.20 to $3.30 and does not contemplate the impact of noted divestitures. we anticipate that the invenco acquisition will close in q3 and that it will be neutral to eps in 2022 and accretive in 2023 by mid-single-digit cents per share. taking a closer look at some of our other assumptions, we now expect full year 2022 weighted average share count to be approximately 161.4 million, which reflects the impact of the share repurchase activity conducted to date in 2022, but not the additional 100 million that i previously referred to. interest expense is anticipated to be $68 million, reflecting an increase in interest on the variable portion of our debt.
our guide also reflects the current foreign currency translation rates and the strengthening of the u.s. dollar since our last guide, which has had a $0.02 dilutive impact to the full year since our last update. our assumption on the full year effective tax rate remains at 23%. moving on to the third quarter of 2022.
we expect core revenue growth of low single digits with non-emv core growth of high single digits. this contemplates a supply environment similar to what we experienced in q2, still not normal, but more stable than what we experienced in previous quarters. adjusted core operating margin is expected to be 20 to 40 basis points. as mark stated, this translates into adjusted earnings per share of $0.85 to $0.90 in the quarter.
before turning it back to mark, i'd like to call your attention to slide 8. we presented this slide last quarter to better dimensionalize our conviction in our ability to offset the impact of the emv decline in 2023 and most importantly, how we expect to have a rebaseline core revenue growth rate of mid-single digits at accretive margins post the emv sunset, which we continue to expect completes in 2023. our conviction in accelerated growth and returns has not changed, and we continue to make progress on many fronts. the profitable growth initiatives and platform strategies continue to progress.
we have deployed further capital to share repurchase and announced the acquisition of invenco, demonstrating progress on the capital deployment section of this slide. also, the disclosure of our plans to divest hennessy and gtt demonstrates progress on the continuing evolution of our portfolio toward markets with attractive growth and margin profiles. with that, i will turn it back to mark.
mark morelli -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, dave. as dave highlighted, we are continuing to evolve the portfolio toward attractive markets and growth characteristics. and as we potentially enter a slower growth macroeconomic environment, i think it's worth reminding you of our portfolio's low cyclicality as best demonstrated in 2008, 2009, where sales were down only mid-single digits. we have a highly resilient portfolio of businesses, not correlated to pmi, but rather tied to a steady wave of regulatory drivers.
the economy of convenience, expansion of digital workflows, modernization and build-out of retail fueling infrastructure, and increasing complexity of the car park are attractive secular drivers of sustainable growth. and as the 2023 growth road map in slide 8 also illustrates we are taking advantage of the resiliency and strategic optionality inherent in our businesses to build a better, stronger, more focused growth portfolio. i want to underscore once again that while we believe continued m&a will be a part of our strategy to continue our multiyear portfolios transformation, we are not dogmatic in our approach. given the strength of our cash generation, we will balance investing in organic and inorganic opportunities along with returning capital to shareholders.
they are not mutually exclusive. we will continue to align our capital allocation priorities to the benefit of our shareholders, as we execute on the initiatives underway to drive further portfolio diversification, profitable growth and increased returns. we are driving a value-creating growth agenda. we are making meaningful progress on our most important priorities and shareholder commitments.
we are demonstrating strong execution and successfully delivering our profitable growth initiatives. we're showing we will make acquisitions and carry only assets that maximize value even at the expense of near-term earnings. bottom line, we are focused on long-term shareholder value, and we're accelerating returns. and lastly, before turning it over to lisa, i'd like to thank her for her important role in the successful launch of vontier as a public company, especially for her professionalism, intellect and investor relations expertise.
we are fortunate to have lisa staying on long enough to help ensure a smooth transition. with that, i'd like to welcome ryan edelman to the team. i believe many of you already know ryan from his prior roles in both ir and the sell side. ryan brings deep experience in our sector and a clear understanding of market dynamics.
we are very excited to have him aboard. with that, lisa, i wish you all the best in your next chapter, and i'll turn the call back over to you.
lisa curran -- vice president, investor relations
thanks for the kind words, mark. after the pleasure of working with ryan in the last month, i'm confident that you all are in the best of hands with him. katie, we are now ready for questions.

operator
thank you. [operator instructions] our first question will come from andrew obin with bank of america. your line is now open.
andrew obin -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
yes, good morning, mark, dave. lisa, thanks so much. we'll definitely miss you. and ryan, welcome, look forward to working with you.
first question on working capital. and you guys are considered to be some of the better operators out there. and i appreciate the shift in free cash flow story. what are you looking for to sort of what signposts should we look for, for the industry, for your supply chain to normalize? and this is a bigger picture question, right? i'm sort of taking it beyond vontier.
what's your best guess as to one thing to normal? and if they don't, what structural countermeasures can you take? do you need to carry sort of more buffer stock going forward? do you need to rethink your supply chains in 12 to 24 months? just more of a 30,000, 40,000 foot view on supply chain. thank you.
mark morelli -- president and chief executive officer
yes, andrew, thanks for the question. look, there's no question we've all been wrestling with the supply chain issues now for a while. and i'll absolutely say that we have taken measures already anticipating the supply chain just to be different. one of the things that we've talked about is a simplification program that we've engaged in that will flow right through to your suppliers.
so i think that's really the starting point, because if you can kind of consolidate and figure out and particularly figure out what region you get supply chain from. but going back to sort of the first part of your question there, it's continuing to be challenging. there's no question about it. i couldn't be more proud of what our team has done to be able to once again face some pretty significant issues and deliver on our commitments.
but at the same time, i anticipate we will be in this situation for a little bit longer. and hopefully, into 2023, we'll be able to see some of these things get better. clearly, we are seeing some things getting better on the semiconductor side and the electronic component side, but that's actually where most of the stuff still resides. so dave, do you want to -- any comments there?
dave naemura -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yes. i'd just add, andrew, you made a great point about the linearity. when we look at what happened in q2, it was really vbs at its finest. when we look at the -- how supply pushed production to the back end.
usually, as overall, we'd ship maybe 40% of the quarter in the third month, that was well up over 50%. when we look at our biggest factory where emv comes out of, actually half the quarter was shipped in about the second half of june, a little under half the quarter was shipped in the second half of june. and that was really vbs at its finest, but i think it puts a sharp point on some of the challenges that we fielded. and when you roll through in our shorter collection type region to push in receivables and free cash flow out of the quarter.
so just to put a highlight on that.
andrew obin -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
yes. and another question i have just a follow-up on m&a. i think your recent acquisition is sort of more middle of the fairway type of acquisition for you, but would you say that the m&a funnel is skewed more toward software solution? driivz was early stage, high growth. invenco, they've scaled through a decent level of profitability.
do you have a philosophy on what's the better time to acquire software firms, because it seems that's where the company is going? thanks.
mark morelli -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, i definitely wouldn't say that we're looking for software companies to acquire. i think there's a mix of things that are in our pipeline and that you can expect us to execute and cultivate our pipeline accordingly, because i think there are great returns. they can have some embedded hardware into it as well as software. and if you look at companies like invenco, you look at companies like drb, it has a combination of those.
they're not just software. now granted some of the alternative energy stuff that we did earlier in the year with driivz with an embedded technology, sparkion. those can be more software-oriented, but once again, a mix.
andrew obin -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
thank you so much.

yeah. so the industry is actually going through a very interesting, not only investment from an energy transition perspective, but also the sophistication of the retailing environment. and so you do see some really interesting formats being advanced on your local neighborhood store as well as your truck stop. and so we are -- there's no question that we're seeing that.
i've just come back from norway, where we're kind of looking at a company that has electrified a lot and they do a lot of home charging. but at the same time, you see those investments going into that format. and with higher gas prices, if they're a multinational oil company or they're backward integrated into the supply of gas, then they're going to have more margins here, and you certainly see the energy companies with higher margins. so i think the key thing is that companies like 7-eleven that have a very sophisticated set of offerings, you're going to see them making those investments in that energy transition and that retail environment.
so i think it's a really good growthy and forward-looking way of building out the mobility infrastructure. so we're pretty pleased on the position that we're in to be able to take advantage of those investments.
ryan cooke -- wolfe research -- analyst
great. that's very helpful. and then i also wanted to ask about the e-mobility space and see if you could provide some details surrounding the driivz investment. and i guess just how we should be thinking about those sort of investments moving forward?
mark morelli -- president and chief executive officer
yes. i'll turn it over to dave, but let me just give an opening on that. the bigger picture here is that we can play in and opportunity. we believe in the petrol-based infrastructure, particularly in high-growth markets growing out, but at the same time, if you look at the energy transition, we're actually very well-positioned to take advantage of that.
and investments like driivz with embedded technologies like sparkion give us a great platform for investment, because it's the operating system for the electric charging network that needs to be managed. and if you think about the bigger issues here about range anxiety, this is a huge growth space, and we're exactly at the right part of the value chain to not only grow but to grow profitably. once again, i'll go back to my norway visit, all the major players out there in the market doing electric charging have subscribed and are subscribing to that driivz operating system, i think it's a real testament to how we position ourselves for growth. and so it's a great position to be in right now.
ryan cooke -- wolfe research -- analyst
great. i really appreciate that. thank you.
lisa curran -- vice president, investor relations
yeah, i'd just point out to folks, too, that we have some new disclosures sizing the dilutive impact of those investments in our supplemental slides in slide 15 and 16 of the presentation. we heard you asking for that information, and so we provided that this quarter, right. thanks, katie. back to you.
operator
thank you. our next question will come from andy kaplowitz with citi. your line is now open.
unknown speaker
hi. this is piyush on behalf of andy. thanks for taking my question. so drb is growing nicely.
can you talk about the visibility through the remainder of the year at this business? and i think when you guys announced drb, you've talked about high single-digit growth over longer-term. so maybe provide some additional color on what's driving the double-digit growth you saw in the quarter and how being part of vontier helps drb achieve these growth rates?
mark morelli -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. so i think you broke it a little bit at the beginning of that question. i think what you asked was what's driving the growth rates for drb. is that correct?
unknown speaker
yes.
mark morelli -- president and chief executive officer
ok. so i think, first of all, we've -- it goes back to the strategy around m&a. we've picked the right property and we carefully did this. i think it shows the discipline around our m&a.
this is by far the market leader in the space. it's a combination of hardware and software. it's a deeply embedded end-to-end point-of-sale system where we layer on top of that workflow software solutions that really are high demand for customers. and inherently, it's in a growth space.
and so that's the first reason. the second reason is just our integration plan, i think, just hit the right level. this is not a hard integration, because it's a growthy type thing. we've done a significant amount of high-level changeover management there.
i think we've executed really well on that, too, taking advantage of a lot of the expertise already in the business. so i think the overall -- the strategic path and the execution path has worked incredibly well.
unknown speaker
got it. very helpful. and my follow-up question is we talked leverage here. like i think you expect leverage to be under three turns by the end of the year.
can you talk about how you're planning to balance continued deleveraging versus driving incremental capital deployment in the second half and maybe into 2023?
dave naemura -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yeah, sure. i mean i think we have a targeted range of below three times kind of that two and a half to three times net leverage that i talked about. and our free cash flow generation profile and ebitda growth should facilitate that with additional capital to deploy. so it's always dynamic.
m&a opportunities, we don't always get to pick when those come. we've talked about deploying additional capital $100 million over the second half of the year into share repurchase and the timing of which will depend on market conditions. but when conditions are right, we'll be more aggressive. so we have throughout the year develop.
and we also said, i would remind you that at times would be above three times with line of sight to coming back below that in a reasonable period of time. so i think our current profile reflects that. and frankly, the 3.3 times net leverage is a reflection of the opportunities we've taken to date over, well, $288 million of capital deployed to share repurchase and the deals we did in the first and then funding the invenco deal that we just announced.
unknown speaker
very helpful. i'll pass it along and good luck to these and good luck, ryan.
lisa curran -- vice president, investor relations
thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question will come from julian mitchell with barclays. your line is now open.
julian mitchell -- barclays -- analyst
hi, good morning. and yes, thanks, lisa, for all the help down the years. just wanted to follow up on the invenco deal. maybe help us understand recent organic sales growth rates in that business, what you're thinking about the top-line growth outlook there? and then when we're looking at earnings accretion for perhaps next year, are we thinking sort of single digits sense of eps accretion is the right sort of ballpark for that?
mark morelli -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. so let me jump in on this one. so their organic growth profile is something that -- it's kind of flattish, but it's something that we can really take advantage of. so let me just describe that, give a little bit color on it and then i'll turn it over to dave on the accretion side.
so first of all, this is an excellent strategic fit for us, and it really fits our portfolio diversification. and particularly the nature of this agile software that customers are really looking for, it really enhances our workflow solutions. and the key thing here is that not only is it a platform that is building out with some of our key customers, we have excellent leverage with our sales force, particularly it adds feature-rich environment for our high-growth market and we can leverage our existing sales force to be able to do that. and so we think that on the growth side, this is a -- really it's a rare opportunity for us to be able to leverage what we've got and what they've got to really have growth.
and then there's also a cost synergy side, too. it wasn't where your question went. but there was also costs included happy to go there. go ahead, dave, you want to talk about accretion.
dave naemura -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yeah, so i would first highlight what mark said. very synergy-rich deal, great channel synergies, but cost synergies as well. and the newer stage product they have on the software side fits hand in glove into our existing channel. so we're really excited about that.
so it's an interesting deal in that it has attributes of the bolt-on, which helps us drive returns. they're very synergy-rich but also on point strategy with their newer product on the software side. as far as accretion, we're looking at kind of mid-single-digits cents per share next year and beyond that, moving up to high-single digits cents per share.
julian mitchell -- barclays -- analyst
that's very helpful. thank you. and then maybe just my second question would be around the -- any update on sort of that emv outlook. i see you've got maybe a bigger headwind kind of third quarter than we thought and then a bigger step-up perhaps into the fourth quarter with that $30 million number.
maybe help us understand kind of where are we on the overall transition and kind of penetration of the installed base amid the sort of quarterly moving parts and maybe supply chain disruption. any change in perspectives on that emv waiting next year or over the next 12 months?
dave naemura -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yeah, julian. look, great question. so really, i would say nothing overall in the big picture has changed. i think what we're feeling the most here is that we actually satisfied more emv demand in the second than we had anticipated.
so if you think of an additional $10 million to $15 million that was part of that late june push got satisfied, and that really pulled in from the third, which kind of adds to that step-up. we're still satisfying a lot of demand in a pretty uncertain environment. so it will move around some, and we try to keep you guys updated as we can. we'll probably get to year-end before we update the penetration numbers, but as far as we think of -- we talked about still being at that $50 million headwind for the year and our view to next year.
no update to that.
julian mitchell -- barclays -- analyst
that's great. thank you.
dave naemura -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
thanks, julian.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from rob mason with baird. your line is now open.
rob mason -- robert w. baird and company -- analyst
yes. good morning. i wanted to see if you could just elaborate, mark, on some of the challenges you talked about at matco and how you see those playing out in the second half? and then specific to -- i thought i heard a comment around investment in company-owned stores, whether -- how new of a dynamic is that? what level of investment are you talking about and perhaps the time frame that we would see that materialize?
mark morelli -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, happy to, rob. so first of all, i think the backdrop here for matco is a pretty strong macro environment for them. the technician continues to be at high employment. they're getting paid well.
there's robust shop activity. so that -- all those things bear really well. and then the backdrop for complexity to repair is also really good, too. so i think that's great.
i think one of the biggest issues we're running up against is, first of all, year-over-year compare is pretty significant. matco had more than 50% organic growth in the prior-year period. and we knew that the quarter was going to be challenging, because of the timing of the matco expo was in q1 this year instead of q2, and so we did a lot of bookings according to that. but at the same time, we experienced supply chain disruptions and some -- had some labor issues associated mostly with our jamestown factory that we build toolboxes on.
and so we currently have a remedy plan in place for that, that i feel confident in. and at the same time, i think the build-out of the franchisee, which is a real opportunity for us and goes back to your question on company-owned stores as well, is that it's not something that we have focused on a lot historically, but i think some of these underserved geographies and territories, where we have a real advantage, because about 30% of our territories are not yet penetrated. but sometimes you have to jump start that a bit with a company-owned store, you might get that route started. and then it's easier to hire somebody into that area that would be able to take that on.
so it's kind of a transition plan for us. not necessarily a permanent plan. but we think that we've got to be creative to -- particularly in these rather underserved geographies with how to build that out, particularly with the labor constraints. it's harder to attract maybe labor in some of these opportunities.
so i think we've got an excellent value proposition, and it's just our effort here to be more creative.
rob mason -- robert w. baird and company -- analyst
i see. and dave, could you just give a little bit of color on how you see growth in the second half -- core growth in the second half of the year between the two platforms?
dave naemura -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. so we -- i think we continue to track after a reasonably slower start in the dt side of the business. we'll continue to track in the second to get to more of a low -- kind of a low single-digit core growth for the full year. and then i would say, overall, in the empty side of the house, we're still tracking to that mid-single digit to get to the full year guide that we articulated.
rob mason -- robert w. baird and company -- analyst
excellent. thank you.
operator
thank you. [operator instructions] our next question will come from ty hardwick with credit suisse. your line is now open.
unknown speaker
hi. good morning. i want to ask a question about invenco. is it correct -- understanding it correctly that it takes gvr a little bit beyond the gasoline forecourt and into the broader convenience store market? and also if you give the background as to what the contingent consideration is based on?
mark morelli -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. so if i understood your question, you're trying to understand how that's positioned. and i think it's a great question, because the key thing here is it is -- it does take us beyond the traditional c-store with our retail solutions platform. so if you think about what's happening here, this is a micro services software offering that offers a lot of modularity and customer choice, and you're seeing this in other type of retailing venues that have not shown up into the verticals around the retailing spaces that we serve.
and so not only is this great for the convenience store, there's other things part of the mobility infrastructure that we're very interested in, namely car washes as another thing, the repair solution side. so it's a very contemporary modular technology that customers are very interested in, because it drops out cost as well as lead time with offering solutions that they can pick and choose from. so it's a really big step up. if we were to do this development ourselves, it would take us a couple of years, and there's nothing available in the space that you can actually go out and develop.
so it's a great position for us to pick up.
dave naemura -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
but to just build on that a little bit. making sure -- i'm not sure i got your words right, but you talked about moving from the forecourt into the c-store. and i would just point out, we're already well into the c-store with our existing retail solutions. and as mark pointed out, this really fits in the globe with that and could take us into other verticals as well.
and the contingent consideration is based around revenue performance in the first kind of year, year and a half.
unknown speaker
ok, thank you. and just as a follow-up, can you tell us what pricing was in q2? and how you expect price cost to progress through the rest of the year?
dave naemura -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. so look, we again had pretty strong price. we were price cost positive, and we offset the margin impact from costs as well. so in other words, it was margin neutral.
so we did more than offset it just on a dollar basis. we've been running really well on a year-to-date basis, got off to an early start last year, as most people know. but -- the -- for the year, we still anticipate in the second half being price cost positive as well and also offsetting the margin impact. and so for the full year, we would anticipate being margin-neutral as well.
unknown speaker
thank you.
lisa curran -- vice president, investor relations
and we did come in almost six points of price in the quarter and still on track for kind of that mid-single-digit range for the year.
unknown speaker
thank you.
operator
thank you. it appears we have no further questions at this time. i would now like to turn the program back over to mark morelli for any additional or closing remarks.
mark morelli -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. thank you, katie. look, i couldn't be more encouraged in the track record that we're establishing and the runway of opportunities in front of us at vontier. i'm particularly thankful of the team for continuing to step up and work through challenges in this dynamic market environment.
and i think our work is resulting in a stronger, more growth-oriented portfolio. i couldn't be more encouraged by all this. so thanks for joining us on today's call, and have a nice day.

hello. my name is katie, and i will be your conference facilitator today. at this time, i would like to welcome everyone to the vontier corporation's second quarter 2022 earnings results conference call. [operator instructions] i would now like to turn the conference over to ms.
lisa curran, vice president of investor relations. ms. curran, you may begin.
lisa curran -- vice president, investor relations
thank you, katie. good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on the call. with me today are mark morelli, our president and chief executive officer; dave naemura, our senior vice president and chief financial officer; and ryan edelman, our incoming vice president of investor relations. we will present certain non-gaap financial measures on today's call.

mark morelli -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, lisa. good morning, everyone, and welcome to our second quarter earnings call. once again, our strong execution, price cost performance and capital allocation drove double-digit earnings growth, more than offsetting supply chain inflation and other headwinds. we delivered adjusted earnings per share of $0.72 or an increase of 18%, despite a challenging comparison year over year.
these strong results reflected positive operating leverage and a top-line beat. the beat was driven by double-digit growth at drb and environmental, more than offsetting underperformance in diagnostics and repair technologies, which i'll come back to. drb delivered yet another quarter of robust growth highlighting the strength of our capital deployment and portfolio strategy to accelerate non-ice business growth. furthermore, we leveraged the strength of our portfolio's cash generation and balance sheet by deploying $14 million of capital in the quarter toward share repurchase and followed with an additional $17 million in early july.
today's announcement of our bolt-on acquisition of invenco, and further actions on the planned divestitures that dave will discuss in more detail are important milestones toward building a better stronger, more focused growth portfolio. we're excited to acquire industry leader invenco and expand our software-enabled workflow solutions and subscription business model. invenco is a leading global provider of open platform retailing and payment hardware and software solutions. its disruptive edge computing technology road map and modular solutions offer extensibility across other retailing verticals.
this acquisition accelerates our digital strategy and better positions us to serve our customers' growing demand for digitally agile software systems. invenco is one of the top suppliers of retailing and payment solutions to the convenience retail industry worldwide. invenco's innovative, secure solutions are well-positioned to enable retailers to customize digital payments and consumer services as the energy markets evolve. invenco's expected 2022 revenue of $80 million with mid-40s gross margin, enhances vontier's growth and recurring revenue profile.
the acquisition purchase price is $80 million and is expected to achieve a very attractive 20% return on invested capital in three years. while we are still in the early stages of developing our m&a track record as a stand-alone company, i'm very pleased with our results and return profile. drb is pacing nicely toward delivering 10% roic within five years. and collectively, our $1.5 billion of capital deployed since separation is delivering double-digit returns in approximately three years.
we're also continuing to advance our profitable growth initiatives, and i'm encouraged by the progress and earnings potential in front of us, but we have more work to do. we have a strong runway of opportunities where we've made important early strides with strategic pricing and product line simplification, which is beginning to take hold. as an example, in gvr, we're on a multiyear journey to reduce our global dispenser platforms from 32 to 8. so far this year, we've eliminated six dispenser lines.
this is indicative of the cost structure opportunities we have to improve our efficiency, cost position and follow-on improvements to working capital. before moving to the outlook, i'd like to provide more color on the supply and demand environment, and broader backdrop. i'm incredibly pleased with our team's ability to deliver on profitable growth initiatives, leveraging vbs. strong price cost execution and drb performance resulted in an adjusted gross margin expansion of 100 basis points in the quarter.
strong execution rigor enabled us to deliver nearly 30% incrementals in the face of supply chain and inflationary headwinds. we expect supply to remain tight, but not get worse through the back half of the year. and while we are seeing deflation in some inputs like steel and aluminum, we're also forecasting higher freight. net-net, we have taken cost measures to protect our margin expansion outlook for the full year.
reflecting the strength and resiliency of our portfolio, the overall demand environment remains solid despite some pockets of softening at hennessy. and while we always expected a decline in order rates this quarter given peak growth of over 50% for non-emv orders in the prior-year period, underlying quarter trends and elevated backlog levels position us well for accelerated growth into the back half of this year and into 2023. that said, the dp businesses did underperform against our expectations in the second quarter, even though demand remains above pre-pandemic levels. we did not reduce backlog or growth or macro franchisee count as planned, primarily due to labor challenges and higher separations.
importantly, we've developed countermeasures to address the challenges within dt, including ramping up company-owned stores. and looking into the back half of the year, we subsequently lowered our assumptions for dt and also high-growth markets due to timing of large tender orders shifting out. that said, we are still maintaining our full year core revenue growth outlook primarily due to continued outperformance by drb and expectations of improving backlog. moving to the outlook.
we are holding our full year 2022 adjusted diluted net eps guidance to $3.20 to $3.30 per share. our core growth and adjusted core operating margin expansion assumptions remain the same at low to mid-single digits and 30 to 60 basis points, respectively. reflecting continued poor sales linearity and assumptions for increased working capital or expecting adjusted free cash flow conversion of approximately 90%. we're also initiating our third quarter adjusted diluted net eps guidance of $0.85 to $0.90, which includes assumptions of low single-digit core revenue growth and 20 to 40 basis points of adjusted core operating margin expansion.
looking beyond this year, i continue to have strong conviction in our ability to offset the peak emv headwind and deliver earnings growth and strong free cash flow conversion in 2023. dave will be walking you through a more detailed view of our assumptions to achieve this performance and our road map for accelerated growth that we introduced last quarter. with that, i'll turn the call over to dave to provide the financial results. dave?
dave naemura -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
thanks, mark. i'll get started with a brief summary of our performance in the quarter. adjusted net earnings for the second quarter were $116 million, an increase of 11.5% from $104 million in the prior-year period. this translated to adjusted net earnings per share of $0.72, an 18% increase compared to $0.61 in the prior-year period.
revenue grew 7.2%, with core revenue up 1.6%. our non-emv core growth was mid-single digits on a difficult compare, particularly for our diagnostics and repair businesses, where prior-year core growth was over 50%. growth was primarily driven by gvr, which grew mid-single digits on an overall core basis with growth in both developed and high-growth markets. gvr growth was driven by environmental, aftermarket and our cng business.
our compressed natural gas business has grown greater than 65% year to date off a relatively small base. and although not core yet, drb continued to demonstrate strong growth of high 20s. adjusted operating profit for the second quarter was $167 million, an increase of 10% compared to the prior-year period. gross margin expansion of almost 100 basis points reflected continued effective price cost management and the benefits of drb and other higher-margin solutions.
these favorable items helped offset production inefficiencies from a very back-end loaded quarter, driven by timing of supply, which i will elaborate on further in a bit. the increase in operating profit and strong execution drove incremental margin of nearly 30% and modest adjusted core operating margin expansion. excluding the $0.02 or $3 million dilutive impact of our energy transition investments, our incremental margin is high 30s. looking at the top-line performance of our two platforms.
in our mobility technologies platform, core revenue was three and a half percent, reflecting growth in gvr in developed and high-growth markets, particularly in north america, more than offsetting the sunsetting emv impact of nearly $15 million in the quarter. total growth in mobility technologies was 11% as drb continues to increase market share and increase share of wallet, while benefiting from their industry-leading position and a very strong market backdrop. drb has continued to outperform our expectations during this first year of ownership and will become core near the end of q3. in our diagnostic and repair technologies platform, core revenue declined 3.6% in the quarter as a result of both a difficult compare against the 57% growth in q2 of the prior year and also normalization of matco to a more typical growth and operating profile, but still above pre-pandemic levels.
the demand backdrop remains healthy as technician employment and auto repair remain at high levels. as mark referenced, we did experience some labor and other production challenges that prevented us from reducing backlog as much as we had anticipated, which remains an opportunity in the second half of the year. looking at total company sales regionally, north america core revenue grew low single digits due to gvr growth in non-emv applications more than offsetting a decline in emv. developed markets overall grew low single digits as strength in north america was partially offset by a mid-single-digit decline in western europe.
high-growth markets, which are typically lumpy, grew low single digits with strong double-digit growth in india, being partially offset in other areas, including eastern europe and china. we anticipate increased lumpiness in high-growth markets due to the broader macroeconomic and geopolitical factors as well as timing of tender orders. that may impact growth rates some in the near-term, but overall, we remain confident in this profitable growth initiative in the middle and long-term, given the attractive long-term secular drivers. moving on to the balance sheet.
we ended the quarter with a cash balance of just under $130 million and had $14 million of borrowings under our $750 million credit facility. our net leverage was 3.3 times adjusted ebitda at the end of the quarter and temporarily elevated due to the large cash outflow year to date related to share repurchase and acquisition activity and a temporary shift in the timing of free cash flow generation from first half to second half of the year. the quarter became significantly back-end loaded given supply chain issues and this lack of linearity shifted free cash flow from q2 to q3. further, we saw additional working capital build in inventory.
we maintain our commitment to investment-grade credit ratings and expect that our leverage will end the year below 3x net leverage, with our targeted range being between two and a half times and three times net. we will also have capacity for further free cash flow deployment in 2022, which will fund the announced acquisition of invenco and also additional share repurchase of approximately $100 million. these assumptions, of course, are influenced by market conditions and further m&a opportunity. in q2, we refreshed our repurchase authorization back up to $500 million and subsequently have deployed $31 million against that.
our total year to date share repurchase stands at $288 million as of today. these assumptions on leverage and capital deployment capacity do not consider any additional capital raise through divestiture activities. today, we disclosed assets for sale, and those being considered are the hennessy and gtt operating company. these businesses comprise about $175 million of annual revenue at a combined growth rate that is below the non-emv fleet average.
the impact of selling these businesses will be accretive to enterprise gross margins and operating margins by greater than 60 and 40 basis points, respectively. we anticipate the proceeds from divestiture will be used for some debt reduction and then also providing further available capital for deployment on m&a and/or share repurchase, which would more than offset the reduction in eps resulting from removing these businesses. in our full year 2022 guide, we have assumed approximately $0.12 to $0.13 of contribution from these combined businesses. returning to adjusted free cash flow conversion.
on a year-to-date basis, our conversion is 23%. we talked previously about the poor linearity we experienced in q1, which is typically a low point for free cash flow generation, and we saw further deterioration in q2. we anticipate that this dynamic will normalize over the second half of the year, but we also are seeing some upward pressure on our working capital levels, mostly in inventory as we build stock to satisfy demand. we anticipate that a combination of these factors will have some impact on our full year free cash flow conversion, and we will more likely be around the 90% range rather than the typical 100% portfolio generates.
turning to the outlook assumptions. for full year 2022, we are maintaining our core revenue guide of low to mid-single-digit growth, with non-emv growth of high single digits, as emv is still expected to be approximately a $50 million headwind. we also continue to expect core operating margin expansion of 30 to 60 basis points, reflecting our leveraging of vbs to dynamically adjust our cost structure to effectively adjust to demand levels and offset inflationary impacts. our confidence in delivering these results reflects continued execution on our profitable growth initiatives and price cost management and the resiliency of our portfolio through the cycle.
the full year eps guide is unchanged and adjusted earnings per share range of $3.20 to $3.30 and does not contemplate the impact of noted divestitures. we anticipate that the invenco acquisition will close in q3 and that it will be neutral to eps in 2022 and accretive in 2023 by mid-single-digit cents per share. taking a closer look at some of our other assumptions, we now expect full year 2022 weighted average share count to be approximately 161.4 million, which reflects the impact of the share repurchase activity conducted to date in 2022, but not the additional 100 million that i previously referred to. interest expense is anticipated to be $68 million, reflecting an increase in interest on the variable portion of our debt.
our guide also reflects the current foreign currency translation rates and the strengthening of the u.s. dollar since our last guide, which has had a $0.02 dilutive impact to the full year since our last update. our assumption on the full year effective tax rate remains at 23%. moving on to the third quarter of 2022.
we expect core revenue growth of low single digits with non-emv core growth of high single digits. this contemplates a supply environment similar to what we experienced in q2, still not normal, but more stable than what we experienced in previous quarters. adjusted core operating margin is expected to be 20 to 40 basis points. as mark stated, this translates into adjusted earnings per share of $0.85 to $0.90 in the quarter.
before turning it back to mark, i'd like to call your attention to slide 8. we presented this slide last quarter to better dimensionalize our conviction in our ability to offset the impact of the emv decline in 2023 and most importantly, how we expect to have a rebaseline core revenue growth rate of mid-single digits at accretive margins post the emv sunset, which we continue to expect completes in 2023. our conviction in accelerated growth and returns has not changed, and we continue to make progress on many fronts. the profitable growth initiatives and platform strategies continue to progress.
we have deployed further capital to share repurchase and announced the acquisition of invenco, demonstrating progress on the capital deployment section of this slide. also, the disclosure of our plans to divest hennessy and gtt demonstrates progress on the continuing evolution of our portfolio toward markets with attractive growth and margin profiles. with that, i will turn it back to mark.

thanks, dave. as dave highlighted, we are continuing to evolve the portfolio toward attractive markets and growth characteristics. and as we potentially enter a slower growth macroeconomic environment, i think it's worth reminding you of our portfolio's low cyclicality as best demonstrated in 2008, 2009, where sales were down only mid-single digits. we have a highly resilient portfolio of businesses, not correlated to pmi, but rather tied to a steady wave of regulatory drivers.
the economy of convenience, expansion of digital workflows, modernization and build-out of retail fueling infrastructure, and increasing complexity of the car park are attractive secular drivers of sustainable growth. and as the 2023 growth road map in slide 8 also illustrates we are taking advantage of the resiliency and strategic optionality inherent in our businesses to build a better, stronger, more focused growth portfolio. i want to underscore once again that while we believe continued m&a will be a part of our strategy to continue our multiyear portfolios transformation, we are not dogmatic in our approach. given the strength of our cash generation, we will balance investing in organic and inorganic opportunities along with returning capital to shareholders.
they are not mutually exclusive. we will continue to align our capital allocation priorities to the benefit of our shareholders, as we execute on the initiatives underway to drive further portfolio diversification, profitable growth and increased returns. we are driving a value-creating growth agenda. we are making meaningful progress on our most important priorities and shareholder commitments.
we are demonstrating strong execution and successfully delivering our profitable growth initiatives. we're showing we will make acquisitions and carry only assets that maximize value even at the expense of near-term earnings. bottom line, we are focused on long-term shareholder value, and we're accelerating returns. and lastly, before turning it over to lisa, i'd like to thank her for her important role in the successful launch of vontier as a public company, especially for her professionalism, intellect and investor relations expertise.
we are fortunate to have lisa staying on long enough to help ensure a smooth transition. with that, i'd like to welcome ryan edelman to the team. i believe many of you already know ryan from his prior roles in both ir and the sell side. ryan brings deep experience in our sector and a clear understanding of market dynamics.
we are very excited to have him aboard. with that, lisa, i wish you all the best in your next chapter, and i'll turn the call back over to you.
lisa curran -- vice president, investor relations
thanks for the kind words, mark. after the pleasure of working with ryan in the last month, i'm confident that you all are in the best of hands with him. katie, we are now ready for questions.

operator
thank you. [operator instructions] our first question will come from andrew obin with bank of america. your line is now open.
andrew obin -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
yes, good morning, mark, dave. lisa, thanks so much. we'll definitely miss you. and ryan, welcome, look forward to working with you.
first question on working capital. and you guys are considered to be some of the better operators out there. and i appreciate the shift in free cash flow story. what are you looking for to sort of what signposts should we look for, for the industry, for your supply chain to normalize? and this is a bigger picture question, right? i'm sort of taking it beyond vontier.
what's your best guess as to one thing to normal? and if they don't, what structural countermeasures can you take? do you need to carry sort of more buffer stock going forward? do you need to rethink your supply chains in 12 to 24 months? just more of a 30,000, 40,000 foot view on supply chain. thank you.
mark morelli -- president and chief executive officer
yes, andrew, thanks for the question. look, there's no question we've all been wrestling with the supply chain issues now for a while. and i'll absolutely say that we have taken measures already anticipating the supply chain just to be different. one of the things that we've talked about is a simplification program that we've engaged in that will flow right through to your suppliers.
so i think that's really the starting point, because if you can kind of consolidate and figure out and particularly figure out what region you get supply chain from. but going back to sort of the first part of your question there, it's continuing to be challenging. there's no question about it. i couldn't be more proud of what our team has done to be able to once again face some pretty significant issues and deliver on our commitments.
but at the same time, i anticipate we will be in this situation for a little bit longer. and hopefully, into 2023, we'll be able to see some of these things get better. clearly, we are seeing some things getting better on the semiconductor side and the electronic component side, but that's actually where most of the stuff still resides. so dave, do you want to -- any comments there?
dave naemura -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yes. i'd just add, andrew, you made a great point about the linearity. when we look at what happened in q2, it was really vbs at its finest. when we look at the -- how supply pushed production to the back end.
usually, as overall, we'd ship maybe 40% of the quarter in the third month, that was well up over 50%. when we look at our biggest factory where emv comes out of, actually half the quarter was shipped in about the second half of june, a little under half the quarter was shipped in the second half of june. and that was really vbs at its finest, but i think it puts a sharp point on some of the challenges that we fielded. and when you roll through in our shorter collection type region to push in receivables and free cash flow out of the quarter.
so just to put a highlight on that.
andrew obin -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
yes. and another question i have just a follow-up on m&a. i think your recent acquisition is sort of more middle of the fairway type of acquisition for you, but would you say that the m&a funnel is skewed more toward software solution? driivz was early stage, high growth. invenco, they've scaled through a decent level of profitability.
do you have a philosophy on what's the better time to acquire software firms, because it seems that's where the company is going? thanks.
mark morelli -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, i definitely wouldn't say that we're looking for software companies to acquire. i think there's a mix of things that are in our pipeline and that you can expect us to execute and cultivate our pipeline accordingly, because i think there are great returns. they can have some embedded hardware into it as well as software. and if you look at companies like invenco, you look at companies like drb, it has a combination of those.
they're not just software. now granted some of the alternative energy stuff that we did earlier in the year with driivz with an embedded technology, sparkion. those can be more software-oriented, but once again, a mix.
andrew obin -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
thank you so much.
mark morelli -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, andrew.
operator
thank you. our next question will come from nigel coe with wolfe research. your line is now open.
ryan cooke -- wolfe research -- analyst
good morning. this is ryan cooke on for nigel coe. thanks for taking my question. i just wanted to ask about gas station investments.
and if you could provide some color on how you typically see that tracking with higher gas prices?
mark morelli -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. so the industry is actually going through a very interesting, not only investment from an energy transition perspective, but also the sophistication of the retailing environment. and so you do see some really interesting formats being advanced on your local neighborhood store as well as your truck stop. and so we are -- there's no question that we're seeing that.
i've just come back from norway, where we're kind of looking at a company that has electrified a lot and they do a lot of home charging. but at the same time, you see those investments going into that format. and with higher gas prices, if they're a multinational oil company or they're backward integrated into the supply of gas, then they're going to have more margins here, and you certainly see the energy companies with higher margins. so i think the key thing is that companies like 7-eleven that have a very sophisticated set of offerings, you're going to see them making those investments in that energy transition and that retail environment.
so i think it's a really good growthy and forward-looking way of building out the mobility infrastructure. so we're pretty pleased on the position that we're in to be able to take advantage of those investments.
ryan cooke -- wolfe research -- analyst
great. that's very helpful. and then i also wanted to ask about the e-mobility space and see if you could provide some details surrounding the driivz investment. and i guess just how we should be thinking about those sort of investments moving forward?
mark morelli -- president and chief executive officer
yes. i'll turn it over to dave, but let me just give an opening on that. the bigger picture here is that we can play in and opportunity. we believe in the petrol-based infrastructure, particularly in high-growth markets growing out, but at the same time, if you look at the energy transition, we're actually very well-positioned to take advantage of that.
and investments like driivz with embedded technologies like sparkion give us a great platform for investment, because it's the operating system for the electric charging network that needs to be managed. and if you think about the bigger issues here about range anxiety, this is a huge growth space, and we're exactly at the right part of the value chain to not only grow but to grow profitably. once again, i'll go back to my norway visit, all the major players out there in the market doing electric charging have subscribed and are subscribing to that driivz operating system, i think it's a real testament to how we position ourselves for growth. and so it's a great position to be in right now.
ryan cooke -- wolfe research -- analyst
great. i really appreciate that. thank you.
lisa curran -- vice president, investor relations
yeah, i'd just point out to folks, too, that we have some new disclosures sizing the dilutive impact of those investments in our supplemental slides in slide 15 and 16 of the presentation. we heard you asking for that information, and so we provided that this quarter, right. thanks, katie. back to you.
operator
thank you. our next question will come from andy kaplowitz with citi. your line is now open.
unknown speaker
hi. this is piyush on behalf of andy. thanks for taking my question. so drb is growing nicely.
can you talk about the visibility through the remainder of the year at this business? and i think when you guys announced drb, you've talked about high single-digit growth over longer-term. so maybe provide some additional color on what's driving the double-digit growth you saw in the quarter and how being part of vontier helps drb achieve these growth rates?
mark morelli -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. so i think you broke it a little bit at the beginning of that question. i think what you asked was what's driving the growth rates for drb. is that correct?
unknown speaker
yes.
mark morelli -- president and chief executive officer
ok. so i think, first of all, we've -- it goes back to the strategy around m&a. we've picked the right property and we carefully did this. i think it shows the discipline around our m&a.
this is by far the market leader in the space. it's a combination of hardware and software. it's a deeply embedded end-to-end point-of-sale system where we layer on top of that workflow software solutions that really are high demand for customers. and inherently, it's in a growth space.
and so that's the first reason. the second reason is just our integration plan, i think, just hit the right level. this is not a hard integration, because it's a growthy type thing. we've done a significant amount of high-level changeover management there.
i think we've executed really well on that, too, taking advantage of a lot of the expertise already in the business. so i think the overall -- the strategic path and the execution path has worked incredibly well.
unknown speaker
got it. very helpful. and my follow-up question is we talked leverage here. like i think you expect leverage to be under three turns by the end of the year.
can you talk about how you're planning to balance continued deleveraging versus driving incremental capital deployment in the second half and maybe into 2023?
dave naemura -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yeah, sure. i mean i think we have a targeted range of below three times kind of that two and a half to three times net leverage that i talked about. and our free cash flow generation profile and ebitda growth should facilitate that with additional capital to deploy. so it's always dynamic.
m&a opportunities, we don't always get to pick when those come. we've talked about deploying additional capital $100 million over the second half of the year into share repurchase and the timing of which will depend on market conditions. but when conditions are right, we'll be more aggressive. so we have throughout the year develop.
and we also said, i would remind you that at times would be above three times with line of sight to coming back below that in a reasonable period of time. so i think our current profile reflects that. and frankly, the 3.3 times net leverage is a reflection of the opportunities we've taken to date over, well, $288 million of capital deployed to share repurchase and the deals we did in the first and then funding the invenco deal that we just announced.
unknown speaker
very helpful. i'll pass it along and good luck to these and good luck, ryan.
lisa curran -- vice president, investor relations
thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question will come from julian mitchell with barclays. your line is now open.
julian mitchell -- barclays -- analyst
hi, good morning. and yes, thanks, lisa, for all the help down the years. just wanted to follow up on the invenco deal. maybe help us understand recent organic sales growth rates in that business, what you're thinking about the top-line growth outlook there? and then when we're looking at earnings accretion for perhaps next year, are we thinking sort of single digits sense of eps accretion is the right sort of ballpark for that?
mark morelli -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. so let me jump in on this one. so their organic growth profile is something that -- it's kind of flattish, but it's something that we can really take advantage of. so let me just describe that, give a little bit color on it and then i'll turn it over to dave on the accretion side.
so first of all, this is an excellent strategic fit for us, and it really fits our portfolio diversification. and particularly the nature of this agile software that customers are really looking for, it really enhances our workflow solutions. and the key thing here is that not only is it a platform that is building out with some of our key customers, we have excellent leverage with our sales force, particularly it adds feature-rich environment for our high-growth market and we can leverage our existing sales force to be able to do that. and so we think that on the growth side, this is a -- really it's a rare opportunity for us to be able to leverage what we've got and what they've got to really have growth.
and then there's also a cost synergy side, too. it wasn't where your question went. but there was also costs included happy to go there. go ahead, dave, you want to talk about accretion.
dave naemura -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yeah, so i would first highlight what mark said. very synergy-rich deal, great channel synergies, but cost synergies as well. and the newer stage product they have on the software side fits hand in glove into our existing channel. so we're really excited about that.
so it's an interesting deal in that it has attributes of the bolt-on, which helps us drive returns. they're very synergy-rich but also on point strategy with their newer product on the software side. as far as accretion, we're looking at kind of mid-single-digits cents per share next year and beyond that, moving up to high-single digits cents per share.
julian mitchell -- barclays -- analyst
that's very helpful. thank you. and then maybe just my second question would be around the -- any update on sort of that emv outlook. i see you've got maybe a bigger headwind kind of third quarter than we thought and then a bigger step-up perhaps into the fourth quarter with that $30 million number.
maybe help us understand kind of where are we on the overall transition and kind of penetration of the installed base amid the sort of quarterly moving parts and maybe supply chain disruption. any change in perspectives on that emv waiting next year or over the next 12 months?
dave naemura -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yeah, julian. look, great question. so really, i would say nothing overall in the big picture has changed. i think what we're feeling the most here is that we actually satisfied more emv demand in the second than we had anticipated.
so if you think of an additional $10 million to $15 million that was part of that late june push got satisfied, and that really pulled in from the third, which kind of adds to that step-up. we're still satisfying a lot of demand in a pretty uncertain environment. so it will move around some, and we try to keep you guys updated as we can. we'll probably get to year-end before we update the penetration numbers, but as far as we think of -- we talked about still being at that $50 million headwind for the year and our view to next year.
no update to that.
julian mitchell -- barclays -- analyst
that's great. thank you.
dave naemura -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
thanks, julian.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from rob mason with baird. your line is now open.
rob mason -- robert w. baird and company -- analyst
yes. good morning. i wanted to see if you could just elaborate, mark, on some of the challenges you talked about at matco and how you see those playing out in the second half? and then specific to -- i thought i heard a comment around investment in company-owned stores, whether -- how new of a dynamic is that? what level of investment are you talking about and perhaps the time frame that we would see that materialize?
mark morelli -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, happy to, rob. so first of all, i think the backdrop here for matco is a pretty strong macro environment for them. the technician continues to be at high employment. they're getting paid well.
there's robust shop activity. so that -- all those things bear really well. and then the backdrop for complexity to repair is also really good, too. so i think that's great.
i think one of the biggest issues we're running up against is, first of all, year-over-year compare is pretty significant. matco had more than 50% organic growth in the prior-year period. and we knew that the quarter was going to be challenging, because of the timing of the matco expo was in q1 this year instead of q2, and so we did a lot of bookings according to that. but at the same time, we experienced supply chain disruptions and some -- had some labor issues associated mostly with our jamestown factory that we build toolboxes on.
and so we currently have a remedy plan in place for that, that i feel confident in. and at the same time, i think the build-out of the franchisee, which is a real opportunity for us and goes back to your question on company-owned stores as well, is that it's not something that we have focused on a lot historically, but i think some of these underserved geographies and territories, where we have a real advantage, because about 30% of our territories are not yet penetrated. but sometimes you have to jump start that a bit with a company-owned store, you might get that route started. and then it's easier to hire somebody into that area that would be able to take that on.
so it's kind of a transition plan for us. not necessarily a permanent plan. but we think that we've got to be creative to -- particularly in these rather underserved geographies with how to build that out, particularly with the labor constraints. it's harder to attract maybe labor in some of these opportunities.
so i think we've got an excellent value proposition, and it's just our effort here to be more creative.
rob mason -- robert w. baird and company -- analyst
i see. and dave, could you just give a little bit of color on how you see growth in the second half -- core growth in the second half of the year between the two platforms?
dave naemura -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. so we -- i think we continue to track after a reasonably slower start in the dt side of the business. we'll continue to track in the second to get to more of a low -- kind of a low single-digit core growth for the full year. and then i would say, overall, in the empty side of the house, we're still tracking to that mid-single digit to get to the full year guide that we articulated.
rob mason -- robert w. baird and company -- analyst
excellent. thank you.
operator
thank you. [operator instructions] our next question will come from ty hardwick with credit suisse. your line is now open.
unknown speaker
hi. good morning. i want to ask a question about invenco. is it correct -- understanding it correctly that it takes gvr a little bit beyond the gasoline forecourt and into the broader convenience store market? and also if you give the background as to what the contingent consideration is based on?
mark morelli -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. so if i understood your question, you're trying to understand how that's positioned. and i think it's a great question, because the key thing here is it is -- it does take us beyond the traditional c-store with our retail solutions platform. so if you think about what's happening here, this is a micro services software offering that offers a lot of modularity and customer choice, and you're seeing this in other type of retailing venues that have not shown up into the verticals around the retailing spaces that we serve.
and so not only is this great for the convenience store, there's other things part of the mobility infrastructure that we're very interested in, namely car washes as another thing, the repair solution side. so it's a very contemporary modular technology that customers are very interested in, because it drops out cost as well as lead time with offering solutions that they can pick and choose from. so it's a really big step up. if we were to do this development ourselves, it would take us a couple of years, and there's nothing available in the space that you can actually go out and develop.
so it's a great position for us to pick up.
dave naemura -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
but to just build on that a little bit. making sure -- i'm not sure i got your words right, but you talked about moving from the forecourt into the c-store. and i would just point out, we're already well into the c-store with our existing retail solutions. and as mark pointed out, this really fits in the globe with that and could take us into other verticals as well.
and the contingent consideration is based around revenue performance in the first kind of year, year and a half.
unknown speaker
ok, thank you. and just as a follow-up, can you tell us what pricing was in q2? and how you expect price cost to progress through the rest of the year?
dave naemura -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. so look, we again had pretty strong price. we were price cost positive, and we offset the margin impact from costs as well. so in other words, it was margin neutral.
so we did more than offset it just on a dollar basis. we've been running really well on a year-to-date basis, got off to an early start last year, as most people know. but -- the -- for the year, we still anticipate in the second half being price cost positive as well and also offsetting the margin impact. and so for the full year, we would anticipate being margin-neutral as well.
unknown speaker
thank you.
lisa curran -- vice president, investor relations
and we did come in almost six points of price in the quarter and still on track for kind of that mid-single-digit range for the year.
unknown speaker
thank you.
operator
thank you. it appears we have no further questions at this time. i would now like to turn the program back over to mark morelli for any additional or closing remarks.
mark morelli -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. thank you, katie. look, i couldn't be more encouraged in the track record that we're establishing and the runway of opportunities in front of us at vontier. i'm particularly thankful of the team for continuing to step up and work through challenges in this dynamic market environment.
and i think our work is resulting in a stronger, more growth-oriented portfolio. i couldn't be more encouraged by all this. so thanks for joining us on today's call, and have a nice day.

thank you, katie. good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on the call. with me today are mark morelli, our president and chief executive officer; dave naemura, our senior vice president and chief financial officer; and ryan edelman, our incoming vice president of investor relations. we will present certain non-gaap financial measures on today's call.

mark morelli -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, lisa. good morning, everyone, and welcome to our second quarter earnings call. once again, our strong execution, price cost performance and capital allocation drove double-digit earnings growth, more than offsetting supply chain inflation and other headwinds. we delivered adjusted earnings per share of $0.72 or an increase of 18%, despite a challenging comparison year over year.
these strong results reflected positive operating leverage and a top-line beat. the beat was driven by double-digit growth at drb and environmental, more than offsetting underperformance in diagnostics and repair technologies, which i'll come back to. drb delivered yet another quarter of robust growth highlighting the strength of our capital deployment and portfolio strategy to accelerate non-ice business growth. furthermore, we leveraged the strength of our portfolio's cash generation and balance sheet by deploying $14 million of capital in the quarter toward share repurchase and followed with an additional $17 million in early july.
today's announcement of our bolt-on acquisition of invenco, and further actions on the planned divestitures that dave will discuss in more detail are important milestones toward building a better stronger, more focused growth portfolio. we're excited to acquire industry leader invenco and expand our software-enabled workflow solutions and subscription business model. invenco is a leading global provider of open platform retailing and payment hardware and software solutions. its disruptive edge computing technology road map and modular solutions offer extensibility across other retailing verticals.
this acquisition accelerates our digital strategy and better positions us to serve our customers' growing demand for digitally agile software systems. invenco is one of the top suppliers of retailing and payment solutions to the convenience retail industry worldwide. invenco's innovative, secure solutions are well-positioned to enable retailers to customize digital payments and consumer services as the energy markets evolve. invenco's expected 2022 revenue of $80 million with mid-40s gross margin, enhances vontier's growth and recurring revenue profile.
the acquisition purchase price is $80 million and is expected to achieve a very attractive 20% return on invested capital in three years. while we are still in the early stages of developing our m&a track record as a stand-alone company, i'm very pleased with our results and return profile. drb is pacing nicely toward delivering 10% roic within five years. and collectively, our $1.5 billion of capital deployed since separation is delivering double-digit returns in approximately three years.
we're also continuing to advance our profitable growth initiatives, and i'm encouraged by the progress and earnings potential in front of us, but we have more work to do. we have a strong runway of opportunities where we've made important early strides with strategic pricing and product line simplification, which is beginning to take hold. as an example, in gvr, we're on a multiyear journey to reduce our global dispenser platforms from 32 to 8. so far this year, we've eliminated six dispenser lines.
this is indicative of the cost structure opportunities we have to improve our efficiency, cost position and follow-on improvements to working capital. before moving to the outlook, i'd like to provide more color on the supply and demand environment, and broader backdrop. i'm incredibly pleased with our team's ability to deliver on profitable growth initiatives, leveraging vbs. strong price cost execution and drb performance resulted in an adjusted gross margin expansion of 100 basis points in the quarter.
strong execution rigor enabled us to deliver nearly 30% incrementals in the face of supply chain and inflationary headwinds. we expect supply to remain tight, but not get worse through the back half of the year. and while we are seeing deflation in some inputs like steel and aluminum, we're also forecasting higher freight. net-net, we have taken cost measures to protect our margin expansion outlook for the full year.
reflecting the strength and resiliency of our portfolio, the overall demand environment remains solid despite some pockets of softening at hennessy. and while we always expected a decline in order rates this quarter given peak growth of over 50% for non-emv orders in the prior-year period, underlying quarter trends and elevated backlog levels position us well for accelerated growth into the back half of this year and into 2023. that said, the dp businesses did underperform against our expectations in the second quarter, even though demand remains above pre-pandemic levels. we did not reduce backlog or growth or macro franchisee count as planned, primarily due to labor challenges and higher separations.
importantly, we've developed countermeasures to address the challenges within dt, including ramping up company-owned stores. and looking into the back half of the year, we subsequently lowered our assumptions for dt and also high-growth markets due to timing of large tender orders shifting out. that said, we are still maintaining our full year core revenue growth outlook primarily due to continued outperformance by drb and expectations of improving backlog. moving to the outlook.
we are holding our full year 2022 adjusted diluted net eps guidance to $3.20 to $3.30 per share. our core growth and adjusted core operating margin expansion assumptions remain the same at low to mid-single digits and 30 to 60 basis points, respectively. reflecting continued poor sales linearity and assumptions for increased working capital or expecting adjusted free cash flow conversion of approximately 90%. we're also initiating our third quarter adjusted diluted net eps guidance of $0.85 to $0.90, which includes assumptions of low single-digit core revenue growth and 20 to 40 basis points of adjusted core operating margin expansion.
looking beyond this year, i continue to have strong conviction in our ability to offset the peak emv headwind and deliver earnings growth and strong free cash flow conversion in 2023. dave will be walking you through a more detailed view of our assumptions to achieve this performance and our road map for accelerated growth that we introduced last quarter. with that, i'll turn the call over to dave to provide the financial results. dave?
dave naemura -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
thanks, mark. i'll get started with a brief summary of our performance in the quarter. adjusted net earnings for the second quarter were $116 million, an increase of 11.5% from $104 million in the prior-year period. this translated to adjusted net earnings per share of $0.72, an 18% increase compared to $0.61 in the prior-year period.
revenue grew 7.2%, with core revenue up 1.6%. our non-emv core growth was mid-single digits on a difficult compare, particularly for our diagnostics and repair businesses, where prior-year core growth was over 50%. growth was primarily driven by gvr, which grew mid-single digits on an overall core basis with growth in both developed and high-growth markets. gvr growth was driven by environmental, aftermarket and our cng business.
our compressed natural gas business has grown greater than 65% year to date off a relatively small base. and although not core yet, drb continued to demonstrate strong growth of high 20s. adjusted operating profit for the second quarter was $167 million, an increase of 10% compared to the prior-year period. gross margin expansion of almost 100 basis points reflected continued effective price cost management and the benefits of drb and other higher-margin solutions.
these favorable items helped offset production inefficiencies from a very back-end loaded quarter, driven by timing of supply, which i will elaborate on further in a bit. the increase in operating profit and strong execution drove incremental margin of nearly 30% and modest adjusted core operating margin expansion. excluding the $0.02 or $3 million dilutive impact of our energy transition investments, our incremental margin is high 30s. looking at the top-line performance of our two platforms.
in our mobility technologies platform, core revenue was three and a half percent, reflecting growth in gvr in developed and high-growth markets, particularly in north america, more than offsetting the sunsetting emv impact of nearly $15 million in the quarter. total growth in mobility technologies was 11% as drb continues to increase market share and increase share of wallet, while benefiting from their industry-leading position and a very strong market backdrop. drb has continued to outperform our expectations during this first year of ownership and will become core near the end of q3. in our diagnostic and repair technologies platform, core revenue declined 3.6% in the quarter as a result of both a difficult compare against the 57% growth in q2 of the prior year and also normalization of matco to a more typical growth and operating profile, but still above pre-pandemic levels.
the demand backdrop remains healthy as technician employment and auto repair remain at high levels. as mark referenced, we did experience some labor and other production challenges that prevented us from reducing backlog as much as we had anticipated, which remains an opportunity in the second half of the year. looking at total company sales regionally, north america core revenue grew low single digits due to gvr growth in non-emv applications more than offsetting a decline in emv. developed markets overall grew low single digits as strength in north america was partially offset by a mid-single-digit decline in western europe.
high-growth markets, which are typically lumpy, grew low single digits with strong double-digit growth in india, being partially offset in other areas, including eastern europe and china. we anticipate increased lumpiness in high-growth markets due to the broader macroeconomic and geopolitical factors as well as timing of tender orders. that may impact growth rates some in the near-term, but overall, we remain confident in this profitable growth initiative in the middle and long-term, given the attractive long-term secular drivers. moving on to the balance sheet.
we ended the quarter with a cash balance of just under $130 million and had $14 million of borrowings under our $750 million credit facility. our net leverage was 3.3 times adjusted ebitda at the end of the quarter and temporarily elevated due to the large cash outflow year to date related to share repurchase and acquisition activity and a temporary shift in the timing of free cash flow generation from first half to second half of the year. the quarter became significantly back-end loaded given supply chain issues and this lack of linearity shifted free cash flow from q2 to q3. further, we saw additional working capital build in inventory.
we maintain our commitment to investment-grade credit ratings and expect that our leverage will end the year below 3x net leverage, with our targeted range being between two and a half times and three times net. we will also have capacity for further free cash flow deployment in 2022, which will fund the announced acquisition of invenco and also additional share repurchase of approximately $100 million. these assumptions, of course, are influenced by market conditions and further m&a opportunity. in q2, we refreshed our repurchase authorization back up to $500 million and subsequently have deployed $31 million against that.
our total year to date share repurchase stands at $288 million as of today. these assumptions on leverage and capital deployment capacity do not consider any additional capital raise through divestiture activities. today, we disclosed assets for sale, and those being considered are the hennessy and gtt operating company. these businesses comprise about $175 million of annual revenue at a combined growth rate that is below the non-emv fleet average.
the impact of selling these businesses will be accretive to enterprise gross margins and operating margins by greater than 60 and 40 basis points, respectively. we anticipate the proceeds from divestiture will be used for some debt reduction and then also providing further available capital for deployment on m&a and/or share repurchase, which would more than offset the reduction in eps resulting from removing these businesses. in our full year 2022 guide, we have assumed approximately $0.12 to $0.13 of contribution from these combined businesses. returning to adjusted free cash flow conversion.
on a year-to-date basis, our conversion is 23%. we talked previously about the poor linearity we experienced in q1, which is typically a low point for free cash flow generation, and we saw further deterioration in q2. we anticipate that this dynamic will normalize over the second half of the year, but we also are seeing some upward pressure on our working capital levels, mostly in inventory as we build stock to satisfy demand. we anticipate that a combination of these factors will have some impact on our full year free cash flow conversion, and we will more likely be around the 90% range rather than the typical 100% portfolio generates.
turning to the outlook assumptions. for full year 2022, we are maintaining our core revenue guide of low to mid-single-digit growth, with non-emv growth of high single digits, as emv is still expected to be approximately a $50 million headwind. we also continue to expect core operating margin expansion of 30 to 60 basis points, reflecting our leveraging of vbs to dynamically adjust our cost structure to effectively adjust to demand levels and offset inflationary impacts. our confidence in delivering these results reflects continued execution on our profitable growth initiatives and price cost management and the resiliency of our portfolio through the cycle.
the full year eps guide is unchanged and adjusted earnings per share range of $3.20 to $3.30 and does not contemplate the impact of noted divestitures. we anticipate that the invenco acquisition will close in q3 and that it will be neutral to eps in 2022 and accretive in 2023 by mid-single-digit cents per share. taking a closer look at some of our other assumptions, we now expect full year 2022 weighted average share count to be approximately 161.4 million, which reflects the impact of the share repurchase activity conducted to date in 2022, but not the additional 100 million that i previously referred to. interest expense is anticipated to be $68 million, reflecting an increase in interest on the variable portion of our debt.
our guide also reflects the current foreign currency translation rates and the strengthening of the u.s. dollar since our last guide, which has had a $0.02 dilutive impact to the full year since our last update. our assumption on the full year effective tax rate remains at 23%. moving on to the third quarter of 2022.
we expect core revenue growth of low single digits with non-emv core growth of high single digits. this contemplates a supply environment similar to what we experienced in q2, still not normal, but more stable than what we experienced in previous quarters. adjusted core operating margin is expected to be 20 to 40 basis points. as mark stated, this translates into adjusted earnings per share of $0.85 to $0.90 in the quarter.
before turning it back to mark, i'd like to call your attention to slide 8. we presented this slide last quarter to better dimensionalize our conviction in our ability to offset the impact of the emv decline in 2023 and most importantly, how we expect to have a rebaseline core revenue growth rate of mid-single digits at accretive margins post the emv sunset, which we continue to expect completes in 2023. our conviction in accelerated growth and returns has not changed, and we continue to make progress on many fronts. the profitable growth initiatives and platform strategies continue to progress.
we have deployed further capital to share repurchase and announced the acquisition of invenco, demonstrating progress on the capital deployment section of this slide. also, the disclosure of our plans to divest hennessy and gtt demonstrates progress on the continuing evolution of our portfolio toward markets with attractive growth and margin profiles. with that, i will turn it back to mark.
mark morelli -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, dave. as dave highlighted, we are continuing to evolve the portfolio toward attractive markets and growth characteristics. and as we potentially enter a slower growth macroeconomic environment, i think it's worth reminding you of our portfolio's low cyclicality as best demonstrated in 2008, 2009, where sales were down only mid-single digits. we have a highly resilient portfolio of businesses, not correlated to pmi, but rather tied to a steady wave of regulatory drivers.
the economy of convenience, expansion of digital workflows, modernization and build-out of retail fueling infrastructure, and increasing complexity of the car park are attractive secular drivers of sustainable growth. and as the 2023 growth road map in slide 8 also illustrates we are taking advantage of the resiliency and strategic optionality inherent in our businesses to build a better, stronger, more focused growth portfolio. i want to underscore once again that while we believe continued m&a will be a part of our strategy to continue our multiyear portfolios transformation, we are not dogmatic in our approach. given the strength of our cash generation, we will balance investing in organic and inorganic opportunities along with returning capital to shareholders.
they are not mutually exclusive. we will continue to align our capital allocation priorities to the benefit of our shareholders, as we execute on the initiatives underway to drive further portfolio diversification, profitable growth and increased returns. we are driving a value-creating growth agenda. we are making meaningful progress on our most important priorities and shareholder commitments.
we are demonstrating strong execution and successfully delivering our profitable growth initiatives. we're showing we will make acquisitions and carry only assets that maximize value even at the expense of near-term earnings. bottom line, we are focused on long-term shareholder value, and we're accelerating returns. and lastly, before turning it over to lisa, i'd like to thank her for her important role in the successful launch of vontier as a public company, especially for her professionalism, intellect and investor relations expertise.
we are fortunate to have lisa staying on long enough to help ensure a smooth transition. with that, i'd like to welcome ryan edelman to the team. i believe many of you already know ryan from his prior roles in both ir and the sell side. ryan brings deep experience in our sector and a clear understanding of market dynamics.
we are very excited to have him aboard. with that, lisa, i wish you all the best in your next chapter, and i'll turn the call back over to you.
lisa curran -- vice president, investor relations
thanks for the kind words, mark. after the pleasure of working with ryan in the last month, i'm confident that you all are in the best of hands with him. katie, we are now ready for questions.

operator
thank you. [operator instructions] our first question will come from andrew obin with bank of america. your line is now open.
andrew obin -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
yes, good morning, mark, dave. lisa, thanks so much. we'll definitely miss you. and ryan, welcome, look forward to working with you.
first question on working capital. and you guys are considered to be some of the better operators out there. and i appreciate the shift in free cash flow story. what are you looking for to sort of what signposts should we look for, for the industry, for your supply chain to normalize? and this is a bigger picture question, right? i'm sort of taking it beyond vontier.
what's your best guess as to one thing to normal? and if they don't, what structural countermeasures can you take? do you need to carry sort of more buffer stock going forward? do you need to rethink your supply chains in 12 to 24 months? just more of a 30,000, 40,000 foot view on supply chain. thank you.
mark morelli -- president and chief executive officer
yes, andrew, thanks for the question. look, there's no question we've all been wrestling with the supply chain issues now for a while. and i'll absolutely say that we have taken measures already anticipating the supply chain just to be different. one of the things that we've talked about is a simplification program that we've engaged in that will flow right through to your suppliers.
so i think that's really the starting point, because if you can kind of consolidate and figure out and particularly figure out what region you get supply chain from. but going back to sort of the first part of your question there, it's continuing to be challenging. there's no question about it. i couldn't be more proud of what our team has done to be able to once again face some pretty significant issues and deliver on our commitments.
but at the same time, i anticipate we will be in this situation for a little bit longer. and hopefully, into 2023, we'll be able to see some of these things get better. clearly, we are seeing some things getting better on the semiconductor side and the electronic component side, but that's actually where most of the stuff still resides. so dave, do you want to -- any comments there?
dave naemura -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yes. i'd just add, andrew, you made a great point about the linearity. when we look at what happened in q2, it was really vbs at its finest. when we look at the -- how supply pushed production to the back end.
usually, as overall, we'd ship maybe 40% of the quarter in the third month, that was well up over 50%. when we look at our biggest factory where emv comes out of, actually half the quarter was shipped in about the second half of june, a little under half the quarter was shipped in the second half of june. and that was really vbs at its finest, but i think it puts a sharp point on some of the challenges that we fielded. and when you roll through in our shorter collection type region to push in receivables and free cash flow out of the quarter.
so just to put a highlight on that.
andrew obin -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
yes. and another question i have just a follow-up on m&a. i think your recent acquisition is sort of more middle of the fairway type of acquisition for you, but would you say that the m&a funnel is skewed more toward software solution? driivz was early stage, high growth. invenco, they've scaled through a decent level of profitability.
do you have a philosophy on what's the better time to acquire software firms, because it seems that's where the company is going? thanks.
mark morelli -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, i definitely wouldn't say that we're looking for software companies to acquire. i think there's a mix of things that are in our pipeline and that you can expect us to execute and cultivate our pipeline accordingly, because i think there are great returns. they can have some embedded hardware into it as well as software. and if you look at companies like invenco, you look at companies like drb, it has a combination of those.
they're not just software. now granted some of the alternative energy stuff that we did earlier in the year with driivz with an embedded technology, sparkion. those can be more software-oriented, but once again, a mix.
andrew obin -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
thank you so much.
mark morelli -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, andrew.
operator
thank you. our next question will come from nigel coe with wolfe research. your line is now open.
ryan cooke -- wolfe research -- analyst
good morning. this is ryan cooke on for nigel coe. thanks for taking my question. i just wanted to ask about gas station investments.
and if you could provide some color on how you typically see that tracking with higher gas prices?
mark morelli -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. so the industry is actually going through a very interesting, not only investment from an energy transition perspective, but also the sophistication of the retailing environment. and so you do see some really interesting formats being advanced on your local neighborhood store as well as your truck stop. and so we are -- there's no question that we're seeing that.
i've just come back from norway, where we're kind of looking at a company that has electrified a lot and they do a lot of home charging. but at the same time, you see those investments going into that format. and with higher gas prices, if they're a multinational oil company or they're backward integrated into the supply of gas, then they're going to have more margins here, and you certainly see the energy companies with higher margins. so i think the key thing is that companies like 7-eleven that have a very sophisticated set of offerings, you're going to see them making those investments in that energy transition and that retail environment.
so i think it's a really good growthy and forward-looking way of building out the mobility infrastructure. so we're pretty pleased on the position that we're in to be able to take advantage of those investments.
ryan cooke -- wolfe research -- analyst
great. that's very helpful. and then i also wanted to ask about the e-mobility space and see if you could provide some details surrounding the driivz investment. and i guess just how we should be thinking about those sort of investments moving forward?
mark morelli -- president and chief executive officer
yes. i'll turn it over to dave, but let me just give an opening on that. the bigger picture here is that we can play in and opportunity. we believe in the petrol-based infrastructure, particularly in high-growth markets growing out, but at the same time, if you look at the energy transition, we're actually very well-positioned to take advantage of that.
and investments like driivz with embedded technologies like sparkion give us a great platform for investment, because it's the operating system for the electric charging network that needs to be managed. and if you think about the bigger issues here about range anxiety, this is a huge growth space, and we're exactly at the right part of the value chain to not only grow but to grow profitably. once again, i'll go back to my norway visit, all the major players out there in the market doing electric charging have subscribed and are subscribing to that driivz operating system, i think it's a real testament to how we position ourselves for growth. and so it's a great position to be in right now.
ryan cooke -- wolfe research -- analyst
great. i really appreciate that. thank you.
lisa curran -- vice president, investor relations
yeah, i'd just point out to folks, too, that we have some new disclosures sizing the dilutive impact of those investments in our supplemental slides in slide 15 and 16 of the presentation. we heard you asking for that information, and so we provided that this quarter, right. thanks, katie. back to you.
operator
thank you. our next question will come from andy kaplowitz with citi. your line is now open.
unknown speaker
hi. this is piyush on behalf of andy. thanks for taking my question. so drb is growing nicely.
can you talk about the visibility through the remainder of the year at this business? and i think when you guys announced drb, you've talked about high single-digit growth over longer-term. so maybe provide some additional color on what's driving the double-digit growth you saw in the quarter and how being part of vontier helps drb achieve these growth rates?
mark morelli -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. so i think you broke it a little bit at the beginning of that question. i think what you asked was what's driving the growth rates for drb. is that correct?
unknown speaker
yes.
mark morelli -- president and chief executive officer
ok. so i think, first of all, we've -- it goes back to the strategy around m&a. we've picked the right property and we carefully did this. i think it shows the discipline around our m&a.
this is by far the market leader in the space. it's a combination of hardware and software. it's a deeply embedded end-to-end point-of-sale system where we layer on top of that workflow software solutions that really are high demand for customers. and inherently, it's in a growth space.
and so that's the first reason. the second reason is just our integration plan, i think, just hit the right level. this is not a hard integration, because it's a growthy type thing. we've done a significant amount of high-level changeover management there.
i think we've executed really well on that, too, taking advantage of a lot of the expertise already in the business. so i think the overall -- the strategic path and the execution path has worked incredibly well.
unknown speaker
got it. very helpful. and my follow-up question is we talked leverage here. like i think you expect leverage to be under three turns by the end of the year.
can you talk about how you're planning to balance continued deleveraging versus driving incremental capital deployment in the second half and maybe into 2023?
dave naemura -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yeah, sure. i mean i think we have a targeted range of below three times kind of that two and a half to three times net leverage that i talked about. and our free cash flow generation profile and ebitda growth should facilitate that with additional capital to deploy. so it's always dynamic.
m&a opportunities, we don't always get to pick when those come. we've talked about deploying additional capital $100 million over the second half of the year into share repurchase and the timing of which will depend on market conditions. but when conditions are right, we'll be more aggressive. so we have throughout the year develop.
and we also said, i would remind you that at times would be above three times with line of sight to coming back below that in a reasonable period of time. so i think our current profile reflects that. and frankly, the 3.3 times net leverage is a reflection of the opportunities we've taken to date over, well, $288 million of capital deployed to share repurchase and the deals we did in the first and then funding the invenco deal that we just announced.
unknown speaker
very helpful. i'll pass it along and good luck to these and good luck, ryan.
lisa curran -- vice president, investor relations
thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question will come from julian mitchell with barclays. your line is now open.
julian mitchell -- barclays -- analyst
hi, good morning. and yes, thanks, lisa, for all the help down the years. just wanted to follow up on the invenco deal. maybe help us understand recent organic sales growth rates in that business, what you're thinking about the top-line growth outlook there? and then when we're looking at earnings accretion for perhaps next year, are we thinking sort of single digits sense of eps accretion is the right sort of ballpark for that?
mark morelli -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. so let me jump in on this one. so their organic growth profile is something that -- it's kind of flattish, but it's something that we can really take advantage of. so let me just describe that, give a little bit color on it and then i'll turn it over to dave on the accretion side.
so first of all, this is an excellent strategic fit for us, and it really fits our portfolio diversification. and particularly the nature of this agile software that customers are really looking for, it really enhances our workflow solutions. and the key thing here is that not only is it a platform that is building out with some of our key customers, we have excellent leverage with our sales force, particularly it adds feature-rich environment for our high-growth market and we can leverage our existing sales force to be able to do that. and so we think that on the growth side, this is a -- really it's a rare opportunity for us to be able to leverage what we've got and what they've got to really have growth.
and then there's also a cost synergy side, too. it wasn't where your question went. but there was also costs included happy to go there. go ahead, dave, you want to talk about accretion.
dave naemura -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yeah, so i would first highlight what mark said. very synergy-rich deal, great channel synergies, but cost synergies as well. and the newer stage product they have on the software side fits hand in glove into our existing channel. so we're really excited about that.
so it's an interesting deal in that it has attributes of the bolt-on, which helps us drive returns. they're very synergy-rich but also on point strategy with their newer product on the software side. as far as accretion, we're looking at kind of mid-single-digits cents per share next year and beyond that, moving up to high-single digits cents per share.
julian mitchell -- barclays -- analyst
that's very helpful. thank you. and then maybe just my second question would be around the -- any update on sort of that emv outlook. i see you've got maybe a bigger headwind kind of third quarter than we thought and then a bigger step-up perhaps into the fourth quarter with that $30 million number.
maybe help us understand kind of where are we on the overall transition and kind of penetration of the installed base amid the sort of quarterly moving parts and maybe supply chain disruption. any change in perspectives on that emv waiting next year or over the next 12 months?
dave naemura -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yeah, julian. look, great question. so really, i would say nothing overall in the big picture has changed. i think what we're feeling the most here is that we actually satisfied more emv demand in the second than we had anticipated.
so if you think of an additional $10 million to $15 million that was part of that late june push got satisfied, and that really pulled in from the third, which kind of adds to that step-up. we're still satisfying a lot of demand in a pretty uncertain environment. so it will move around some, and we try to keep you guys updated as we can. we'll probably get to year-end before we update the penetration numbers, but as far as we think of -- we talked about still being at that $50 million headwind for the year and our view to next year.
no update to that.
julian mitchell -- barclays -- analyst
that's great. thank you.
dave naemura -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
thanks, julian.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from rob mason with baird. your line is now open.
rob mason -- robert w. baird and company -- analyst
yes. good morning. i wanted to see if you could just elaborate, mark, on some of the challenges you talked about at matco and how you see those playing out in the second half? and then specific to -- i thought i heard a comment around investment in company-owned stores, whether -- how new of a dynamic is that? what level of investment are you talking about and perhaps the time frame that we would see that materialize?
mark morelli -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, happy to, rob. so first of all, i think the backdrop here for matco is a pretty strong macro environment for them. the technician continues to be at high employment. they're getting paid well.
there's robust shop activity. so that -- all those things bear really well. and then the backdrop for complexity to repair is also really good, too. so i think that's great.
i think one of the biggest issues we're running up against is, first of all, year-over-year compare is pretty significant. matco had more than 50% organic growth in the prior-year period. and we knew that the quarter was going to be challenging, because of the timing of the matco expo was in q1 this year instead of q2, and so we did a lot of bookings according to that. but at the same time, we experienced supply chain disruptions and some -- had some labor issues associated mostly with our jamestown factory that we build toolboxes on.
and so we currently have a remedy plan in place for that, that i feel confident in. and at the same time, i think the build-out of the franchisee, which is a real opportunity for us and goes back to your question on company-owned stores as well, is that it's not something that we have focused on a lot historically, but i think some of these underserved geographies and territories, where we have a real advantage, because about 30% of our territories are not yet penetrated. but sometimes you have to jump start that a bit with a company-owned store, you might get that route started. and then it's easier to hire somebody into that area that would be able to take that on.
so it's kind of a transition plan for us. not necessarily a permanent plan. but we think that we've got to be creative to -- particularly in these rather underserved geographies with how to build that out, particularly with the labor constraints. it's harder to attract maybe labor in some of these opportunities.
so i think we've got an excellent value proposition, and it's just our effort here to be more creative.
rob mason -- robert w. baird and company -- analyst
i see. and dave, could you just give a little bit of color on how you see growth in the second half -- core growth in the second half of the year between the two platforms?
dave naemura -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. so we -- i think we continue to track after a reasonably slower start in the dt side of the business. we'll continue to track in the second to get to more of a low -- kind of a low single-digit core growth for the full year. and then i would say, overall, in the empty side of the house, we're still tracking to that mid-single digit to get to the full year guide that we articulated.
rob mason -- robert w. baird and company -- analyst
excellent. thank you.
operator
thank you. [operator instructions] our next question will come from ty hardwick with credit suisse. your line is now open.
unknown speaker
hi. good morning. i want to ask a question about invenco. is it correct -- understanding it correctly that it takes gvr a little bit beyond the gasoline forecourt and into the broader convenience store market? and also if you give the background as to what the contingent consideration is based on?
mark morelli -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. so if i understood your question, you're trying to understand how that's positioned. and i think it's a great question, because the key thing here is it is -- it does take us beyond the traditional c-store with our retail solutions platform. so if you think about what's happening here, this is a micro services software offering that offers a lot of modularity and customer choice, and you're seeing this in other type of retailing venues that have not shown up into the verticals around the retailing spaces that we serve.
and so not only is this great for the convenience store, there's other things part of the mobility infrastructure that we're very interested in, namely car washes as another thing, the repair solution side. so it's a very contemporary modular technology that customers are very interested in, because it drops out cost as well as lead time with offering solutions that they can pick and choose from. so it's a really big step up. if we were to do this development ourselves, it would take us a couple of years, and there's nothing available in the space that you can actually go out and develop.
so it's a great position for us to pick up.
dave naemura -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
but to just build on that a little bit. making sure -- i'm not sure i got your words right, but you talked about moving from the forecourt into the c-store. and i would just point out, we're already well into the c-store with our existing retail solutions. and as mark pointed out, this really fits in the globe with that and could take us into other verticals as well.
and the contingent consideration is based around revenue performance in the first kind of year, year and a half.
unknown speaker
ok, thank you. and just as a follow-up, can you tell us what pricing was in q2? and how you expect price cost to progress through the rest of the year?
dave naemura -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. so look, we again had pretty strong price. we were price cost positive, and we offset the margin impact from costs as well. so in other words, it was margin neutral.
so we did more than offset it just on a dollar basis. we've been running really well on a year-to-date basis, got off to an early start last year, as most people know. but -- the -- for the year, we still anticipate in the second half being price cost positive as well and also offsetting the margin impact. and so for the full year, we would anticipate being margin-neutral as well.
unknown speaker
thank you.
lisa curran -- vice president, investor relations
and we did come in almost six points of price in the quarter and still on track for kind of that mid-single-digit range for the year.
unknown speaker
thank you.
operator
thank you. it appears we have no further questions at this time. i would now like to turn the program back over to mark morelli for any additional or closing remarks.
mark morelli -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. thank you, katie. look, i couldn't be more encouraged in the track record that we're establishing and the runway of opportunities in front of us at vontier. i'm particularly thankful of the team for continuing to step up and work through challenges in this dynamic market environment.
and i think our work is resulting in a stronger, more growth-oriented portfolio. i couldn't be more encouraged by all this. so thanks for joining us on today's call, and have a nice day.
