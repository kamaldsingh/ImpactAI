thank you, brett. good morning and good afternoon, everybody. i would like to welcome all for our fourth quarter and full-year 2019 conference call. with me this morning is niran baruch, chief financial officer and vice president of finance of audiocodes. niran will start off by presenting a financial overview of the quarter. i will then review the business highlights and summary for the quarter, and then discuss trends and developments in our business and the industry.
we will then turn it into the q&a session. niran?
niran baruch -- chief financial officer
thank you, shabtai, and hello everyone. as usual on today's call, we will be referring to both gaap and non-gaap financial results. the earnings press release that we issued earlier this morning contains a reconciliation of the supplemental non-gaap financial information that i will be discussing on this call.
revenues for the fourth quarter were $52.8 million, an increase of 2.7% from the prior quarter, and a 15.3% increase compared to the fourth quarter last year. full year 2019 revenues increased by 13.7% to $200.3 million. services revenues for the fourth quarter were $17.5 million, accounting for 32.2% of total revenues. on an annual basis, services revenues increased by 14.7% compared to the previous year.
the amount of deferred revenues as of december 31, 2019 was $62.2 million compared to $49.2 million as of december 31, 2018. non-paid deferred revenues as of december 31, 2019, at the amount of $19 million was deducted from the trade receivables in the balance sheet.
revenues by geographical region for the quarter were split as follows. north america, 39%; central and latin america, 12%; emea, 36%; and asia-pacific, 13%. our top 15 customers in aggregate represented 63% of revenues in the quarter, of which 51% are attributed to our 11 largest distributors.
the variance between gaap and non-gaap is of particular importance this quarter because as announced in november 2019, we entered into a royalty buyout agreement with the iia, the israel national authority for technology and innovation relating to certain grants we had received.
the contingent net royalty liability to the iia with respect to this grant at the time of the royalty buyout agreement was approximately $49 million. as part of the royalty buyout agreement, we agreed to pay approximately $32.2 million to the iia to settle the $49 million debt in full, in three annual installments starting in 2019. the $32.2 million expense is included in the gaap cost of revenues for the fourth quarter of 2019, and impacts gaap results for the three months and full year ended december 31, 2019.
non-gaap results exclude this expense. in addition, during the fourth quarter of 2019, we recorded a deferred tax asset in the amount of $20.5 million, which represents the approximate amount of net operating losses and temporary tax differences we estimate to be utilized over the next few years. gaap net income for the fourth quarter and full 2019 year reflect the effect of the tax benefit associated with the certain of this deferred tax asset. non-gaap net income excludes this non-cash deferred tax benefit.
with that understanding, let me discuss the results. gaap gross margin for the quarter inclusive of this $32.2 million expense for the royalty buyout was 3.9% compared to 62.6% in q4 2018. gaap operating loss for the quarter was $26 million compared to an operating income of $5.1 million in q4 2018. full year 2019 gaap operating loss was $9.6 million; gaap net loss for the quarter was $8.2 million or $0.28 per share compared to net income of $4.5 million or $0.15 per share in q4 2018.
full year 2019 gaap net income was $4 million or $0.13 per share. as noted above, results for the quarter and full-year were impacted by the $32.2 million expense incurred in connection with the royalty buyout agreement. pursuant to the royalty buyout agreement, we eliminated all the royalty obligations related to our future revenues with respect to these grants. this will have a positive impact on gaap gross margin starting in the first quarter of 2020.
non-gaap results are as follows. non-gaap gross margin for the quarter was 65.1% compared to 63% in q4 2018. non-gaap quarterly operating income was $8.3 million or 15.7% of revenues compared to an operating income of $6.3 million in q4 2018. full year 2019 non-gaap operating income was $28.2 million. non-gaap quarterly net income was $8.1 million or $0.26 per share compared to $6.3 million or $0.20 per share in q4 2018.
full year 2019 non-gaap income was $27.8 million or $0.89 per share. our balance sheet remains strong at the end of december 2019, cash, cash equivalents and bank deposits totaled $71.9 million. net cash provided by operating activities was $2.4 million during the quarter and $23.2 million for the full year 2019. both numbers were impacted by the $10.7 million payments made in december 2019, which was the first installment pursuant to the royalty buyout agreement.
days sales outstanding as of december 31, 2019 were 48 days. in august 2019, we received court approval in israel to purchase up to an aggregate of $12 million of additional ordinary shares pursuant to our share repurchase program. the court approval also permitted us to declare a dividend of any part of the $12 million during the approved validity period. this court approval will expire on february 3, 2020. as of today, we have used an aggregate of $3.5 million of these authorized amounts to declare cash dividend.
in december 2019, we submitted a new application to the israeli court requesting approval of an additional repurchase program for $12 million of ordinary shares. the application also requested the court to permit us to declare cash dividends of any part of this amount. a decision on our application is expected during february 2020.
we continue to expect top line revenue growth and operating margin expansion in 2020. we expect revenues in the range of $214 million to $222 million, and non-gaap diluted earnings per share of $1.08 to $1.12.
i will now turn the call back over to shabtai.
shabtai adlersberg -- president and chief executive officer
thank you niran. we are pleased to report record financial results for the fourth quarter and the full year 2019. 2019 has been our best year ever and the fourth year in a row of continued growth in revenues and net income in every single year. and so, when discussing 2019, and looking forward to 2020 and beyond, it's clear that we are now reaping the fruits of success in our eye on investments we have been doing during the past five years, with the very focus on providing more comprehensive and larger scale solution and services to our partners and customers in the unified communication and all-ip markets.
underlying our success in 2019 is the progress we've made in several key financial indicators which best demonstrates our success since 2015. let me touch on each of them. revenue growth. we saw double-digit revenue growth for the second year in a row. we grew 13.7% in 2019. we grew 12.4% in 2018. margin expansion. let me talk first on the gross margins. we saw steady progress in improving gross margins from 60% in 2015 to 63.7% in 2019. planning for 2020, we expect further increase in gross margin. operational margin improved in more impressive manner. we ended 2019 with operating margin of 14.1% compared to the year-ago margin of 11.7% and compared to just 8.2% in 2017.
for 2020, we target again meaningful increase of operating margin to well above 15%. net income growth for four years in a row, we are delivering high double-digit net income growth in the range of 30% to 60% in every single year.
in 2019, we delivered 38.9% growth on the heels of delivering 54.9% growth in 2018. cash flow. we have demonstrated further consistent ability to deliver growing positive operating cash flow results in previous five years, generating $33.9 million in 2019, compared to the $25.6 million in 2018. out of the funds generated in the fourth quarter of '19, we've paid about $10.7 million to the israel innovation authority as part of the royalty buyout agreement signed in november in 2019.
finally, deferred revenues, we grew more than 25% in 2019 to a level of $62.2 million by the end of 2019 versus just $49.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2018. when we analyze what has driven the success in 2019, it is clear that the improved financial performance was achieved mainly due to the strong trend of pstn transition to all-ip in north america and in about three or four countries in western europe with a handful of major tier 1 service providers.
we expect this migration trend to ip to continue in coming years and we plan to engage with more service providers in countries, which have yet to start at all transforming their networks and services to businesses to all-ip in the coming decade. we're talking about five years to 10 years going forward. but on a more general level, if i have to highlight the key fundamental reasons for the success we enjoy, i'll say on a general level that the strength of our business is primarily related to the very strong and healthy markets we serve, and obviously our execution capability.
i have talked so far about the all-ip market. a bigger market that keeps growing for the past 10 years and we should keep growing for the next foreseeable future is the unified communication and unified communication-as-a-service market. this market exhibits compound annual growth rate of about 18% for several years now and with whole penetration only at about 25% in north america and only 7% globally, this market offer us a lot of room for expansion and growth for a voice infrastructure vendor like us. when you add to the mix, the leadership position we develop and the strong ties with our partners the picture gets rosier.
same growth trends apply to global digital transformation trends of businesses, gearing toward a digital workplace. and similarly such opportunity exist in the process of contact center migrating to the cloud into a saas model.
so as long as we keep executing as we did in 2019 and in previous years, we should see positive results in coming years. on top of this and in order to keep the business momentum and allow further expansion of our business in the future, we are investing substantial efforts and resources in new growth engine such as the voice.ai business announced two years ago and the new evolving meeting space market.
now to the business lines. key to the success in 2019 is the consistent progress in our networking business, which grew 17.7% year-over-year to $191.7 million accounting now to 96% of your overall business in 2019. the networking business comprises of two key business lines, the uc-sip business line and the gateway business line. the uc-sip business line grew above 20% in first quarter '19 and full year 2019, and provides now to about 55% of our business about $110 million in 2019.
while investments have stabilized in size in this business line over the past several years, revenues continue to grow with about 15% to 20% annually. as a result, the business line becomes quite profitable. it first achieved profitability in 2018 and now it has more than doubled in 2019. as such, we now enjoy growing profit margins, say results of the operation of leverage.
at this stage, we do not anticipate a change in this 15% to 20% annual growth in coming years for this business line. quite important to note is that the steady annual increase of sales of more softer products, and growing services in the uc-sip business line, we experienced substantial improvement in the gross margin of this business line. and please remember, at this stage this is $110 million line, 55% of our revenue in 2019.
now let's talk a bit about our gateway business, parallel to the growth in uc-sip, we enjoyed in 2019, a strong year in our gateway business, which grew above 10% compared to 2018 and reached a level of about $70 million. as mentioned before, this is substantially due to the ongoing strength in the multi-year continued migration of service providers pstn networks to all-ip. global services also demonstrated very solid growth and strength. i'll touch on that later on.
providing a quick snapshot into the first quarter of 2020. i'm glad to know that at this stage the trend in our business continues in january, the first month of the first quarter of 2020. touching on the highlights of sales in the fourth quarter in 2019, generally sales performed very well to and above the targets we set for them. so very good performance, remarkable performance primarily in north america, in the dach region, which is germany, switzerland and austria, in the uk, in cala, russia and asia pacific.
on an annual level, those were mainly in north america, the dach region and south europe, that provided most of the revenue. to mention some of the notable deals in the quarter, we won a huge multimillion project in cala, we are talking about project managed by telefonica, and which provide a solution to a large company, i'll refer to more details about that later.
also, on the business services side, we had very large purchase order with the north american service provider that's a buying customer for several years now. same since, i already mentioned the name deutsche telekom, deutsche telekom was a very strong for us overall 2019 and also in the quarter, a few hundreds of thousands of dollars. touching on the contact center space, i'll note two deals, one in brazil, one in canada both deals relied on using our sessions border controls and gateways with genesys and others.
to give you some examples to our customer wins. let me put more color and share a few examples of customer wins and expansions that we have secured part of this quarter. outlining several of the examples, you can get a sense for how is our business, our enterprise business, how it is evolving with large opportunities in large corporations, and how our strategy is aligned and growing with cloud adoption.
let me first start, touch on that south america multi-million project. last year, sorry last quarter, we presented a multi-million dollar win in the healthcare space in the us. this quarter, we were awarded an even bigger multi-million microsoft teams deal at the latin american government agency. this agency, which is a part of the local ministry of labor oversees a large national chain of schools for developing employees' skills. in this bid, we have positioned our entire portfolio of products and services including devices, networking, management tools and implementation services.
we are proud to win such deals as they demonstrate again that our strategy of single stop shop solutions holds tremendous value for the customers and end users. this deal validates our ability to offer a networking solution for over 100 branches together with over 10,000 of ip phones. it clearly sets us apart from competition and our ability to balance and offer a broad value proposition to the customer.
second, and staying on the microsoft teams program and exploring the dynamics of markets for very large enterprises, we started to rollout a teams deployment at one of the world largest consumer goods companies. this company was referred to us by microsoft at one of their internet shows. this was because we were highlighted at that show as the vendor empowering the rollout of hundreds of thousands of skype for business seats across four multinational enterprises.
this large consumer goods company has thoroughly vetted the microsoft solution, and it's just getting started with their global rollout. at first phase, we are providing our session border controllers, and professional services. this deal is representative of many such large enterprises globally that we work with on their microsoft teams' journey.
third and last, a very large project in the us related to our all-ip migration solution for service provider, a very important multi-million win came from a tier 1 service provider in the us where we were engaged to provide gear and services in a multi-million dollar deals, combining sd-wan and uc services to a nationwide healthcare company.
in this deal, our unique offering of universal cpe combining wireless and ethernet access with voice functionality was chosen as the sd-wan platform in order to reduce the number of several cpus down to only one product. this product combined with our gateways from centralized management and professional services were the deciding factor that got us this sizable deal.
now let me touch on microsoft. revenue was above 40% of the quarter revenue. in terms of growth, we saw 16% growth above the year-ago quarter. on an annual level, revenue in the microsoft ecosystem grew about 12% to over $80 million in 2019. key in the quarter was seemingly better environment for microsoft teams voice. while as we've planned during the first three quarters of 2019, we saw more large end users embracing teams in the fourth quarter of 2019, a trend we continue to see in january 2020. also, some customers are continuing in parallel with skype for business and teams.
for microsoft announcement, we all know that teams daily active users is growing rapidly in 2019, and so we expect the side-by-side with this dramatic growth in users -- number of users and with the expected completion of gaps on the voice side in teams, which are expected in this first half of 2020, we should see better overall market in 2020. gradual progress in developing market awareness to our meeting solution, rx suite of conferencing devices and dolby partnership is another positive development in the quarter, and we all look for 2020 to be the first year of our greater penetration in the conferencing space with our devices and solutions.
i'd like to mention also on our session border controllers line, which is the leading and most promising line at this stage within the uc-sip business line. in the fourth quarter, revenue grew 18.4% year-over-year, looking on overall 2019, we grew more than 20%. we also saw very strong booking. booking grew in the first quarter by 28%. this business line is characterized by extremely high gross margin that's above 85%, growing in comparison to the previous quarters. this is mainly to the fact that a quarter for our sales of product is now in software. so, we are being deployed generally substantially more in cloud, in software solution, in virtualized version, in data centers, all-in-all, very successful fast growing and high profit margin line.
on terms of geo split, we saw nice use, both almost equal between north america and western europe. also saw some 10% in asia pacific and less than that in cala. to mention the type of few customers that we serve in that business line. so we had one very large north american service provider using our sbc. we sold sbc for more than $1.5 million. we sold two large banks. one in brazil. one in russia, consuming our session border controllers for -- we're about to see in our solution for software device -- software-defined voice networks.
also, in the asia pacific large service provider is using our session border controllers within azure as a hosted solution for teams direct route sbc. all-in-all very successful quarter for sbc business line. last, let me touch on global services. in the press release, you saw the recognition side of the business. let me talk about the booking side of the business. so, on a quarterly basis, we saw the following, we saw an increase of 26.2% in the fourth quarter for total services.
we've seen 19.2% growth in maintenance contracts, but we have seen more than 60% growth in professional services, all that in the fourth quarter. when we go to the annual level and talking about what has changed. so, overall booking of services reached above $70 million in the year. we grew about 19% on an overall services level, close to 18% on the maintenance contracts, 24% on the professional services. so, all-in-all quite successful and rapid growth here. substantially, we saw -- to give some color on that we saw substantial growth in north america professional services mainly the team there is doing a fantastic job.
we keep winning new managed services contracts mainly in desire throughout sbc area. also, we see growing a number of requests to deploy and manage the teams voice on the office 365 side. now to our guidance for 2020. first, a general comment. we have not factored in any possible impact of the potential economic developments in 2020 as a result of the corona virus. it is simply too early for that for us.
now let me touch on revenue and earnings. revenue, based on current plans and data we have, we guide for another year of growth with revenue range set for $215 million to $222 million. the mid-range guidance is set at about $218 million and that represents a growth of about 9% compared to 2019. this is pretty much in line with the 10% growth we guided for year ago for 2019.
now let me touch on earnings. before i present our guidance for the year, i'd like to touch on a key factor affecting it for us as a company at core and based mostly in israel. i'm talking about the much different us dollar versus the new israeli shekel conversion rate environment, which is now expected for 2020 versus what we had in 2019.
based on current rates for budget and planning purposes, we assume a rate of ils3.45. in 2019, the average conversion rate has been about ils3.57. so we are talking about an increase of about 3.4% regarding all expenses nominated in new israeli shekel, which are about ils45 million a year, translating to an impact of about $1.6 million or $0.05 impact on our bottom-line compared to 2019.
now to the guidance. as a result of that, we now guide for continuing growth in the earnings of more than 20% in 2020, and we are setting the range to $1.08 to $1.12.
with that, i've basically completed my introduction for this session. thank you very much. operator, would you take us to the q&a session.
",":
operator
thank you. [operator instructions] our first question comes from the line of rich valera with needham & company. please proceed with your question.
rich valera -- needham and company -- analyst
thank you. i'd like to open with a question on the microsoft business. looks like you saw a nice pickup in the fourth quarter, the microsoft businesses, i guess, teams is starting to gain some momentum. can you talk about what is still in the pipeline for teams in terms of features that you see that could help further accelerate teams? and how you're thinking about the overall microsoft business in 2020 versus the 12% growth that you saw in 2019? thanks.
shabtai adlersberg -- president and chief executive officer
right. thank you, rich. first, you know, we know that there are several features missing for the voice implementation within teams. from our ongoing discussion with microsoft, we know that the plan is now to complete them in the first half of this year. so all-in-all, we know that much will start happening in the second half.
second, as i have mentioned before in the beginning of 2019, we've seen lot of potential end users, large corporation sitting on the fence. people were hesitant. the transition from skype for business to teams has just started. teams was not complete yet. and there was much delay. that gives some explanation to why we grew only 12% in 2019 versus more than 30% in 2018.
now, we do expect and we've seen that that's where we have a much more comprehensive portfolio and you can apply that to more phones that will be introduced during 2020. we can talk about the conferencing devices that we just -- end of the year, we just sent the first few 100 devices for evaluation by customers. so, a much more complete portfolio in 2020. also we are increasing the set of services we offer. and as i've mentioned or maybe it was not emphasized enough, we now start to deal substantially with more deployments where we not only deliver the products, but also provide services and in several cases, lately managed services, meaning large companies, a few hundreds and sometimes thousands of companies will rely on audiocodes to provide their ongoing daily microsoft teams operation.
so all-in-all, we're very optimistic regarding that could be a definite change in 2020 compared to 2019 and we will just have to wait and see for the next two quarters to see that indeed happening.
rich valera -- needham and company -- analyst
great. and i wanted to move on to voice.ai. this has been an area of significant investment for you. we just hoping you get a little -- put a little more color on kind of one, how much revenue contribution you've actually seen from that to-date? how much investment you've put into that on an annual basis? and how you're thinking about the potential growth of that business over the next couple of years?
shabtai adlersberg -- president and chief executive officer
right. so, first, let me put an overall framework on this. we have at this stage about 60 people employed in the voice.ai business, which we officially announced two years ago. the business is still growing. last year, we did above $2 million of sales in that line. we do expect an increase of at least 50% to 100% this year in 2020. the investment basically, we have two parts of the business. one is the recording services, the other one is more, the speech recognition and nlp services. so, in the recording side of the business, we have a compliance recording application, which is growing and starts to grow further and now the teams is a new market for them.
we've also discussed few months ago, launching meeting insights, which will allow us to record the interactions in the office. we're talking about meetings, which will be recorded, then we'll later on allow management and other people to analyze them and look for facts, automated -- automated action item taking, identify speakers, you'll have a great repository of voice interaction in the office that are searchable, pretty much compared to when you go for your outlook to look for a mail or a data message that was sent.
then we substantially improved our stack of technologies in the voice recognition area. we have developed a very strong deep neural network solution that's now deployed in two languages. at this stage, it's hebrew and german. also going to be deployed shortly with us english. nlp has been developed. we've been working substantially on opportunities in the customer engagement area, virtual assistant and we definitely start to pick up in the number of projects that we performed. so all-in-all, we're very -- while investing a lot, by the way, the expense on that business in 2019 was about $4.5 million, meaning that, it's quite a large investment, but we do feel that within the next three years this operation will become fully successful growing fast.
i'll mention also that, we did a very unique development that we call voice.ai gateway and that technology allows you to voice-enabled chatbots and with chatbots and both being used increasingly in the enterprise and in other places the ability to add voice channels to it both in the recognition side and then in the synthesizing side is a great solution. this solution is already being implemented with two or three large corporations. there are five or more in the pipeline. so all-in-all very encouraged by the progress we're making on the voice.ai.
rich valera -- needham and company -- analyst
got it, thank you for that. and then, i wanted to just talk about your -- the seasonality of your business into the first quarter. sounds like it's -- you are continuing to see pretty good momentum. in the last couple of years, you've actually seen a modest seasonal uptick q4 to q1. so just wondering how we should think about from a modeling perspective that the q1 revenue relative to the q4 revenue?
shabtai adlersberg -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, yeah. i've learned in the past not to rely on miracles, enjoy them. so, for planning purposes i usually plan on a down quarter that will be roughly around 2%. but you've mentioned, rightly, yes, in past years, we've been able to beat that and actually grow. so, we try to stay modest. i think we saw that in our guidance for the revenues and profits and we'll start a new year just as we did in 2019.
rich valera -- needham and company -- analyst
that's great. and then just wanted a clarification on the royalty agreement. understanding that will have a positive impact on the gross margin. i believe starting in first quarter of 2020, did it have any impact on the non-gaap gross margin in the fourth quarter of 2019?
shabtai adlersberg -- president and chief executive officer
yes, yes, definitely, you are so right. yes. already in the fourth quarter of 2019 we had a contribution of several hundreds of thousands of dollars in the quarter, but we do expect that in 2020 we will have close to a million contribution on each and every single quarter.
rich valera -- needham and company -- analyst
got it. and then just one more from me if i could. the non-gaap share count for the quarter, you have a gaap share count, but i couldn't find the non-gaap share count for fourth quarter of '19?
niran baruch -- chief financial officer
the non-gaap share count for diluted eps is 31.4 million shares.
analyst
31.4 million. okay, thank you very much.
niran baruch -- chief financial officer
you're welcome.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of mike latimore with northland capital markets. please proceed with your question.
mike latimore -- northland capital markets -- analyst
great. yeah. thanks very much. i'm just curious on the cloud, ucaas, ccaas, that whole kind of market segments. how much of your revenue comes from kind of the cloud market today?
shabtai adlersberg -- president and chief executive officer
so, it's growing. it's not substantial as these days. it's growing. we are deployed with our session border controllers and the management, centralized managed suite and the routing application in both aws and azure. we grew, actually in fourth quarter, we grew very nicely with our sbc and azure and in teams that is related to the sbc direct route. we are basically putting all efforts toward that. so, it's a process, but it will take time.
mike latimore -- northland capital markets -- analyst
got it. and then, it sounds like obviously microsoft's sort of the biggest platform environment [indecipherable] who would be sort of number two and three in the list there after microsoft?
shabtai adlersberg -- president and chief executive officer
we have -- we have number of partners. we have mentioned in the past few names like ringcentral, amazon, zoom and a few others. so obviously, we had, in the past also broadsoft now cisco, so that's a partner. if i have to call number two in terms of volume of sales, it's genesys at this stage. all of the others are still not comparable in size to either microsoft, genesys and/or broadsoft cisco.
mike latimore -- northland capital markets -- analyst
okay, got it. and then teams obviously, the teams subscriber counts grown rapidly. i think it was over 20 million in the september quarter. do you know like what percent of those teams users are also using some form of microsoft voice and where might that go?
shabtai adlersberg -- president and chief executive officer
so, you touched on a interesting point. we do see actually, obviously, there's a large installed base skype for business users and some of we have seen fourth quarter a number of them starting to move some of their users to teams. so, i assume that going forward there will be pure new teams accounts. but at the same time, we will see some of our skype for business adding teams users.
mike latimore -- northland capital markets -- analyst
got it. and then you talked about a number of large teams win i believe in the quarter. i assume those deployments will be in a cloud delivery model?
shabtai adlersberg -- president and chief executive officer
yes, yes. when we're talking about teams, we're talking about cloud deployments. we're talking -- but then, some of the components maybe installed on-prem and session border controllers could be placed either in a cloud and/or on-premise. but all-in-all the majority or the whole implementation is meant to be cloud based. yes.
mike latimore -- northland capital markets -- analyst
great. and just last one. how important are acquisitions to your sort of medium-term strategy?
shabtai adlersberg -- president and chief executive officer
good question. well, we keep growing nicely on the top line, 13.7% this year, on the bottom line more than 30%. it's not crucial. we will -- if there's one area i'd like to look at, it would be more the voice.ai business where we would like to inject larger, bigger operation into that business unit than we would maybe look more for m&a. so it's not by all means, we have very nice organic growth and we'll keep doing that. it's not crucial. but we will definitely be helpful growing the new business.
mike latimore -- northland capital markets -- analyst
got it. great, thanks. good luck.
shabtai adlersberg -- president and chief executive officer
sure. thank you.
operator
thank you. [operator instructions] our next question comes from the line of greg burns with sidoti & company. please proceed with your question.
greg burns -- sidoti & company -- analyst
good morning. you had mentioned the expectation for uc-sip to continue growing at about 15% to 20%, based on the guidance, i think that's implying like a flattish year for gateways, but can you just maybe give your outlook for the gateway business in 2020 based on your revenue guidance? thanks.
shabtai adlersberg -- president and chief executive officer
yes. uc-sip will keep growing at the rate we have mentioned. gateways, we enjoyed a very unique year of up 10%. obviously, we have done our bottom-up analysis for 2020. it looks like we'll continue to grow on but on a more modest mode. whether the line will stay flat or grow and/or decline by you know several percent that is still to be seen throughout the year. so, we do bid on our growth on uc-sip mainly and in on gateways to hold the line for us, a very profitable business line. but we do not expect growth from that.
greg burns -- sidoti & company -- analyst
okay, thanks. and then in terms of your partnership with dolby and you're entering the meetings market. what's been the early reception, what are you hearing from customers and maybe what gives you confidence as we go into 2020, and your ability to gain share in that market.
shabtai adlersberg -- president and chief executive officer
okay. so this is a bit premature and we announced the launch in around september, october of last year. we did send the first product, that's a joint product by us and dolby to several large companies, at this stage some hundreds of units. we know this interest in those units. with the [technical issues] think probably expected around february or march this year.
greg burns -- sidoti & company -- analyst
okay thanks. can you just update us on your tax status in both the us and israel you know with the tax status [technical issues] what do you expect to be full tax payer in israel, i think you're paying in the us already, but [technical issues]
niran baruch -- chief financial officer
if you are referring to the expected tax payment in the next one or two years, we do not expect more than $1 million in terms of cash tax payment. we have nols and we created the deferred tax asset for that, and that will offset any future tax payment both in israel and in the us.
greg burns -- sidoti & company -- analyst
okay, great. thank you.
operator
thank you, ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our question-and-answer session. i'll turn the floor back to mr. adlersberg for any final comments.
shabtai adlersberg -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, operator, we would like to thank everyone who attended our conference call today. with continued good business momentum and execution in 2019, we believe we are on track to achieve another strong growth year in 2020 in our business. we look forward to your participation in our next quarterly conference call. thank you very much. have a nice day. bye-bye.

i will now turn the call over back to shabtai.
shabtai adlersberg -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, niran. we are pleased to report strong financial results for the first quarter 2020. as stated earlier in our financial release, we enjoyed good business momentum in the core, both in the enterprise space and the service provider space. we experienced growth in all of the major market segments in which we participate including the uc-as-a-service market, the contact center market and the service provider all-ip migration market. underlying our success in the first quarter of 2020 is the financial performance. let me touch on each of the main points.
revenue growth, we continued our double-digit growth of past two years and delivered 11.7% growth year-over-year. gross margin expansion, we kept the steady progress in improving gross margin. in the first quarter, gross margin was 66.1%, compared with 53% in the first quarter of 2019, and 65.1% in fourth quarter 2019.
operating margin improved substantially from 11.9% in the first quarter a year ago to 15.2% in the first quarter of 2020. we expect continued growth in gross margin in the second quarter in the second half of 2020 as a result of lower expenses anticipated in certain budget items resulting from the covid-19 pandemic impact.
net income growth, we saw nice increase in earnings in the first quarter 2020, delivering net income of $7.8 million compared to $5.5 million in first quarter 2019, an increase of 41.8%. cash flow, we kept producing cash from operating activities, delivering $6.8 million, in line with our plan for the whole year.
finally, deferred revenues continue to grow and amounted to $64.2 million an increase of 23.4% over first quarter 2019. i'd like to stress and note here that with revenue growing steadily in the past several quarters and deferred revenues growing in a similar trend all along, our ability to meet the top-line targets of every new quarter we're stepping in is improved, hence the momentum and the confidence in achieving the revenue target in coming quarters.
now, to an update as to the impact of the coronavirus pandemic in the first quarter of 2020 and projections for second quarter and the full year. around the middle of the first quarter, we experienced difficulties in the manufacturing for our hardware products in china. with china resuming business activity partially in the second half of february and more so in march, we were able to quickly recover from the associated delay and we were able to ship all of the products as planned during the quarter. then in compliance with the israeli regulation meant to cope with the covid-19 crisis, we have moved on march 16 the majority of our headquarter employees, about 85% of them, to a work-from-home basis. similar such transitions took place in our u.s. facilities and elsewhere in the world. the transition went smoothly including our research and development team, sales and marketing. only must-carry-on premise activities such as warehouse, final testing and qa, which have to use on-prem equipment continues to be carried in our facilities. i'm glad to report now that, so far, none of our employees was diagnosed positive with regards to the coronavirus.
now to a pleasant surprise related to working remotely using collaboration tools. as i've mentioned before, we moved to working from home on march 16. since then, i can report that productivity has substantially improved. the improved productivity was confirmed across the company's various teams. prior to the crisis, we were using skype for business on premise at office which did great for our next collaboration. however, now remotely, where communication and collaboration is your only savior, nothing gets done unless it is well communicated, documented, followed, etc. currently, communication and collaboration is much more crucial when you're not in the office. so, we see now great future for collaboration in our core activity, mainly with large enterprises. to a large extent and for certain use cases, work-from-home in a well managed and coordinated work environment seems to provide similar, if not superior, productivity compared to working on-prem. this phenomena deserves a longer discussion. i'll leave it at that. but this phenomenon also points to the ability of businesses to lower operating expenses in certain areas going forward.
now to some of the top highlights of the first quarter. our main market, as you see is the service and we all have seen use of uc-as-a-service exploded in the first quarter. as the world is going digital and its transformation to a digital and remote workplace is in full power these days. in recent years, we have channeled most of our investment and efforts toward the unified communication and collaboration market. in 2019, we derived above 55% of our $200 million annual revenue from this market. serving to the markets of skype for business and teams market provided around $80 million of this revenue. in previous calls, we highlighted the fact that the ucaas market is growing for the past 10 years and that we see it continuing this growth for the foreseeable future. according to a forecast from early 2019, this market has shown compound annual growth rate of about 18% and with growth constructions to about 25% in north america and 7% globally. obviously, this market offers a lot of room for expansion and growth for a voice infrastructure vendor like us.
in the first quarter of 2020, we saw acceleration in the transition to ucaas compared to previous year. this is attributed mainly to the explosive growth of several hundred percent to more than 600 million users worldwide using communication collaboration and web video conferencing as a result of the coronavirus pandemic and the associated move to working remotely in work-from-home. as reported by leading companies such as microsoft, cisco, and zoom, ucaas usage skyrocketed in the first quarter of 2020, a phenomena which contributed to increased sales across the board in this space. as a result, revenues related to uc-as-a-service in the first quarter grew to more than 60% of our business. this growth related mainly to service in the microsoft teams market. we will provide more details on this later on. this is not a passing trend. we saw continued strength in april and believe we will see continued substantial growth of uc-as-a-service in coming years. i believe that it is now realized by most leading businesses worldwide that an advanced and efficient communication and collaboration application is key to improved level of productivity across the enterprise and also key in the new emerging work-from-home trend.
now to review some of the business lines in which we are focused. our networking business kept growing 12% year-over-year and has reached a level of $49.9 million, accounting now for 96% of our business. our technology line remains at 4% only. the networking business comprises of two key business lines, the uc-sip and the gateway business line. the uc-sip business line grew nicely in the quarter but that's that in the moment. we saw decline in our gateway business. uc-sip business line grew substantially above 20% in the first quarter and provides now to above 60% of our business revenue in the quarter due to the growth where increased sales in three of our leading product lines, including the session border controller line, our centralized network management software, and our advanced routing management solution. noteworthy is the fact that revenue in the uc-sip business lines were substantially above this 15% to 20% annual rate in previous years. gross margin for this business line increased and is now above 65%, mainly due to the increased sales of software products, transition to cloud communication and nice level of service sales. all these combined contributed massively to the company overall gross margin of 66.1%.
so, in summary of the review and current trends so far, i would say that based on the momentum in our business activity during the first quarter of 2020, in recent few weeks, coupled with good productivity in our operations, we believe with our ability to meet the original target performance trend for the second quarter and full year is in place. also, i'd like to add that currently we have no plans for layoffs. also, as a matter of fact, the company expect to keep select hiring worldwide for new jobs this year.
we had capital for operations in the microsoft base, so revenues grew more than 20% compared to the year ago quarter. that was a very strong quarter revenue wise, also from the standpoint of creating new opportunities. newly created opportunities in the first quarter more than doubled compared to the year ago quarter. we see continued accelerated trend of new opportunities created in recent weeks in april. as for microsoft teams, microsoft reported massive demands for the cloud services and swift adoption as part of -- was often due to the corona crisis. they've reported 44 million daily active users before the end of march. so one can expect that would keep growing up in april. so they've reported in mid-march, 44 million compared to only 20 million in november. i will just say that those are business customers with the [indecipherable] consumer who use our video conferencing.
one major comment that i need to make here is that the majority of the teams deployment these days are mainly used for collaboration purposes, meaning the functionality of presence and chat are the key functionality being used. and most of the time, voice channels are not added. according to some estimates, we believe that only about 5% maybe less than 10% includes voice. that means a lot for us, understanding that since voice -- since daily active users will grow to 100 million and above. that leaves for us a huge area to grow once we will see more emphasis put on the voice side of things. and we believe that we should see that coming in the second half of 2020. we have seen in the quarter, accelerating number of opportunities with microsoft teams. we've seen, also in the space, a lot of activity in meeting devices. we've seen gradual progress developing in market awareness through our partnership with dolby and our conference room devices, the rx suite.
we have announced, few weeks ago, audiocodes live for microsoft teams. we have a plan to release the product toward the end of april. audiocodes live for microsoft teams provides a managed service to fully voice-enable teams. the core services include teams direct route, microsoft tenant management, user lifecycle management, moves, add and changes of personnel and saas integration with on-premise it and legacy voice communication. all in all, it allows businesses to move fast the team relying on audiocodes products and expertise in deploying projects in a very fast manner.
let me just mention -- give some color as to some notable deals. we have won a deal with one of the world largest chemical company with over 100,000 employees as they've selected microsoft teams and decided to work with audiocodes for our networking solution. we're primarily selected, thanks to our abilities to run on microsoft azure, and implementing microsoft's new local media optimization functionality. for their remote branches, they selected the audiocodes mediant 800 of managed applications -- client sessions, sorry. this means that audiocodes is monitoring and managing the mediant 800 from our network operations center. this account again demonstrates how audiocodes cloud and premise portfolio are working together to meet the needs of giant companies and when combined with our professional services, we have a very compelling solution.
another example is a huge energy company. our devices strategy continue to gain ground with large deal done with one of the world's largest oil and energy manufacturers. this company is rolling out microsoft teams and they've selected our flagship c450 color touchscreen phone for their office workers. over time, and as they grow their deployments, we expect about 1 million in desk phone devices and mixed room devices. we were awarded this project, thanks to our portfolio of devices and excellent sound quality, a centralized management that we demonstrated throughout the evaluation process.
in other accounts, in the unified communication market, zoom, we have -- growing the number of the zoom opportunities, which is the first quarter of such growth. we've seen trends of opportunity often within an amount potential of few millions. we have been -- those opportunities are mainly in north america but some come from emea and apac and in all opportunities, it's mainly the sbc and the ip phone, which was certified by zoom for our key offering. also, aws, we went live with a very efficient service of our session border controller, which is a pay-as-you-go sbc, in aws marketplace end of january, we have generated more than 30 customers in february and march. we have a first public case study, a company called emc insurance, 2400 employees, 19 u.s. location using aws chime sip trunk.
going to our session border controllers, with a record quarter, we grew more than 30% year-over-year. most of the revenue came from enterprise accounts, about 70% of revenue. in terms of geo split, it was mainly even between north america and europe. it's contributing about 36%. we also saw a stepping up in the new created opportunity number. to give you some perspective on the line, that line has been -- annually that line has been about $16 million in 2015. we should end up 2020 with more than $70 million, so nice grow. also on the quarterly basis, we keep growing both product and services, so all in all, one of our most important business. time has shown, it is very competitive. we're winning many wins against competitors, i mentioned previously, [indecipherable].
so i mentioned the products, the new products we have, so, i've mentioned the pay-as-you-go offering in aws market place. aligning with our aws -- aligned our offering with how aws charges, which are in both connector, as i've mentioned, we have more than 30 customers. also today, we've announced cooperation with google-the google one click program. this is a true software-as-a-service offering that connect google's dialogflow virtual agents to telephony, a new brand portal where our customers can purchase phone numbers in the u.s. and u.k. in a moment and connect them to dialogflow virtual agents. in the future, we intend to connect dialogflow to our voice.ai gateway, which will provide better status in the access.
coming to talk a bit about the work-at-home, the global covid-19 crisis is closing companies all over the world, to move all over a significant process of the workforce to remote working in order to ensure business continuity. this is what is driving teams and zoom usage. audiocodes announced three work-at-home offerings. we have announced audiocodes live for microsoft teams, i discussed that already. we also offer a connectivity solution for work-at-home contact center agents. this is an highly efficient web, rx50-based cellphone, which ensures high voice quality solution for work-at-home contact centers.
two examples, a large north american health benefits company, which is moving all of their agents who work from home, basically they have determined that agents working from home are more proactive, it is easier to find and retain talent, employee satisfaction is higher and improved -- provides business agility. audiocodes was selected to design and deploy our complete one voice solution, include opus-enabled session border controllers, ip phones in our management one voice operation center. this project is expected to gradually expand to support more than 15,000 agents who work at home. last, just to mention that another company from australia, another contact center company has adopted webrtc as their solution for agents at home. we think the rapid growth of different retail chains that -- which work at home, technology can help much. this company was, you know, just needed to expand their customer service capacity to take order via phone calls and work-at-home agents and leveraging our webrtc capability exposure for our session border controller.
we also won, and this is a very notable win, we won one of the leading uc market providers worldwide. they are expanding their service and operations to specific countries in apac and cala, in need for right and needed a high capacity session border controller platform due to regulatory requirements. we were selected out of seven sbc contenders, thanks to our flexible sbc capabilities alongside with our ovoc lifecycle management suite and primarily gross time voice quality monitoring. and with that i've basically came through the end of the review of our business line activity.
i'll just get back to few more words about guidance. based on the activity in the first quarter, we believe that we should be able to meet our original performance targets for the second quarter and full year. and so we do not change the guidance provided earlier for the revenue range of $214 million to $222 million. we are confident as to earnings. we are confident in our ability to continue the growth in our earnings. as a result of the success to grow on it in the first quarter above the original plan, we are now updating our earnings guidance and increased the earnings range to $1.09 to $1.13. with that i have completed my presentation and we can move the call to the q&a session. operator?
",":
operator
thank you. we'll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [operator instructions] the first question is from the line of rich valera with needham. please proceed with your questions.
rich valera -- needham and company -- analyst
thank you. congratulations on the strong results in a challenging environment, shabtai and team.
shabtai adlersberg -- president and chief executive officer
thanks.
rich valera -- needham and company -- analyst
so you gave the growth for the microsoft related business and i think you said well over 20%. so i'm wondering if you could put a finer point on that in terms of how fast it grew. and then, i'm wondering if you could give us a sense of how fast you're expecting that business to grow for all of 2020. i know historically you've tended to bracket that in the range of 15% [phonetic] to 20% [phonetic], but it sounds like you're running ahead of that so far. and then obviously you reiterated your full year guidance and it sounds like, actually the microsoft piece is running ahead of plan. so wondering if anything is running below plan. i know you mentioned your gateway business was down for the quarter. is that what you expected and do you expect that business to be down for the year? so a lot there, but i'll let you answer those things, shabtai.
shabtai adlersberg -- president and chief executive officer
okay. as for microsoft, well, originally, as we all remember, 2019 has been a bit slow, but toward the end of 2019, i believe that many of the potential customer moved off the fence they were sitting on and decided to go with teams. so that has driven, initially in january and february, good portion of the business. then as we all know the corona crisis really caused dramatic growth in usage of uc-as-a-service, minutes of meetings calls, conferences. so that has definitely helped to raise up interest in the solution, which for business purposes seems to be, at that moment, probably the best cloud-based solution. then on top of that i would say that we were expecting voice to take part again in the second half of the year and i think, due to the fact that conferencing has been substantially more than initially planned, use of web conferencing drives the use of phones. i mean if you watch zoom play, which went out initially with a conferencing solution and then follow that with the zoom phone, you would see similar such focus here. conferencing function in teams is very successful, very good, but that drive the usage of phone calls, etc. so all in all, i will tell you that it's a bit premature for us to make a call for the full year. we definitely see higher new opportunities, you know, development rate. so at this stage, i would stay with our $15 million to $20 million projection by may [phonetic] as well be that when we come to our next conference call, we may up that. so we need to wait.
as to gateways, yes, gateways declined in the quarter more than 10%. actually we now can start to see that this is a trend. fortunately enough, gateways are being called sold these days to medical service providers and they are basically sold in two forms. one is, you know, stand-alone gateway, the other one is gateways which are embedding routing capability and dsl capability because of that type of product, msbr, which stands for multi-service business router. now, all our sales in the service provider to market for the all-ip were almost as planned. there was no meaningful decline there. but the portion of msbr sold was more than the gateways sold. so that's one explanation. i'll tell you one more very important point is that when talking about revenues, we usually -- we all know that we combine product revenues and sales revenues and while service revenues remain at the same level or even grow a bit, the decline was mainly in the product. so that gives you some color as to what happened in the gateway business.
rich valera -- needham and company -- analyst
got it. and then i didn't quite catch, you gave some numbers for sbc revenue for last year and i think projected this year. could you just reiterate those numbers? i didn't catch them. and then if you could say how much of that sbc revenue you think was software last year and how much you think might be software this year.
shabtai adlersberg -- president and chief executive officer
okay. so roughly, the numbers, because i don't have them here and we know those numbers are internal data, and not really are discussed, but i would say that session border controllers were sold for a bit above $60 million last year. this year we look to grow this above 20% annually. as i've mentioned, in the first quarter, we grew above that target, we grew 30%. that's roughly with regards to session border controllers. it's the mix -- by the way, the mix has been 25% software last year, i believe that we will see substantially higher growth this year in software simply because many of the new implementations are cloud-based both in aws and azure.
rich valera -- needham and company -- analyst
got it. that's helpful and then you mentioned your gross margin, you expected -- i think you said you expected it to be up in q2 and you referenced covid-related expenses or expenses you're not going to incur because of covid. i wasn't sure what that comment meant. but if you could just clarify on your expectations for gross margin trajectory i guess into q2.
shabtai adlersberg -- president and chief executive officer
right, so, as we know, business activity around the world kind of stalled from the middle of the first quarter and still continues for the second quarter, we did a new estimate of budget items going forward. obviously everybody understand that traveling is going down. so expense on travelling is going down, same for marketing, simply because events which -- some of which draw a lot of expense in terms of presents and sponsorship and participation. that is not happening yet in a major way. so we expect some of these items to come down in the second quarter and second half of 2020, and that would be the source of large expense and increase the operating margin, not gross margin but operating margin.
rich valera -- needham and company -- analyst
got it, ok. so that was more in reference to operating than gross margin. okay, that makes sense. and then could you just give us an update on the voice.ai business, kind of where that is in terms of scale growth and any updates there.
shabtai adlersberg -- president and chief executive officer
right. so we have two main activities there, the nlp asr activity and then the recruiting activity. the asr nlp activity, this is very -- grows very nicely in the first quarter. we were hit -- we plan to go major efforts in other countries, but now that has stalled due to the virus. on the other hand, we have very interesting activity developing around our two new products that we have delivered to market as mentioned one in our press release, meeting insights, that is a software productivity enhancement tool which allows you to basically process, analyze and derive actionable items for meetings in a very efficient way. and basically will allow meetings to become source of productivity again compared to what is growing today. we have more than 10 accounts right now in beta and we expect to grow in a larger way in the second quarter.
another very interesting product connected with the announcements we made with the google dialogflow, the voice ai gateway, which basically allow to connect telephony in those channels into how the overview of established world of virtual agents embark. so we provide -- we have today one of the best product that's allowed. if you take the corona crisis situation where people were trying to call institutions, health organization, etc, you had massive, lot of people, most of which do not really know to use text-based chat bots for which telephony can help much, take help from people equally in their stride. so we are providing right now a very efficient solution which allows to connect massive number of telephony channels into those bots. so those are two of the new developments we have in the voice.ai business.
rich valera -- needham and company -- analyst
great, thanks for taking the questions, shabtai. i appreciate it.
shabtai adlersberg -- president and chief executive officer
sure. you're welcome.
operator
thank you. our next question is from the line of tavy rosner with barclays. please proceed with your question.
tavy rosner -- barclays -- analyst
hi, thanks for taking my questions and congratulations on the solid results. as a follow-up to your comments on guidance, you talked about how the company managed to weather the impact of covid-19 on your supply chain, and you also talked about how the switch to working from home is having a positive impact on demand. so i guess, looking at your reiteration of guidance, are you guys being conservative or, put another way, if working from home was to last for a longer period, would that be very positive for your top-line?
shabtai adlersberg -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. i think, in one of my conversation with one of our investors, it became obvious that audiocodes sits right now on two of the main trends in communications. one, which is the collaborations team and second is the work-from-home team. and because we have huge investment made over the last years and actually, we are ready with those solution connected with the right partners in the market, yes, we definitely, you know, are very confident in our business to keep growing. i just mentioned that if you look on our bottom-line earnings, we've been able to grow earnings more than 25%, 30% every year in the past five years and definitely now in view of the new developments, there is no reason to be pessimistic about it. i think we will keep growing, we just need to do the right things. we need to execute.
tavy rosner -- barclays -- analyst
that's helpful. and i guess the last one for me, how do you guys view acquisitions as part of your growth strategy? i'm asking in the context of your growing cash balance.
shabtai adlersberg -- president and chief executive officer
right. so it's a matter of the regular business. we -- in each of the business line, we do monitor and study the environment, the other players, competition sometimes and once we will get into conclusion that you know a business would be necessary, or very good to help grow or if we feel, make it jump, we will definitely do that. so yes, we are always looking for opportunities.
tavy rosner -- barclays -- analyst
great, thank you. i'll get back in the queue.
shabtai adlersberg -- president and chief executive officer
sure.
operator
[operator instructions] the next question is from the line of greg burns with sidoti & company. please proceed with your question.
greg burns -- sidoti & company -- analyst
good morning. just want to follow-up maybe a little bit on the last question. just to get a better understanding of how the business may be negatively impacted by the actions taken to fight the virus, whether it be from a sales or deployment perspective and if we do see the economy is starting to open up a little bit more, is there potentially maybe a backlog of business that could provide even more of a tailwind as we go into the second half of the year? thanks.
shabtai adlersberg -- president and chief executive officer
sure. so i believe that the world moves these days much faster through cloud communications and our real challenge as a company would be to cope with the developments and, you know, if you look on names mentioned in this call, some of the worlds biggest, largest and quite fast ramping companies that are leading unified communication and collaboration market forward, for us, that would be a big challenge to keep pace with the need to support key partners and customers. so this is where most of our energy would -- will go for. due to the fact that businesses going cloud, there's less and less requirements for on-prem deployment. so that is coming down, that's a plus. and, all in all, i believe that, we kind of revealed the value of work remotely and be efficient and we think that will really help us to get more -- we will not get leaner, we will grow and hire people but i think we can definitely grow meaner, meaning we can now get access into good resources that we can find in other places. so all in all, it's very positive. we're not really concerned with -- if you want to touch the negative of this quarter, we're not really bothered by the decline in gateways. that was perceived to happen along the time and the fact that now uc-sip is more than 60% percent of the business and gateways really declined to a level where that very decline is immaterial. i think we are in good shape.
greg burns -- sidoti & company -- analyst
okay, great, thanks. and in terms of the the voice.ai, and what you're doing with google, how -- what's the business model there? is it a flat fee? is it transactional? and what kind of installed basis google have with that platform? thank you.
shabtai adlersberg -- president and chief executive officer
okay. so very simply, this is a software-as-a-service solution, meaning that every chat bot developer that wants to add phone access today in the u.s. and the u.k. and goes to the site and click on using our solution-the one-click telephony gateway, there is a price that's for the team. so, all in all, it's a software-as-a-service solution, very simple.
greg burns -- sidoti & company -- analyst
okay and just the installed base that maybe google has a number of bots or the number of transactions that they're transacting among, just to get a maybe a feel for the size of the market or maybe you could talk about the overall size of the bot market, the opportunity you see there for yourself. thanks.
shabtai adlersberg -- president and chief executive officer
right. actually, what we announced today is a very simple -- we worked hard on implementing it, it's not that trivial. but still, it's just the first step that you can think about a cpaas solution, a communication platform-as-a-service connected to the one-click telephonic gateway. so, we intend to connect some of our capabilities in voice processing to create a more advanced communication platform-as-a-service that will help dialogflow virtual agents to use mainly in terms of our voice channels. so definitely there's huge potential out there. the bot industry grows, there's the need for easy access and we're bringing the telephony access to it using just the same bots that are there.
greg burns -- sidoti & company -- analyst
okay. and lastly the -- i guess when you gave your initial guidance, the shekel to u.s. dollar was like i think like a $0.05 headwind or so, but it seems like the shekel has depreciated a little bit that you're kind of -- what you are embedding in your guidance change in terms of the fx impact?
shabtai adlersberg -- president and chief executive officer
yes. the fx change have very important point. yes, indeed, during the crisis, the u.s. dollar has appreciated against the new israeli shekel. we took advantage of that and basically, when compared to the original budget, we have -- we will now have, in each of the coming quarter, a better budget position because expenses in u.s. dollars are going to be lower.
greg burns -- sidoti & company -- analyst
okay, thank you.
shabtai adlersberg -- president and chief executive officer
sure.
brett maas -- managing director, hayden ir
shabtai, we have a question from a shareholder, came in via email. can you please go into the details about the transition from microsoft skype for business to teams, as well as in the past, you've indicated this migration might be headwinds to microsoft revenues. also could you go into more detail on the transition? how is microsoft doing? is teams as functional yet as skype? what was the growth in microsoft related sales? what is the difference in content for skype implementation as compared with teams for audiocodes?
shabtai adlersberg -- president and chief executive officer
okay, that's a long one. okay. i'll try to take it one at a time. basically we -- i have mentioned, i mean, we as a company used skype for business for many years. it's a great unified communication on-prem solution. when we moved to work-from-home, we started using it personally, as you said, and then, you know, the huge amount of traffic over the internet side, that is usage of teams. i was surprised to see much better performance of teams compared to the skype for business and also obviously microsoft putting all its weight behind teams, adding features really quickly. so in a matter of two, three weeks, it became apparent that we want to, at this stage, put skype for business behind us and move to teams. we actually had a project when we were all at home. the it team took the project to move all of the company, we're talking about more than 500 seats from skype for business to teams. glad to say that, basically, i was -- they were afraid to move me among the first one. so i moved as [indecipherable] before 100. anyway, if everything plays well and everybody is very happy with using teams, i can tell you that in all other people complain now that using teams really makes them work essentially harder than they are used to when they came to the office and [indecipherable] and small stuff.
so, yes, teams is very efficient. i believe that in view of our experience, we will definitely see other customers of microsoft using skype for business consider moving to teams really quick. all in all, we believe that we are on top of that. i think we are one of the leading company, if not the largest one, that supports that transition. and so far, we can see, skype for business revenues are not going down dramatically simply because there's lot of expansion of accounts that have been declining seven, five and three years ago, because they keep buying equipment for their other facilities. but we definitely see a growth up with teams and hopefully i've covered all of your questions, brett, i don't remember all of them now.
brett maas -- managing director, hayden ir
no, it's ok. two more, where should gross margins level off and why? and then also, can you explain what you can sell into enterprise accounts that use ucaas service like ringcentral?
shabtai adlersberg -- president and chief executive officer
okay. so that is exactly what audiocodes live is about. so we definitely have a lot of products associated with deployment of teams, our session border controllers for direct route, phones, management systems, conference devices, etc, but the real value is really in our ability to help the companies get fast on board and the closure service very fast. so we will provide them day zero service, provide them with the planning and the deployment and then day two service with bringing it up and monitoring and everything. so, all in all, i think we can expedite the deployment of teams account, definitely in the mid-market for smbs. and by the way, one of the products announced which is called audiocodes live cloud is exactly that. we target large channels, the companies could be service providers who will then deploy our own solutions to their customers.
operator

i will now turn the call back over to shabtai.
shabtai adlersberg -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, niran. we're very pleased to report record financial results for the fourth quarter and the full year 2020. let me talk first about several major milestones achieved throughout the quarter and the full year.
first and foremost is the strong financial performance, which niran just provided a detailed description of it. i'd like to stress some of the most important achievements, which are strong expansion of our gross margin, operating margin and jump in net income, strong cash flow, positive cash flow, all i'll discuss further on in the following. then it's the evolution of our enterprise business, now close to 80% of our business, growing 17% year-over-year. third is the resurgence of three new growth engines for 2021 and going forward, namely microsoft team's, contact center and conversational ai, all in the enterprise space heading into 2021.
then, it's the rapid transition for our solution and services to real-time cloud communications. much was achieved in 2020. we now invest full force and accelerate investment in these areas driving the momentum into more real-time cloud communication solutions.
on top of this, we have substantially moved our focus in sales to its recurring revenue model as compared to the previous years, where the majority of sales was done as capex transaction.
to highlight this last point, in march 2020, we have announced audiocodes live initiative, which is a portfolio of professional and managed services designed to offer adequate voice expertise products and solution to enterprises via flexible subscription-based managed service model. we have already made nice progress in the second half of 2020 and now see the momentum building up into 2021.
now, let me touch on the achievements made on the financial front. overall, company topline revenue grew 10% -- above 10% year-over-year. however, once you break down the revenue into key segments, enterprise and service providers, one can easily see that the progress made in 2020 in the enterprise space, about 78% of our business today was substantially higher and more impressive.
enterprise business consisting mainly of unified communication, ucaas and contact center, grew 17% in 2020 and now provides for about 78% of the overall company revenue.
we expect this annual growth rate to continue well into 2021 and beyond for reasons i will dwell on shortly. therefore, in our updated long-term financial model for next three years, we can clearly see that the company annual top-line will step up to a range of 13% to 15% growth annually, every year in two years from today.
ucaas and contact center segments will drive this growth going forward. ucaas is driven mainly by continued success in the microsoft teams space, where annual revenue grew by over 300% year-over-year and more than 30% compared to the third quarter of 2020. additionally, we experienced higher than originally planned revenue coming from the contact center business, which grew over 15% in 2020.
with the world adopting substantially more collaboration and work-from-home in the coming years, the new normal, so to speak, we anticipate similar such growth in 2021 and beyond.
now, let me touch on the achievements made on the financial front. to provide a more complete picture of the revenue in 2020, i'll just add that while we grew nicely on the enterprise, we didn't do so well on the service provider front and technology. i'll say that we have experienced a decline in service providers business about -- which is now about 18% of business and which has declined for about 10% year-over-year; and also continuing small decline in the technology business, which now provides for about 4% of business. so, 78% of business grew 17%, about 22% declined. and that gives you the average of about 10% growth for the full year.
providing more color on growth in different business lines in 2020. uc-sip business line grew about 20% year-over-year. by the way, this would be the last time we will report numbers on uc-sip, very simply, as this indicator bundles growing software-based business line, such as the sbc management software and routing software, together with devices and hardware appliances used in the service provider space and in on-prem deployments.
as these two last ones are bound to continue to suffer from the ongoing pandemic and not essential to our business, we will drop the uc-sip report. it's not going to be a good indicator to indicate our business health. we will obviously track our business through the development in our ucaas and contact center and conversational ai business.
revenue related to ucaas as a whole grew close to 20% as well. all in all, we're talking about $140 million annually at the end of 2020. revenue related to sales of session border controllers, sbc, have jumped in the fourth quarter, bringing this business line very close to $100 million level for overall 2020. that's a real jump. the overall year, we sold above 40 plus percent, real cornerstone in our business going forward.
service revenue grew about 20% in the first quarter, 16.7% annually, professional and managed services growing substantially faster in the mix. so, lots of emphasis on managed services, professional services, those are growing very fast. actually, on an annual level, we're talking about 30% per year, which is nice growth.
now, let's talk about the growth engines, which is becoming key factor for 2021 success and beyond. entering 2020, microsoft on-prem skype for business was our main growing business. however, with the pandemic growing in impact throughout the first quarter, two new key major trends evolved for the year, collaboration and work-from-home. these two trends became essential to preserve business continuity and workplace productivity in the enterprise world.
these trends drove as a result accelerated transition toward cloud communication and the introduction of series of more new key technologies that we have developed, such as webrtc, call automation processing, intelligent assistance and virtual agents.
as such, we emerge out of 2020 and head into 2021 with three new growth engines. the first and most visible one is the microsoft teams, which became in 2020 the fastest growing business for us. it has grown more than 300% year-over-year and more than 30% in the last quarter over the previous quarter.
next to it, we saw accelerated growth of activity in the contact center, where a series of disruptions in this space related to the transition to cloud supporting high-quality communication for work-from-home agents over the open internet and the increased need for call automation and self-service drive growth in this space.
third engine is the conversational ai, which has become a top priority for many contact centers. you need to quickly and efficiently respond and answer customer calls coming in large masses, it's people who are locked at home and providing a satisfactory customer experience.
now, to our long-term financial model. as we've mentioned before, gross margin and operating margin have demonstrated record levels in 2020. we ended the year with gross margin for the fourth quarter at 71.5% and 26.2% for the operating margin.
by the way, talking about gross margin, we looked into our annual performance, and i'd like to draw your attention to the progress we made in the past five years where gross margin stepped from about 60% back in 2015 to 68.1% in 2020. this is a result of the shift of mix of our revenues from hardware appliances, more and more into software solution and services. so, very decent growth. we believe we will continue to grow in coming years. obviously, the last quarter, as i've mentioned, we did 71%.
operating margin, this is the second quarter in a row where operating margin is well above the 20% level, which is kind of a mark for us. so, let's talk a bit first on the longer-term financial model.
we believe that as we will keep progressing with our enterprise business, growing above 16% a year, we believe that we will step up gradually in a matter of two to three years into annual revenue growth of about 13% to 15% overall for the company.
gross margin, we are at 68%. we believe that the range we define, 67% to 70%, we should be able to grow beyond that at the end of this period. we would obviously work out of a strategy; and actually, we are defining kind of a modified strategy for 2021.
we see much more value in keeping operating above 20%, but still allowing big portion of it to be applied to growth and investment. so, we will not try to achieve 24%, 25% operating margin and above. we will instead opt for 20% plus and then invest the remaining into developing new areas for us, such as conversational ai and likes.
so, let me go now into the specific business line or more interesting data points. first, let's talk obviously on the microsoft business. in the fourth quarter, overall revenues were close to $30 million. this represents a growth of 18% year-over-year and close to 15% sequentially. for the full year, we saw a nice increase of about 19% compared to 2019, combined.
however, as we all know, there was a big, big shift in mix in microsoft revenues between the two different collaboration solutions. entering into 2020, we entered with about $84 million of revenue, of which about $70 million came from skype for business, only about $13 million came from teams. that picture has substantially reversed in 2020.
we're coming out with teams substantially on top. teams has grown, just to give you an idea, as i have mentioned, 300% year-over-year, looking at $13 million in 2019, we should look now into -- we have done about $55 million in 2020. so, that's a big growth. also, i have mentioned that in the fourth quarter, we kept growing, sequentially grew more than 30%.
skype for business on the other hand declined; declined from a level of, give or take, an average of $17 million to $18 million in a quarter. we ended up the last quarter with less than $10 million. so, all in all, gradual decline. i would say that the decline, as i've mentioned in previous quarter, has kind of been mild. so, we do expect continued decline. but obviously, in terms of absolute millions of dollars, that will be less in 2021.
now, let's talk about new accounts. so, we definitely grew with large number of new microsoft teams accounts in 2020. on a overall annual level, i'll tell you that we have grown substantially. we've grown more than 200% from 2019 to 2020. we have seen the numbers. i mean, roughly, if you look on the fourth quarter, i'll give you a data point here that about one-third of the accounts were accounts migrating from skype for business and about two-thirds of the accounts were actually new accounts. so, all in all, a very nice growth on teams in new accounts.
as to the future, as we kept saying, we have a very long runway ahead of us. this microsoft 365 is now worth about $270 million. teams was announced to have $115 million last october. i'm confident we'll hear new numbers as microsoft releases their numbers today. so far, we believe it's only about 10% of the teams users have implemented voice.
very simply, we know for a fact, that as microsoft tries to become the dominant player in that market, the intention was put really more into collaboration, chats and meetings, and voice was not a requirement, so many organization could live up with their old pbx. it could be the company, pbx, one of the previous manufacturer's name avaya, name cisco, name mytel, any other. so, people could stay with their pbx, but still get on board with teams using the collaboration and meetings.
we believe that as time goes by, the benefit of using an integrated solution, all coming from microsoft, will basically drive the migration of those into microsoft telephony solution as well. so, definitely a lot of potential going forward.
we have heard that customers who have standardized on microsoft teams really not looking back. the product is working well and has become an important part of their daily work and we have seen in surveys that these days in the enterprise, service show that more than 50% already selected microsoft teams over other players, and actually that number is expected to grow in about two to three years from today to about 60%.
more on the microsoft business. so, we have launched sbc as a service on azure few months ago. it is available on microsoft marketplace in north america. will soon be available in other regions as well. basically, very, very easy for customers to get on board teams by clicking few times on the keyboard and getting connected.
also, we enjoy strong activity in the field. in several cases, we also meet with the field -- the sales field staff for microsoft, helping winning accounts. also, we had a rather big investment in 2020 into expanding our meeting room offering for teams. so, we are just getting to market with some of our newer products in that space. we are getting to market with our meeting insights shortly, two, three weeks from today. so, all in all, definitely an activity.
to name few new wins in the quarter; so, we won a leader -- a teams project, actually migration project from skype for business from one of the leaders in the financial services world. basically, we have provided there our session border control technology and our management technology; and all in all, some professional services, so a nice mix about $0.5 million project.
we won a large project with a very large world-leading asia-pacific service provider, where we have expanded into several of their subsidiaries. we have provided there sbc as a service. it's running on azure, and we plan to expand into few more subsidiaries.
we won a world leader in chemical products for the car industry. we're working through a very large service provider who provides a fully managed service as part of their teams rollout, a lot of success.
so, all in all, a lot of activity with microsoft. assuming that -- well, knowing that microsoft is now 45% of business, right about $100 million out of the $220 million in 2020, teams now becomes the most important business for us. traditionally, we've been selling to the enterprises, companies that have 5,000 to 10,000 and more employees. we are now starting to target the mid-market with our audiocodes live offering. as i've mentioned before, audiocodes live offering is a managed services offering, providing many solutions. we offer it in like three tier program and we enjoyed quite a success in second half of 2020.
how do we grow from here on microsoft teams? so, first is obviously we intend to grow in the number of audiocodes live users. that's one dimension. the second dimension is trying to scale up in revenue from the essential program to the pro and premium services, where we can charge for more on a per user, per month basis.
we do intend to introduce new business application services this year. we will shortly announce our recording services. we, several times have been selling contact center solution from partners we work with. we will be providing analytics, voice analytics and meeting analytics shortly, conversational ai services and more. so, all in all, this is the main focus of the company going forward.
now, to take you through the second priority in the company, which is the contact center market. this is a fast-growing market, no question that covid-19 pandemic further accelerated growth in this space.
right now, about 15% of our business, basically in the contact center market, grew 15% last year. all in all, this market is a great market for us. very simply, a lot of disruption, lot of room to apply technology and investment. i've mentioned transition to cloud, i've mentioned work-from-home and webrtc to maintain the quality of service, i've mentioned the trend to intelligent contact center that's emerging that's basically providing much greater role to conversational ai to deal with customer's inputs and requests.
so basically, we are expanding. while in the past our play was majority around genesys business, we now see more entry into other names in the industry and basically quite expand the reach of our solution to other contact center vendors.
also, we have changed a bit our strategy that instead of trying to focus on the vendor themselves, such as genesys, and we've mentioned throughout the u.s., names like, five9 and nice incontact, we now intend to go more toward end users. some of them prefer to stay on-prem and not transition to cloud, and then they found our solution fairly helpful in allowing them to maintain this on-prem operation. on top of that, conversational ai gets a big boost for automatic handling of self-service customer engagement.
so, we're providing in that market connectivity solution, voice quality monitoring solution, we're about to see virtual agent solution and agent assist solution. all in all, fairly active space.
in terms of revenues, we didn't grow much between '19 to '18. we said it's about $30 million level. in 2020, revenue grew to -- close to $35 million, that's 15%. throughout the year, we didn't broke down yet revenues from different quarters, but we can easily see that we have been stepping up in revenues throughout the year. so, ending the year on a strong note on the contact center.
obviously, conversational ai, that's built to improve customer experience and reduce cost, is growing in use. it is estimated that already 30% or 40% of customer prefer to use self-service speech interfaces, not involving a human agent. it is predicted that toward 2023, that that percentage will grow to 70%, so a lot of room to grow there.
let me touch on our sbc operation, because this is turning to be a stellar performance in our company with record revenue growing, as i've mentioned, above 40% in the quarter. all in all, as i've mentioned, we will grow to close to $100 million from just $60 million plus last year.
the share of sales of sbc into the microsoft space grew substantially in the fourth quarter, now it's more than 50%. we have a rather a nice geo split, about 38% of revenues in north america, about 34% in western europe and about 10% to 11% in asia-pacific and then cala.
we've seen strong booking growth going forward. so, we feel very confident in our ability to perform here.
on a -- if i'll do the breakdown between products and services, i'll tell you that product grew more than 50% this year and we also grew very nicely on the services. one very important note to make here is that with -- as i've told you in the beginning, we put a lot of emphasis on managed services. just to tell you that in the sbc business line, those services really jumped and almost tripled in the year. so, we started from a low number of millions in the sbc managed service, and now we have grown close to 3 times in that.
also, very important, and i'm being questioned many times about what's the portion of software versus hardware? i will tell you that while we saw huge increase in sbc in 2020, the hardware portion of it almost did not grow. it did grow, but a very mild between 5% to 10%. majority of the growth really came from the software; and now, virtual sbc, it's being used in data centers and in the cloud. basically, sbc software solution grew more than 150% as compared to 2019. so, give or take, all of the sbc use the same software load, the same technology. it's a great success and the gross margin is really high there.
i just mentioned also on the sbc side that we have seen nice growth on webrtc as a result of the move to work-from-home, and we've grown more than 50%; so, definitely interesting.
the last area i'll touch is conversational ai, which really seems to be our next-gen growth engine. it's a very fast-growing market, with covid-19 pandemic definitely driving that with the lockdown situation in many countries in this world.
booking in revenues grew more than 50%, still we are talking about small numbers, less than $4 million, but we do have a target of -- targeting above $10 million in two years by the end of 2022.
conversation ai business grew fast. it does include three different business line. one is recording services. it's the smarttap, which is a compliance recording, which just got certified about a month ago for teams. we are the second company certified with teams, so that started to sell nicely. we're also, as i've mentioned before, going to introduce meeting insight in a major way in teams shortly.
second line is the voice.ai connect. voice.ai connect basically allows chatbots and textbots to be serviced and approach enabled by voice. so, you have today hundreds and thousands of different chatbots used daily. some could be used as millions, take the service provider allowing customers to reach out through messaging and whatsapp and like messenger. so, if you want to allow all the public to access those same services by voice, that's definitely where voice.ai connect comes in and we enjoy quite a success. third is our voca operation, which was very successful this year, growing more than 150%.
all in all, the technology used in all those three-business line has been home-grown. it's a combination of some homegrown cognitive services technologies we used in conjunction with microsoft and google and aws cloud cognitive services. and above all, our huge experience in networking, telephony and sbc really gives us an advantage as compared to other players in the market.
so, all-in-all, very exciting business. i'll just say that we definitely intend to grow in 2021, substantially above 50% in this line. so, do expect to see it popping to the range of $5 million to $10 million at the end of this year.
one more very important note to make is that we are expanding our solution for voice.ai connect. while in the past, we just offer its connection to cognitive services mainly and to analyze solution, now we're talking about adding recording capabilities to adding speaker verification and authentication to it and few more technology.
so all-in-all, we believe that we will come with a very comprehensive voice subsystem for conversational ai, which will basically leave us fairly at the top of the competition.
finally, to complete my presentation, i'll just repeat what niran mentioned in terms of guidance. so, in terms of revenue, we now guide based on results in the fourth quarter and plans for the year, we're guiding for a range of between $240 million to $250 million.
as to the earnings, as niran guided, we have announced a range that's a bit wide than before. we're talking about $1.45 to $1.65. few reasons for it. the business outlook is good and tracking along the same lines of success in 2020. so, we see no difference in that. there are going to be two new changes in 2021. one, is a big change in the u.s. dollar and new israeli shekel conversion rate, which we assume that this will impact the bottom line of our earnings by about 10%. so, unfortunately with the u.s. dollar's weakening in israel, we're going to lose like 7% or 8% in terms of applying it to salaries, and that will result in about 10% in the profit.
second, is that we believe that as we enter 2021, our new effective tax rate is going to be raised and it's going to be raised to a level we predict of 10% to 10%. so that will basically lead to additional impact of about $0.10.
all in all, we still believe that we will keep growing but we therefore provide relatively larger band of $1.45 to $1.65.
and with that, i've ended my presentation. we'll move it now to the q&a session. operator?

operator
thank you. we will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [operator instructions] and our first question comes from the line of richard valera with needham & company. please proceed with your questions.
richard valera -- needham & company -- analyst
thank you. good morning. shabtai, first question around your long-term topline growth target of 13% to 15%. just wanted to clarify, are you thinking about that as kind of a 2023 target or just what timeframe that is? and then what specifically do you expect to drive the acceleration of the topline growth over that timeframe? thank you.
shabtai adlersberg -- president and chief executive officer
okay. yes, the answer to the first question, yes, we view that range as applying to 2023. where does the confidence comes from? so last year, we grew 10%. what drove it was 18% in enterprise and decline of about 10% in service provider. we believe that service provider decline will basically flatten out.
so, in our plans and assumptions, we do not see the service provider business declining substantially from where it is today. once we keep growing 17% on the enterprise, you will see gradually every year growth in the topline.
so, our guidance, if you take the mid-range of it $245 million, that represents roughly 11% growth and we believe as we will step up into any new single year, you'll see that growing at least to 13% if not more.
richard valera -- needham & company -- analyst
got it. and then maybe this one is for niran. your product gross margins were very strong in the fourth quarter and just wonder if you could talk about what drove them to be so much stronger? was there anything non-recurring in that? and how you're thinking about your gross margins in 2021?
niran baruch -- chief financial officer
yes. so, indeed gross margin of the product was very high relatively to previous quarter. what drove that is the product mix that shabtai mentioned, sbc grew very nicely and this is a very high gross margin and most of it is actually software and services. with regards to 2021, as shabtai mentioned on our longer three years model, we believe 67% to 70% gross margin is achievable.
richard valera -- needham & company -- analyst
okay. that's overall gross margin?
niran baruch -- chief financial officer
yes.
richard valera -- needham & company -- analyst
got it. and then just a final one from me. a clarification on the sbc business. you said, i think, it grew close to $100 million. if you could just say sort of what that was on a percentage basis for the entire year? and then could you clarify what percent of sbc was in fact software this year? it sounds like that percent must have gone up based on what you said, but just wondering if you could provide the actual percentage of sbc revenue that was software based in 2020?
niran baruch -- chief financial officer
right. so, yes, first -- yes, we have approached the $100 million level in sbc, ok. that's a number. i don't have here with me the right split between software and hardware. but again, i want to urge you to change a bit the way it's being perceived.
guys, listen, all of our hardware was developed seven, 10 years ago, ok? it's mediant 1000, mediant 800, long list of hardware products. but that is something that was developed and we do not engage in it.
just to give you an idea that out of 350 employees in r&d, there are about 15 guys in hardware all doing fixes and the flag issues, etc. so, no -- and the load, the load is one load. we do release a new workload every seven to nine months and that's basically a load that's going to be sitting on everything, both in the virtual machines that's running on public cloud, on data centers and then running on top of hardware. on hardware, the servers that were designed several years ago, but still the customer pays for the intellectual property, the sbc that's really for the hardware.
so, all-in-all, i think, as time goes by -- and one more, by the way, very important point to make. when you're talking about data centers at premises and/or in the cloud, you're talking about software and this is what we sell. we sell virtual software.
however, when you go to offices, when you go to branch offices, which every large company has, there is no way if you want to optimize cost and efficiency for those branch offices, you need to use a hardware device. that hardware device is going to include a firewall, a router, an sbc, switch and few more. so, calling this an sbc hardware, it really doesn't make sense. it's all about software. so, that's the way you should look upon it.
and i'm not mentioning the gross margin, but you can bet that the gross margin on the hardware and software combined is very, very high. north of -- just throw a number, north of 80% to85%.
richard valera -- needham & company -- analyst
right. okay. thanks for that clarification and i'll pass it along. thanks.
niran baruch -- chief financial officer
okay, thanks.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of raimo lenschow with barclays. please proceed with your questions.
raimo lenschow -- barclays -- analyst
thanks. congrats on a strong finish to the year. shabtai, can you go a little bit deeper, when you say you -- on the cc side, you want to go closer to the end user and talk more on a little bit with the on-premise-focused clients as well. it sounds to me more like avaya type customers. do i read that correctly, like how do i have to think about that strategy? and then i had one follow-up.
shabtai adlersberg -- president and chief executive officer
okay. so, yes, we have not mentioned names and this is not really limited to one player or more. i think when you're going to large end users, you find probably some resistance in moving the solution to cloud, simply because in terms of cost, it's going to be substantially more expensive for them.
so, large companies do not necessarily rush to move to cloud. still, the more advanced solution are going to be applied into the cloud, so some of these end-users find themselves with the need, let's say, for webrtc, just to provide high quality of service through their own based agents, and/or they need to use conversational ai just to be able to automation of customer calls and self-service.
so, we find a need in the markets and not only with the name you have mentioned to really be able to upgrade the capabilities of on-prem solutions. and we have seen a large number, i mean i think more than 10 just in the second half of 2020. so, we believe this could be a trend that we can work. and by the way, it happened also with genesys accounts or other accounts, that's the trend.
raimo lenschow -- barclays -- analyst
yes, ok. and then how do you -- on the teams side, how do you think this will play out, like, in terms of where are we in terms of your penetration on new teams deployments and where do you see that overall teams trend going? thank you.
shabtai adlersberg -- president and chief executive officer
so, all-in-all, as i've mentioned, we've been growing nicely in terms of our quarterly sequentially in new accounts on microsoft teams. and actually, looking into the chart i have in front of me, relatively the pace of skype for business customer moving into teams is kind of flat. so, we're talking about more than 100 -- to tell you more than 100 accounts a quarter moving. but, then on new accounts on teams, we see like about 20% growth in terms of number of new accounts.
so, it's going forward. and again, i want to stress the point i was making that, when microsoft was very explicit in convincing customers to use teams for collaboration and meetings, there was no much pressure on them to move to teams voice since the customer could have keep using his old pbx.
as conversational ai capabilities grow, meeting capabilities grow, there will be -- anybody that is stuck with an old pbx will just add few more dollars for his license and will move into a more comprehensive advanced voice evolution. so, we believe that we should see -- i don't think we'll have a problem keeping up with the 10%, 20% growth a year in microsoft teams.
raimo lenschow -- barclays -- analyst
yes. okay. perfect. thank you. congrats.
shabtai adlersberg -- president and chief executive officer
sure. thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question is coming from the line of ramsey el assal of jefferies. please proceed with your questions.
samad samana -- jefferies -- analyst
yes. sorry, this is samad samana. i'm not quite sure where ramsey's name came from, but thanks for taking my questions nonetheless, and congrats again on a strong finish to the year.
maybe just the first to shabtai. on the skype for business installed base, how much of that do you believe is left to convert over to teams for voice and what percentage do you think realistically you could convert over to teams for voice?
shabtai adlersberg -- president and chief executive officer
tough for me to answer that question simply because one needs to assume that will be certain portion of the end users. so, would rather stick to on-prem installation and not move to the cloud for many reasons, could be security and others.
and quite frankly, i don't have a very detailed analytic tools that would allow me to look into the specific accounts. it's a trend. i can tell you the only data points i can give you is that, as i've mentioned before, that it has been growing throughout the year. in the last two quarters, i see that number of all skype for business accounts flattening above 100 in some, but really have no idea on how it's going to keep -- we will keep reporting, that's the only thing i can do.
samad samana -- jefferies -- analyst
great. and just one maybe for niran or for you, whoever wants to take it. but we appreciate all the disclosures that you -- that you give around kind of full year numbers and growth rates, but is there any chance or is there any philosophical thought around giving -- reporting the dollars around how big your microsoft business is more precisely on a quarterly basis just given that that's -- as you noted that that's the most important part of the business on a go-forward basis. we're just seeing if we'll maybe get more color on that on a consistent basis in dollar terms going forward.
niran baruch -- chief financial officer
yes. so, samad, hi. we are not providing it on a quarterly basis. the numbers we provide are not audited by our auditors based on internal reports that we have, so we can't provide it historically on a quarterly basis.
samad samana -- jefferies -- analyst
got you. and then maybe just a last question. we saw the news around the buyback extension. just curious maybe more broadly speaking what the philosophical approach to that will be and how we should think about the execution of that or just maybe the logic behind asking for an increased buyback?
shabtai adlersberg -- president and chief executive officer
right. so, the idea is that sometimes the market gets irrational, right? i mean, we all know that, those times. and we have our view on the fair value of what we do compared to the value of other assets in the market. and when we will find it beneficial for us, we will engage on the buyback. it's not that we intend to go for the same strategy when we had. we're going to work on the multiples, etc.
but all in all, i will tell you that we are -- i'm glad to say that we are big producers of cash flow. before paying the $10 million or $11 million to the israel innovation authority, we have produced about $50 million -- $50 million, one of our board member told me it's a half of the year offering, right? so, we are producing a lot of cash.
in terms of cash allocation, we have answered that question a few times, priority goes into m&a, then to dividend payment and then to buyback. and again, we will weigh the situation over time and decide accordingly.
samad samana -- jefferies -- analyst
great. congrats again on the quarter and nice to see the stock having a strong move this morning. take care.
shabtai adlersberg -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, samad. thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of walter pritchard with citi. please proceed with your questions.
walter pritchard -- citi -- analyst
hi. thanks. i'm wondering if you could just talk to -- you mentioned some pull back from the selling into the ucaas providers and instead focused on the end users. if you could talk a little bit about that decision and how you're seeing -- as the teams adoption goes forward, how you're seeing customers choose connectivity options there and if there's been any change relative to what you've seen more recently?
shabtai adlersberg -- president and chief executive officer
yes, i think there is some confusion. i have not mentioned that in conjunction with ucaas. in ucaas, well -- in ucaas, we do it for a long time, right? i mean, we are selling sometimes indirect or direct to the end users, is certainty what i've mentioned on the call related more to the contact center market, where our go-to-market, up to last year was substantially on working with the vendors themselves to reach to the end users.
we found that with the more i would say -- the move to cloud, which really moves the world from being an on-prem market to be being a two-fold on-prem and in cloud market, we found that in order to service better the on-prem portion of it, we better develop a direct go-to market for those. and obviously, you can imagine that we will use the same sales force. at this stage, we have more than 200 people both in terms of salespeople and pre-sales and the sales manager getting into account would be able to sell not only the ucaas solution, but also a contact center solution.
so, that's -- it's not -- and one big, big, big clarification. we are not selling contact center, guys. i mean, that's the -- we are very clear about it. we do sell complementary technology and solution that help to improve, ok? so, we're selling webrtc, we're selling sbc for access, we're selling technology called click-to-call, it allows calling over the internet. we will be selling conversational ai. so those were -- those will be the type of solution that we will be selling.
walter pritchard -- citi -- analyst
got it. and then just i guess relative to microsoft and metaswitch in terms of their own offerings on that end, you talked about your sbc as a service that rolled out in the quarter. what are you seeing in terms of the market with customers looking at those different offering to understanding it's quite early?
shabtai adlersberg -- president and chief executive officer
we haven't seen any of that quite frankly, not seen. we may. but right now, we are developing our own offering. if you've heard, we developed sbc as a service approach. we're developing managed services approach. we believe this will be competitive even if ever that that happens.
walter pritchard -- citi -- analyst
great. thanks for taking the questions.
shabtai adlersberg -- president and chief executive officer
sure. thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of tal liani of bank of america. please proceed with your questions.
tal liani -- bank of america -- analyst
hi, guys, good morning, good afternoon. few questions. first, can you give us an update on zoom? you had an announcement before. i just want to know what's the experience so far.
second, can you -- i want to understand how it works with microsoft teams. and sorry for the very basic question, but how does the sale cycle happen? meaning, do you sell to them or do you sell to the enterprise, who is selecting the technology behind it? i just -- i'm trying to understand the drivers. maybe we'll do -- we'll take one by one, will do these two and then i'll ask my other questions.
shabtai adlersberg -- president and chief executive officer
okay. as related to zoom, we have thin level of zoom phone activity earlier in 2020; but toward the fourth quarter, we have seen some uptake. we are -- also been reported that we see more opportunities coming up in 2021. zoom announced about few weeks ago that they have reached a level of 1 million zoom phone users. so, we do expect that going to 2021, we will win more zoom phone accounts. i think the only thing that's left is really to wait for the next six to nine months and then provide more information, but we definitely see a change from 2020.
as to microsoft teams, always the discussion is at the end of the day with the cio and the it manager of the end-users; and basically, he is the one that's making the decision. how we fulfill that? usually, it is being fulfilled by partners. so, we have partners in the field, which based on the final solution proposed to the end users, that end-user is buying the equipment and our solution from the partner and the partner in return buys it from us.
tal liani -- bank of america -- analyst
and in your view, what's still -- what's the win rate or can you tell us about the competitive landscape in these kind of accounts?
shabtai adlersberg -- president and chief executive officer
we believe that due to the fact that we have captured throughout the years to develop a very comprehensive portfolio of not only product but really solutions, where we combine several products and add on top of them a management solution, a recording solution, analytic solution and few more; lately, also conversational ai, a voca type.
our offering is substantially more comprehensive than competition. the only competition we had in the past is now seems to be focusing much more on service provider business. so, quite frankly, i think we're doing fairly well in this teams environment, no tough competition -- always competition but not too strong.
tal liani -- bank of america -- analyst
great. shabtai, two more quick ones. one is, can you discuss the environment in 2020 and the sustainability? meaning, in 2020, employees started working from home. we had to invest in collaboration tools, teams one of them. do you have concerns that you have tougher comps for 2021 in that corporates bought what they needed and now they can slow down? any concern about sustainability of what we've seen in 2020?
shabtai adlersberg -- president and chief executive officer
i'm an optimistic guy, so tough for me to be pessimistic on this. i'll tell you the following, ok? in contact center, it's pretty obvious, we just saw a completely new cycle, right, work-from-home. we have webrtc growing substantially faster. conversational ai is growing fast, same for sbc solution that need to support cloud migration. so, in contact center, we really are in the first inning of the thing.
as we go for microsoft teams, again, i have no reasons to believe that we will ""see."" customer already got to their needs back in 2020 and there is no more accounts. quite frankly, as i've mentioned, only about 10% of microsoft teams users have applied teams voice; and we believe there is a huge, huge growth area for us.
so, i do not share. but again, we will go through the year. but in every single quarter since the beginning of the year, we've seen growth. i've mentioned we growing fourth quarter 30% over the third quarter. so right now, i have no evidence that it's slowing or changing.
tal liani -- bank of america -- analyst
got it. my last question is the stupid question, not that my other questions were very smart. but in your press release you mentioned that you went through, that's what happens when you get the covid vaccine. my last question is, you mentioned in the press release that you got court approval for buyback.
shabtai adlersberg -- president and chief executive officer
right.
tal liani -- bank of america -- analyst
stupid question, just to understand the kind of the procedure; why is there a court approval? why can't just the board decide? i don't know how it works with israeli companies.
niran baruch -- chief financial officer
hi, tal. this is niran. in israel, whenever you would like to distribute dividend or to do buyback, you need to file an application to get court permission for that unless you have sufficient retained earning over the past two years. if you will go to our gaap financials, you will see that we already bought back or distributed dividend more than that two years gaap profit. that's the reason.
tal liani -- bank of america -- analyst
got it. thank you. congrats on a great quarter.
shabtai adlersberg -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.

[operator instructions] your next question is coming from the line of robin guess of opus capital [phonetic]. please proceed with your questions.
robin guess -- opus capital -- analyst
thank you for taking my question. a follow-up question regarding the teams moving into pbx and voice and competition there. just, first, to verify that i understand correctly, your solution would be needed and you have opportunities there if this pbx to the cloud teams voice would be based on the microsoft teams solution? and my understanding is that there is competition there with the existing ucaas leading companies like 8x8 and ringcentral, also jumping on the teams voice opportunity offering their pbx in the cloud. so, this is my question, competitive dynamics there and is it correct that your solution would not be needed if they grow this list, ucaas alternative? thank you.
shabtai adlersberg -- president and chief executive officer
right. you're definitely right, ok. definitely, this competition arising from the middle of 2020 by ucaas -- other ucaas players such as ringcentral and 8x8, telling customers, ""okay, you have settled on microsoft teams; but for telephony, either you already using mine or you want to use mine instead of using microsoft telephony and i'll offer you a solution. i'll tell you that that is a fair competition. but i'll tell you that i believe that long-term the capabilities and the services that we are offering for microsoft teams voice and telephony will supersede those offered by other companies.
our business is voice. this is the only thing we do. and just -- just we're coming out with meeting insight, i don't think you'll see any comparable capability in other company. so, yes, it's a competition, we know how to fare.
robin guess -- opus capital -- analyst

i will now turn the call back over to shabtai.
shabtai adlersberg -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, niran. we're very pleased to report strong first quarter '21 financial results ahead of our internal budget and continued progress in our business. most important, we have been strong in the market. we have seen strong market for our three main growth engines namely, microsoft business, contact centers and conversational ai.
in the microsoft business, teams and skype for business, business grew above 20%. however, most notably, our us market showing increased activity in view of the decline in pandemic, we saw better environment for new credit accounts and businesses. very stronger book-to-bill trend, which portends strong growth ahead. contact center, we have seen strong pickup in activity. conversational ai growth of more than 100% year-over-year in total.
importantly, first quarter industry dynamics further underlines the notion. this collaboration work-from-home remains center stage in 2021 and beyond, even post-pandemic and presents long-term growth prospects for us. add to it, strong performance in our north america services operation and continued sbc business strength, the outlook for 2021 and onward is positive. talking about the growth in services, audiocodes live continues on track with the initial plan, and we'll talk more about it later on. also, with the return to office trend picking steam in several countries, our devices, ip phones, desktop phones, video conference devices showed meaningful improvement from 2020, though magnitude of recovery could be capped going forward by the well-known ongoing chip supply constraints and shortage.
so touching on the key highlights of the first quarter. total revenue grew 15.1% year-over-year, an improvement as compared to the 11.7% growth back in the first quarter 2020. growth driven mainly by a secular growth opportunity within the unified communication-as-a-service and contact center markets. service revenues grew 23.3% year-over-year. service revenues were driven by strength in professional managed services offering. most important, we made ongoing progress in pivoting to recurring revenues with strong traction experienced with our audiocodes live offering.
in terms of the first quarter 2021 revenue, let me go by segments. referring to the 13.1% overall company year-by-year revenue growth, it is important to note the growth in our key markets, ucaas and contact center were substantially higher. ucaas accounted for over 65% of revenue and grew above 15% year-over-year. contact center accounts for over 12% of revenue and grew above 20% year-over-year. so combined, and that is the enterprise operations we have, we now see more than 80% of our revenues growing at the rate of 15% year-over-year, which is substantial growth above the overall company growth.
two more segments. voice.ai, as i've mentioned, grew over 100%, still less than 2% of revenue at this stage. the decline was seen in the service provider and technology, which finally make up the balance of revenues down in the quarter.
now, to reiterate our three-year financial model targets growth, which was 15% in enterprise revenues in the first quarter provides strong support for our reiterated 2021 outlook as well with our long-term financial model. the model calls for 13% to 15% growth of revenues. we did 13.1%. non-gaap gross margin, we define in the range 67% to 70%. we ended up doing 68.7%. opex as a percentage of revenue, we said we would cap it at 47%. it came to 46.3%. and then when we're talking about the non-gaap operating margin, we said the range to be between 20% and 23%, we ended up at 22.4%.
now let's focus on two more key developments in the quarter. this is the focus on real-time cloud communication and on transition to recurring revenue. a recurring theme in our operation for the past several years has been increased focus and rapid transition for our solution and services to real-time cloud communications. we continue to invest in cloud services automation, and in software-as-a-service solution development, and we see further growth in this space. much was achieved in 2020. in the first quarter of '21, we have increased and accelerated investment in this area, driving the momentum in 2021 and beyond. on top of this, we have substantially moved our focus in sales toward recurring revenue model, and an increasing percentage of revenue now comes from recurring revenue sources versus the historical model of capex sales of our network in the year.
to further highlight this focus on transition to recurring revenues, in march 2020, we announced audiocodes' live initiative, which offers audiocodes' voice expertise product and solution to enterprises via very flexible subscription-based managed services model. we have made good progress through the second half of 2020, and into the first quarter of '21, and now see the momentum growing and expanding. by mid-2021, we expect this line to cross the $10 million arr mark and reach $15 million arr by the end of the year, more than doubling 2020 levels.
our booking or total contract value of this business on hand is already several tens of millions of dollars, and it is signed with large number of enterprises who have already started or about to start the ucaas deployments with us.
this fast-growing business is a tangible proof to our superior technology in the areas of connectivity, management, automation tools, services and adjacent applications to the user solutions. i am confident that this business will keep growing and represent a very significant portion of audiocodes' value in coming years as recurring revenue basis.
now to microsoft operations in the quarter. first quarter '21 business grew over 20% year-over-year. microsoft business is now 45% of overall business. we target $120 million by the end of the year, growing about [phonetic] 20% on top of 2020. we've seen accelerating opportunities in the market, some of which focus more in the mid-market. we have seen lot of activity around direct routing-as-a-service, and we have seen dozens of opportunities in booking and in pipeline. we also enjoy a lot of success in our business development efforts in the field. we have seen increased success in the field, identifying new large enterprise opportunities. by now, we are getting several qualified deals every week. the average size is few thousands. similar success now is picking up in certain countries of europe, where we see cooperation with the local teams of microsoft.
now to the mix of revenues in the microsoft space. in terms of mix revenue -- the mix of revenues, microsoft teams witnessed growth of 170% year-over-year, while skype for business declined moderately less than 10% sequentially, and about 50% year-over-year. all in all, we see much success in growth in the microsoft business.
we -- talking usually about revenues, but i think it's more important to talk about what's evolving, about what i would call a book-to-bill ratio. so we have seen an acceleration of overall teams business opportunities in the us in the first quarter having increased over 100% on a year-by-year basis and over 30% relative to the prior quarter. this metric is good leading indicator, pointing to ongoing momentum in our microsoft business. so, all in all, substantial new teams opportunity developing for us going forward.
as to the mix of accounts, where does they come from? so, we are around about 100 give or take opportunities per quarter coming from our old skype for business installed base, but growing number on teams. so all in all, comparing first quarter '21 to the first quarter 2020, we have seen an increase of more than 50% year-over-year in terms of number of accounts moving to teams.
to highlight some top wins in the first quarter in the microsoft space. talking about a large private company from food industry. this is a long-term audiocodes customer that started with us with skype for business. we have a gradual journey from skype for business to teams. we had a huge po for desk phones replacing competitor phones. also we are providing their direct route-as-a-service through the live essential service. another big account in the us, a company well-known in the financial space. they are basically on track with the teams migration project from skype for business. we have done large professional services project for augmenting in-house capabilities.
talking about a project in asia pacific, we are talking about a bank in apac. we have provided a mixture of products and services including gateways, session border controllers, management, central management, routing capability, management capability for subscribers and professional services. fairly competitive win against a competitor from this space, and we -- in that specific deal we have been partnering with a local large service provider.
so how do grow from here? we have a clear plan. we are going to grow the number of audiocodes live users. we are going to scale up in revenue to audiocodes live professional and premium services. we are going to introduce new business application services in upselling. so that would include recording services, contact center services, analytics, meeting space services, and conversational ai services.
now, going to the second large market, contact center, that is a very fast-growing market. revenue is now about 15% of our business. we target growth of above 15% year-over-year. this market is going through several disruptions. firstly, the transition to cloud, also work from home evolved as a main trend. so webrtc becomes the mainstream to maintain quality of service when communication goes over the internet lines. and then we are engaged in investing in the new emerging intelligent contact center, and there we have a greater role to our conversational ai.
all in all, this breadth of different technologies allows us to expand our business in the past. we have been much more focused on working very closely just with genesys. these days we are expanding our work to work with more contact center vendors and also working with end users. so, the focus on contact center end users, in contrast to the past contact center vendor focus help us a lot in expanding the business. all in all, conversational ai gets big boost for automated and doing self-service customer engagements.
so all in all, a very successful quarter for contact center. as i have mentioned before, we've grown in revenues of more than 20% over the year-ago quarter. as i have mentioned, we have expanded beyond the genesys environment. so we are now selling into some other large contact center vendors in a meaningful way. emea was very strong this quarter, and we do see the same developing in the second quarter, the current quarter. we also engage much in new voice.ai technology that we call, voiceai connect that helps to connect with voice to chatbots and that activity is becoming fairly successful.
let me touch, for a second, on our sbc operation, which is our most important product. last year, sales reached short of $100 million. we plan to grow this year another 20%. quarter was very successful. we grew 30% above the year ago quarter. we have seen a very strong booking growth, more than 40% year-over-year. we, all in all, see lot of activity in the space on various different projects, different technologies. for us, this space represents a lot of opportunity. microsoft revenues in this space continued to grow 70% year-over-year. in terms of geo split, the majority of revenues came from europe about 40%, about 25% and above from north america, 13% from apac and the rest from cala and israel.
now let me get to the smallest growth engine, but still very important and very exciting, i am talking about conversational ai, our next-gen growth engine. our conversational ai business includes the following lines. it includes recording services, [indecipherable] for teams and meeting insights. it includes also the voiceai connect to connect, voice to chatbots and then we have the voca for conversational ivr.
we've seen strong business. as i've mentioned, revenue grew more than 100% year-over-year. our rise in this area stems from the fact that technology relies a combination of ungrown cognitive services technologies such as speech-to-text, text-to-speech, machine learning, nlu, nlp, and then cloud cognitive services and sbc networking telephony expertise, which sell for competition just in the cognitive service area lack some of these components. long-term growth potential. that business fund ended up in 2020 at about $3.6 million. we now target to grow more than 50% this year and we target to reach $10 million by the end of 2022. growth is driven by trends in the ucaas and contact center, and meeting industry and the trend for self-service and customer call automation in the contact center markets.
smarttap, which is our solution for complex recording, enjoyed a lot of success. we just got certification for teams about three months ago. we are one of the few got that certification. we have seen pipeline growing significantly, driven by the increased compliance recording needs from using number of teams users in the enterprise space. so very successful operation there. i've mentioned also voiceai connect, our industry-leading voice-enabling chatbot technology plays a vital role in enabling contact centers to support the increasing call volume arising from the ongoing secular shift to digital engagements. we are preparing for production with several customers and are on track to achieve $1 million arr by the end of 2021. we will continue to provide update on this exciting emerging business going forward. so all in all, a very successful operation.
with that, i have concluded my presentation, and like to move the call to the q&a session. operator, please go ahead.

operator
thank you. [operator instructions] our first question today is coming from samad samana from jefferies. your line is now live.
samad samana -- jefferies -- analyst
hi. good morning and congrats on the strong results. it's good to see you could figure off with strong numbers. so, shabtai, maybe first, team's growth continues to be very exciting. and i know you dug into it -- about the quarter somewhat in your prepared remarks. but when you think about the go-to-market motion, are you guys hiring more sales reps to sell into that microsoft installed base to drive voice into team's or maybe what's audiocodes is doing as an organization to address that opportunity from a go-to-market perspective?
shabtai adlersberg -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, samad. i'm really glad you brought that up. i didn't mention headcount. and headcounts really changed dramatically. we grew 6% over the last year. so we added another 45 employees to the 745 employees we had then. a majority of these positions are with our sales and services organization. and as you can expect, because we see a lot of growth in the u.s., most of it is really occurring in the u.s. so, yes, and i can tell you just in the past two weeks, we have approved between 10 and 15 new positions for the sales and services organization. there's a lot of activity and we're going to support that.
samad samana -- jefferies -- analyst
great. and then, maybe on the pipeline again, your confidence in the environment definitely ran through on the prepared remarks. but when you think about how you measure it in terms of either a client inbound request or sign-ups for demos, anything that maybe kind of tangibly that audiocodes measures that points to what the pipeline looks like or how healthy the pipeline for team's related deals is?
shabtai adlersberg -- president and chief executive officer
yes, we are. we definitely track that internally. we have analytics. each of these deals -- as we're moving more and more into recurring revenues, we're measuring the pipeline. we're measuring the contract value that is accumulated and we measure obviously the execution of how much was deployed, how much -- you need also to -- by the way to simulate that. in every organization, it's tough to move into audiocodes live and our managed services is really deploying only a very small portion of its operation initially. so, it will be very natural for an organization to start with just few hundreds, right. the proof-of-concept may start with 100 or 200. but at the end of the day, this organization is about 3,000 or above.
so, what we basically tell you is that, and i have driven in terms of total contract value. we have not counted the thousands, we have counted only the hundreds. so there's a lot of accumulated potential there. and as we continue to deliver well on our promises, we basically see growth, i've mentioned tens of millions of contract value that is what's developing within the scope of the year now. so, a lot of activity.
samad samana -- jefferies -- analyst
great. maybe just one last one for me, for either of you, but the profitability continue to be nicely above our expectations. and so, i saw that audiocodes repurchased $10 million worth of shares in the quarter. maybe how should we think about the rest of what's left in terms of that $30 million buyback? and if there is any appetite to maybe expand the buyback level given the current valuation?
shabtai adlersberg -- president and chief executive officer
right. so, right now, i mean, by -- we are taking a position where we need to relaunch a new purchasing effort every six months. so, the current one basically adds like $25 million in total, out of which we already executed some $10 million. so we are left with about $14 million for the rest of the six months that will end somewhere in july. again, based on the situation there, based on what makes sense for us, i think that we see lot of value in this buyback, because we definitely want to invest where we believe the investment makes sense. and right now, that is what's happening.
samad samana -- jefferies -- analyst
great. i'll turn it over. but congrats again on the quarter and thanks for taking my questions.
shabtai adlersberg -- president and chief executive officer
sure. thank you, samad.
operator
thank you. our next question today is coming from raimo lenschow from barclays. your line is now live.
raimo lenschow -- barclays -- analyst
hey. thanks for taking the question and congrats from me as well. can you talk a little bit about the strength in the call center market, like how much of that do you think is that you see there kind of more like pandemic, kind of one-off emergency versus really strategic changes to what's going on in the industry?
shabtai adlersberg -- president and chief executive officer
i think pandemic really puts a lot of weight on the issue of moving the agents from the facilities into working from home, right? there was no other choice. so -- but during that process, i think many of the vendor -- the end-users actually found out that the cost of using agents at home is substantially lower than the cost of maintaining data protection on-prem, on facilities. so, there is a natural saving when that force is sitting at home. so, obviously that is a driver that's going to stay.
beyond that, the production of the cognitive services technology and industry, i think, help moving from human agents operations. this was 100% two years ago, 80% now and according to research, people believe that in three years from today, only about 30% of the agents will remain human. so it's really the evolution of the technology, completely [indecipherable] to the pandemic that is driving that shift. beyond that, there is the shift from the premises to cloud, which makes sense usually for a smaller company, but then provides a lot of efficiency for the vendor.
so, not all of it. i think it's mainly the work-from-home. it's the webrtc, quality monitoring end-to-end over the internet, those are technologies that evolved due to the pandemic, but they are going to stay with us.
raimo lenschow -- barclays -- analyst
okay. okay, perfect. and then, if you think about your ongoing migration like toward more software away from hardware, can you talk a little bit about, like are there any more active steps you need to do as an organization to kind of achieve that or do you think it's just a natural evolution?
shabtai adlersberg -- president and chief executive officer
it's an evolution. i mean, we have started that journey like three years ago. we've done great steps. we are improving quarter-to-quarter. and i believe that today, there's no single application that's developed internally that does not rely on cloud communications -- built in cloud communication. so, everything that needs to take into account, devops, software-as-a-service, automation tools, etc, analytics, all of that is being developed as we go into 2021. so, i assume that in less than two years, we will be fully cloud-based.
raimo lenschow -- barclays -- analyst
okay, perfect. thank you.
shabtai adlersberg -- president and chief executive officer
sure.
operator
thank you. [operator instructions] our next question is coming from greg burns with sidoti & company. your line is now live.
greg burns -- sidoti & company -- analyst
good morning. you gave the relative growth rates between team's and skype for business. but can you just give us the mix of revenue like, how much revenue from microsoft is still for skype for business?
shabtai adlersberg -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. i can tell you from the pro forma, so all in all, i think revenues topped $25 million or above. out of that, skype for business accounted for give-or-take about $8 million and the rest of it came from team's.
greg burns -- sidoti & company -- analyst
okay, great. thanks. and then, when you look at the team's market in terms of voice penetration within the user base, can you just give us an update on where that stands? and have you seen any change in the trajectory or the pace of voice adoption within the team's user base?
shabtai adlersberg -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. i think we're seeing in 2021 greater emphasis on voice. it may relate to competition coming from other companies making voice more important this year. also, if you want to play on the top-line of the vendors of ucaas, you really need to have all of the different components. and this drives some other companies to invest a lot in voice. i would mention also by the way, this did not came up during the discussion that we have made some very nice steps in selling also into the zoom environment. zoom phone, which was less visible in our operation last year, started to pick up end of last year. first quarter was really strong, above more than double the business we had in the fourth quarter.
so, i guess, that greater emphasis by all of the other players, i think, 8x8 and ringcentral announcing services that combine their offering with team's. i think, all in all, the voice space is getting more importance these days.
greg burns -- sidoti & company -- analyst
okay, great. and then, in terms of live, can you maybe -- what is embedded in those arr targets, the $10 million by mid-year, $20 million [technical issues] by the end of the year and also maybe the number of seats, the relative seismic counts and arpus?
shabtai adlersberg -- president and chief executive officer
right. so, basically we're talking about companies -- our target is mainly thousands of fits, but the projects do start with type of a hundreds. in terms of services, we do provide the first -- most basic services direct route sbc. on top of that, we provide management. on top of that, we provide other routing services, call recording services in the future also some cognitive services. so, it's a stack of technology. actually we start to push it as team's voice-as-a-service. and when you're deploying voice like team's voice, you really need a stack of technologies to provide overall processing. so, it's sbc, it's routing, it's management, it's devices, it's meetings, etc. and then, that's what's consist the team's voice-as-a-service, as we will discuss, call it before audiocodes live.
greg burns -- sidoti & company -- analyst
okay. when you look at that stack of the [technical issues] technology stack required to stand up like a seat and then also these -- some of these incremental applications you're talking about cross-selling or selling into that universe, where you think -- where do you think arpu will get to or where do you see it may be starting?
shabtai adlersberg -- president and chief executive officer
okay. it's a great question. we can start as low as $1 when the service is the most basic one. but when you stack up all of the different capabilities, or when you need to connect to the local pbx or to provide more advanced services, the arpu can go up to $4, $6, $7, etc. so, you can make the average yourself, but this is the range where, i would say, $1 to $7 is the range where we should on off [phonetic].
greg burns -- sidoti & company -- analyst
okay. great. and then, just lastly, how are you going to market with live? do you have any like direct or internal sales force selling that or are you just going all through the channel?
shabtai adlersberg -- president and chief executive officer
so, we are working with the channels. i mean, we have not changed anything in our go-to-market. we actually include our partners in the game. obviously we help them where the -- like the knowledge and/or the expertise, but the go-to-market is indirect still for some very large customers who have hundreds of thousands of employees, in some cases, we do have some direct touch. but the majority of the service is indirect.
greg burns -- sidoti & company -- analyst
okay. thank you.
shabtai adlersberg -- president and chief executive officer
sure.
operator
thank you. the next question today is coming from ryan koontz [phonetic] from needham & company. your line is now live.
ryan koontz -- needham & company -- analyst
thanks for the question and thanks for all the color on the microsoft ecosystem. are you seeing any -- within that area, are you seeing any shifts in the competitive landscape? are you seeing new vendors get approved? and then, second question on the product side, are you seeing any shifts toward more of a saas model there or is it still more kind of a license approach? thank you.
shabtai adlersberg -- president and chief executive officer
sure. so, generally there are not too many newcomers, right? we have seen announcements from companies like 8x8, ringcentral and vonage offering services like that throughout. nothing more than that. so, all in all, in terms of providing a full technology stack for team's, i think we do not see much competition at this stage.
i'm sorry, the second question related to, growing the saas?
ryan koontz -- needham & company -- analyst
yes, changes in the product model. are you seeing just more of a license model?
shabtai adlersberg -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. obviously, yeah, it was that. right, actually we did deploy -- actually i'm happy that [phonetic] you mentioned it because in the first quarter, we have deployed a new service that we call live essentials or azure. this is a completely saas solution that we're going to offer management solution-as-a-service, etc. the trend again is indeed to move substantially more from services and managed services into saas solutions, yes.
ryan koontz -- needham & company -- analyst
thanks so much.
shabtai adlersberg -- president and chief executive officer
sure.
operator

shabtai adlersberg -- president & chief executive officer
thank you niran, we are very pleased to report strong financial results and continued progress in our business in the second quarter of 2021. this is the second quarter in a row where our revenue grew 13% plus, year-over-year. as a comparison, growth in the second quarter of 2020 last year, was about 8.2%, so quite a leap in terms of revenue growth rate. now the majority of the growth came from the enterprise business, which has provided close to 85% of the company revenue in the second quarter. to remind us all enterprise business consists of our ucaas and contact center market operations. bottom line of this, is that while the company revenue grew 13.2%, enterprise-related revenue grew above 20% year-over-year, which clearly points to the potential of increasing our company annual revenue growth rate in coming years well beyond 13% a year.
during the quarter we continue to execute in all of our three strategic business areas in the enterprise space. first, microsoft teams, business grew well above 20%, year-over-year. i should add that in general, we saw robust demand in the us enterprise market much along the same trend we saw in the first quarter of 2021. this is a direct result of the decline in the pandemic in the us and in other markets. contact center operations grew nicely year-over-year. we'll touch that later on and we will talk about developments, new development that we've seen in certain areas, and in conversational ai we saw nice progress in several business line most important booking and revenue growth of more than 100% year-over-year.
in summary of the progress made in the ucaas and contact center and in view of similar such trends in several past quarters, second quarter industry dynamics further underscores the fact that collaboration hybrid work and work from home remain key industry trends, not only in 2021 but well beyond and thus they do present for us, long-term growth potential. also it's important to say that our decision made at the end of last year to increase our investment in r&d, sales and marketing and services on account of trading up for lower operational margin and profitability, proves to be working well and should fuel our success in the market in coming years. and much along the same line reported in the previous quarter, we experienced strong demand and performance in north america services operation and continued as we see business strength. and so, the outlook for 2021 in the second half of the year looks positive and promising.
going back to the various business line performance during the second quarter, here is a breakdown, ucaas and uc, which contribute about or above 70% of revenue, grew above 20% year-over-year. contact center, which provides for between 10% and 15% of revenue, grew above 25% year-over-year. so all in all, if we take enterprises as a whole, which provide close to 85% of revenue, we grew above 20% year-over-year. in view of that, we should have been growing faster, however, there's one business area, the service provider cpe business, which really suffered substantially from the pandemic, much along the same lines, that we've seen in previous quarters. so service provider cpe, which was top of 10 million in the quarter last year, was substantially below that in the second quarter and we have experienced decline. if you take service provider cpe, that's about between 10% and 15% of revenues. so basically the difference between the growth of 20% plus in the enterprise and the overall company growing only about 13%.
last i'll mention two other business plan, which are really minor at this stage, first is the voice ai business, which is just about 1.5% of business that grew year-over-year 100%. technology business continue to decline, it is now about 2% to 2.5% of overall revenues and has declined about 15%, but all in all, a very strong core in terms of our enterprise performance.
now getting to our long-term financial model that we presented in the last 2 quarters, generally, we are looking for the current three years, 21 to 23, to provide for revenue growth of 13% to 15% non-gaap gross margin, 67% to 70% opex, a percentage of revenues. we said it would be capped at 47% and then non-gaap operating margin to be in the range of 20% to 23%. if we look at second quarter performance, we seem to be well within those ranges except for opex. opex came at 47.3% and we believe that indeed going forward we will fix that range and i think we will probably target 47% to 49% or even 50%. it's all comes to investing more in areas where we feel that there is a lot of potential and we should increase our investment in this area.
now touching on several more important financial data points for the quarter, opex increased substantially more than 5% sequentially, mainly due to two key factors, one is, increase in headcount, has dodged debt immediately and then the impact of much lower new israeli shekel versus the us dollar's exchange rate. basically, i should say that we basically were edging that conversion rate up to the end of the first quarter of 2021 and we enjoyed a very good rate of 3.7 new israeli shekels per dollar. however, in the second quarter, we know which was available and therefore we were at 3.3%. so there is a big gap of about 11% between the exchange rate used up to the second quarter and in the second quarter that explains a surge of more than a $1 million in our opex expenses.
headcount increased 31%, i'm sorry, 31 positions to 821 full-time employees in the second quarter, 21, growing 9% year-over-year and triple 9% sequentially. obviously, adding more than 70 positions over the year-ago quarter, clearly demonstrate our confidence in our continued expansion of our business. cash flow from operating activities, we generated 17.1 million in the second quarter and more than 30 million in the first half of 2021. net comparison was just 17.5 million in first half of 2020. on an annual level, we can now plan on annual cash flow from any activity of 55 to 60 million in 2021, generating a lot of cash and allowing us to allocate capital for various targets that we see. deferred revenues continue to grow and mounted to 73.3 million versus 65.1 million a year ago, an increase of 12.6% over the second quarter last year.
now let's go to the key business area that present the most potential for us. let's talk first about microsoft, so microsoft business grew above 20% in the second quarter, we have seen accelerating mid-market opportunity, that we had access to. we have been leveraging audiocodes live services. i'll talk more of that later on, for microsoft teams. mostly around that [indecipherable] as a service, and at this stage live contracts, total contract value pipeline equal, several 10s of millions going forward. so, we have generated for us quite a potential going forward, within the microsoft team space ip phone business came back from 2020 and was stable in showing plenty of room for growth. that was a very nice comeback as compared to 2020 where you know we all suffered from the pandemic. and the fact that there were no purchases of devices for premises, though the magnitude of recovery is somewhat encouraging.
we all know about the ongoing supply constraints and therefore, we believe that we could be hurt in the 3rd quarter from a shortage of chips. we continue to certify our devices for video conferencing in the team's environment. i also invested quite a lot in the microsoft's teams environment. we have been investing in a new proprietary development for that ecosystem, invested substantial r&d to come up with an offering that's new to the market. we assume that we will talk more about it as we launch it, early 2022. about our live cloud operation, where we try to provision and help our service provider, provide a live service themselves, we saw some progress in that space. we are releasing a major release in the september timeframe and that will allow us to add multi-tier and reporting, make it more powerful for the go-to-market. we have one big oem at the sign up to live cloud and is now introducing it in their channels. another program that is very important to us is microsoft operator connect, microsoft introduced api for teams allowing operators to integrate to the teams marketplace and offers their plans and vads, that's cloud testing with operator connect api started already and we expect an introduction to the market in the first half of 2022.
in terms of growth we've seen definitely growth in the team space, since it's grown 90% year-over-year, compared to the second quarter in 2020. skype for business continues to decline. all in all, if you compare it to the second quarter of 2020, the decline was about 45% year-over-year. all in all, we continue just as mentioned before, to grow an overall microsoft business 20% year-over-year. at this stage skype for business really is down to a level where further decline will not contribute much to decline of skype for business. i'm sorry, microsoft. it was also a very successful quarter in terms of new business created. we have seen a lot of business created mainly in the teams' space. we have seen an increase of more than 100% year-over-year and more than 20% sequentially. so definitely quite active area for us.
in terms of some of the wins we enjoyed, i can talk about one big win in western europe, where we provided a managed services solution to administer minutes of the solution in that space. the significance is that managed services providers finding audiocodes live, is an easy way for them to accelerate time to service. we also enjoyed a large contract with a leading tier 1 operator in asia pacific, basically it's a large, we believe the cloud service providers continue to rollout teams to the smb and mid-market accounts, through those type of services. also we have seen large enterprises, which we acquired discussion in skype for business many years ago, they keep placing purchases and expansion as they migrate to teams and we've got such examples, both in japan and the us.
now to our live offering, which is really the key to our success, going forward. so let's talk about teams' voice as a service, this is where we focus teams' voice as a service, our best offering today in the market. in 2021 we have significantly stepped up our efforts and the accelerated the introduction of audiocodes live teams, voice-as-a-service, addressing critical challenges faced by mid-and large-sized businesses, as they adopt microsoft teams phone system. teams versus a service removes complexity from the integration of teams collaboration, unified communication, and enterprise telephony and provide a seamless, rapid and cost-effective migration to teams. in building this service, we have brought together our sbc network and user management products and complete set of automation and are delivering them on a, per user, per month, software as a service model. this allows our customers to quickly integrate sip trunk contracts, integrate with legacy solutions, and rollout globally, including on-premises devices such as phone video rooms in analog adapters.
our consulting services team can help address planning, design, and discovery, together with the partners or to complement the capability for some office through 65 fares[phonetic] who have expertise in the microsoft solution but lack telephony knowledge. since introducing the concept, this live mid last year we experienced good reception to the offering. we talk about this in the following and growth in our annual recurring revenues from this activity. it is important to know that using this software as a service offer, we are able to extend this offer to other markets. we have already won first accounts for siemens, such service with zoom phone customers, i'll talk about zoom in a minute. we are successful also in winning such offering in the context of the market. so audiocodes live is the key to our success going forward.
as we continue to grow very fast, our recurring revenues and made good progress in the second quarter, 21, we have exceeded by more than 10% or stated 10 million aor target for june 2021. as we now expect this type of business to go above the target to 15 million aor, by the end of the year growing 2.5 times above 2020 levels. our booking or total contract value of this business on end is already several 10s of millions dollars, by a large number of enterprises that have already started or about to start their ucaas deployments with us. also there is a nice pipeline that's growing steadily and building up. this fast-growing business is the tangible proof through our superior technology in the year as of connectivity, management, automation tools, services in adjacent application to the uc solution majority of it, for teams' voice as a service. i'm confident that this business will keep growing and represent a significant portion of audiocodes value in coming years.
now let's talk a bit about zoom, zoom starting to show up in our activities in 2021, we already reported in the first quarter of 2021 about the growth in the zoom phone area. second quarter was also a good one. we all know that zoom reported about two months ago that they've grown from one million zoom phone users to 1.5 million zoom phone, [indecipherable] and announce it. we had one, although we made quite a big leap over 2020, the quart would have been substantially higher except for one big deal that had slipped in the 3rd quarter. so all in all, we are building our presence in the zoom phone area, the amount of new opportunities developed in the second quarter, was substantially above anything we saw ever, in the zone phone area amounting to several millions just in the second quarter. just to remind you that also in the first quarter we had above one million of business created. so all in all, we start to see some enterprise zoom phone deals that are rolling out over a prolonged period. we also talking about introducing more of what we do in the microsoft voice space to be applicable to the zoom phone area. basically, we try to position our surface the best voice goes to partner for successful collaboration players, such as microsoft and now we start to see that with zoom too.
talking a bit about sbc business which was great in second quarter, we grew above 20%. actually, we at this stage, are well into our plan to reach 120 million of sbc revenues in 2021. side by side with our ability to deliver a good quarter, we've seen nice growth in booking going forward. both in life and non-life environment and also we have seen similar such phenomenon in the contact center and in the microsoft business. so all in all a very good quarter again from a geo split, i'll mention that, it's split almost 1/3 in north america and 1/3 in west europe, about 17% in apac and the rest in the carlisle in eastern europe. so all in all, we are well on plan to execute on our plan to grow this year by more than 20%. most important, our services business as we have mentioned before, we grew above 32% year-over-year, majority of the growth really comes from the professional services area and mostly from managed services. very strong, i would say that the complexity of launching a new voice service within an enterprise, usually our ability to provide those services, provide both the products and the accompanying services so that we can basically provide the enterprise with quick turn to deployments in operation, is much appreciated by our customers, already have a very nice pipeline of opportunities in this area. so professional services and managed services is becoming key all in all, it represents about 38% of our revenues in the second quarter.
just to touch on some of the developments in the contact center market, so we're starting to see webrtc as a key successful technology as we have mentioned before, when you start to place agents at arm or a lot of the communication goes from home, there is a need for good i-quality voice solution to be transported over internet clients, webrtc provides that. it's being used mostly in the contact center area and we have seen a record quarter in terms of our webrtc operations. also we focus in the contact center market mainly on collaborating with genesis, so we have invested quite heavily in transitioning some of our solution into the cloud environment. we have already registered for leading application in genesis up foundry solution in the cloud, namely voice, both connectivity, webrtc, teams integration, and advanced [indecipherable]. so all in all we starting to see some developments here already, so some first few projects with our webrtc and live operation in contact center.
last i'll touch on the development in the voice ai area or conversational ai. we have been able to grow revenues and booking by more than 100%, i would talk mainly about our voice.ai connect activities, which have shown great growth, that's debt [phonetic] immediately and also a lot of success for smarttap or compliance recording solution. the transition of communication and collaboration platforms into teams' really make it necessary to move all of the old compliance recording solution to teams' too. so we enjoyed a lot of business in that area. so smarttap has been growing fairly fast and basically, it is shown almost 100% year-over-year growth. touching on voiceai connect, this i've mentioned in the past, this is a solution that allows to connect the voice world, telephony, contact centers, sip trunks, pbxs to cognitive services, such as speech with text, text with speech and more. we made quite a progress in the second quarter, in terms of revenue we have more than doubled first quarter revenue, booking grew 10 times more than the first, i'm sorry, the same quarter in 2020.
we have created a lot of opportunities and roughly, we are above and beyond the plan we had at the beginning of the year. so at this stage, we are in a fairly accelerated more than that. out of all the different projects we have in that space, i'd like to touch on one very specific, which is key to our success going forward, i'll talk about vodafone. vodafone has a bot called tobi, is vodafone at the channel digital system, that is in use in multiple vodafone countries, many markets. it is used by vodafone to be constantly engaged with its customers, offering persistent assistance and customer experience. now vodafone has selected audiocodes voiceai connect to enable its customer to talk to tobi, their chatbot. voiceai connect not only facilitates of voice interaction with tobi, but also integrates with vodafone multi-vendor customer support system, including genesis, [indecipherable] and cisco. initial rollout started earlier this year in south africa, with positive feedback and plans for rapid expansion to additional countries and later also other use cases, including agent assist, speaker verification in outbound calls. the solution is provided estimated service vodafone datacenters in subscription-based model and it should be used all over the world.
with that, i have completed my introduction to this call and we would like to take the call into the q&a session, operator.
",":
operator
thank you. at this time, we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session. [operator instructions]
our first question comes from the line of samad samana with jefferies, please proceed with your question.
samad samana -- jefferies -- analyst
hi, good morning and thank you for taking my questions. maybe first shabtai, i appreciate all the detail that you gave in your prepared remarks, but just, it's added notable to me that you're seeing zoom phone more often, that felt like something incremental or new. can you maybe just help us understand how you get that partnership to work and are you seeing zoom customers decide between zoom phone and microsoft teams for telephony or just maybe, what are you seeing from those two, head to head?
shabtai adlersberg -- president & chief executive officer
so zoom as far as we know, right, much of what i'll tell you really comes from the market, zoom was very and will be successful, mostly in the lower end of the market. they're working their way up to the mid-market and the large enterprise. obviously, we have more value to offer when you come to enterprise. so if zoom steps into more and more deals with large enterprise and mid-market company's, collaboration with zoom will pick up, and that's really the so far, better performance in the first half of 2021.
samad samana -- jefferies -- analyst
great and then maybe just a follow-up question on the guidance, we saw the bump up in the revenue outlook but eps was held in the same range. i'm curious, how much of that is due to the fx weakness versus the ramping of actual growth investments? just can you help us bifurcate that end and if it hadn't been for fx, would you have raised that eps guidance?
shabtai adlersberg -- president & chief executive officer
yeah. so we had a step function in terms of the fxo all the impact of the us dollar exchange rate are going down from 0.7 to is now fully embedded. and therefore, we do not expect any further change in coming quarters. on the other end. i can tell you that we have pressure from both partners and some big customers to perform certain developments, some of our partners come to us with request to invest and develop new capabilities and are serving them says, yes, we will be evaluated and we will invest in it. so basically this is really what drives our investments that considered in most of the investment really well made in 3 different areas. its r&d developing those solutions it sales and marketing to attract and achieve more sales in the market and then service because once we focus more on in services, we need to increase personnel that helps customers deploy those managed services. beyond that, i think that we need to take again into consideration two phenomena, one is the shortage in components, which may hurt sales going forward 3rd quarter. we already know that some deals were pushed from the 3rd quarter because of shortage of components. and then there's also the pandemic, which you know, we all thought we were out of it and now we have the 4th wave. so trying to be a bit more conservative, i can tell you that we will keep pushing on all cylinders and growing revenues, but as far as, on our profitability, we need to be more conservative. that's where it is.
samad samana -- jefferies -- analyst
okay, great and then just one housekeeping question, i didn't hear if you said teams growth specifically for the quarter, can you just tell us what teams related growth, was please?
shabtai adlersberg -- president & chief executive officer
i'm sorry can you repeat the question please?
samad samana -- jefferies -- analyst
yeah. microsoft teams-related growth, i think you said overall, microsoft. [speech overlap]
shabtai adlersberg -- president & chief executive officer
yeah, yeah. we've. yes. yeah. i've mentioned the teams revenue grew 90% year-over-year. 9 zero.
samad samana -- jefferies -- analyst
okay, great. great, thank you. i'll turn it over to the next analyst, appreciate the questions this morning and congrats on the quarter.
shabtai adlersberg -- president & chief executive officer
thank you so much. thank you.
operator
thank you. [operator instructions] our next question comes from the line of greg burns with sidoti and company, please proceed with your question.
gregory burns -- sidoti & company -- analyst
good morning. is there any potential benefit for you from zoom's act pushing of five9?
shabtai adlersberg -- president & chief executive officer
good question, greg. so on the first glance, not sure. however, should zoom be successful in integrating with five9, in terms of their customer base with five9, zoom is the strong mid-market player. that may help may help zoom to win those mid-market players. now if that happens, the answer is yes. meaning that, if zoom is successful in acquiring more mid-market customers of five9, that would be good for us.
gregory burns -- sidoti & company -- analyst
okay and then just getting back to the opex and the increased investments you're making, i didn't quite catch it, did you raise your target for opex that cap from 47, above 47, how should we think about that going forward?
shabtai adlersberg -- president & chief executive officer
yeah, good question. okay. good question. originally when we have established a range for opex to be capped at 47% that was made end of the last year. we have not anticipated that us dollars will depreciate against the new israeli shekel that much. i'll tell you that the guiding line for us is really increasing investments where it needed, be it in services, be it in r&d, in other areas or adding sales positions. so in view of that we'd rather change what we have said that opex will be kept by 47% and basically we want to extend it to be kept by 50%, ok, and increase of 3%. that would mean that, if that happens, then operating margin will go down toward the 20%, rather than stay as they are today, above 22%. so that's the [indecipherable] we give priority to increasing investments over profitability.
gregory burns -- sidoti & company -- analyst
okay and then in terms of the decline you are seeing in the service provider, the cp area, it's pretty, i guess significant decline this quarter. what's the outlook for that, the term of the year. and do you expect to stabilize or to continue on the same downward trajectory?
shabtai adlersberg -- president & chief executive officer
second quarter, represented bottom[phonetic] into the stats, we have received some signs of a better market in 3rd quarter already, some of the customers, some of the service provider really did not place with us purchase order for a long time. we started to see toward the end of the quarter, some new po's, however with the rise of the 4th wave, hard for me to say. i will tell you that in our plans because enterprise market goes well, sulfur and services goes well. most of the company priority and strategy lies in that area and therefore at this stage, service provider is still a 10% to 15% revenue service for the company, but we place less importance to that. we'll have to live with what the market provides us.
gregory burns -- sidoti & company -- analyst
okay. thank you.
operator
thank you, ladies and gentlemen. [operator instructions] thank you.
our next question comes from the line of ethan etzioni with etzioni portfolio management, please proceed with your question.
ethan etzioni -- etzioni project management -- analyst
yes. i wanted to ask about the interest expense, why would you have an interest expense when you have so much cash and no debt?
shabtai adlersberg -- president & chief executive officer
you know, first, we are investing in market versus securities are mostly at the yield of 1% because we don't want to take any risk about our cash investments and there were some exchange rate differences, it come close to zero for this quarter and previous quarter. of course, if the interest rate, at the marketable securities or bonds will raise, we should expect more.
ethan etzioni -- etzioni project management -- analyst
but the negative, do you have ifrs 16, are you impacted by that or you're not subject to, is gaap subject to ifrs 16?
shabtai adlersberg -- president & chief executive officer
no, we are subject to us gaap, not to ifrs.
ethan etzioni -- etzioni project management -- analyst
okay. so this is nothing to do with leasing or something like that?
shabtai adlersberg -- president & chief executive officer
no leasing and we don't gaap, we take it out as a reconciliation. you can look at the reconciliation between the gaap and the non-gaap. so no impact from the leasing.
ethan etzioni -- etzioni project management -- analyst

shabtai adlersberg -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, niran. we're very pleased to report strong financial results and continued progress in our business in the third quarter of 2021. as in previous quarters, our enterprise business, now 85% of the quarterly revenue, kept growing and demonstrated growth of about 20% year-over-year. at the core of this success was the ucaas business, which grew about 18% year over year and our contact center business which grew more than 20% year-over-year.
the growth of these two key business lines for several quarters now in a row, clearly points to the potential of continued annual growth rate for revenue in coming years. just to remind this all, our stated objective announced earlier in the year, we plan to achieve annual growth rate of 15% by the end of 2023. during the quarter, we continue to execute in all of our three strategic business areas in the enterprise space.
the first one, microsoft teams, business grew nicely above 20% year-over-year with live services or team's voice-as-a-service leading charge. contact center and customer experience operations grew nicely year-over-year. we have signed a new vendor partnership agreement and we're able to drive new advanced technological solutions with end users, mainly for call automation. and in the conversational ai space, we saw nice progress in this -- in several business lines growing year-over-year, above 50% in revenue and above 100% in bookings.
now products made in both the ucaas and contact center in the markets in several past quarters further emphasizes the fact, the team collaboration, hybrid work and work from home remain key industry trends, not only in 2021, but also for coming years. as such, both markets over a long-term growth potential for us for several years going forward. contributing to this fast pace of growth and success is our decision made end of last year to increase our investment in r&d, biz dev, sales and marketing and services for those markets. we intend to grow our investment in these areas in order to fuel further business growth in coming years.
growth in ucaas and more specifically in the microsoft teams market is primarily related to our audiocodes live services in the area of teams voice. all-in-all, service business revenue grew in the quarter above 25% year-over-year. consisting now close to 40% of our revenues in the third quarter of 2021, it is becoming key to our future business success and expansion. the progress in teams voice as a service is primarily related to industry evolution toward cloud communication and the growing demand in the enterprise space to consume technology-as-a-service versus buying and deploying the products and technological solution by the enterprise it stuff. delivering successfully teams voice as a service relies primarily on continued steadily investment in our professional and managed services operations. one favorable result of this is the shift toward technology-as-a-service is the continued progress in pivoting toward recurring revenues with strong execution in audiocodes live operation.
while enjoying success in the enterprise space, we saw substantially less success in the service provider market. in this area, revenue suffered from diminished demand for connectivity gear from service provider as a result of the covid-19 crisis. as a result, we have witnessed a decline of over 30% year-over-year in this area. just to put things in perspective, i should mention that revenue in the service provider area provide less than 15% of the company overall revenue. another less favorable phenomenon in the third quarter was the shortening -- shortage in components, which has limited our ability to deliver products, targeting connectivity and ip phones. consequently, this shortage in components has hurt our ability to deliver a more successful quarter by roughly about $2 million in revenue.
before we move on just to summarize the various business line performance during the third quarter, the company overall revenue grew 12.1% year-over-year, ucaas and microsoft teams revenue grew 18%, contact center revenue grew above 20%, voice ai, which is now roughly about 1.5% of business kept growing 50% in revenues and 100% in bookings year-over-year. and lastly, the service providers cp business line declined above 30% year-over-year.
touching on several more important financial data points for the quarter, as you could probably see from the press release we issued, opex increased dramatically, around 7.5% sequentially and close to 25% year-over-year. this phenomena is due to the following three key factors. one, first, increase in headcount. we grew 100 positions year-over-year. headcount increased 34 positions this quarter to 855 full-time employees and growing 13% year-over-year, obviously adding 100 new positions over the year-ago quarter clearly demonstrate our confidence in continued expansion of our business. the second factor, rising salaries in the r&d space in israel, where the boom in the local high-tech industry drive substantial shortage in skilled manpower and higher salaries for r&d employees. third component, the impact of much lower u.s. versus the new israeli shekel exchange rate as compared to the year-ago quarter, where we enjoyed good hedge. we are talking about 10% change in this ratio compared to last year. so all-in-all, three factors affecting substantial growth in our opex. that probably explain how from growing revenues 12% year-over-year, the earning line really remained flat. most of the increase in profitability went to cover those differences in spending.
cash flow, again very successful quarter. we generated $13 million in the third quarter and more than about $43 million in the first nine months of the year, which is fantastic. that would compare with about $28.4 million in the same period last year. lastly, deferred revenues were at $72.1 million compared to $64 million a year ago, an increase of 12.6% of second quarter -- third quarter '20.
now let let's relate to our financial performance in terms of our financial model. as we have targeted earlier in the year, we target revenue growth to achieve 13% to 15% on an annual basis. last year, we delivered 10.2%. this quarter, we delivered 12.1%. we believe we should be able to close the year at around 12.6%, 12.5% in terms of revenue growth. in terms of gross margin, we targeted to achieve between 67% and 70%. glad to know that in the quarter we have delivered 69.9%. in terms of opex as a percentage of revenue, we targeted range of 47% to 50% in the third quarter of 2021, we delivered 48.5%. and lastly, operating margin, we targeted the range of 20% to 23%. we ended the third quarter 2021 at 21.4%, all-in-all a very nice performance.
now let me touch one key area, which i believe everybody is interested in and that is microsoft space. so in the third quarter of 2021, we grew more than 20% year-over-year. we have leveraged audiocodes live services for microsoft teams. we saw continued momentum in the market. live services are focused on direct routing as a service and additional teams voice services. as a result, we have increased the total contract value of live contracts by several millions in the quarter, reaching now few tens of millions of total contract value from past 12 months activity.
now, i would like to reference now, until lately there was no published report that gave visibility as to the potential or the total available market for microsoft teams for us teams voice. so i would like to reference one recently published seminar research from piper sandler, highlighting the large total addressable market and the strong growth potential in the ucaas segment. according to that report, ucaas should expand rather fast or -- before i begin with that, i'll mention that the global tam for endpoints is today about $440 million. so we now are looking at a market that's looking to replace the current tdm and other endpoints with ucaas and for us more specifically with microsoft teams and zoom phone endpoints.
so the report mentions that this year the overall endpoint market ucaas market is about 26 million. they forecast that that number should grow to 113 million endpoints in 2026. aall-in-all this represents about 34% cagr for the next five years. according to this note, microsoft teams market share is estimated to be 17% this year of the total ucaas market, and is forecast to grow to lead the market and own 29% by 2026. so just translated that into actual numbers. sso microsoft teams ucaas sets are expected to increase from 4.2 million this year to 31.5 million in 2026. that represents about 50% cagr for microsoft teams sets. the notes states also that zoom and ringcentral are main competitor in that space. as i'll mention later on, we're growing out our share of revenue in the zoom phone area as well, where the very successful core in that space to.
getting back to microsoft, the ip phone business is growing fast this year and showing plenty of room for growth. this is mainly due to the trend of return to work. so all in all, we grew actually -- we could deliver a substantially better core unless we were facing a component shortage thing.
also now let's talk about enhancements what we see ahead for us in 2022. microsoft announced lately in the enterprise connect industry trade show two very important programs. they have announced microsoft operator connect. they have introduced api for teams, which allows operators to integrate teams marketplace and into their plans to deliver ucaas. we see high traction by the carriers and service provider, smb vehicle from microsoft perspective. earlier release should be provided by the end of the year and the final release will be provided mid 2022.
and audiocodes is one of four partners that are helping that effort to develop and sell the platform. so that should be a big driver for microsoft teams service provider push next year. also microsoft announced sip gateway from at enterprise connect, allowing third-party phones to connect to microsoft teams using advanced session border controllers technologies and device management. all in all, we look forward to see how that program develops and what our part in it will be there.
just to get to some more visibility into the microsoft ecosystem sales. so we've continued to see the share of skype for business declining versus sales of about $10 million a year ago, we saws just $5 million this quarter. on the other end, microsoft teams grew substantially more than 70%, so carrying out the charge going forward. in terms of new business created, again we saw an increase in new opportunities created in the core and it's growing at least 25% year-over-year.
now let me touch the key program we have in the microsoft space that is audiocodes live, where we provide basically teams voice as a service. in 2021, we have significantly stepped up our efforts and accelerated the introduction of audiocodes live teams versus the service. teams versus the service removes complexity from the integration of team collaboration, unified communication and enterprise telephony and provide a seamless, rapid and cost effective migration to teams. in building this service, we have brought together our sbc network and user management products and a complete set of automations and are delivering them on a per user per month software as a service model. in recent course, we've already expanded the service offering by adding new compliance recording services and more. also we have since extended the offering of live to other markets, including solutions for zoom phone and contact center activities.
introducing the live offering mid last year, we experienced good reception to this offering. we continue to grow the recurring revenue fairly fast. as i've mentioned before, with the target to reach $10 million arr middle of the year we invested. we believe that this time we will cross the target of $15 million by the end of the year.
our bookings or total contract value of this business on end is already several tens of millions by a large number of enterprises that have already started or about to start the ucaas deployments with us. also, there's a nice pipeline that's growing steadily. this fast-growing business is tangible proof through our superior technology in the year as of connectivity, management and automation services and adjacent application to the uc solution majority of it in teams' voice. i'm confident that this business will keep growing and represent a significant portion of audiocodes value in coming years.
touching on the zoom space, this has been a most successful, the best quarter we had ever in the zoom phone area. we have reached about $1 million in revenue, a bit less than that. we believe that fourth quarter will keep growing. all in all, we see a lot of focus in this area. we believe that zoom will be focusing more and more on zoom phone. and they've basically stated that application to be a strategic focus for them. so we won some large operation, can mention two large deals, one in europe, one in the u.s. so all in all, also if you go back to the piper sandler report, i can quote that zoom is expected to achieve a market share of 15% in 2026 from its current position of 11% -- current market share of 11% in 2021. again, i remind you all we're talking about the tam of 440 million seats altogether.
now one key operation i've mentioned before is our services. as i've mentioned, services is growing to become about 40% of our business that basically the combination of maintenance contracts, but more importantly professional and managed services which is growing very fast. i mentioned that services invoicing -- i was talking about recognition. talking about invoicing, total company services grew close to 25% of the core, while professional and managed services exhibited substantially larger growth, topping 40% both for the core and for the first nine months in the year. so all in all, services really do serve for us a lot of room for expansion going forward.
lastly, i'll touch on voice.ai. voice.ai seems to be growing the way we wanted to grow this year. as i've mentioned in the press release, we target overall booking to grow above a 100% and reach a level of close to 5 million. we expect that rate of growth to come and happen next year. key in that operation were a compliance recording for teams, booking or substantially over the initial plan for the year.
second is a technology we call voice.ai connect, which is used to enable chatbots to connect true voice. and here we've enjoyed a very good core. this year we shouldn't end up somewhere in the 1 million arr in that business, but next year we expect to more than triple that number. and all in all, we definitely get a feedback from the market that it comes to voice and voice becomes very important in the chatbot world in the voice space or solution is regarded fully advanced and superior to competition. and we do have working relationships with some of the leading chatbot developers in that market. one such known one is a company called cognizant out of germany [phonetic] in europe, and there are a few more partners in the uk, i'm sorry, in the u.s. and in india and other places, which allow us to deploy that technology.
last, i should mention that we've made very nice progress with our meeting insights product. the first release was done in october, actually earlier this month. we've seen great interest in over 70% or 80% of introduction. right now, we have tens of proof-of-concept scheduled and running in israel, already begun business development in the u.s. for that product. we've got first few very nice reaction to the product and already got the first po from the u.s. so we do expect to grow fast on that product next year.
all in all, with that, i've been able to cover most of our activity in the third quarter. and i'd like to get the call back to the q&a session. operator?

[operator instructions] your first question for today is coming from greg burns. please announce your affiliation, then pose your question.
gregory burns -- sidoti & company -- analyst
good morning. i'm with sidoti and company. so, i just wanted to touch on the increase in opex and what your view is on that? the range is you kind of set in terms of operating expenses as a percent of revenue and your operating margin targets. at what point do you expect to kind of slow down the investments and start to gain a little bit of leverage on some of the revenue growth that you're projecting? thank you.
shabtai adlersberg -- president and chief executive officer
okay. well, most of the investment in growing headcounts really is related more to the sales and marketing side of the business to grow teams voice as a service -- as the market grows and we need to be able to attract more customers and grow the business, we need to add personnel to provide good service. so, our investment is less intense in the r&d space, still going on and adding more automation and few more solution to it, but the majority of the expense goes to the deployment in the market. so, i think we've seen the most of the worse, i would say, part of the increased simply because from that point and i think the behavior of the us and new israeli shekel will moderate substantially. we will not face anytime soon another decline of 10% in that ratio.
and then again coming back to the average salary issue in r&d, i think this is a phenomena that you'll hear of many companies in israel were due to the very attractive -- i would say attractiveness of israeli r&d, just give you an example. a month ago, we've heard microsoft is planning to add 2,500 new positions in israel in five new developments areas. and as you can imagine, there are tens of such companies increasing. yesterday, we heard about at&t opening a design center in israel. so i would tell you that there is kind of, i would say, not call it a fight, but there is a big, big effort to be able to recruit the right talent to be able to grow the business. luckily for us, again most of the additions would be abroad in marketing and sales. so we do expect continued investment, but not as big job as we have faced current quarter.
gregory burns -- sidoti & company -- analyst
okay. and then in terms of the service provide space, do you -- can you just give us a little bit more color on what is driving the declines there? do you expect that business to kind of remain at these levels, like level off here? or is there a reason to believe maybe that that business might potentially rebound from these current levels? thank you.
shabtai adlersberg -- president and chief executive officer
sure. now, i'm a bit more optimistic than i was about three months ago because we definitely have seen in the third quarter some new demand and i would expect some level off. however, due to the shortage of components, we are kind of stuck here for, i would say, for this quarter -- the fourth quarter, and maybe the first one too. so i expect i do not think that we will see any further decline. actually, i think we've reached the bottom and could see some up growth from here, but more growth should be expected in the second half of 2022. so all in all, it's an area that's not helping to drive revenues upward these days, but we believe it will make a comeback around mid next year.
gregory burns -- sidoti & company -- analyst
okay. thank you.
shabtai adlersberg -- president and chief executive officer
sure.
operator
your next question is coming from ryan macwilliams. please announce your affiliation, then pose your question.
ryan macwilliams -- barclays -- analyst
sure from barclays bank plc. shabtai, continued strong growth with enterprise customers. so as these larger customers are looking to adopt cloud solutions, are you seeing your average deal size increase? and are the companies by number of employees getting larger in your pipeline? thanks.
shabtai adlersberg -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, ryan. yes, well, our focus as i've mentioned is really was -- when we develop our solution for microsoft's first skype for business and later on team's, we're targeting usually the large enterprise companies with a number of employees ranging from, i would say 3,000, 5,000 and upward. lately, with team's voice as a service, we also target smaller companies. we could go as low as 500 employees. so, we're working with the large global system integrator on the large enterprises. we're acting much more independently in the mid market. so this is where the focus is going to be. the typical business for us would be few thousands of employees, whereas they will start trialing and do proof-of-concept with first with a hundred or few hundreds of employees and then after a period of three to nine months will probably add more. so that's the trend you'll see in that space.
ryan macwilliams -- barclays -- analyst
perfect. and then you mentioned operator connect last quarter along with this quarter. would you mind just digging a little deeper on what you think that could mean for audiocodes? and how do you think operator connect impacts the direct routing landscape? thanks.
shabtai adlersberg -- president and chief executive officer
sure. okay. so, great question. as i mentioned in a moment ago, microsoft's focus was entirely in the beginning in the large enterprise space. there's no focused target effort in the mid-market. however, it's obvious that going to the smb market and going to small businesses, usually that's not where microsoft is having direct full efforts. in that space, obviously, ringcentral is the leading player. and as we could have seen zoom, zoom has entered the space.
and actually according to that report from piper sandler, you can see ringcentral and zoom in fight for this segment. now operator connect, which will connect between microsoft and service provider will allow microsoft for the first time to target that smaller segments -- smaller size business market, because traditionally businesses of that size are being served by service providers and, you know, take at&t and verizon, and operators anywhere in the world. so that was definitely open for us completely new segment that has not been served by us before. once that program goes into full motion, the cooperation between microsoft and service provider will allow us to turn our voice teams as a service into that small businesses market. so it's a very important addition toward our future.
ryan macwilliams -- barclays -- analyst
thanks for taking my questions. nice [indecipherable]. thanks guys.
operator
your next question is coming from samad samana. please announce your affiliation then pose your question.
samad samana -- jefferies -- analyst
hi, good morning. samad samana from jefferies. so maybe shabtai first. i wanted to ask about the component side. i wanted to make sure one that i think you said it was a $2 million headwind in the quarter. one, i want to confirm if that's the case. and then how does that factor into the guidance that you've given in -- given for the fourth quarter or the implied guidance for the fourth quarter, and maybe how should we think about the impact of that into 2022?
shabtai adlersberg -- president and chief executive officer
okay. so yes you understood correctly. we could have delivered more ip phone products and more service provider gear. we believe that all-in-all, we kind of missed the delivery of about 2 million in the core. so we have targeted a larger growth of revenue in the quarter.
that phenomena will probably continue, i would say this quarter and in the first half of 2022, we took that into account when we gave the overall guidance, meaning that, taking that shortage into account, we still target to grow in the fourth quarter, if you make quick calculation, we definitely plan on growing in the fourth quarter, although less than we could have expected earlier in the year. so all-in-all that's for the guidance. again, next year, i believe that as we approach second half of the year all that will go away. so we should get a boost from increased phone sales and service providers gear.
samad samana -- jefferies -- analyst
great. and then maybe a follow-up. i know we've touched on opex, but if i look back at sales and marketing dollars in -- from '17 to '18, it was roughly flattish, shows up very modestly in 2019. so even, pre-covid it was fairly limited expansion in sales and marketing dollars. and now this year we're tracking up pretty healthily. how should we think about the -- just the increases there going forward and what's the right level of sales and marketing investments that we should think about maybe both short-term and intermediate?
niran baruch -- vice president of finance and chief financial officer
hi samad, this is niran. so again, as shabtai mentioned, we are planning to invest more in opex mainly at the sales and marketing area. i can refer to the near-term, to q4 we are planning to invest more and the level that you see in the third quarter, which was 14.4 million, we are planning to increase it, but let's say 1% to 3% in terms of sales and marketing. with regards to other opex such as r&d and g&a, we are not planning to invest much more than the level that we saw in the third quarter.
samad samana -- jefferies -- analyst
great. and then just last question for me, shabtai you spent a lot of time today talking about the seats available in the market and the opportunity. i was wondering if you could share with us just maybe how many microsoft teams, voice seats you're actually enabling today, just so we can get an idea of how audiocodes' progress looks against this large market?
shabtai adlersberg -- president and chief executive officer
right. we do not you know discuss in public the number of seats we have, but i'll give you some numbers if you will. and if you go back to the piper sandler report, you can see that microsoft teams seem to be deploying about 4.1 million subscribers this year. this should grow, as i've mentioned to 31 million in 2026. now we are by far the dominant player in that market. you know, you can use market share of 60% or 70% these days. so that's probably can give you some idea about the number of seats we are enabling, but at the same time, give you an idea about the future, our ability to double that number next year and grow to be 60% or 70% out of the total of 30 million in 2026.
samad samana -- jefferies -- analyst
great. thank you for taking my questions this morning.
shabtai adlersberg -- president and chief executive officer

your next question is coming from tal liani. please announce your affiliation, then pose your question.
tal liani -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
thank you. my affiliation is bank of america. good morning. i have a question on zoom and also on microsoft. can you share with us what's the outlook for zoom? what is -- what are they doing there that involves you? what's the potential for other types of businesses with them? just kind of, because it's such an important company. i just want to understand the outlook even not with numbers, just the -- kind of the potential opportunities there. and then on microsoft, can you share with us your view of how they evolve from here? is there a risk of slowdown, because of covid year-over-year comparisons and just in general, same question on microsoft? thanks.
shabtai adlersberg -- president and chief executive officer
okay. thank you, tal. okay. referring first to zoom, [technical issues] that zoom phone is a strategic room for zoom. and we have been working with zoom for more than two years now, on reading and integrating our solution into their offering. now we've done a very little business in 2020, that business is growing substantially in 2021. the amount of new business created for us in the past two quarters is really overwhelming.
now, the way we are designing to the zoom phone solution is in two key areas. one is devices, phones that is integrated already today. now i'll tell you and i think this is known that zoom success really comes from the small businesses and in smb. zoom has an effort to grow up the market and go into larger organization. whenever they go into larger organization, they need for sbc -- good sbc solutions grow. so whenever they go to sell to a larger company, our potential offering grows in importance. also we do intend to come in next six to nine months with our new offering for meeting rooms and that offering would combine of conference devices or meeting room devices management and meeting insights. and we will provide a comprehensive battle. we believe we will be very successful. we believe that zoom should be a very important partner for us. so that's on zoom.
regarding microsoft teams is perceived to be a key driver in microsoft effort to increase licensing fees from e5. i think security and teams are the two leading drivers for the increasing e5 licensing as such. we could see a pretty focused effort at microsoft to support teams and teams voice more specifically. and i've just mentioned these two programs operated connect and sip gateway to be fairly important to them. so i think it's known that teams should be part of windows 365, basically integrating teams into practically not only the business world, but also for the consumer world. so i don't think we face a trend, a potential trend of lower focus in this area. i think we will see microsoft keep investing because this is part of a substantially larger and overall more important target for microsoft.
tal liani -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
great. thanks shabtai for the color.
shabtai adlersberg -- president and chief executive officer
sure.
tal liani -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
just last question on supply chain, how -- can you discuss how supply chain impacts you? how it impacts your clients and your ability to sell, even if you have the right components in place, just in general, the environment for supply chain?
shabtai adlersberg -- president and chief executive officer
yes, actually it's really more the shortage of components. obviously, there is increased lead times. so, our customers really suffer from inability to get the products they want. but other than that shortage, we are capable of working out around those issue in the production and delivery. so that's something that contained within our operations. all in all, i think, we are starting to see some signs that there are ways in which the world is starting to crank out more devices, more components. i'm optimistic that in six to nine months, we will see substantially leveling off of this issue.
tal liani -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
got it. thank you.
shabtai adlersberg -- president and chief executive officer
sure.

your next question is from ariel yaakov [phonetic]. please announce your affiliation then pose your question.
ariel yaakov -- var capital -- analyst
hi, shabtai. i'm from var capital. great job on another good quarter. so my question is can you elaborate and give us more color about the time that you mentioned in the microsoft teams area specifically for the audiocodes live. to my understanding your thoughts about the rest of the market from the 440 million seats is $4.2 million, and that you can assume 50% cagr year-over-year. and from that you can take 70% market share. is that correct?
shabtai adlersberg -- president and chief executive officer
yes, that is about the rough of my calculation. yes.
ariel yaakov -- var capital -- analyst
and how should we look at it in the next couple of years in terms of your market share, or maybe you can charge more from a user per month?
shabtai adlersberg -- president and chief executive officer
right. so ae1 needs to make a differentiation. we haven't done that yet, but we'll probably need to do it starting from next year. everything we discussed so far on microsoft teams is really in the enterprise space. now let's not forget that 440 million tam relates to both enterprise and service providers. now service provider was start to play next year. we'll see their competition. we expect competition from companies like ribbon and metaswitch, which is now part of microsoft. so how market share will develop in the service provider that is still yet to be seen. however, we're very confident that in the enterprise space where we are today, we will keep being the dominant player.
obviously, the only competition -- real competition will face there. it's just one company and we really don't see them close to us. also, we do intend and i have not mentioned it. but we do intend to add more services, contact center services, meeting rooms services, recording services, management services. so i think we should be able to defend fairly nicely or dominance in the enterprise teams space.
ariel yaakov -- var capital -- analyst
so to my understanding that expands your time it is $4.2 million is only for the enterprises. then you can take another market share from the service providers in the last -- in the upcoming years, right?
shabtai adlersberg -- president and chief executive officer
yes, that is correct. although, 2022 will be just the launch here. so you should expect rather mild beginning, but i would tend to think that 2023 will be a year of where that market was growing fairly fast with large service provider, no names pushing it to the market.
ariel yaakov -- var capital -- analyst
okay. thank you so much.
shabtai adlersberg -- president and chief executive officer
sure.
