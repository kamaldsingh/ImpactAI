hello, and welcome to today's tyler technologies second-quarter 2019 conference call. your host for today's call is john marr, chairman of tyler technologies. [operator instructions] as a reminder, this conference today is being recorded. i would like to turn the call over to mr.
marr. please go ahead.
john marr -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, and welcome to our second-quarter 2019 earnings call. with me on the call today are lynn moore, our president and chief executive officer; and brian miller, our chief financial officer. first, i'd like for brian to give the safe harbor statement. next, lynn will have some preliminary comments.
then brian will review the details of our second-quarter results and update our 2019 guidance. then i'll have some final comments, and we'll take your questions. brian?
brian miller -- chief financial officer
thanks, john. during the course of this conference call, management may make statements that provide information other than historical information and may include projections concerning the company's future prospects, revenues, expenses and profits. such statements are considered forward-looking statements under the safe harbor provision of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from these projections. we would refer you to our form 10-k and other sec filings for more information on those risks.
please note that all growth comparisons we make on the call today will relate to the corresponding period of last year, unless we specify otherwise. lynn?
lynn moore -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, brian. our second-quarter results were strong as both revenue and bookings growth accelerated from the first quarter. of course, bookings were the highlight of the quarter as we signed the two largest saas contracts in our history, one of which is our largest single contract of any type. we're gratified that new clients trust tyler to execute high level on crucial and complex projects such as these.
and while it's great to set a new quarterly bookings record, this quarter illustrates, albeit in a positive way, the lumpiness in our contract signings, particularly with respect to large deals. this is our 31st consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth as total gaap revenues grew 16.5% and non-gaap revenues grew 16.9%. our core software revenues from licenses and subscriptions grew 23% on a non-gaap basis, with 16% organic growth. software license and royalty revenues declined 7.7% as the mix of new business was more heavily weighted toward subscription arrangements.
approximately 80% of the value of new software deals came from subscription arrangements and 20% from on-premises license arrangements. the mix was especially skewed by the two very large odyssey saas contracts signed in the quarter. gaap subscription revenues grew 38.6% and non-gaap subscription revenues grew 36.5%. total recurring revenues from maintenance and subscriptions grew 20.8% and comprised 65% of total revenue.
quarterly bookings were the highest in company history at $452 million. as i mentioned previously, we signed the two largest saas deals in our history, both for odyssey court suite. the largest was a 10-year contract with the north carolina administrative office of the courts and north carolina judicial branch valued at approximately $85 million for several products from our odyssey suite, including statewide e-filing. this marks our 15th statewide agreement for odyssey, with north carolina being the largest of those states.
the second contract was a five-year arrangement with bexar county, texas, the nation's 17th largest county valued at approximately $20 million. the contract includes a broad set of products from the odyssey suite to create a single integrated solution to advance court, prosecutor, jail and juvenile probation operations. we also signed a new saas contract with the yolo county, california, superior court for odyssey, including e-filing and modria online dispute resolution. this is the 26th california county court to adopt odyssey and is the first new county in california we've added since mid-2016.
new business for our erp solutions continue to be robust during the second quarter. the largest deals of the quarter were saas arrangements with stockton, california, a multi-suite deal for our munis and socrata data insight solutions valued at approximately $10 million; pembroke pines, florida for munis and energov valued at approximately $6.5 million; and the savannah-chatham county school district in georgia for munis valued at approximately $3.6 million. we also signed notable on-premises license arrangements for our erp solutions with campbell county, wyoming and the cities of vacaville, california; kennewick, washington and redlands, california. for our energov solution, we signed a significant saas agreement with boca raton, florida, valued at approximately $2 million, and an on-premises license deal with newport beach, california, valued at $1.2 million.
we also signed notable license contracts for our public safety in brazos ecitation solutions, each valued over $1 million, with colonial heights, virginia and owensboro, kentucky. for our socrata data and insight solution, significant new signings included the agency for healthcare research and quality, which is a federal agency under the u.s. department of health and human services, and the city of grand rapids, michigan. in addition, notable customers upgrading to our socrata connected government cloud solution included the cities of fort worth, texas, and richmond, california.
finally, for our recently acquired micropact solution, we signed a notable federal arrangement for entellitrak with the export-import bank of united states. now i'd like for brian to provide more detail on the results for the quarter and update our annual guidance for 2019.
brian miller -- chief financial officer
thanks, lynn. yesterday, tyler technologies reported its results for the second quarter ended june 30, 2019. i'm going to provide some additional data on the quarter's performance and update our annual guidance for 2019, and then john will have some additional comments. in our earnings release, we have included non-gaap measures that we believe facilitate understanding of our results and comparisons with peers in the software industry.
these measures include -- exclude writedowns of acquisition-related deferred revenue and acquired leases, share-based compensation expense, the employer portion of payroll taxes on employee stock transactions, amortization of acquired intangibles and acquisition-related expenses. a reconciliation of gaap to non-gaap measures is provided in our earnings release. we've also posted on the investor relations section of our website under the financial reports tab, schedules with supplemental information provided on this call, including information about quarterly bookings, backlog and recurring revenues. gaap revenues for the quarter were $275.1 million, up 16.5%.
on a non-gaap basis, revenues were $278 million, up 16.9%. organic revenue growth rose from the first quarter of 2019 to 8.1% on a gaap basis and 7.4% on a non-gaap basis. as lynn mentioned earlier, the mix of new software business continued to trend -- continued the trend of being weighted toward subscription arrangements, which puts pressure on our organic growth rate for the second quarter. our core software license and subscription revenues combined grew organically approximately 16%.
subscription revenues for the quarter increased 38.6%. we added 154 new subscription-based arrangements and converted 27 existing on-premises clients, representing approximately $128 million in total contract value. in q2 of last year, we added 126 new subscription-based arrangements and had 32 on-premises conversions, representing approximately $32 million in total contract value. subscription contract value comprised 80% of the total new software contract value signed this quarter, compared to 47% in q2 last year.
the value weighted average term of new saas contracts this quarter was 6.1 years, compared to 3.5 years in q2 last year. however, the average term of 6.1 years includes the 10-year north carolina odyssey agreement. excluding this agreement, the average term of new saas agreements was 4.1 years. transaction-based revenues from e-filing and online payments, which are included in subscriptions, increased 26.7% to $21.2 million from $16.7 million last year.
that amount includes e-filing revenue of $14.5 million, up 13.8% over last year. annualized gaap recurring revenues for q2, which are comprised of subscription and maintenance revenue, were approximately $721 million, up 20.8%; and on a non-gaap basis, were approximately $732 million, up 21.4%. our backlog at the end of the quarter reached a new high of $1.4 billion, up 17%. backlog included $395 million of maintenance, compared to $356 million a year ago.
subscription backlog was $599 million, compared to $480 million last year, and includes approximately $138 million related to fixed fee e-filing contracts. our bookings for the quarter were approximately $452 million, an increase of 72.3% from q2 of last year. for the trailing 12 months, bookings were approximately $1.2 billion, up 16.9%. excluding the north carolina odyssey contract, bookings growth was 40% for the quarter and 8.5% for the trailing 12 months.
our software subscription bookings in the quarter added $18.5 million in new annual recurring revenue, up 153% over last year's $7.3 million. for comparison, if all of our new subscription contracts had been under license arrangements, we estimated that they would have represented an additional license bookings of approximately $23 million. we signed 34 new on-premises contracts in the quarter that included software licenses greater than $100,000, and those contracts had an average license of $297,000, compared to 25 new contracts with an average license value of $459,000 in the second quarter of 2018. we ended the quarter with $79 million in cash and investments and $15 million of debt under -- outstanding under our revolving credit facility, which has subsequently been paid off in july.
day sales outstanding and accounts receivables was 125 days at june 30, compared to 114 days at june 30, 2018. the increase in dsos is primarily related to the timing of milestone billings under several large percentage of completion contracts, resulting in a $31 million year-over-year increase in unbilled receivables. excluding current unbilled receivables, dsos were 93 days at june 30, 2019, compared to 89 days at june 30, 2018. our guidance for the full year of 2019 is as follows: we expect 2019 gaap revenues will be between $1.8 -- i'm sorry, $1.8 billion and $1.10 billion, and non-gaap revenues will be between $1.09 billion and $1.11 billion.
we expect 2019 gaap diluted eps will be between $3.50 and $3.63 and may vary significantly due to the impact of stock incentive awards on the gaap effective tax rate, as well as the final valuation of acquired intangibles. we expect 2019 non-gaap diluted eps will be between $5.22 and $5.35. for the year, estimated pre-tax noncash share-based compensation expense is expected to be approximately $62 million. we expect r&d expense for the year will be between $81 million and $83 million.
fully diluted shares for the year are expected to be between 40 million and 41 million shares. gaap earnings per share assumes an estimated annual effective tax rate of 10% after discrete tax items and includes approximately $27 million of estimated discrete tax benefits related to share-based compensation, which may vary significantly based on the timing and volume of stock incentive awards. our estimated non-gaap annual effective tax rate for 2019 is 24%. we expect our total capital expenditures will be between $48 million and $50 million for the year, including approximately $23 million related to real estate and approximately $6 million of capitalized software development.
total depreciation and amortization expense is expected to be approximately $77 million, including approximately $51 million of amortization of acquired intangibles. now i'd like to turn the call back to john for his comments.
john marr -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, brian. we're very pleased with our strong second quarter results and our positive outlook for the rest of the year. we again achieved double-digit revenue growth and have now achieved subscription revenue growth of greater than 20% in 49 of the last 54 quarters. our new business pipeline remains active, and win rates are strong, and our outlook for the second half of the year is positive with an expectation of accelerating growth.
we're also pleased with the progress of micropact and mycivic during the first full quarter as part of tyler. work is well under way with the integration of their products and operations into tyler, and the opportunities in micropact's pipeline are exciting. now we'll take your questions.

[operator instructions] our first question comes from rob oliver of baird. please proceed.
rob oliver -- robert w. baird -- analyst
hey, great. thank you, guys, for taking my question. lynn, one for you and then one follow-up. recognizing that there is significant lumpiness in these types of large saas deals, you guys have now strung together a bunch of quarters of really strong subscription bookings.
and i'm just curious, i know you're not moving your customers one way or another, but whether there's anything you're doing within your sales force to incentivize or otherwise cajole your customers to move this way, whether it'd be roi case studies or value or anything else you might be doing in the go-to-market motion to move those sorts of deals along?
lynn moore -- president and chief executive officer
yes. sure, rob. it's a good question. i think what you're seeing, too, is a recognition of what we've talked about over the last several years, is how the market has been moving toward the saas environment and has been adopting it seemingly more recently at a quicker pace.
as i've said before, the adoptions today versus five years ago are significantly different and where we expect to go in the future. i think one of the things we've talked about generally before, perhaps on the last earnings call or two, is we are taking a hard look at that internally. one of our strategic initiatives for this year has really been looking at this and really focusing on a companywide cloud strategy. that's a significant focus across the entire senior leadership team.
it's a broad effort. as you said, it involves looking at things at sales and sales incentives, looking at our products, trying to determine the best cloud optimization, looking at pricing and financial modeling, potential opportunities from cloud providers. so all that, we're taking a look at, and we are recognizing the shift. we see it.
historically, we've -- i think you've heard us say we've had mostly cloud-agnostic approach, and i think that's something we're taking a look at going forward. and probably not going to get into too much more detail at this time, but i think that's something you'll continue to see and hear from us in the coming quarters.
rob oliver -- robert w. baird -- analyst
that's really helpful. i appreciate that. and then, brian, just one quick follow-up for you. i know there was a lot of focus on the expense side last year and this year, and i heard john in his closing comments talk about how you guys are integrating some of the newer acquisitions.
in the large deals that you mentioned on the call, i heard you mention the juvenile probation. i think that sounds like that could be caseloadpro, also heard modria. in terms of those that are already integrated, is this a question of you guys are better positioned now to cross-sell? or is it -- is that these products give you the ability to come in and sort of platformize and go after a much larger type of deal like we're seeing here? thanks, guys, very much.
brian miller -- chief financial officer
it's a little bit of both. clearly, after the acquisitions that we've talked about in the past, we typically make investments in those acquired companies. some of those investments are organizational to position them to be able to scale. some of those are integrations of the products with other tyler products.
and i think with modria, to some extent, caseloadpro and some of those acquisitions that we've made in the last two or three years, you're now seeing us be at a point where we are integrating them into sales. we're including them in sales like north carolina and like the yolo county deal we talked about that include modria, that include caseloadpro for juvenile probation in bexar county. so yes, we are at a point with some of those acquisitions looking back a ways that now we have a cross-selling opportunity and we have an ability to include them in new deals, as well as going back to our existing customer base. so that's part of our strategy.
and i expect you'll see that contribute to future growth in a bigger part with the acquisitions we've just made in the last 12 months as we look out toward 2020.
rob oliver -- robert w. baird -- analyst
thanks again, guys.

the next question comes from jonathan ho of william blair & company. please proceed.
jonathan ho -- william blair and company -- analyst
hi. congratulations on the strong bookings quarter. i just wanted to start out with your commentary around the lumpiness in some of the pipeline. and just wanted to make sure, were there any deals that maybe came in a little bit early or pulled forward relative to your expectations? and just how should we generally think about the pipeline of opportunity just given how big this quarter was?
lynn moore -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, jonathan. i'll start and maybe brian pipe in. i think we've talked about this for a number for years. i think the way i kind of look at it is, our core bread-and-butter business remains very strong.
our competitive position is good, the market is robust. and then from time to time, we get some of these rather large deals, and traditionally we're talking about the lumpiness when we're coming off a maybe a difficult bookings quarter. and i wanted to point out that this quarter there's little bit of lumpiness that served us well. but that's just part -- it is also a part of our business, you've seen it over time.
we continue to execute on really good mid and upper mid opportunities. and then periodically, we sprinkle in these larger deals. so i think you will continue to see that as we move forward. i don't know that these deals were anything that were, that's really pull forward or back.
the north carolina deal, for example, was been on our horizon for some period of time. but the exact timing of it would have been q2, q3. there is always some movement there. but we have visibility on some of those deals, and i think you can always expect some of those deals to come down the road.
brian miller -- chief financial officer
as you can see, we didn't change our revenue guidance. and so these are -- the timing of these deals generally in line with our expectation. so no big change there. i would say the pipeline continues to have a normal mix of some large deals in it and a normal mix of our more traditional mid-sized deals.
lynn moore -- president and chief executive officer
and jonathan, q2 2020, i'm going to go ahead and set the stage, it is going to be a tough comparison quarter.
jonathan ho -- william blair and company -- analyst
absolutely. absolutely. and just in terms of the micropact acquisition, i mean, should we expect in the third quarter to have a little bit more contribution from u.s. federal government.
i just want to understand if there's any sort of seasonality shift that we should be thinking about on that side as well?
lynn moore -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, absolutely, jonathan. so stepping back, i mean, we've owned the micropact now for what we started march 1. so maybe five months or so. we're pleased with the acquisition.
corporate integrations are going well. we've been doing some product integrations. they're generally on plan as we would expect. but as you point out, there's a little bit of lumpiness in their business.
q3 is the federal business is generally their bigger quarter. they've got a lot of number of good deals. we got pretty good visibility. we feel confident.
it's the first time they are under our wing, but we like where they sit. we believe they're on plan. but you're correct that q3 tends to be a little bit bigger quarter for micropact.
operator
the next question comes from kirk materne of evercore. please proceed.
peter levine -- evercore isi -- analyst
great. thanks for taking my question. this is peter levine in for kirk. so obviously the 10-year deal was impressive in the quarter, but can you talk about how that deal came into the pipeline? how long the sale cycle was? because i know in the past you've alluded to colleges aren't really handing out cobol engineering degrees anymore.
so as governments undergo their own digital transformation or migrating to saas, i mean, could we see 10-year deals become the norm?
lynn moore -- president and chief executive officer
well, peter, it's good question. so i think originally this probably first started hitting our windshield back in 2017. it's a 10-year deal in part -- which is obviously a longer-term for our saas deals and in part it's a statewide implementation. north carolina has got over -- it's got about 100 counties.
it's multiproduct, so we're multi-year. so what you will expect or what we expect to see over the first half of this term is really sort of a ramp-up of getting all those counties online, getting all their products online, getting e-filing online. and then really when you get to year 6, as revenue sort of start peaking out, then it turns into the more of your traditional saas arrangement. i will point out, we talked in the past about our move to try to shorten some of these terms, primarily because the marketplace has been successful in sort of dictating a fixed fee over the initial term.
this contract, as you move into the outer years, year six through 10, as after we get them up running those, those escalations already are built in there. so that's a positive. it's a significantly large deal. to your point about what we can expect in the future, i think it's representative of, as you say, customers moving to digital age, are able to do multiproduct deals and really part of our connected community vision which is really spanning across our divisions.
peter levine -- evercore isi -- analyst
and then just in terms of the subscription mix during the quarter, you have to look at the composition of the pipelines when you entered. how many of those deals kind of shifted from license to subscription? i guess, the better way to ask that question is, who are your customers using to advise them? are they working with consultants? is just an internal decision that they feel comfortable making themselves or is it they kind of making this last-minute ditch effort kind of go to saas?
brian miller -- chief financial officer
i think it's a mixture. i believe the number is roughly around a third of our deal. there's a consultant involved. often it's not one of your better-known consultants like gartner or forrester, but consultants who specialize in the public sector or the local government arena.
so it's not the majority of the deals. and with respect to the mix this quarter, i don't think it was -- it varied significantly from what our expectations were going into the quarter. we expected it would be even excluding north carolina and bexar county, more heavily weighted toward subscription, but with a very strong license deal component in it. and certainly we knew for sometime that both north carolina and bexar county were going to be saas deals.
so again that hasn't changed our guidance outlook for the full year and wasn't very different from what we expected.
peter levine -- evercore isi -- analyst
thank you for taking my questions.
operator
the next question comes from peter heckmann of d.a. davidson. please proceed.
peter heckmann -- d. a. davidson -- analyst
good morning, gentlemen. brian, could you give us the acquired revenue for the two larger deals, aggregate acquired revenue was somewhat lower in my forecast?
brian miller -- chief financial officer
the aggregate -- so the revenue in the quarter for which deals was that for micropact and modria?
peter levine -- evercore isi -- analyst
it's modria.
brian miller -- chief financial officer
ok. hang on just a second.
peter heckmann -- d. a. davidson -- analyst
while you're looking through that, another question maybe for lynn. are you seeing any shift in short-term it spending priorities given the uptick in security breaches at municipalities. with malware and ransomware you find that there is clients who were tracking toward buying or make a decision on a product from tyler or related product and then getting a security -- getting concerned about security and getting -- and that initial procuring gets off track?
lynn moore -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. i would say -- i don't know that i would say there has been any material short-term uptick. it's certainly an opportunity for us. as you know the acquisition we did last year sage data services, we see that as an opportunity.
we like where we sit with that. it's an unfortunate reality of the business that's out there. and surprisingly, for the number of things that you read in the paper, i think there are even at least that many, if not more, that have not actually hit the public windshield. so it certainly -- it's a higher awareness factor.
we see that as an opportunity again. and i think we are positioned with sage to capitalize on that.
brian miller -- chief financial officer
and socrata and micropact combined were a little north of $23 million in non- gaap revenues this quarter.
peter heckmann -- d. a. davidson -- analyst
little more than $23 million? ok. great. i'll follow-up with you -- with that off-line. it doesn't seem like that math and what's the 7.4%.
so we can talk about that later. i appreciate it.
operator
the next question comes from scott berg of needham & company. please proceed.
scott berg -- needham and company -- analyst
hi, everyone. congrats on a good quarter, and thanks for taking my questions. lynn, i wanted to see if you can talk about sales hiring and capacity. you guys have historically had great coverage in your local municipalities, whether it's on the city or county level.
but micropact and socrata have obviously stretched that, with the governments and states they are obviously in, some international items, which is representative and the u.k. contract opportunity. but how do you expand yourself first to properly address those? or did you think you already have proper coverage today?
lynn moore -- president and chief executive officer
good question, scott. i think we've got pretty good coverage right now. when you look at socrata, their focus before we came in was really more as we've talked about the gov 500, including federal. they maintained their sales force and is continuing to push that in the markets that they traditionally did.
what we're able to do is leverage our existing sales capacity with those products as we continue to build out more and more solutions that dovetail with our division product. so it's added extra things to the bags of our current salespeople, while also allowing them to continue in those -- socrata in their more traditional markets. as it relates to micropact, you're right, that's not the same level crossover. i think their sales coverage is pretty good right now.
one of the things that they have been working on over the last couple of years and one of the strategic initiatives that we liked is that they really leverage a partner program. and they've been developing that for a number of years. it's really starting to bear fruit. the number of rfps that are submitted by partners continues to grow.
the partner pipeline continues to grow. that's something that they are really going to be leveraging with respect to international sales. and i would expect that sometime over the next 12 months, you might see a international account or two to come that are really the result of their partner program.
scott berg -- needham and company -- analyst
got it. helpful. and then a small follow-up for brian. brian your online payments business had a nice jump over q1 in the quarter.
i know those expectations i assume that's all material at least and those expectations were brought in a little bit earlier. was that all planned? or was there something unique maybe that spiked that in the 2q results?
brian miller -- chief financial officer
we did plan for those to increase and they did. we also had -- to some extent, we had a one-time pickup from an arrangement with a payment processor that gave us a little boost there. but there was organic growth as well.
scott berg -- needham and company -- analyst
got it. very helpful. thanks for taking my questions.
operator
the next question comes from tim klasell of northland securities. please proceed.
tim klasell -- northland securities -- analyst
hey, guys. great quarter. just first a quick housekeeping one. i know you guys sort of keep track of awarded, but not signed contracts.
is that sort of in your normal range at the end of this quarter or was it sort of a buffer below that?
brian miller -- chief financial officer
i'd say, generally normal, maybe a tick above normal. but i think that comes just with our size now. normal is a bit higher than it used to be. nothing particularly unusual there.
tim klasell -- northland securities -- analyst
ok. good. and then obviously a 10-year term, as you guys mentioned is pretty long. is this a trend that you see happening in your customer base and importantly when contracts come up for renewal.
are you seeing the renewals begin to stretch out a little bit giving you maybe a little bit better visibility going forward?
lynn moore -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, tim. this is lynn. as i mentioned earlier, part of the 10-year term is really because it's going to take about half of that to get fully up and running across all the counties and across all our product lines, including e-filing and everything like that. so on the back end of that, as those revenues ramp, it converts into more of a -- i would say more of a traditional saas arrangement.
as i mentioned earlier, what's good about this arrangement is we do have built-in escalators throughout the term. i don't think it's a -- i wouldn't consider that to be a norm. your question about renewals, i think our experience has been that renewals tend to be more on the annual basis.
tim klasell -- northland securities -- analyst
ok. good. thank you for that clarification. and then micropact, obviously one of your competitor service now had a very strong federal [inaudible], and you guys mentioned maybe some expectations or visibility into that in this quarter.
how about selling micropact into the state and local governments. i know it's early, but what are you seeing so early on, maybe do you have any expectations for next year?
brian miller -- chief financial officer
well, half of micropact's business at the time we acquired them is state and local, with a bit more of a tilt toward state within that side of the business and about half is federal. the federal, at least in the last year, has been growing a bit faster, but they already have a very healthy state and local business. and we expect that to continue to grow, particularly as we look for opportunities to leverage our existing customer base and introduce micropact offerings into that space. so both sides of the business are growth opportunities for us.
but even though we tend to talk about a little more on the federal side because that's relatively new to us, they do have already a strong state and local business.
tim klasell -- northland securities -- analyst
ok. and will you be rolling that product set out to the broader sales force next year? or what are the expectations -- what are your plans there?
lynn moore -- president and chief executive officer
i think tim, the expectation is, as i mentioned earlier, they have a sales force that knows their -- their federal market knows their state market. they have been working on their partner program. i don't really see this as something necessarily going over the next year, pushing into our more traditional sales force. what i do see is the continued product integrations that we're doing and getting some leverage there, for example, socrata.
you talked about some of micropact competitors, that is something that i think is going to be a distinguishing factors. we had data insights to them. and their ability to continue to push out new products based on their entellitrak platform.
tim klasell -- northland securities -- analyst
ok. very helpful. thank you.
operator
[operator instructions] the next question comes from keith housum of northcoast research. please proceed.
keith housum -- northcoast research -- analyst
good morning, guys. with the new [inaudible] contracts that have been signed and the [inaudible] and the e-filing. what are the e-filing assumptions change for you guys going forward? if i think about what we talked about in the past, i believe it was visibility into that $75 million revenue three or four years from now. do this contracts change that visibility at all and your assumption there?
lynn moore -- president and chief executive officer
i don't think it really changes the visibility that much. as i said, the north carolina opportunity has been on our radar for a couple of years. we have a general sense of the overall market, just sense of our perception of our competitive position in that market. i think you're going to continue to see more and more counties, more and more states move to e-filing and mandatory e-filing.
so i'd say overall, our assumptions are about the same.
keith housum -- northcoast research -- analyst
great. i appreciate it. and then obviously it was a good quarter for you guys, just in general with the bookings. was there anything in particular with the market that got some of these guys, i guess over the hump that they were willing to sign the deal this quarter compared to perhaps a quarter or two ago?
lynn moore -- president and chief executive officer
i don't know if there is anything specific that moves in. we talk from time to time, about certain areas of our business and large deals slip and they come in. we generally have pretty good visibility looking out forward. the timing is always a little bit, i wouldn't say suspect, but always moves a little bit from time to time, which is also why we often talk about lumpiness of our business in some of this large deals.
it's a just a function of our market. and as i mentioned in my earlier remarks, having that core underlying really strong business that keeps us going day in and day out and then sprinkle these large deals on top, it's a good mix.

operator
hello, and welcome to today's tyler technologies third-quarter 2019 conference call. your host for today's call is john marr, chairman of tyler technologies. [operator instructions] as a reminder, this conference is being recorded today, october 31st, 2019. i'd like to turn the call over to mr.
marr. please go ahead.
john marr -- chairman
thank you, nick, and welcome to our third-quarter 2019 earnings call. with me on the call, today are lynn moore, our president and chief executive officer; and brian miller, our chief financial officer. first, i'd like for brian to give the safe harbor statement. next, lynn will have some preliminary comments, then brian will review the details of our third-quarter results and update our 2019 guidance.
then i'll have some final comments and we'll take your questions. brian?
brian miller -- chief financial officer
thanks, john. during the course of this conference call, management may make statements that provide information other than historical information and may include projections concerning the company's future prospects, revenues, expenses, and profits. such statements are considered forward-looking statements under the safe harbor provision of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from these projections. we would refer you to our form 10-k and other sec filings for more information on those risks.
please note that all growth comparisons we make on the call today will relate to the corresponding period of last year unless we specify otherwise. lynn?
lynn moore -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, brian. before we get into the third-quarter results, i'd like to highlight two announcements we made this week. first, on tuesday, we announced that we have entered into a strategic collaboration agreement with amazon web services. as public sector clients continue to increasing trend toward the cloud, we continue to evolve our applications in response to their needs.
this agreement allows us to leverage the aws cloud to lay the groundwork for the future of cloud services for the public sector. it provides this framework for development, training, and collaboration in order to support next-generation applications that have the scalability, resiliency, and security that aws offers, and we look forward to working closely together to bring the most advanced cloud-native services to tyler clients. we also announced yesterday that we have acquired courthouse technologies, a leading provider of jury management systems based in vancouver, british columbia. cht's saas solution serves courts of all states across the united states and canada, including five statewide agreements, and their addition will complement and elevate our existing suite of court solutions.
now turning to the q3 results. our execution in the third quarter was solid as we continue to build upon a strong first half of the year. cash provided by operations and free cash flow both reached new quarterly highs in the third quarter, as did non-gaap eps. this is our 32nd consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth as both gaap and non-gaap revenues grew 16.7%.
all of our software-related revenue lines grew by double digits, and organic revenue growth accelerated from the second quarter. our core software revenues from licenses and subscriptions grew 26% on a non-gaap basis with 20% organic growth. software license and royalty revenues in the third quarter were the second-highest in our history, increasing 13.1%. as expected, the new contracts mix shifted somewhat compared to the second quarter, as on-premises license deals made up approximately 48% of the number and 49% of the third quarter total new contract value.
we signed 288 new software contracts in the quarter, a new quarterly high. and through the first nine months of 2019, we have already surpassed the total number of new deals signed in the full year of 2018. our new software subscription deals added $10.6 million of new annual recurring revenue, up 59%. gaap subscription revenues grew 28.2% and non-gaap subscription revenues grew 26.1%.
total recurring revenues from maintenance and subscriptions grew 19.5% and comprised 67% of total revenue. while revenue and bookings in the third quarter were good, they were also affected by delays in the timing of several federal contracts at micropact as an increasing amount of micropact sales are coming through its partner channel. several significant deals were signed by partners at the end of the quarter, but the related contracts with micropact will not execute until october and will be recognized in the fourth quarter. these include the largest deal, a contract for the veterans administration vocational rehabilitation and education for a $3.2 million license fee.
as a result, micropact achieved its largest-ever license sales month in october. our strong sales for our odyssey court case management solution continued this quarter as well. our largest deal in the quarter was a saas arrangement with the district of columbia superior court for odyssey case management, as well as, e-filing with a total value of approximately $7.7 million. we also added two new odyssey clients in california, a license arrangement with shasta county and a saas agreement with the mendocino superior court, along with a new fixed-fee e-filing contract with snohomish county, washington.
new sales for our erp solutions continue to be robust and for our munis solution, the number of new deals in the quarter was an all-time high. significant contracts included multi-suite deals that include some of our more recently acquired solutions. among those were contracts with north richland hills, texas for a number of products, including munis, energov, socrata data and insights, and mobileeyes; and a contract with longview, texas for our munis and socrata data and insights solutions. we also signed a saas agreement for our munis erp solution valued at $4.3 million with the union county public schools in north carolina.
this agreement is one of eight new saas contracts this quarter with north carolina school districts under the master service agreement we signed with the state department of public construction earlier this year. for our public safety solutions, we signed significant contracts with nassau county, new york; the metropolitan computer-aided dispatch in champaign county, illinois; fulton county, new york, and grove city, ohio. for our appraisal and tax solutions, we signed a significant saas agreement with the city of minneapolis, minnesota, and license deals with santa clara county, california, and macomb county, michigan. for our socrata data and insights solution, we had a key win for the socrata-connected government cloud with the new mexico administrative office of the courts, a long time odyssey client.
other significant new signings include the virginia department of rail and public transportation and the u.s. department of veterans affairs. for our recently acquired micropact solution, we signed notable arrangements for entellitrak with the utah department of health, the office of personnel management with the inspector general's office, and the illinois department of agriculture. now i'd like for brian to provide more detail on the results for the quarter and update our annual guidance for 2019.
brian miller -- chief financial officer
thanks, lynn. yesterday, tyler technologies reported its results for the third quarter ended september 30th, 2019. i'm going to provide some additional data on the quarter's performance and update our annual guidance for 2019, and then, john will have some additional comments. in our earnings release, we have included non-gaap measures that we believe facilitate understanding of our results and comparisons with peers in the software industry.
a reconciliation of gaap to non-gaap measures is provided in our earnings release. we've also posted on the investor relations section of our website, under the financial reports tab, schedules with supplemental information provided on this call, including information about quarterly bookings, backlog, and recurring revenues. gaap revenues for the quarter were $275.4 million, up 16.7%. on a non-gaap basis, revenues were $277.2 million, up 16.7%.
organic revenue growth rose from the second quarter of 2019 to 8.9% on a gaap basis and 8.3% on a non-gaap basis. our core software license and subscription revenues combined grew organically approximately 20%. subscription revenues for the quarter increased 28.2%. we added 150 new subscription-based arrangements and converted 20 existing on-premises clients, representing approximately $47 million in total contract value.
in q3 of last year, we added 81 new subscription-based arrangements and had 31 on-premises conversions, representing approximately $29 million in total contract value. subscription contract value comprised 51% of the total new software contract value signed this quarter, compared to 37% in q3 of last year. the value-weighted average term of new saas contracts this quarter was 2.7 years, compared to 3.6 years in q3 of last year. revenues from e-filing and online payments, which are included in subscriptions, increased 19% to $21.3 million from $17.9 million.
that amount includes e-filing revenue of $14.7 million, up 10.5% over last year. annualized gaap recurring revenues for q3 were approximately $740 million, up 19.5%, and on a non-gaap basis were approximately $747 million, also up 19.5%. our non-gaap operating margin increased sequentially 100 basis points from 24.6% in the second quarter to 25.6% in the third quarter but declined 150 basis points from last year's third quarter. the year-over-year decline reflects two major factors: our increased investment in r&d and the lower operating margins from acquisitions completed in the last two years, which also are receiving significant investments that affect their near-term profitability as they are integrated into tyler.
our r&d expenses in the third quarter increased almost 24% from last year. if our r&d expense were flat with last year and the results of our 2018 and 2019 acquisitions were excluded, our q3 non-gaap operating margin would have been 28%, up 90 basis points, and on a year-to-date basis, 27.9%, up 130 basis points. our backlog at the end of the quarter was $1.41 billion, up 13.9%. backlog included $393 million of maintenance, compared to $355 million a year ago.
subscription backlog was $592 million, compared to $488 million last year, and includes approximately $129 million related to fixed-fee e-filing contracts. our bookings for the quarter were approximately $259 million, an increase of 1.6% from q3 of last year. for the trailing 12 months, bookings were approximately $1.2 billion, up 18.9%. the intentional reduction in the term of new subscription contracts also impacted bookings growth.
had the average term of subscription bookings in the quarter been the same as last year, bookings growth would have been approximately 4.3%. our software subscription bookings in the quarter added $10.6 million in new annual recurring revenue, up 58.9% over last year's $6.7 million. for comparison, if all of our new subscription contracts had been under license arrangements, we estimate that they would have represented additional license revenue of approximately $14 million. we signed 49 new on-premises contracts in the quarter that included software licenses greater than $100,000, and those contracts had an average license of $293,000, compared to 29 new contracts with an average license value of $465,000 in the third quarter of 2018.
cash flow from operations rose 16% to $130.1 million and free cash flow rose almost 21% to $125.3 million, both new quarterly highs. we ended the quarter with $230 million in cash and investments and no outstanding debt. during the quarter, we also entered into a new five-year $400 million unsecured revolving credit facility. the new credit facility replaces our previous $300 million secured credit facility, which was scheduled to mature in november of next year.
the new credit facility also provides a minimum of $250 million additional uncommitted funding through an accordion feature. in addition to expanding the size and moving to unsecured, the credit facility also contains improved pricing compared to our previous facility. days sales outstanding and accounts receivable was 114 days at september 30th, 2019, compared to 107 days at september 30th, 2018. the increase in dsos is primarily related to the timing of milestone billings under several large percentage of completion contracts, resulting in a $32 million year-over-year increase in unbilled receivables.
excluding current unbilled receivables, dsos were unchanged from last september at 79 days. our guidance for the full year of 2019 is as follows: we expect 2019 gaap revenues will be between $1.082 billion and $1.095 billion, and non-gaap revenues will be between $1.090 billion and $1.103 billion. we expect 2019 gaap diluted eps will be between $3.50 and $3.63 and may vary significantly due to the impact of stock incentive awards on the gaap effective tax rate, as well as, the final valuation of acquired intangibles. we expect 2019 non-gaap diluted eps will be between $5.22 and $5.35.
for the year, estimated pre-tax noncash share-based compensation expense is expected to be approximately $62 million. we expect r&d expense for the year will be between $81 million and $83 million. fully diluted shares for the year are expected to be between 40 million and 40.5 million shares. gaap earnings per share assumes an estimated annual effective tax rate of 10% after discrete tax items, includes approximately $27 million of estimated discrete tax benefits related to share-based compensation, which may vary significantly based on the timing and volume of stock option exercises.
our estimated non-gaap annual effective tax rate for 2019 is 24%. we expect our total capital expenditures will be between $45 million and $47 million for the year, including approximately $20 million related to real estate and approximately $6 million of capitalized software development costs related to micropact. total depreciation and amortization is expected to be approximately $76 million, including approximately $52 million of amortization of acquired intangibles. now i'd like to turn the call back over to john for his comments.
john marr -- chairman
thanks, brian. we're pleased to continue to build on the strong first half of the year with a very solid third quarter. we again achieved double-digit revenue growth, as well as, achieving the highest quarterly non-gaap eps, and free cash flow in our history. our competitive position remains high, in part reflecting our increased investment in r&d over the last two years, and we signed a record number of new deals in the quarter.
we continue to be active in the integration of our 2018 and 2019 acquisitions into tyler, and we are encouraged by the progress. we're starting to see benefits from the investments we've made in acquired products, including integration to tyler's core products. for example, 22 new erp and public safety deals this quarter included socrata's data-as-a-service platform and we had seven wins with caseloadpro, now branded tyler supervision. as lynn noted, we're also very excited about our new strategic collaboration agreement with amazon web services.
this multifaceted agreement brings together tyler, the nation's largest software company focused exclusively on the public sector, and aws, the broadest and deepest cloud platform. we look forward to working together to accelerate innovation in the development of these strategic initiatives. as we continue to evolve our applications in response to the public sector needs, this collaboration will enable tyler's clients to deliver better experiences for citizens and further enable governments to use data as a strategic asset in the design, management, and delivery of their programs. now, nick, we'll take your questions.

[operator instructions]first question comes from kirk materne, evercore isi. go ahead.
kirk materne -- evercore isi -- analyst
hi, thanks very much. i guess, maybe just to start, i guess, lynn or john, can you talk a little bit more about the aws deal just in terms of what maybe you're hoping to accomplish with that in the immediate sort of near term? are clients asking about aws and having the flexibility of moving over -- move over to it? how do you think about that as a development platform for your own applications? maybe just a little bit more color on that, what's in the near term, goals are, and then maybe, longer-term goals?
lynn moore -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, sure, kirk. i think it's -- this is kind of something i've been talking about for the last several quarters. i've been talking about an initiative within tyler, really a long-term strategic initiative about really coming up with a comprehensive companywide cloud strategy. we've talked about -- it involves a lot of different things, and involves evaluating our current products, our potential road maps, trying to figure out how to get them on the right path to become more cloud efficient, and hopefully, cloud-optimized, looking at our historic approach of cloud-agnostic, looking at the long-term strategy of the tyler cloud, evaluating opportunities with public cloud providers and on and on.
and so, this really is an extension of that. it's a piece of that overall puzzle that we've been working on for the past year. as we continue to focus more on delivering more of our solutions in the cloud and building next-gen applications, partnering with aws helps with that. it helps modernizing our portfolio short-term.
it also helps with some training for our staff to help them get the skills necessary to build some of these next-gen apps. it helps with our long-term strategy, eventually moving away from the tyler cloud. so, it's really just a continuation of stuff that we've been talking about. i don't know that we're in a position still to sort of outline, you can expect this in this quarter and that in that quarter.
but it's a part of an overall movement that we've been working on for the past year. i want to be careful on a couple of things. i want to make sure that it's clear about what it's not. we're not -- it's not an immediate radical shift in our business model, away from on-premise.
we certainly recognize the increasing market shift in the public sector. we believe that's going to continue in the future. we've talked about where rates were five years ago versus today, and where we think they'll be in the future. but we're going to continue to be responsive.
there's still significant demand in the market for on-premise, and we're going to be responsive to that demand, even as we are evolving, and moving the strategy more to the cloud. it's also not an immediate move away from our existing tyler cloud. we've got existing customer commitments. we've got financial commitments.
and again, as i mentioned, some of our products will -- can today move more easily into a public cloud, into a more cost-efficient manner, and some needed some work to become a little more cloud-efficient, and hopefully, over time, cloud-optimized. so, at a high level, that's where it is. in the near term, it's -- we're going to continue to solidify our relationship. it's an overarching framework for us to work on various initiatives, but we're really focusing on future development, on training, on collaboration, migrating customers where it makes sense.
but really recognizing the market and where it's going, and again, an extension of the work we've been doing inside of tyler for the past year.
kirk materne -- evercore isi -- analyst
super. that's helpful. and maybe just one follow-up for brian. brian, i apologize if i missed this, but any impact from courthouse on the fourth-quarter guidance? or maybe how to think about it for fiscal '20?
brian miller -- chief financial officer
no, it's a relatively small deal, less than $5 million in annual revenues so the impact won't be material in q4.
kirk materne -- evercore isi -- analyst
ok. super. thank you all.
operator
our next question comes from scott berg, needham & company. go ahead.
scott berg -- needham and company -- analyst
hi, everyone. thanks for taking my questions. i guess, let's start with when -- we were at the iacp event here earlier this week, and had some great discussions on the public safety side of your business, and how that business is positioning better upmarket. could you maybe talk about the company's overall efforts to move more into those tier 1 type customers? historically, it hasn't been a big focus.
i know you're doing more there more recently, but maybe an update on some successes and opportunities there. that would be great.
lynn moore -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, sure, absolutely. so, we've talked about it a little bit, scott, over the last -- really last couple of years, we've made a lot of investments. part of the purpose of those investments was one, to get the product more competitive but also position it to move upscale, upmarket. those investments have been paying off in our core market in terms of number of rfps we're responding to, shortlisting.
but i think, you've also seen this year, the number of new names we're getting is up significantly year over year. as an example to your direct question is, the larger deals are starting to be on our horizon. we expect to close, by the end of the year, approximately twice as many deals that were in the $1 million-plus range as last year. so a good example of those investments.
i think stepping back, when you look at the quarter, for public safety, there were really two big operational milestones, which are really key to fueling that growth upmarket. i mean, we've done the work on the product and we don't talk a lot about it, but we had two really big go-lives this quarter, scott. one was in orlando, florida, and that was really our first tier 1 cad go-live. and by that i mean, it's a jurisdiction that has over 1 million-plus calls a year.
so, it's the first time we've been able to do that. burlington county, new jersey, another successful go-live. they were a tier 1 client for both cad and records. we talk about this stuff occasionally.
but again, this kind of the secret sauce of tyler. this is the hard stuff, getting clients up and running on time, on budget. as you know, it's a reference business. getting them happy is going to help play, as we continue to move upmarket and get more and more opportunities, having these tier 1 sites up and running and referenceable.
in orlando's case, for example, our team got multiple personal handwritten notes from the clients just all about the success of the implementation. so, that's really good stuff. we don't put out press releases about it. but to your point about moving upstream, you got to get those references in place, and it was a really good quarter for public safety to do that.
scott berg -- needham and company -- analyst
got it, helpful. and then from a follow-up perspective, you had a couple of micropact deals that kind of moved out of q3 into q4, and i certainly understand the rationale there. but as you moved into new segments, federal is obviously new with micropact, socrata has brought some state opportunities and international maybe that you didn't have before. how do you view the predictability of the business today around deal flow? i know the business has always had some quarters where deals will get awarded but maybe not get invoiced, and there'll be some movement there.
but it seems like the last couple of quarters, there's been some more movements there. is this kind of a short-term trend, as you have these assets, kind of, for the first time in your purview? or maybe is predictability a little bit less certain versus what's been historically very easy to guide to with the small local customers?
lynn moore -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, scott, i think it's a couple of things. i think you're right. we're still learning a little bit about these markets. and then, as it relates to micropact, we're still learning and they're still learning really about this -- the partner channels, and they have spent some time and made some investments over the last couple of years.
but this is really the year that it's really starting to see some fruition. and i think that was just sort of a little bit of an internal miss that, as you know, some of the federal deals, which is a significant part of their business -- certainly not all their business -- has a lot of business that comes in at september 30. well, the partners were getting that business but didn't turn around. and sometimes that business comes in, literally, at the stroke of midnight on september 30.
well, there's no time for us to get that contract. i think part of it, too, is -- and you see this in a couple of our lines, when you don't have the -- as the business is growing and you don't have the deal flow, and you have some -- a little bit more larger deals, you tend to have some deals that will slip that may impact performance a little bit more, as opposed to say, our erp side of the business, where there's a more continuous and constant deal flow. so deals slip in, deals slip out. it's kind of -- that's just the nature of the business and we don't really talk about it.
but some of these lines, where there's a little bit larger deals, we see this with odyssey, sometimes even in our core business, the predictabilities gets a little bit off internally. but for the year, and generally, like i told the guys at micropact, the good news is you won the business. we'll take the business when we get it. as you know, we don't put out quarterly guidance.
perhaps this is part of the reason but the good news is that all the business trends are there but we're still learning a little bit of the space.
scott berg -- needham and company -- analyst
great. thanks for taking the questions.
operator
our next question comes from keith housum, northcoast research. please go ahead.
keith housum -- northcoast research -- analyst
good morning, guys. during the courthouse acquisition, i'm just trying to understand, is this typical of your, i guess your common pattern of making acquisitions? do you foresee a need to spend some significant amount of r&d in terms of updating their portfolio or integrating with yours?
lynn moore -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, keith, i'd say it's in line with a lot of our recent acquisitions, which are -- have been more strategic, and primarily product acquisitions. we've talked in the past about our white space initiative and looking for things that are either voids or deficiencies in our current offerings. and i think that's courthouse technology sort of fits that bill. i'd say it's very similar rationale and thought process as our caseloadpro, which is now tyler supervision, acquisition last year.
courthouse technologies is a company that had a -- really a leading jury management solution. we had our own existing jury management solution. it was probably not an a. it was certainly not a strength of ours.
it's something that we see in a lot of deals but i think about half of our odyssey deals requesting jury, as well as, other products. we had some outstanding customer required -- requirements. so it's been on our list, our r&d list to put in some more investment, and yet, we were able to find a company with a solid product to bring in. to your question about r&d, like almost every investment we do, we don't just put them in and let them run.
we make some investments, we make some integrations, we usually end up spending a year or two sort of getting them tylerized, getting them on track. and our history has generally been, as you look out a couple of years, and you really see that growth start to take off. so, i do expect some investment there. but the product is in pretty good shape and a lot of that will be integration-related.
keith housum -- northcoast research -- analyst
great. i appreciate it. and then just, brian, perhaps i -- going down deeper into the e-filing business. i know you're up at 10% year over year.
but at some point, over the next year or two, should we expect even acceleration of that growth, as you sign -- you guys sign up more customers? or is this a pretty good cadence to think about that growth quarter over quarter and year over year?
brian miller -- chief financial officer
i think, generally, kind of mid-teens is probably the right way to think about it. we have some sort of backlog of e-filing, and then, we've got commitments from some clients that are in the process of implementing case management solutions that will go live on e-filing once that system's in place. we have others that are still not fully mandatory. so, there's additional volumes to come.
and then, we expect to continue to win new business as we did this quarter. i think snohomish county, washington was a new e-filing customer. so, i think generally, it can be a bit lumpy, too, especially if larger solutions or larger systems come online or jurisdictions. but i think kind of mid-teens is the right way to think about that, on average, as growth.
keith housum -- northcoast research -- analyst
great. thank you.
operator
our next question comes from rob oliver from baird. please go ahead.
rob oliver -- robert w. baird and company -- analyst
great. thanks for taking my questions, guys. first question is for lynn. and i just wanted to ask -- it sounds like you guys got some nice traction with new world and some wins on the public safety side this quarter.
and just wanted to get a sense for you, both near term, tactically, you know, how -- obviously, it's more of a q4 back-end loaded type of land. so, how you feel kind of heading into q4? and then, the nature of some of those wins? and if you're starting to see that kind of federation effect from your tyler installed base starting to cross-pollinate in terms of wins on the public safety side. thanks.
lynn moore -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, i think going back to my comments before, i'm pleased where public safety sits today. like a lot of our -- we just talked on the question before about acquisitions and investments. and we've invested a lot over the years, and sometimes, it takes a little bit -- even longer than we think to sort of get that momentum going but the momentum is there. i mentioned some of the metrics.
we're shortlisted now and more than 90% of our rfps are new names, through three quarters are, up 75% from last year, the size of deals is going up. q4 is setting up for a big quarter. it still tends to be a little bit seasonal that way and they have a lot of big deals in the pipeline. it's a lot of operational execution to try to get all those closed.
i mean, it's a difficult thing to do. but sort of stepping back at the 20,000-foot level, all the metrics are trending in the right direction. the competitiveness is trending in the right direction. our products are there.
we're getting the references. i mentioned from orlando and burlington, which are key for -- to move upmarket. and overall, customer side is in such a different place than it was a couple of years ago. and you just can't overlook that, making sure that our clients are happy and feel like they're getting value.
as we've talked before, as you guys know, it's -- everything we do is out in the public. our customers are not competitors, they share everything. so, being successful with your existing base is such a big part of getting the new business and they're just doing a great job.
brian miller -- chief financial officer
and i just would add one thing on your question about cross-pollination and how public safety is working with other tyler products. we're certainly seeing that our public safety solution had not had much success in texas historically, and in the last year or so, they've had a number of deals in texas. i think all of those when in jurisdictions that use our odyssey case management solution on the courtside. many of our public safety deals include brazos, our e-citation product.
mentioned earlier in the remarks that socrata data and insights is being included in a lot of public safety deals, and we expect to go back to our public safety base and add socrata to a lot of those clients. so clearly, we're seeing the impact of tyler on the public safety business.
rob oliver -- robert w. baird and company -- analyst
that's great. thanks. and then just a quick follow-up, brian, while i've got you. so, the 51% mix on subscriptions this quarter, you've got micropact deals that are going to hit this quarter, assuming some of them are going to be perpetual license since it tends to be more perpetual.
and then, you've got kind of public safety, year-end kind of skewing perpetual. how should we think about that mix into q4? thanks a lot guys.
brian miller -- chief financial officer
well, there's still uncertainty, there's still a lot of deals that are in the pipeline, particularly in the erp side, where we have -- we're either a finalist or, in some cases, have been awarded but the client is still deciding whether they're going to go to the cloud or be on-premises. but generally, i think there's two factors: micropact has a number of license deals that will be in q4. public safety tends to be much more heavily weighted toward license deals today. and so, there are seasonality in q4, both of those tend to trend to q4 more heavily toward licenses in the cloud.
but having said that, in q3, and we did see a bigger mix in the erp in the cloud. so, i don't think it's going to be heavily cloud like q2 was, but we still have a fairly wide range on the revenue side. and the biggest factor there is how some of those deals that are uncertain today fall out.

our next question comes from pat walravens, jmp securities. please go ahead.
pat walravens -- jmp securities -- analyst
oh, great. thank you. so, looking out sort of a long time, but sort of five to seven years, right? let's assume we're going to be a lot more in the cloud, and sap's got s/4hana and they're doing a public cloud version, and oracle's got fusion but they bought netsuite. for your core erp, what's the plan? i mean, are you going to rewrite it so that we have sort of a multi-tenant, true saas solution?
lynn moore -- president and chief executive officer
well, pat, we're -- like i said earlier, we are currently in the process of evaluating all of our core products and trying to get them on the right roadmap to be able to be more responsive in the cloud and be more first, cloud-efficient, and then, cloud-optimized. our near term, you look out over the next couple of years, i think we're looking to just evolve away from our approach of historical approach of being cloud-agnostic, as a business model, perhaps cloud-first, as a business model. but again, recognizing that there's still going to be significant demand for on-premises. it's a technical, strategic question and i'm not sure i'm ready to give you that product roadmap right now, but it's something that we're working on intently.
we see where the market's going. we know the efficiencies of the cloud, not just from a revenue standpoint, but what it can mean for the customer, in continuous delivery, continuous improvement, which is part of your multi-tenancy, and what it can do operationally as we reduce versions out in the field and stuff like that. so, we're in the middle of all that. i think you'll continue to hear us each quarter or be a little more specific or give a little more info as this strategy unfolds.
but we're going to take our disciplined approach, and the way we've done -- tackled the rest of our business.
john marr -- chairman
and i think the direct answer to your question though is no. we won't be rewriting any of the major apps. they're all architected in ways that they can continue to evolve to be native cloud, certainly, multi-tenant or whatever the specific objective is. so it's really a matter of priorities.
we have functional priorities, quality priorities, user-experience priorities, and then, the technical priorities of evolving toward a more cloud-native solution. and we look at the marketplace and we work with our sales and marketing people, and then we balance those things and make those decisions. so, i think as lynn's been saying, over the last year or two, there has been a little more focus, and the pendulum has swung toward attributing more attention and more resources toward cloud-native solutions. so we'll do that.
but all of our major applications can evolve to be entirely cloud-native without a rewrite. rewrites are generally not part of the tyler strategy. they're not just disruptive to our business, they're very disruptive to the customer. and so, we generally take an approach where we continue to evolve the products without blowing our customers out of the water and delivering this in a non-disruptive way to both our clients, as well as, our business strategies.
pat walravens -- jmp securities -- analyst
ok, great. thank you.
operator
our next question comes from mark schappel from benchmark. please go ahead.
mark schappel -- benchmark -- analyst
hi, thank you for taking my question. i've got a question for you on the competitive front. you have a relatively new private equity-backed competitor that's out there, that's basically been stitched together during the past year or so. i was wondering if -- given their larger size, if they're starting -- if you're seeing them in more rfps, if you're seeing any major impact competitively out there?
lynn moore -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. hey, mark. so, i'm assuming you're -- i think i know who you're talking about. they have two pe firms -- got together and have acquired a number of assets of significant size.
we're pretty familiar with all those assets. we've competed with them in the markets for years. i think if you follow them closely, you probably also know they've got a significant amount of debt. i think their debt's recently been downgraded.
we see them in the market. i don't know, generally, the pe playbook is -- they look a little more at the near term. we know that what they've been doing is -- has been a little bit disruptive in the market in terms of trying to consolidate product lines, consolidate business bizops. so, it's been a little bit disruptive in the customer and their employee base.
i heard that a little bit anecdotally. but our competitive position with them has remained strong as it does with, i guess, all our other competitors. our win rates are good across the board.
mark schappel -- benchmark -- analyst
great. thank you. and then, brian, a question for you. this has been an investment year from an r&d standpoint, which has impacted your operating margins.
i was wondering if you could just address in kind of broad brush strokes, the company's longer-term view on the margin front over the next couple of years.
brian miller -- chief financial officer
yeah, i'd say, broadly, we expect to be sort of growing into this new level of r&d. we certainly have had elevated investments -- over the last couple of years, i think r&d has been up more than 30% in each of the last two years. that is starting to level out a bit. i think our total r&d expense, excluding acquired companies, was pretty flat with last year's q3.
so, i expect that all else being equal in terms of not having other large compelling opportunities to invest internally, that we'll see r&d headcount start to level out, and that we won't see that growth of r&d expense that's way above our revenue growth. and that if you look out over the next few years, we'll see leveraging in on that line. and along with that, then we'll be sort of back on a trajectory of long-term operating margin improvement that's more consistent with what we've seen in -- over a longer period of tyler's history. so we do believe there's significant operating margin opportunity ahead of us.
i'd say the other factor that we pointed out on the call, as well is in -- generally around the acquired businesses, which really are the biggest reason for the falloff in margin improvement in the last year. as lynn talked about, generally, we're making investments in the short-term after we acquire someone. some of that's in r&d and some of that's in operating expense, but those investments are sometimes around the product, sometimes around the integration with other tyler products, sometimes beefing up the organization to take advantage of the opportunities that they have ahead of them. and so, with the seven acquisitions we've done in the last two years, collectively, those businesses are just about breakeven right now.
so, that's a bit of a drag on our margin improvement. but again, as we get through those initial investments, we expect to see profitability and contribution to margin, where today, they're not. so yeah, if we look out over the next couple of years, margin improvement is still a big part of our story, and something that we do have a focus and discipline on and we'd expect to be getting back to that.
mark schappel -- benchmark -- analyst
thank you.
operator
our next question comes from tyler wood from northland. please go ahead.
tyler wood -- northland securities -- analyst
yeah, going back to the aws partnership and the cloud-native stuff, when you look across your different business lines, the erp, the public safety, the courts, which do you see as the best fit for cloud delivery and you think will be quickest to migrate? and then, what do you expect to be more gradual, and say, on-prem for a longer time? thank you.
lynn moore -- president and chief executive officer
well, i think that question has two parts. one is, what's the state of our current products to run more efficiently in a public cloud? as you know, all our products run in the tyler cloud today. the second thing is what is the market calling for and where is the demand? it's interesting, the shift and move to the cloud, the saas, even tyler cloud or whatever, it has been increasing. we've seen a lot on the erp side.
but we're also seeing it in the other lines. we're seeing it kind of really across the board. if you look at large -- recently large court deals, the north carolina deal we announced last -- we talked about last earnings call, the dc courts deal, bexar county, all the larger deals are starting to trend that way. we talked a little bit about, on the erp side, there's north carolina statewide schools contract.
all those implementations will be saas in the cloud. in the public safety side, you're seeing more and more receptiveness from the public safety buyer and the public safety user to having their information up in the cloud, whereas i say, four, five years ago, that was probably an area that was more reluctant. so, i don't know that there's a specific area where the trend is hotter than the other. it's just the overall market trend that's moving that way.
tyler wood -- northland securities -- analyst
thanks. that's all for me.
operator
[operator instructions] the next question comes from jonathan ho, william blair & company. please go ahead.
jonathan ho -- william blair & company -- analyst
hi, good morning. i just wanted to maybe touch on the arr metric and just, i guess, better understand what your broader expectations for maybe what arr should be growing. and just given the duration shift in bookings, is this sort of a more relevant metric when we think about sort of the forward-looking performance of the company?
brian miller -- chief financial officer
yeah, jonathan, i'd say, certainly, as we become more and more of our new business coming through the cloud, that the arr metric becomes more important. there are a lot of nuances to it around tyler. the $10.6 million of new arr that we talked about this quarter was up 59% over the new arr last year's third quarter. that is really around new software bookings.
we certainly have -- we're now two-thirds recurring revenue, a big chunk of that is maintenance. that's not included in that arr. it also doesn't include things like e-filing, which are also recurring revenue streams. so, it's really just new software deals from the cloud.
so it's a piece of it and it's hard to predict that growth. but certainly, our cloud business, our subscription business has been growing in the 20% to 30% range for very, very consistently over the last several years, and we expect that to continue. so, i think we'll continue to refine that metric and put more emphasis on it but definitely a high-growth piece of our business.
jonathan ho -- william blair & company -- analyst
got it. and then, can you talk a little bit about the reaction from clients in the salesforce now that you're a few quarters into this initiative to pursue, i guess, shorter-duration contracts? has there been much pushback or have you had to, i guess, change incentives in order to get this through?
brian miller -- chief financial officer
i don't believe there's been pushbacks. i think it's more in line with most software companies. we -- in the early days of our cloud business, we were, i think, less -- we -- and this is going back 15 years ago, we and our clients, were newer to it. we felt like we needed to sign customers up to very long-term agreements.
there's certainly no more attrition in our cloud business than there is in our on-prem. i guess, there's actually somewhat less, although, it's on a bigger sample, and we have pretty negligible attrition in general. so, i think it's those kinds of -- the three-year term that we generally lead with is, i think, pretty consistent with what other vendors provide. and our customers are comfortable with that.
and so, there haven't been really any changes in the sales process. it's just an evolution to -- these are our standard terms now.
jonathan ho -- william blair & company -- analyst
ok. thank you.
john marr -- chairman
look, our early cloud strategy -- our early cloud strategy often bundled the deployment services into the annual fee. so by doing that, we went for extended terms in order to keep the annual costs reasonable. over time, as the market matured, and generally, the de facto relationship had services paid for on the side and the annual fee typically was a subscription fee and the hosting fee, it became less necessary for us to require our clients to sign these longer-term agreements. so that was really an evolution in the relationship we had.
and as professional services became a line item that they paid for on the side, it wasn't necessary so we felt there was no reason to have that hurdle out there in the new business market. so, it's been well-received by clients. obviously, it gives us some flexibility if the market changes or our cost changes to have some price flexibility down the road. but the reality is that those increases are very reasonable and have never been anything significant enough to hurt the client.
jonathan ho -- william blair & company -- analyst
thank you.

hello, and welcome to today's tyler technologies fourth-quarter 2019 conference call. your host for today's call is john marr, chairman of tyler technologies. [operator instructions] as a reminder, this conference is being recorded today, february 13, 2020. i would now like to turn the call over to mr.
marr. please go ahead.
john marr -- chairman
thank you, kate, and welcome to our fourth-quarter 2019 earnings call. with me on the call today are lynn moore, our president and chief executive officer; and brian miller, our chief financial officer. first, i'd like for brian to give the safe harbor statement. next, lynn will have some preliminary comments, then brian will review the details of the fourth-quarter results and provide our guidance for 2020.
then i'll have some final comments and we'll take your questions. brian?
brian miller -- chief financial officer
thanks, john. during the course of this conference call, management may make statements that provide information other than historical information and may include projections concerning the company's future prospects, revenues, expenses and profits. such statements are considered forward-looking statements under the safe harbor provision of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from these projections. we would refer you to our form 10-k and other sec filings for more information on those risks.
please note that all growth comparisons we make on the call today will relate to the corresponding period of last year unless we specify otherwise. lynn?
lynn moore -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, brian. we closed out 2019 by reaching two significant financial milestones as our annual revenue surpassed $1 billion and adjusted ebitda exceeded $300 million for the first time. this was also our 33rd consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth as gaap revenues grew 19.4% and non-gaap revenues grew 18.3%. organic revenue growth accelerated for the third consecutive quarter, returning to double-digit growth at 10.2% for non-gaap revenues.
our core software revenues from licenses and subscriptions grew 30.5% on a non-gaap basis, with 18.3% organic growth. the mix of new business was once again weighted more toward subscription arrangements, which represented approximately 52% of the total number of new deals and approximately 54% of new contract value signed this quarter. over the last five years, the percentage of new saas business has continued to rise. and 2019 was the first year in which subscription arrangements made up more than 50% of the total contract value of new software deals, finishing at 63% for the year.
this new business mix shift has put pressure on short-term revenue growth. if the mix of new business in 2019 have been similar to 2018, we estimate that 2019 revenue growth would have been approximately 160 basis points higher. as the trend toward greater cloud adoption continues to grow in our market, we are actively working with amazon web services teams under the strategic collaboration agreement with aws that we announced in october. we're currently refining road maps for optimizing tyler products for the cloud and for transitioning certain clients hosted in our data centers to aws.
gaap subscription revenues grew 34.3%, and non-gaap subscription revenues grew 32.7%. total recurring revenues from maintenance and subscriptions grew 22.7% on a gaap basis and comprised 67.2% of total revenue. although the mix of new business in the fourth quarter was weighted more toward subscription arrangements, software license and royalties revenue reached a new quarterly high at $32.4 million, an increase of 25.3% over q4 of 2018, driven by strong sales in our public safety and micropact units. the total value of new contracts signed in the fourth quarter for new world public safety was more than double than last year's fourth-quarter signings.
also, as we discussed last quarter, there were several significant micropact deals that were signed by our partners in the third quarter, but the related contracts with tyler were signed in q4 and contributed to this quarter's license growth. bookings in the fourth quarter were particularly robust at approximately $331 million, up 33.5% over q4 of 2018. even excluding micropact, bookings were up approximately 26%. bookings growth was primarily driven by the number of new deals, particularly midsized deals rather than by very large deals.
and our largest new contract was just under $9 million. we signed 314 new software contracts in the quarter, a new record. for the full year 2019, we signed over 1,100 new software deals, approximately 44% more than last year. our six largest saas deals of the quarter, each had total contract values of greater than $3 million.
two of these were for odyssey court case management solution, an $8.7 million contract with franklin county, ohio, the largest court system in the state; and a $3.6 million contract with jefferson county, texas. with the jefferson county deal, we now serve courts in all of the 20 largest counties in texas. we also signed two large multi-suite saas contracts that each included our munis erp, energov civic services, executime time and attendance and socrata data insight solutions. one with the city of oxnard, california valued at $8.3 million and the other with the city of o'fallon, missouri, for $4.7 million.
in addition, we signed two large saas contracts with clients in florida for our energov civic services solution, a $6.3 million contract with st. johns county and a $5.6 million agreement with the city of west palm beach, which also included our socrata data & insight solution. our five largest on-premises license deals for the quarter, each had total contract values greater than $3 million. the largest was a multi-suite contract valued at $5.1 million with the city of lawton, oklahoma, which included our munis erp, energov civic services, new world public safety and socrata data & insight solutions.
the two largest license contracts for our micropact entellitrak solution were a $4.3 million contract for the puerto rico vocational rehabilitation administration and a $4.2 million contract for the u.s. department of veteran affairs, vocational rehab and employment agency. we also signed a $4.2 million license arrangement with the city of coral springs, florida for our munis, energov and executime solutions as well as a $3.5 million contract for our new world public safety solution with the city of jackson, mississippi, which is the largest public safety contract ever for new world. i'd also like to highlight a contract with the north carolina administrative office of the courts that we announced earlier this week.
the contract, which was signed in the first quarter of 2020, is a 10-year $14.5 million saas agreement to provide our brazos electronic citation solution for over 500 law enforcement agencies state wide. it's a great example of our ability to expand existing client relationships through the unmatched breadth of our product suites. this latest contract builds upon our largest saas deal ever, an $85 million statewide contract for our odyssey court case management solution in north carolina, which was signed in june of 2019. as a point of reference, when we acquired brazos in 2015, brazos had annual revenues of approximately $10 million.
as a result of the investments we've made in the brazos products and organization and their integration into tyler, we now generate approximately $17 million in annual revenues from brazos, and this latest single contract is 1.5x their total revenues at acquisition. now i'd like for brian to provide more detail on the results for the quarter and provide our annual guidance for 2020.
brian miller -- chief financial officer
thanks, lynn. yesterday, tyler technologies reported its results for the fourth quarter ended december 31, 2019. i'm going to provide some additional data on the quarter's performance and provide our annual guidance for 2020, and then john will have some additional comments. in our earnings release, we've included non-gaap measures that we believe facilitate understanding of our results and comparisons with peers in the software industry.
a reconciliation of gaap to non-gaap measures is provided in our earnings release. we've also posted on the investor relations section of our website under the financial reports tab, schedules with supplemental information provided on this call, including information about quarterly bookings, backlog and recurring revenues. gaap revenues for the quarter were $288.8 million, up 19.4%. on a non-gaap basis, revenues were $287.4 million, up 18.3%.
organic revenue growth rose from the third quarter of 2019 to 10.6% on a gaap basis and 10.2% on a non-gaap basis. our core software license and subscription revenues combined grew organically 18.3%. subscription revenues for the quarter increased 34.3%. we added 164 new subscription-based arrangements and converted 18 existing on-premises clients, representing approximately $74 million in total contract value.
in q4 of last year, we added 81 new subscription-based arrangements and had eight on-premises conversions, representing approximately $33 million in total contract value. subscription contract value comprised approximately 54% of total new software contract value signed this quarter compared to 40% in q4 of last year. the value weighted average term of new saas contracts this quarter was 4.4 years compared to 4.1 years in q4 of last year. revenues from e-filing and online payments, which are included in subscriptions, increased 25.5% to 200, i'm sorry, to $21.7 million.
that amount includes e-filing revenue of $14.7 million, up 12.8% over last year and e-payments revenue of $7 million, up 65%. for the fourth quarter, our annualized non-gaap total recurring revenue, or arr, was $769.9 million, up 21%. non-gaap arr for saas arrangements for q4 was approximately $235 million, up 35.6%. transaction-based arr was approximately $87 million, up 25.5%, and non-gaap maintenance arr was approximately $448 million, up 13.7%.
our non-gaap operating margin increased sequentially 10 basis points from 25.6% in the third quarter to 25.7% in the fourth quarter, that declined 110 basis points from last year's fourth quarter. the year-over-year decline reflects two major factors: our increased investment in r&d and the lower operating margins from acquisitions completed in the last two years, which are also receiving significant investments that affect their near-term profitability as they are integrated into tyler. our r&d expense in the fourth quarter increased 22.1% from last year, that was essentially flat sequentially from q3. we believe the level of investment in emerging revenue streams like e-payments, existing products and recent acquisitions well positions us as we continue to focus on competitiveness and future growth while making progress toward improving margins.
our backlog at the end of the quarter reached a new high of $1.46 billion, up 16.9%. backlog included $407 million of maintenance compared to $365 million a year ago. subscription backlog was $606 million compared to $480 million last year and includes approximately $118 million related to fixed fee e-filing contracts. as lynn noted, our bookings for the quarter were very strong at approximately $331 million, an increase of 33.5% from q4 of last year.
for the trailing 12 months, bookings were approximately $1.3 billion, up 32.3%. our software subscription bookings in the quarter added $12 million in new annual recurring revenue, up 52.5% over last year's $7.9 million. for comparison, if all of our new subscription contracts had been under license arrangements, we estimate that they would have represented additional license revenue of approximately $16 million. cash flow from operations rose 7.5% to $76.2 million, while free cash flow declined by 0.5% to $66.5 million.
for the full year of 2019, cash flow from operations increased 1.8% to $254.7 million. free cash flow declined by 4.5% to $212.7 million, mainly due to an increased level of capital investments related to expansions and renovations at several of our office facilities. we ended the quarter with $314 million in cash and investments and no outstanding debt. our guidance for the full year of 2020 is as follows: we expect 2020 gaap revenues will be between $1.204 billion and $1.224 billion, and non-gaap revenues will be between $1.205 billion and $1.225 billion.
we expect 2020 gaap diluted eps will be between $3.81 and $3.93 and may vary significantly due to the impact of stock incentive awards on the gaap effective tax rate as well as the final valuation of acquired intangibles. we expect 2020 non-gaap diluted eps will be between $5.60 and $5.72, of which approximately 55% to 60% is expected to be generated in the second half of the year. for the year, estimated pre-tax noncash share-based compensation expense is expected to be approximately $77 million. we expect r&d expense for the year will be between $92 million and $94 million.
fully diluted shares for the year are expected to be between 41.5 million and 42.0 million shares. gaap earnings per share assumes an estimated annual effective tax rate of 10% after discrete tax items, includes approximately $31 million of estimated discrete tax benefits related to share-based compensation, which may vary significantly based on the timing and volume of stock option exercises. our estimated non-gaap effective tax rate for 2020 is 24%. we expect our total capital expenditures will be between $36 million and $38 million for the year, including approximately $9 million related to real estate and approximately $7 million of capitalized software development costs.
total depreciation and amortization is expected to be approximately $80 million, including approximately $54 million of amortization of acquired intangibles. now i'd like to turn the call back over to john for his comments.
john marr -- chairman
thanks, brian. we're pleased with our fourth-quarter performance as we finished the year and the decade on a strong note. from a historical perspective, when we started the decade, our revenues were $290 million, with less than 50% of those recurring. our stock price was $20.05, and our market cap was approximately $700 million.
we finished the decade with revenues of more than $1 billion, of which 67% are recurring, a stock price of more than $300 and a market cap of approximately $12 billion. we're proud of our progress over the last 10 years and especially appreciative of our extremely talented team of more than 5,400 employees whose efforts are crucial to the success of tyler and our clients. we're even more excited about the opportunities ahead of us as we build on our strengths to expand our markets and drive toward $2 billion in revenues. our robust bookings in 2019, and particularly in the fourth quarter are indicative of our competitive strengths as well as an active marketplace.
we expect to achieve double-digit organic revenue growth into 2020 and to show significant progress toward returning to the margin expansion trajectory that we achieved through most of the last decade. although r&d expense is expected to increase approximately 15% in 2020, the rate of growth is significantly below that of the last two years and includes our increased investment in cloud technologies as we continue to work in partnership with aws to accelerate our move to the cloud as well as increased investment and expanding our revenue streams for payments. finally, tyler was recently named for the second consecutive year to the forbes best employers for diversity list. acceptance and inclusiveness are important attributes of our company culture, and we're honored to be recognized for this diversity.
now kate, we'll take questions.

[operator instructions] your first question comes from peter heckmann with d.a. davidson. please go ahead.
peter heckmann -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
morning. thanks for taking my question. brian, could you talk a little bit about bookings for the quarter and the year? and just if you have it, a constant term comparison? i know that at least in the second quarter, the term, the average term is a little bit longer.
brian miller -- chief financial officer
yes. the average term of new software subscriptions in the fourth quarter was 4.4 years. last year in the fourth quarter, it was 4.1 years. so that change would have had, had we had the same term as last year, our bookings growth would have been 32.3% this quarter.
so there were that mix, although, as we've talked about, we've driven the average term length down over the last couple of years, leading with a shorter initial term. we still do some contracts that are five years. and the way the mix fell out this quarter is a little bit higher.
peter heckmann -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
ok. yes, so not much difference on a quarter-over-quarter basis. we assume it would be about the same, just a small difference in year-over-year growth for the full year '19?
brian miller -- chief financial officer
that's correct.
peter heckmann -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
ok. and then just payments has been growing really, really nicely. can you just remind us some of the areas that are contributing to that?
lynn moore -- president and chief executive officer
yes, sure. pete, this is lynn. payments is something that we've been doing for some time now. i'd say, in 2019, we've really taken a hard look at it and looked at the market and started thinking that this is really a potential strategic driver for us.
as you know, it's transactional business. it's online transactions, it's credit card fees. it's things, for example, in our utility billing solutions, our tax, our courts, our payments for permitting and licensing, community development, parks and rec, miscellaneous payments. so historically, we've done a little bit of that.
we're consolidating that internally in tyler under a business unit and putting some investment and focus on that this year. and i do believe it's a stream that we're excited about in the future. i think it's something that you're going to see it grow and something that we can really capitalize on. but i think it was john's comment, it is something that will require a little bit more investment this year, as we bring all these various applications across these business lines together, work on a consistent ui and id and stuff like that, but not long-term investments, but investments that will occur this year.
peter heckmann -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
right. i appreciate it.

the next question is from jonathan ho with william blair & company. please go ahead.
jonathan ho -- william blair and company -- analyst
hi. congratulations on the strong bookings quarter. i just wanted to start out, just trying to understand if there was anything abnormal in 2019 in terms of the pipeline? or as we look at 2020 and start to sort of contemplate the bookings activity and pipeline there, it's a sort of a sustainable level that you guys are seeing?
brian miller -- chief financial officer
i don't believe there's anything abnormal about the pipeline in 2019 as opposed to the pipeline we go into 2020 with, obviously, in the middle of the year, we had those two very large contracts, particularly the $85 million saas deal in north carolina. but we've continued to see strength as we mentioned on the call or on the comments earlier, it really wasn't, fourth quarter didn't have any mega deals in it. it was a lot of solid mid-range deals and a high volume of deals. certainly, we're seeing more volume of deals from the acquisitions we've made over the last couple of years, and micropact had a very strong fourth quarter as well as public safety.
but we're very confident in the competitive position of both of those products. and as we've talked about in the past, that often there's a period of investment after acquisitions and after that we start to see the impact of leveraging our sales organization, leveraging our customer base. and we're certainly seeing that with public safety at this point. so i think we go into the year of 2020 with a strong pipeline.
and but nothing particularly unusual about the market activity or the pipeline as we finish 2019.
jonathan ho -- william blair and company -- analyst
got it. and then as we sort of look at the public safety performance in the fourth quarter, can you talk about what made the most difference in terms of the investments? and maybe compare and contrast the opportunities that you could target and win rates relative to maybe last year?
lynn moore -- president and chief executive officer
yes, jonathan, i think we've talked about this for several years now, the investments we've been making at public safety, and part of it too is as we talk a lot of these things take time. we've had a lot of success over the last couple of years, both in sales, but then actually starting to implement and getting those customer references. those investments are paying off. i think we mentioned the number of licenses in the q4 of this year were more than double of last year.
same thing with number of new names. there's just a lot of momentum going on in the marketplace right now and really validates our strategy. but it's also a testament to the work those that the folks at public safety have been doing. we talk a lot about the reputation of business.
and there's been a lot of work going on. it takes time. we talk about it's slow moving, but it starts gaining momentum. and i think we're starting to see that.
and so it's investments, obviously, in cad, we've got some big projects coming out with our e-records. but a lot of the new stuff we've been doing, for example, around mobility and things like that, that's really put us sort of the cutting-edge in the public safety market right now. so we're excited to get those big deals. we've talked about how we're moving up market and getting larger deals.
we've also starting to, similar like we do with courts a couple of years ago, we talked about franklin county and how we were making inroads into ohio. we're seeing some of that in public safety. we're just starting to crack into some markets they hadn't cracked into before. and also, i'd say, leveraging the inside sales channel, leveraging other products, bringing brazos along, we mentioned a lot in oklahoma deal, where we're partnering with other sales teams at munis and sort of leveraging the whole tyler, total tyler concept has really been resonating with the public safety customers.
jonathan ho -- william blair and company -- analyst
thank you.

the next question is from rob oliver with baird. please go ahead.
rob oliver -- baird -- analyst
great. good morning. thank you for taking my question, guys. lynn, one for you.
clearly, some early success here with new subscription offerings from you guys over the past year, and that's been a pivot, we've seen that number grow nicely. i'm curious, the pace of conversions more than doubled, albeit still off of a really small base. i'm just curious how you guys think about that conversion side of the story versus selling new subscriptions? how you are thinking about it from a go-to-market perspective, if you're thinking about approaching clients earlier than the renewal point of their contract? and then, as you look at your pipeline of renewals over the next couple of years, how you think about that? and then i just had one quick follow-up for brian. thanks. 
lynn moore -- president and chief executive officer
yes. sure, rob. i mean you're right. we've talked about it.
the market continues to tend to shift toward saas. as we look at conversions, it is something that we're thinking about and mapping out plans, that obviously also lines up with our strategic collaboration with aws. i don't know that we'll necessarily have a significant acceleration of that planned in the near term, but it is something that we are looking at. stepping back, our relationship with aws, we are trying to modernize our products.
we do recognize the shift, but there still is a piece of the market that is still focused on on-prem, and we want to make sure we don't lose that as we go through this change and recognize the shift in the market.
rob oliver -- baird -- analyst
great. and then, brian, just for you quickly. you guys obviously are coming off this period, the last couple of years, where you had elevated r&d growing around 30-ish percent. it looks like it's going to be up 15% this year.
so seeing that moderation that i think you spoke about, i know john mentioned in his comments that you guys would be sort of returning to that margin growth again. is that, i'm not sure if i missed it, if there's a time line on that. so are we then assuming that this trajectory now you've established of that r&d growth moderating will continue beyond this year without giving specific guidance?
brian miller -- chief financial officer
yes, i think that's a correct assumption. our r&d guidance is up around 15% from this year from '19, which is about half the growth rate that we've seen in the last two years. actually, if you look at the run rate that we exited q4 with, the 2020 r&d is only up about 10% from that q4 run rate. so it is moderating.
the r&d around our products, existing products is flattening. we've sort of grown into that level. lynn talked about some of those investments we've made in public safety, broadly across our product lines. so most of the incremental r&d is around the acquired companies, emerging revenue streams like payments and our optimization of our products for the cloud.
so we talked about sort of growing into this higher level of r&d and seeing that moderate, and i think you'll continue to see that. from a margin perspective, i think the midpoint of our guidance for next year implies roughly flat margins with 2019 after a couple of years of declines, mostly driven by the increased r&d and the acquisitions. and i think we would expect to see that improves, lead toward improved margins as we move out of 2020. but certainly, getting back on that trajectory of margin improvement that we've historically seen is a key part of our long-term model.
lynn moore -- president and chief executive officer
rob, if i could add to that. i think, historically, we've taken a pretty balanced approach to investing in growth and focusing on margin expansion. and we've talked about in the last few years about the elevated investments, and as brian mentioned, growing into those and potentially redeploying some of those. it is a focus on us to look at margin expansion opportunities.
but at the same time, i want to be careful to also recognize that when we see market opportunities out there, marketing opportunities, either a new or emerging revenue stream like tyler payments, changes in the competitive landscape, either see some weakening of some competitors or we see some opportunities with some competitive advancements in our products or shifts in the market as we continue to move to the cloud and we think about modernizing our apps, which we think over time will also lead to margin expansion. we will continue to take advantage of those opportunities. i just want to make sure that, that's also set out there.
rob oliver -- baird -- analyst
yes. that makes a lot of sense. thanks guys very much. appreciate it.
operator
the next question is from kirk materne with evercore. please go ahead.
kirk materne -- evercore isi -- analyst
thanks very much. congratulations on the nice end to the fiscal year. maybe john or lynn, if you guys could just talk a little bit about the broader market? obviously, you service a market that doesn't exactly move on a dime in terms of technology trends, but the number of deals and the velocity of deals, i think, this quarter was really impressive major deal from a bookings growth perspective. so are you just reaching a much broader audience of deals at this point in time? or how do you see sort of your end market, is that picking up? i'm just trying to get a sense on how much of this is sort of the market may be picking up a little bit in terms of spending? and then how much of this is you being able to sort of go after a much broader set of opportunities? thanks. 
lynn moore -- president and chief executive officer
yes. sure, kirk. i'll start and let john jump in. from my perspective, as brian mentioned, the market and the pipeline are solid.
i wouldn't say that there's been any material change in the last quarter or two on some level. i think it's a little bit of validating some of our investments. we've been increasing our competitive position. we've been doing things both internally with builds and through acquisitions.
we're out there executing really well in the market. there still continues to be a lot of activity that's outside of rfp. i don't know that that's anything specific to the market as so much as our internal performance and validating, again, our prior r&d investments.
john marr -- chairman
yes, i think that's right. i would say that, kirk, it's more attributable to our addressable market space. so we continue to try to broaden the breadth of products we have through organic builds as well as the acquisitions we've done, the size and range of clients that we're competitive with. so some of our products were competitive in certain size, cities or communities, and we've broadened that.
public safety would be a good example, as we announced in this one of the largest deal ever. in terms of market size, the only thing i'd say that's a little different, and again, more of it's attributable to what we're addressing in the marketplace. some of these companies that we competed with pretty recently are maybe becoming a little more legacy and their attrition is accelerating to some degree. so some of the better competitors we've had over the last 10 years, i think, are seeing significantly higher attrition rates than what we experience in most of our products.
and those are really good opportunities. those are the right-sized cities and counties and districts that we look for. and as they come back in the marketplace, that those are really good opportunities for us.
kirk materne -- evercore isi -- analyst
and then just one last one for you all. and i realize it's too early in terms of the aws relationship. but as you think about sort of the technology shift toward aws as your infrastructure platform. did you have any thoughts on how that might inform your thought process around m&a? meaning are you be able to build perhaps a little bit faster if you have a little bit more flexible infrastructure? would it slow you down from buying some of the companies you bought, if they would have to be ported over? i'm assuming it's maybe too soon for you guys to have really definitive view on that, but i'd be curious if that's come up at all as you guys think about sort of build versus buy over the next couple of years?
john marr -- chairman
interestingly, some of the acquisitions we've done already, they already had maybe more comprehensive relationships with aws. so it will work both ways. there could be some acquisitions that aren't as cloud oriented or have other facilities that they're using, but aws is a big player. so a lot of the acquisitions we do are obviously smaller companies than us.
they don't have their own clouds. they generally hosted somewhere else. and aws is a place where many of them may already be hosted. so it will work both ways, but in a lot of cases, the target companies are aws customers.
kirk materne -- evercore isi -- analyst
that's helpful. thank you.
operator
the next question is from scott berg with needham & company. please go ahead.
scott berg -- needham and company -- analyst
thanks for taking my questions. congrats on a very strong quarter. i guess, i can't remember who said it, i think it was john in the pre-scripted remarks that you expect organic revenue growth to remain in the double-digit range here in 2020. i guess, can you unpack that a little bit? and i asked the question relative to assumptions around mix on new deals that are subscription or license.
usually, we see a company as they tilt stronger toward subscriptions, revenue growth kind of decelerates or is a little bit lower because of the rev rec impact of the shifting transaction mix.
brian miller -- chief financial officer
yes. and i think that the midpoint of our guidance implies and certainly the upper point implies double-digit growth, just a little north of 10%. the lower end of the guidance range would be a little bit below that. i think the organic implied range is roughly 9% to close to 11%.
there's a couple of things. now licenses are well under 10% of our total revenues. so the impact, as more of our businesses become subscription driven over the last few years, is less significant. i think we're starting to see some of the contribution from some of our recent acquisitions, which generally we expect to grow above tyler's core organic growth rate.
and also as some of our subscription arrangements that were longer-term arrangements entered into in prior years start to come up for renewals and see increases in those, that also helps contribute to the growth. so there are a number of factors there. the exact mix of new business between saas and license is difficult to estimate, often customers make that decision late in the process. so even with deals that have happened this quarter, there are a few that we're not certain which way they're going to go.
but generally, i'd say, the assumption is that the mix of subscriptions will be a little bit higher in 2020 than it was in 2019. but again, 2019 was skewed a bit by the very large deal in north carolina. and we continue to see a mix in those larger deals that's weighted even generally a little bit more heavily toward license deals, although that's changing over time. so there are a number of factors that go into that growth rate.
but it clearly is accelerating a bit from what we've seen in 2019.
scott berg -- needham and company -- analyst
very helpful. and then for from follow-up perspective, just trying to think about the model with the increasing payments and transaction mix going forward, even though it's a small change. but can you remind us what the kind of the gross margin profile is on those more transactional revenues? and just trying to understand if that's maybe a tailwind or headwind for margins as it becomes a greater mix of the business going forward? thanks. 
brian miller -- chief financial officer
so i think it's certainly a tailwind for margins over the long term. those transactional margins, we don't really break them out completely. but the margins on those are well above our blended overall margins, particularly when we get any start-up costs associated with a new contract behind us. but those would be margins, i think, on a payments arrangement or a e-filing arrangement that's at scale, that fully implemented, those margins would be well above our blended overall margins.
operator
the next question is from charlie strauzer of cjs securities. please go ahead.
unknown speaker
good morning. this is brendan on behalf of charlie. so i just want to ask, looking at the r&d beyond just this year. do you see an inflection point where you get operating leverage on that line? or is there just too many opportunities right now and you think, at least for a while, you'll be, i guess, outgrowing your top line with r&d or similarly? and then another, the second question with new world, obviously, a really strong quarter with public safety, and really exciting that you got the jackson contract.
is there any other progress going on with moving upmarket beyond the jackson deal? thanks. 
brian miller -- chief financial officer
with respect to r&d, yes, i'd say, beyond 2020, as lynn said, we sort of reserve the right to adjust our investments to address market opportunities, competitive opportunities and to take advantage of those over the long term. but generally, we would expect that we continue to see more leverage in r&d after this period of elevated investments over the last couple of years, and 2020 certainly shows progress toward that. in the public safety area, one of the goals of the increased investments we've made in that product at new world over the last couple of years was to position ourselves to have the features and functionality to compete for larger opportunities. and we've seen some evidence of that this year going live in orlando, florida, a jurisdiction that has more than one million calls for service through its 911 system each year.
and now the jackson deal being the largest deal in new world's history. but we're still kind of in the early stages of that. these are long sales processes. and it's only been within the last year that we've really been in a position to start to respond to those larger rfps.
so we would expect there to be meaningful opportunities ahead for us to continue to pursue larger deals in the public safety area and to be successful there.
lynn moore -- president and chief executive officer
and i think the follow-on, the public safety thing is a big result of that is the fact that we've really got a competitive offering across a full suite of public safety solutions. so as we continue to build out and bring additional solutions to market as well as leverage other pilot products, for example, in jackson, it's not just cad and records, but it's fire records. it's our mobile solutions. it's tyler corrections that we've been investing in.
it's our brazos offering. it's socrata. so when you're able to compete in those larger jurisdictions when you have a fuller suite of competitive offerings.
unknown speaker
thank you, guys. appreciate it.
operator
[operator instructions] the next question comes from keith housum of northcoast research. please go ahead.
keith housum -- northcoast research -- analyst
can you just remind me in terms of the ads agreement in terms of any impact on r&d? is there a time where the investment to put everything to the cloud is going to, i guess, peak? and how long will that period last out of the additional investments to get out and over into the cloud?
lynn moore -- president and chief executive officer
yes, keith. so as we talked about over the last year, while there are already some initiatives going on within tyler, part of what the aws agreement did was, it's helping us move there across all our product suites together. and we're still finalizing some of those product road maps. we're obviously making already starting to make some investments on those.
the timing of those are going to take, it's going to take a couple of years. these things aren't going to happen overnight. at the same time, we're still going to be investing our competitiveness, but we're also evolving the back end architecture to make them more cloud efficient. so i wouldn't put a specific time line on it right now, but it's not 12 months, but it's not five years, it's somewhere in between.
keith housum -- northcoast research -- analyst
ok. appreciate it. and just a follow-up, i hope i'm not getting too granular here into the guide. but a look at the software licenses, gross margins over the past year or two, actually, those have come down a little bit.
how do you think? i guess what's happening there that would cause it to come down? and how should we think about the gross margins, the software licenses business and royalties next year?
brian miller -- chief financial officer
i think some of the change in the margins there is around the amortization of software, the allocation of purchase price of acquired companies to software. so typically, when we acquire someone, part of their purchase price is allocated to the acquired software and that amortization, which is generally over five years or less, is expensed as part of the cost of software. so given the elevated level of acquisitions we've had over the last couple of years, that's driven that up a bit. so i would expect -- these costs are not incremental costs, but they stay at the same level.
so i'd expect that as -- in software licenses, we probably expect to see something like mid-single-digit growth in those next year. and so you probably see margins be similar to this year, including the amortization.
keith housum -- northcoast research -- analyst

please note that all growth comparisons we make on the call today will relate to the corresponding period of last year, unless we specify otherwise. lynn?
lynn moore -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, brian. we had a very solid first quarter with a great deal of momentum going into the second half of march when we began to see the effects of the covid-19 pandemic. the market was active, and we executed at a high level. this was our 34th consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth as gaap revenues grew 11.9% and non-gaap revenues grew 11.3%.
organic revenue growth was 6.4% for gaap revenues and 5.7% for non-gaap revenues. our court software revenues from licenses and subscriptions grew 12.1% on a non-gaap basis, with 8.3% organic growth. we continue to experience an increasing preference among clients for our cloud offerings as subscription arrangements represented 73% of new contract value signed this quarter. of course, this puts pressure on short-term revenue growth but generates higher revenues and margins over the long term.
gaap subscription revenues grew 21.5% and non-gaap subscription revenues grew 20.5%. subscription revenue growth has now exceeded 20% for 11 consecutive quarters and 52 of the last 57 quarters. total recurring revenues from maintenance and subscriptions grew 17.1% on a gaap basis, and comprised approximately 71% of total revenues. it was another extremely strong quarter for bookings, which were up 39.8%, our second consecutive quarter of greater-than-30% bookings growth.
our two largest saas deals of the quarter led the way. both were follow-on contracts with the state of north carolina administrative office of the courts. the first was for our new odyssey e-warrant solution and was valued at approximately $24 million. the second contract, which we noted on our last earnings call, was for our brazos e-citation solution valued at approximately $14.5 million.
both of these 10-year saas agreements expand on the relationship with north carolina that started with our largest saas agreement ever, an $85 million contract signed last june for our odyssey case management and e-filing solutions. and they demonstrate our ability to grow our client relationships across our broad portfolio of integrated solutions. we signed two other saas deals in the quarter that each had a contract value of greater than $6 million, one with dupage county, illinois, for our iasworld appraisal solution, and one with the city of richardson, texas, where a multi-suite arrangement for our munis erp, executime time and attendance and energov civic services, incode courts and socrata data and insights solutions, takes full advantage of our connected communities vision. we also signed five new saas arrangements with contract values greater than $3 million.
four of those deals were for our munis erp solution with the cities of merced, napa and palm springs, all in california, as well as napa county, california. the fifth was with the south carolina department of education for the first statewide implementation of our versatrans school transportation solution. our largest on-premises license deal in the quarter was a $6.3 million contract with beaver county, pennsylvania for our iasworld appraisal solution which also included appraisal services. we continue to widen our market share lead in the california court case management market with a $4.4 million on-premises license contract with contra costa county for our odyssey solution.
we also signed a $2.7 million license arrangement with l.a. county for our energov civic services solution. now, i'd like for brian to provide more detail on the results for the quarter, and then we'll move to a discussion of covid-19.
brian miller -- chief financial officer
thanks, lynn. yesterday, tyler technologies reported its results for the first quarter ended march 31, 2020. in our earnings release, we have included non-gaap measures that we believe facilitate understanding of our results and comparisons with peers in the software industry. a reconciliation of gaap to non-gaap measures is provided in our earnings release.
we've also posted on the investor relations section of our website under the financial reports tab schedules with supplemental information provided on this call, including information about quarterly bookings, backlog and recurring revenues. gaap revenues for the first quarter were $276.5 million, up 11.9%. on a non-gaap basis, revenues were $276.8 million, up 11.3%. organic revenue growth was 6.4% on a gaap basis and 5.7% on a non-gaap basis.
our court software license and subscription revenues combined grew organically 8.3% on a non-gaap basis. subscription revenues for the quarter increased 21.5%. we added 131 new subscription-based arrangements and converted 19 existing on-premises clients, representing approximately $101 million in total contract value. in q1 of last year, we added 128 new subscription-based arrangements and had 13 on-premises conversions, representing approximately $49 million in total contract value.
subscription contract value comprised approximately 73% of new -- total new software contract value signed this quarter compared to 54% in q1 last year. the value weighted-average term of new saas contracts this quarter was 5.9 years compared to 4.1 years in q1 last year, with the increase caused by the two large 10-year contracts with the state of north carolina mentioned earlier. revenues from e-filing and online payments, which are included in subscriptions, increased 14.7% to $22 million. that amount includes e-filing revenue of $14.9 million, up 1.7% over last year, and e-payments revenue of $7.1 million, up 56.7%.
for the first quarter, our annualized non-gaap total recurring revenue, or arr, was $785 million, up 16.2%. non-gaap arr for saas arrangements for q1 was approximately $239 million, up 22.8%. transaction-based arr was approximately $88 million, up 14.7%, and non-gaap maintenance arr was approximately $458 million, up 13.3%. our backlog at the end of the quarter reached a new high of $1.5 billion, up 19.2%.
backlog included $369 million of maintenance compared to $353 million a year ago. subscription backlog was $668 million compared to $489 million last year and includes approximately $128 million related to fixed fee e-filing contracts, including our e-filing contract with the state of texas, which was extended for one year through august of 2022 during the quarter. as lynn noted, our bookings were very strong again this quarter at approximately $319 million, an increase of 39.8% from q1 of last year. for the trailing 12 months, bookings were approximately $1.4 billion, up 3.7 -- up 37%.
our software subscription bookings in the quarter added $12.6 million in new annual recurring revenue, up 10.7% over last year's $11.4 million. for comparison, if all of our new subscription contracts had been under license arrangements, we estimated that they would have represented additional license revenue of approximately $20 million. as a reminder, our bookings comparison in the second quarter will be a very tough one, irrespective of the impact of covid-19. last year's second-quarter bookings were a record $452 million and included our largest contract in history, the $85 million saas contract for the north carolina courts, as well as a $20 million saas contract with bexar county, texas courts.
cash flow from operations more than doubled to $56.7 million and free cash flow quadrupled to $46 million, primarily due to strong collection of receivables. during the quarter, we repurchased 58,804 shares of our stock for a total of $15.5 million or an average of approximately $263 per share. we ended the quarter with $393 million in cash and investments and no outstanding debt. now, i'd like to turn the call back over to lynn for the discussion on the impact of, and our responses to the covid-19 pandemic.
lynn?
lynn moore -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, brian. in response to the ongoing covid-19 pandemic and its effect on the economy, i want to share information on how tyler technologies is approaching this challenge and its impact on our business. first, our operational response. tyler's nearly 5,500 team members continue to provide a high standard of client service with minimal disruption.
our primary focus has been on ensuring that our employees and their families are safe and healthy while supporting clients who provide essential services to the public. most of our offices already had many staff members with normal workdays involved for both work environments. beginning in mid-march, we transitioned quickly to work from home for all of our staff, equipping our employees to continue their work uninterrupted and also curtailed travel for our employees. our clients faced increasing disruption to their operations as they dealt with the effects of the pandemic on their communities and focused on providing vital services to their citizens.
in march, we began seeing delays in some procurement processes, and finalizing some existing contract awards became logistically more difficult. some implementation appraisal service projects were also delayed as clients were grappling with balancing local shelter in place and social distance orders while conducting daily operations. trade shows, where large numbers of vendors and prospective clients gather in person, were scheduled -- or rescheduled or canceled. we are addressing the challenges imposed by the covid-19 pandemic by adapting the way we do business, using web and video conferencing extensively for collaboration, conducting sales demos, providing client support and delivering professional services such as training remotely and even executing complex go-lives virtually.
with the spread of covid-19, our clients' need for digital connectedness, both within the organization and directly with the public, is rapidly shifting from a vision to an urgent requirement. in recent weeks, we have seen many examples of our team members working with our clients to adapt to the current environment in truly inspiring ways. i'd like to highlight a few examples. san bernardino county, california pulled off a completely virtual go-live of our odyssey court case management system by pivoting to our remote command center model.
the go-live would ordinarily have involved a number of tyler team members traveling to be on site. in response to the covid-19 pandemic, we accelerated the launch of our new virtual court solution and are offering it without charge for 90 days in order to help court clients serve their constituents without interruption. since the official launch last month, more than 60 courts have selected this solution to handle cases remotely, removing the burden of having defendants physically appear in the courtroom while also broadening access to justice for disadvantaged or displaced defendants. the new york state division of veterans affairs deployed our entellitrak solution in under a week, so its staff could continue to improve claims remotely, ensuring that veterans in the state will continue to have access to benefits.
numerous law enforcement agencies optimize their new world computer-aided dispatch tools to flag calls for service where someone might be a covid-19 carrier, allowing officers to take necessary precautions. school districts are using tyler's traversa ride 360 app, temporarily offered free of charge, to assist with parent communications during the crisis and are using our school bus routing software to plan meal deliveries to families in need. the superior court of san luis obispo, california, worked with tyler teams over a single weekend to customize its odyssey guide and file solution. so, domestic violence complaints could be filed online while shelter-in-place orders are in effect.
numerous cities are using our my civic app to provide up-to-the-date covid-19 information to residents. i couldn't be prouder of how our dedicated professionals have embraced the challenge and are excelling at meeting the needs of our clients. i'm constantly inspired by the spirit, resilience and compassion shown by our team members. with that backdrop, i'd like to make a few general comments about the financial impact of the pandemic on the quarter and the rest of 2020 as well as provide some thoughts on the long-term outlook and prospects for tyler.
while not material, the pandemic and the response by clients and prospects did affect first-quarter results. as i mentioned previously, a few sales pushed out of the first quarter, and professional services revenues, including billable travel, were also negatively impacted. we also canceled our annual user conference, tyler connect, which was scheduled to be held this week in orlando. the costs associated with that cancellation, approximately $727,000, are included in our first-quarter results.
we estimate that the total revenue impact of covid-19 in the first quarter was approximately $6 million. as we look out over the rest of 2020, we anticipate a greater impact from covid-19 in the second and third quarters. while we have not seen meaningful cancellations, we continue to see delays in procurement processes and lengthening sales cycles as public sector entities focus on issues related to pandemic. although the cares act provided approximately $424 billion in economic aid to state and local governments and additional stimulus packages are expected to provide more assistance, many of our clients will face near-term budget pressures.
we can deliver the majority of our professional services remotely, but we expect to see lower services revenues as some projects are delayed by client availability. in addition, a number of courts have limited operations during the pandemic which will impact transaction-based e-filing revenues during this period. in addition to these core revenues, approximately $6 million of revenues classified as hardware and other revenues will be eliminated in the second quarter as a result of the cancellation of our connect conference. billable travel will also be impacted significantly in the second quarter, but should return as states begin to transition back from shelter in place to more normal operations.
while some of these variable revenue streams will continue to be impacted by the current environment, we anticipate that recurring revenues which comprise approximately 70% of our total revenues, will not be significantly affected. we expect to continue to invest in product development and accelerating our move to the cloud at levels consistent with our initial plans for the year. we value the experience and expertise of our employees and do not expect to eliminate any positions, but anticipate that incremental hiring will be reduced somewhat from our original plans. we also expect to see reductions in some expenses, including travel and entertainment, trade shows and health claims.
as we remain confident in our long-term outlook, there are significant short-term uncertainties around the continuously evolving covid-19 pandemic and its impact on our operations and those of our clients. for example, government response to the pandemic will continue to vary significantly from state to state and even from jurisdiction to jurisdiction within a state, thereby making the duration and scope of business restrictions within the public sector difficult to predict. as a result, we are suspending our guidance until such time as we have more clarity around the ultimate severity, duration and impact of the pandemic. i expect to have more clarity on the impact of covid-19 through to our 2020 financial performance during our second-quarter earnings call.
while our near-term outlook remains clouded by some uncertainty, given our high percentage of recurring revenues, it's my current expectation that tyler revenues will still grow in the mid-single digits during 2020, with relatively flat operating margins compared to last year. as i look out beyond the uncertainties created by the pandemic, i am as confident as ever in tyler's long-term outlook and prospects. tyler's fundamentals have never been stronger. tyler has endured trying times in the past, including y2k and the dot-com bust, 9/11 and the great recession.
each time, we emerged as a stronger company with an improved competitive position. unlike certain industries, the pandemic has not changed the underlying fundamentals and long-term demand for our software and services. tyler exclusively serves the public sector, including local, state and federal government. our clients will not go out of business, and the solutions we provide are essential, whether managing revenue that keeps communities operating, ensuring public safety to help the most vulnerable or providing transparency and access to government for the residents of the jurisdictions they serve.
our software manages mission-critical functions, such as 911 dispatch, courts, property taxes, utilities and payroll. often, our clients are acquiring solutions to replace aging systems that are at end-of-life and maybe unreliable or unsupported. replacing those essential services is generally a high priority, regardless of the economic environment. if anything, the current crisis is already highlighting the reliance on outdated technology by large segments of the public sector.
you likely have seen recent news around issues related to some of these decades-old cobol-based systems. long-term opportunities will emerge from this crisis as both tyler and our clients reexamine historical business practices. for example, work-from-home postures further highlight the need and benefits of connectivity and cloud services, something we have been actively investing in and are continuing with our strategic collaboration with aws. clients will continue to appreciate the value of data and being connected with others, with other departments and jurisdictions as well as its citizens.
this is our connected communities vision, a vision that only tyler can execute. clients may become more willing to accept remote delivery of services, something they've been more reluctant to do in the past. doing so makes our employees even more productive and efficient. and our ability to deliver uninterrupted high-quality support during these uncertain times only further strengthens our bonds with clients and reinforces tyler's messages of both agility and stability.
as i mentioned earlier, tyler has endured challenging times in the past and emerged stronger than before. today, we believe we are even better positioned to weather an economic slowdown. recurring revenues comprised approximately 70% of our total, including newer transaction-based revenue streams like e-filing and online payments. our competitive position in win rates are stronger than ever.
and we have significantly expanded our total addressable market through investments in a combination of m&a and research and development. and technology is increasingly critical factor in helping government function effectively, especially in difficult times. our financial position is also the strongest it's ever been with zero debt, nearly 400 million in cash and investments and substantial additional liquidity available through our $400 million undrawn credit facility which can be further expanded through an accordion feature. as a result, we are able to continue to invest at a high level in all of our long-term strategic initiatives, something that companies with highly leveraged balance sheets or start-ups lacking the stability of highly recurring revenue base may not be able to do.
our ability to actively invest during the great recession was one of the key differentiators that strengthen our overall market position when demand inevitably returned. we will continue to do the same during this crisis. we recognize this is an evolving situation. tyler is fortunate to have a deep and broad base of knowledge and domain expertise across our employee group, which is approaching the situation with compassion and good humor.
i am confident we will see our way through these unusual circumstances, with the spirit of cooperation, integrity and service that has been the hallmark of our company from the beginning. i can't be more proud and excited to be part of tyler than i am now. now, i'd like to turn the call back to john for his comments.
john marr -- chairman
thanks, lynn and brian. obviously, a little different call than usual and a lot of information to digest. before we take your questions, i'd like to reinforce a few of the highlights. first, i want to add my recognition and appreciation to the entire tyler team as well to the strong leadership that lynn and his executive team have provided.
we deliver and support a lot of great technology, but the true value of tyler exists in our 5,500 incredible employees. these professionals are what differentiate tyler from all other players in this space. lynn and brian provided a lot of data points in detail. i'll just add one of my own anecdotal observations.
nearly every day for the past month, i would drive through the parking lots of the two larger facilities here in maine, where normally, there would be 500 or 600 cars. i need to admit, after seeing this company grow to this level over the past 20 years, it can be a little discouraging to see nearly completely empty parking lots. but then as i talk to our leadership team, i'm told that the dev and r&d projects are on schedule. customer support issues are being handled and closed with better-than-normal response times, and go-lives continue to move forward.
as lynn has been saying, it's not only impressive, it's inspiring. from early in the morning until literally midnight or past there, thousands of tyler employees are tunneled into the network and cranking out the work. these people have lives, children homeschooling, spouses working, some of them in the healthcare profession in their own commitments. one interesting fact is that the highest network activity is late at night, eight, 10, 12 o'clock.
literally hundreds, sometimes thousands, are online, getting the work done after the other challenges of the day have been satisfied. it's incredible to witness. it's also gratifying to know that we have a business model, a strategy, and we're in a position where these jobs are secure and tyler will only grow stronger. yes, we will be impacted in the short and, likely, medium term.
as you've heard, sales cycles will lengthen, our ability to travel to customer sites will have an impact, and there will be some incremental pressure on government budgets at all levels. but the fundamentals that we are built on aren't changing. everything we do is centered around essential enterprise applications. our customers will survive and will rely on technology even more to recover.
they're still going to run payrolls, manage courts, dispatch first responders, appraise properties and on and on. for now, there is some uncertainty. but tyler will grow this year, will be profitable, will strengthen an already strong balance sheet, and most importantly, we'll execute on all the key strategic and competitive initiatives. this simply won't be true for most of our competitors.
smaller start-up types don't have the financial strength. many of our competitors are pe-owned and saddled with significant debt, limiting their investment flexibility. for other horizontal players, this isn't their first or highest priority, and they'll have to make difficult decisions. i'm not suggesting there won't be other good competitors on the other side of this thing.
there always will be. but i'm certain that tyler will be stronger on the other side. whatever negative impact may occur over the next couple of quarters, it's just timing. if a decision to replace a system is delayed, that's all it is, delayed.
we saw this in the great recession with a slow year, 1.5 years, and then a very robust recovery. it's a net-zero game. and when those deals come back online, i'm confident our win rates will only be higher. now, brent, we'll take questions.

[operator instructions] our first question will come from kirk materne with evercore. please go ahead.
kirk materne -- evercore isi -- analyst
thanks very much, and thanks for all the information today. and hope you all are well. i guess, maybe for lynn or john. and john, you sort of referred to the great recession.
and i was kind of curious, obviously, your customer base is fairly unique. and correct me if i'm wrong, but i think a lot of the budgeting process maybe happens over the course of the summer as new fiscal year budgets are set. so, when do you think you'll have a little bit more maybe insight as to how project planning might get impacted by the uncertainty brought on by covid? is this something you might have a little bit more visibility on by the end of the summer as budgets are set, or is this something that is frankly just a totally open-ended question mark at this point?
john marr -- chairman
yeah, it's hard to know, kirk. some of the some of the budget years are actually different around the country. some people go out, do their due diligence, go through a selection process and then go to finance committees for their funds. others get the money appropriated and know they have it and then execute the process.
so, it will be a little bit all over the place. that's, obviously, why we suspend guidance. as we've said, 70% of our business is recurring. we don't see it to be affected in any meaningful way.
and a lot of the other 30% comes out of backlog and is pretty essential and has to occur, and so you end up with a small piece of our business. it's important to us, but it's a little less predictable at this point in time, and we'll just kind of have to see how things unfold. as i've said, and what we experienced in the great recession, was the deals that got pushed, they all occurred. back then, we actually had a flat revenue year.
i think we're negative of million dollars, the only time it's ever happened. and then, we had several very strong years following that. so, it's really just a shift in the timing. if they need new systems, they simply need them, and they will replace them.
but i think the next few quarters will be hard to see other than the brackets, in our case, are on a small percentage of our business that's at risk, and the vast majority of it stays in place.
kirk materne -- evercore isi -- analyst
yeah. that all makes sense. and maybe just in terms of -- and i realize it's still early and this is fluid, but just maybe in terms of your conversations with customers right now in terms of maybe their propensity to think more about sort of subscription models in terms of maybe some of the capex savings versus opex? i guess, did the state and local government sort of think in that same way that a lot of the commercial companies do in terms of capex savings versus opex spend? and does that help or bring about, i guess, maybe an even faster transition toward subscription? i realize it's still early, but just curious to how you guys think that's going to maybe pull out.
john marr -- chairman
i think the bigger driver from this incident is just the availability of technology. so, with everybody working from home, with the citizen and partner-facing applications, much of that is just much more reliable in the cloud. so, some of these people on legacy systems that are hosted in city halls, county offices, courthouses, it's been much more difficult for them to provide that kind of access in a reliable fashion. and partnering with somebody that runs a modern technology, advanced cloud system gives them far greater flexibility.
so, i think that will be the bigger driver to accelerate the move to the cloud.
kirk materne -- evercore isi -- analyst
ok. great. i'll turn it over to others. thanks for your time and stay safe.
operator
our next question will come from scott berg with needham. please go ahead.
scott berg -- needham and company -- analyst
hi, john, lynn and brian thanks for taking the questions. i guess, first question was you talked about some of the single fees with the great recession in 2008. john, you just mentioned the expectation that deals are timing-related component. but what's different about today versus 2008? give the full guidance and some of the uncertainties through the different commentary suggesting that maybe the visibility of the business is a little bit different than 2008 or 2009.
i guess is that, a, the right rate? and b, is there any other differences that you would call out today?
lynn moore -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, scott. i think obviously, one of the clearest examples, the difference between '08, '09 and today is the speed of the shutdown and the impact. as john mentioned earlier, back then, after coming out of the great recession, we had a year where we were essentially flat, maybe even a little down in revenues, but that wasn't until 2010. the impact on the economy was a little bit slower.
here, we, obviously, have a much more forced self-imposed closure. so, i think the compression of the effects may be a little bit stronger, still hard to know. i do think, as we said earlier, our q2 and q3, we're going to learn a little bit more. we're going to learn a bit more as we go into some more budget cycles.
but i would say, the speed of the compression and any associated lag may be a little shorter. the other -- another difference for us, personally, and one of the things that makes me even more positive today is the position that tyler is in today versus where we were 12 years ago. we talk about our balance sheet, we talk about our cash position. you go back to 2008, 2009, our balance sheet was a lot different story.
we probably had somewhere around only $10 million in cash and probably about an equal amount in debt. and today, we're in a different position. our recurring revenues, as a model, i think, back then were less than half of our overall revenues. today, they're approaching 70, 71%.
we've been investing back then. one of our biggest initiatives was to invest during that time. we've been doing that leading up to that. so, a lot of the investments we've been making are prime to be coming online and poised to take -- really take a position of where we are when we come out of this.
so, at a high level that's what i'd say the difference. and there certainly are some similarities, but it's certainly not identical. it gives me a lot of comfort to know that this company has been through that, being able to talk with -- obviously, i was here, part of this team, but we've got senior leaders up and down the management team who were part of this company, who led it through there. it gives us confidence in what we've done in the past and what we can do in the future.
and that's really something that's great to lean on. it's good to be able to lean on each other and know that we're on the right course.
scott berg -- needham and company -- analyst
got it. quite helpful. and then, from a follow-up perspective, both in the press release and on the call here, you all called out the impact of some of the -- your ability to deliver professional services. some of it clearly can be moved remotely, but you've had a decent amount that's been delivered on-premise, with the customer over the last multiple years.
is -- can you help quantify maybe what that impact looks like in the short term, or is it still just too difficult to be able to maybe ascertain in terms of the impact of -- in the quarter?
brian miller -- chief financial officer
scott, this is brian. well, there are a couple of pieces to it. one, we're delivering the vast majority of our services remotely. and as we've mentioned earlier, we are seeing customers who typically just expected that those things would be on site, even if we had the ability to do it remotely, that they're certainly now more flexible about it.
i'd say we're probably delivering somewhere around 85% of what we would have planned. and there's also a little bit of short-term adjustment as customers also aren't all in one place to be able to accept some of the training or services. so, i think that will continue to moderate as we go through this longer. one of the other factors is that included in services revenue is a significant amount of billable travel, something on the order of $5 million a quarter of revenues that we recognize that are effectively little to no margin on those, but certainly affect our revenues.
so, they're grossed up on our income statement. and we've seen that go to just about zero. and again, we don't know exactly how rapidly that travel will resume. but likely, some services will permanently be delivered remotely.
and from an efficiency standpoint, a utilization of our staff standpoint, that's a positive. but it will have an effect on -- negative effect on revenues, positive effect on margins.
scott berg -- needham and company -- analyst
great. helpful. thanks again.
operator
our next question will come from peter heckmann with d.a. davidson.
peter heckmann -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
hey, good morning. thanks for all the information. just a little follow-up on the following guidance in some of your commentary around maybe a more likely range for revenue growth. your prior guidance was calling for 11 to 13% growth.
and if i heard you correctly, you said maybe mid-single digit might be more likely. when we think about that, i mean, is there a reasonable chance that the nonrecurring portion of revenue could be down for the year versus prior expectations?
lynn moore -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. so, peter, as we said before, there's a little bit of uncertainty right now. there are still deals going forward. what we see is particularly deals that are in their later stages are going forward.
we talked earlier, scott was asking about implementation services, same thing. those that are more in the middle of the projects versus the beginning of the projects are continuing. what we see right now, that's sort of our best guess for the rest of the year. we met with management last week, as we do every quarter.
we had them really give us their best guess on the impact of covid on their particular business units. and it varies a little bit from business unit to business unit. our business units recognize revenue differently. some are more poc-based, some work out of backlog, some are a little more dependent on quarterly license sales.
but we met with them. we talked with them. we had them present what they considered sort of bear case, bull case and best case. and we, as a management team, got together and said, this is sort of where we think we're going to land.
as we said in my earlier comments, i'd expect you to have a lot more clarity at our q2 conference call, and i'd probably like to reserve until then to make much more detail on that.
peter heckmann -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
ok. ok. and then, just a follow-up. i didn't hear you say it.
but brian, look like the average term on subscription deals was up a little over 50%. can you talk about year-over-year growth of bookings on a constant-term basis?
brian miller -- chief financial officer
yeah. if the term had been the same, bookings growth for the quarter would have been right at 20%. there were -- as we mentioned, there were two large--24 and a $14 million saas deals, both with the state of north carolina, that were 10-year deals, consistent with our 10-year court case management deal there. if you've taken those two deals out, the average term would have been about 4.3 years on all the rest of the contracts.
but yeah, it would have been right at 20% without -- if the term had been the same as last year's q1.
peter heckmann -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
got it. i appreciate the feedback. thanks.
operator
our next question will come from matt vanvliet with btig. please go ahead.
matt vanvliet -- btig -- analyst
good morning. thank you for taking the question. i guess, i wanted to dig in a little bit on some of the dynamics of the bookings through the quarter, through april and what the pipeline is looking like and sort of what the sales forecast or maybe shaking out on sort of a three-, six-month basis. but looking at what your sales teams are focused on, has there been a greater focus on contacting existing customers where you have the relationship and getting more response rates and sort of seeing what you can do from sort of the virtual and work-from-home type elements with those customers? are you seeing traction on new customers? just curious on what the focus has been there.
and then, across the product platform, are you narrowing your focus for the next couple of months on specific areas that are allowing more e-filing, allowing more remote contact, or do you -- are you continuing to see sort of a broad-based approach to the sales leadership?
lynn moore -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. thanks, matt. so, i guess, initially, you talked about pipeline, and i just want to reiterate our comments that we made earlier. there may be a slight demand in pause, but there's no real fundamental change in our industry demand.
and right now, we don't really see a change in our pipeline. but although we do recognize there will be delays, we really haven't seen any meaningful cancellations. as it relates to sales, it varies a little bit. as i said, some processes that were already well down the road, those are continuing.
we are doing remote demos, which is a little more different. in fact, we just finished one last week and received an award after 13 hours of doing the virtual remote demos. still a little bit new. some of the things we talk about internally.
we talk about what are things -- mitigation things and steps that we can make, but also what types of opportunities are out there. one of the things i think tyler has always been really good about is while keeping their discipline, also staying opportunistic. and some of the things you're talking about are some things we're talking about. we do believe that this will help accelerate the move to the cloud.
so, you see our sales people will start talking about that. they'll start promoting cloud, and they'll start promoting our flips. we will put more emphasis on our mobile solutions, things like in our public safety, mobility, even our payments and things like my civic. you talk about messaging.
i think there was a question earlier, this is a really good opportunity to really sort of start honing our message on roi. i mean, it's something that we know internally, but may not have always been a top priority for some of our customers. so, i think some of those things we're doing. and again, the impact of sales is sort of -- you talk about reaching out to clients.
sometimes, as i mentioned in my earlier comments, just -- there are some logistical difficulties right now because you have work-from-home environments. but we've talked about those messages and make sure that we're going to be equipped for when things return to normal.
matt vanvliet -- btig -- analyst
great. and then, as you talk about unlikely to have to remove any positions, but maybe hiring gets pulled back a little bit. are there specific areas where, in the near term, you're focusing on reducing hiring versus previous plan, or is it just a general pause now to sort of reassess over the next weeks and months of where business is picking back up and where the focus is from a hiring perspective?
lynn moore -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. so, i would say, the message i've sort of given to the team is cautious optimism. we need to see how things play out, but we -- that's not to forget the optimism part. we already had made some significant hires this year as part of our plans.
as we've mentioned before, we're going to continue to invest in our long-term strategic initiatives. and so, all those debt projects are going to keep going. and when you step back and you look at potential projects being delayed and things like that, there may be some slight pause in hiring some of those services components. but overall, we're committed to our workforce.
we're committed to running a business in such a way that our current employees won't be impacted. we will continue to do some hiring. as the year unfolds and when we start seeing return to normal, you'll start seeing some of that hiring again.
brian miller -- chief financial officer
and just to give you a little perspective, our plans for the year going into the year were to add about 500 net new heads. so, we have a fair amount of flexibility there, levers to pull with respect to the timing and the volume in there. but as lynn said, most likely on the professional services and implementation, where we, i think, had plans to hire a couple of hundred people during the year, that there'll likely be adjustments to that hiring, reflecting the change in more of that being delivered remotely and delayed.
matt vanvliet -- btig -- analyst
great. thanks for taking my questions. hope everyone stays safe and healthy.
operator
our next question will come from keith housum with northcoast research. please go ahead.
keith housum -- northcoast research -- analyst
good morning, guys. i'm just trying to reconcile the commentary in terms of deals being pushed off and the ability to maintain the operating margins. is it really that a function of the fact that perhaps your hiring is just not going to be as great? i guess the concern here is that your revenue is not going to grow as much as you had anticipated.
brian miller -- chief financial officer
i think that the biggest factor there is, yes, there'll be less hiring. and so, there'll be your expenses there. there are some offsets to expenses, particularly travel expense. we mentioned health claims are down significantly and travel, t&e.
i'd say the other big thing is that a lot of the revenues that are being reduced are our lowest margin revenues. i mentioned billable travel, which has almost no margin. the professional services, as you know, are very low-margin revenues for us. and even removing connect, we mentioned, will take $6 million of revenues out of q2, but that had no margin associated with it.
so, the higher-margin revenues, the subscriptions, some of the transaction-based revenues, those are growing nicely. so, the change in the profile nets out to something we believe we can still maintain flattish margins with last year, which was the expectation as we came into the year.
keith housum -- northcoast research -- analyst
got you. that's helpful. and then, i guess as you try to think into like 2021, is there a concern that the budgetary pressures are being felt now by the local agencies is that this could carry over into a multiyear, i guess, headwind?
lynn moore -- president and chief executive officer
well, i think that's a possibility. as john alluded to earlier, there's different ways that projects are funded. there's different budget cycles. there are significantly still a lot of funding resources.
one of the things that people tend to forget or may not emphasize is that the -- of all the funding sources, property taxes are still probably the major funding source for state and local government, really for local government -- excuse me, for counties and cities. they comprise an overwhelming proportion of revenues as opposed to, say, sales tax. if you look at sales tax revenues, which are generally considered to be down, those comprise more of around 7% of a budget for a county or city. i also expect that there will be some more funding coming from the federal government.
i think you may have seen earlier this week that the fed announced that it was broadening the number of local governments from which it would allow them to buy debt form. originally, they had talked about doing things for counties that were only $2 million and up, and that's been reduced to populations of 500,000 cities to 250,000. but there will be some impact. and i think if our experience in the great recession was, i mentioned earlier, the impact was really felt a little bit later.
in my response to comments earlier, i think the thing about this is that there may be a little bit more compression in that impact. but again, i think we'll have a little bit more clarity as we get through the year, particularly as we get through q2, see the impact, see what's happening as the states and local jurisdictions are returning to work. and then, we'll -- i think we'll be in a lot better position to answer that question.
keith housum -- northcoast research -- analyst
great. thank you.

our next question will come from jonathan ho with william blair. please go ahead.
jonathan ho -- william blair and company -- analyst
hi. good morning. i guess, just going back to your comments around past crisis and the opportunity to maybe invest, where do you see maybe the most opportunity to do so this time around?
lynn moore -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, jonathan, it's a good point. i think one thing i want to emphasize is something that we've talked about for the last couple of years which we have been -- we have already been investing at an elevated level. we've done that for a number of reasons. as i've mentioned earlier, these projects, to me, that's an opportunity that we have initiated those elevated investments across the board.
i think you're going to continue to see us invest in our cloud initiatives. those are not going away. and if anything, we may try to accelerate some of those. all the things that we've been talking about that are long-term strategic initiatives, we're going to continue to keep doing.
and then, we'll continue across the broad base of our products. but again, i anticipate that this crisis will accelerate, further accelerate both the receptiveness and willingness as well as the move to the cloud. and i think we're going to continue to invest there heavily in the next couple of years.
jonathan ho -- william blair and company -- analyst
got it. and then, just as a quick follow-up. are there potentially any projects that maybe get pulled forward or emergency buying for things like virtual courts or my civic? i just wanted to see if there's any maybe new demand that could come out of this that's unexpected.
lynn moore -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, we have a number of success stories out there that i would consider some quick responses from some of our divisions. we talked about virtual courts. we talked about what was going on in public safety. and i think we're seeing some of that.
we have had a couple of deals where some local governments have tapped into emergency funding. i wouldn't say it's a significant number, but we've seen a little bit of that.
jonathan ho -- william blair and company -- analyst

rob oliver -- baird -- analyst

you guys have to be extremely pleased with the follow-on, the sizable follow-on wins in north carolina. and i was just wondering if we could get a little bit more color on those. and then, obviously, in the near term, there'll be some uncertainty, but to the extent to which you guys are able to template your success in north carolina and port that to other states, would love to hear more. and i have one follow-up.
lynn moore -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. thanks, rob. yes, north carolina has been a real success court story for us. and you're right, we're very excited.
we talked about it last summer when we announced the north carolina courts deal. one of the things we specifically talked about was some of the potential upside sale opportunities. we called out brazos in particular. we spent a lot of time talking about the brazos e-citations deal, i think, in the q4, really great deal, largest deal really in brazos history, running in aws.
it's a great story. shifting gears to something that we haven't talked a lot in detail as much is these odyssey e-warrants. and again, this is a really great story. this is for a lot of reasons.
our odyssey e-warrants is really all about -- it's the electronic transmissions of warrant applications between police officers in the field and a judge who may be sitting in courtroom or maybe at home at night. these are things that are time-sensitive, potentially middle of the night, evidentiary matters, maybe drawing blood on someone at a dui accident, or doing something that's really of a time-sensitive nature. this was a legacy product that didn't, say, north carolina had. they talked with us about it.
and we said, hey, we can build that. and they trusted us. they're building on that relationship. it's 100% cloud-based built in aws.
it's going to be spun up very quickly. targeted go-live is actually next year. we expect to have about 49,000 users. it's just a great -- it's a great story, and it really further evidences our connected communities vision as we realize that it's -- you're connecting the agencies, you're connecting the police agencies with the courts.
do you think it could be a differentiator, not only on our court side, but also on our public safety side. so, it's a really good opportunity. it's something that i'm extremely excited about. as you said, it builds on that earlier big contract with the state of north carolina.
to your question about it being a little bit broader, i think the e-warrants opportunity in north carolina, it's a nice statewide opportunity, i think, as you look out. i don't know that as you go to other jurisdictions. it will be -- it will really be on a statewide basis. i think you'll see a lot more deals more locally at the county level.
you'll see things in some of our larger clients. so, nobody else has this out in the market. i think it's something that's exciting as we look forward.
rob oliver -- baird -- analyst
and then maybe going back to the first question that kirk materne asked. obviously, your customers are showing a greater appetite for subscription. you guys have been kind of consistently beating the subscription number. and i know, as john said, short and medium term, we're likely to see impact here from covid.
but as we all go back and try to look for patterns and comparisons, and we go back to '08, and that flat to slightly down year you guys had, obviously, that was a perpetual license model at that point and tough to get people to make big purchases. just wondering if you could perhaps speculate on how the trajectory might be different and if there's any early signs that that subscription buying could help change the trajectory out of this downturn this time. appreciate it, guys.
lynn moore -- president and chief executive officer
well, you raised a good point. we were in a lot different model back then in 2008, 2009, and certainly, as we go back to even, say, the 9/11 or y2k. i think coming around 2009, i think tyler's subscription revenues were only about 17 million a year. today, we're north of 300 million, which is, obviously, a different situation.
the trajectory, as we talked about, was a little bit delayed there. the impact was a little bit longer-lasting. but as you looked out a couple of years, i think past -- as past the recovery, i think tyler's revenue growth was more in the 18% range. so, the question is, how quick does that come? as we talk a lot of times as we move -- as we continue to move more to a subscription model, it's, obviously, a lot better long term.
it won't have necessarily the same pop in the short term. but as john's comments mentioned earlier, we feel really confident about our ability to be positioned to get an overwhelming piece of our share of the business is this pent-up demand, and i believe we'll return as we get on the other side of this.
operator
our next question will come from tyler wood with northland securities. please go ahead.
tyler wood -- northland securities -- analyst
thanks for taking our question. just one for me. you mentioned last quarter a public safety win with orlando and kind of your optimism there with large cities. can you give us an update on that? maybe how the pipeline looked at that high end of the market in q1 before things ground to a halt? and then just more generally, a little bit of color on your thinking around the covid impact, and how it will vary between those larger tier 1, tier 2 cities versus smaller local cities?
lynn moore -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, sure, tyler. it's interesting. i talked earlier about different business units. we've talked about that sometimes in the past as to how their customer base may be -- may or more -- may not be more or less receptive to certain things.
i would say, in q1, of all of our business segments, the public safety probably was impacted a little bit more than our others, and primarily because the market they serve is first responders and they're extremely focused on really more pressing local needs. we did spend a lot of time at the last call talking about the momentum in the market. that momentum is there. it's real.
there are a number of large opportunities. i can say that a couple of them have been pushed. but as you look and we track, and what we've tracked over the last several years is we track our ability to move up market, larger deals, larger license deals, deals in excess of 1 million, approaching 2 million, but also the size of the customer in terms of calls for service as we approach go over 500,000 to approaching 1 million. and those opportunities are continuing to be there.
we did have to see some delays there. i think we also saw, in the public safety areas that that customer base was probably a little bit more reluctant in the first quarter and sensed to accept remote delivery of services. but in terms of overall demand and our ability to fill that demand, we're as confident as we were last quarter. the investments we've made are paying off.
we're continuing to invest in those products. we continue to do things that we've talked about, like mobility that are going to only make our products even that much more available or more desirable.
tyler wood -- northland securities -- analyst
thanks. that's all for me.

[operator instructions] our next question will come from joe goodwin with jmp securities. please go ahead.
joe goodwin -- jmp securities -- analyst
hey, good morning. thanks for taking my question. i just had a question around how are you guys thinking about m&a in this environment? and then maybe if you could provide some color around the m&a pipeline and what that's looking like and kind of what's happening there.
lynn moore -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, sure, joe. i think, generally, i'd probably just want to step back and just sort of look at what we've done historically and sort of our approach. our approach has always been to be very opportunistic. we've, obviously, done a lot of acquisitions.
i think we talked last year, we had done about eight since 2018. and last year, we sort of taken the approach of a little bit of a deliberate pause, i would say, as we need to really integrate those acquisitions and make some investments and refine some product strategies. i think coming out of last -- coming out toward the end of last year, our approach was -- would have returned to what i consider a more normal approach which is something that we continually look at, continue to look for opportunities. in recent years, we've talked a lot about the fact that it's been tough to do acquisitions, which is one of the reasons why we've done -- increased our r&d spend.
that's been for a number of reasons. there has been some hyper-inflated valuations by sellers, a lot of bidding by pe firms. as i look out forward, i think we're going to continue to be opportunistic. i do think there's going to be an opportunity out there.
i think the current environment may create some additional opportunities. we may see opportunities where we may have a few more motivated sellers. some of their valuations may become more in line with what we think are reasonable, some of the competition for some of these deals, which in the last several years have been pe firms. we've talked about the leverage that they've got on their balance sheets and the issues that this pandemic may cause for them.
so, we may be able to compete a little bit better on our terms as we have in the past. it's been part of our history. we're going to continue to be opportunistic, and i'd expect that to continue as we go forward.

operator
hello, and welcome to today's tyler technologies fourth quarter 2020 conference call. your host for today's call is lynn moore, president and ceo of tyler technologies. [operator instructions]
i would now like to turn the call over to mr. moore. please go ahead.
h. lynn moore -- president & chief executive officer
thank you, grant, and welcome to our call. with me today is brian miller, our chief financial officer. as you've seen, in addition to our fourth quarter earnings, we made another very significant announcement this morning. so, we have a lot to talk about today. i'd like to point out that we posted on our investor relations website and filed with our 8-k, a presentation on the acquisition and we'll refer to some of those slides later in the call.
first, i'd like for brian to give the safe harbor statement. next, i will have some preliminary comments on our fourth quarter results and brian will review the details. after that, we'll return to our announcement today of our agreement to acquire nic inc. i'll have some comments on the proposed acquisition and then we'll take questions.
brian k. miller -- executive vice president-chief financial officer
thanks, lynn. during the course of this conference call, management may make statements that provide information other than historical information and may include projections concerning the company's future prospects, revenues, expenses and profits. such statements are considered forward-looking statements under the safe harbor provision of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties which could cause the actual results to differ materially from these projections. we'd refer you to our form 10-k and other sec filings for more information on those risks. please note that all growth comparisons we make on the call today will relate to the corresponding period of last year unless we specify otherwise. lynn?
h. lynn moore -- president & chief executive officer
thanks, brian. our team executed well in a challenging environment during the fourth quarter, and we concluded 2020 with solid earnings and record cash flows. recurring revenues, which comprise 75% of our fourth quarter revenues, were strong led by a 17% growth in subscription revenues. however, software licenses and services revenues continue to be pressured by longer sales cycles and delays in projects as clients deal with the effects of the pandemic, along with the near elimination of billable travel.
our revenue mix and cost efficiencies contributed to 120 basis point expansion of our non-gaap operating margin to 26.9%. cash flow has been very robust throughout the year. and both cash from operations and free cash flow ended the year strong and grew 16.5% and 25.8%, respectively. this was our highest fourth quarter and full year cash flow ever, and for the year, free cash flow grew 53.6% to $326.6 million.
bookings for the quarter were relatively flat with the prior year at approximately $333 million. our largest deal of the quarter, which was also the largest single contract in our history, was a five-year extension of our e-filing arrangement with the texas office of court administration valued at approximately $98 million. the extension also included e-filing insights, a socrata-based interactive reporting layer that eliminates hundreds of hours of manual reporting activities and gets clerks in all 254 counties, the ability to monitor 50,000 daily filings, so they can identify bottlenecks inefficiencies and improve the experience for the public. however, due to certain contract provisions, only a very small portion of the value of this contract was included in backlog and bookings. if the entire value of this contract have been included in backlogs, bookings growth for the fourth quarter would have been approximately 28%.
our largest new saas deal in the fourth quarter was with jackson county, missouri for our iasworld appraisal and tax solution as well as appraisal services valued at approximately $18 million. other significant contract signed this quarter included a multi-suite license arrangement for our munis erp, energov civic services and socrata data insights solutions with the commonwealth of the northern mariana islands valued at approximately $5 million, saas agreements with the city of jacksonville, florida for energov civic services solution and with stark county, ohio for our public safety solutions, each valued at approximately $4 million. and 10 saas deals and three license contracts for various tyler solutions, each valued at over $1 million.
brian will discuss our guidance for 2021, but i'd like to update you on some of our plans surrounding our strategic initiatives to accelerate our move to the cloud. our 2021 plan includes accelerated and new cloud investments across the spectrum of our products. our plan includes approximately $23 million of investments in cloud product development in 2021 and a total investment of more than $52 million over the next three years, with the majority of that expensed. as a result of these investments, we expect by the end of 2023, all of our major applications will need [phonetic] to be cloud native or cloud efficient for deployment at aws.
we've also made some organizational changes, some of which were announced earlier this week to focus additional leadership on our cloud initiatives as well as streamlining internal technology and security operations and driving other technology efficiency objectives.
now i'd like for brian to provide more detail on the results for the quarter.
brian k. miller -- executive vice president-chief financial officer
thanks, lynn. this morning tyler technologies reported its results for the fourth quarter ended december 31, 2020. in our earnings release, we have included non-gaap measures that we believe facilitate understanding of our results and comparisons with peers in the software industry. a reconciliation of gaap to non-gaap measures is provided in our earnings release. we've also posted on the investor relations section of our website under the financial reports tab schedules with supplemental information provided on this call, including information about quarterly bookings backlog and recurring revenues.
our revenues continued to be impacted by the covid-19 pandemic, gaap revenues for the quarter were $283.3 million, down 1.9%. on a non-gaap basis, revenues were $283.4 million, down 1.4%. software license revenues declined 46%, reflecting both extended sales cycles and a very high mix of subscription deals at 73%. software services revenues declined to 18%, as some projects slowed as a result of covid-19. and our shift to remote delivery of most services also resulted in a $5 million decline in billable travel revenue.
on the positive side, subscription revenues rose 17%. we added 118 new subscription-based arrangements and converted a quarterly high of 50 existing on-premises clients representing approximately $73 million in total contract value. in q4 of last year we added 164 new subscription-based arrangements and had 18 on-premises conversions, representing approximately $74 million in contract value.
subscription contract value comprised approximately 73% of total new software contract value signed this quarter compared to 54% in q4 of last year. the value weighted average term of new saas contracts this quarter was 3.5 years compared to 4.4 years last year. revenues from e-filing and online payments, which are included in subscriptions were $24.6 million, up 13.3%. that amount includes e-filing revenue of $15.5 million, up 5.1% and e-payments revenue of $9.1 million, up 30.6%.
for the fourth quarter, our annualized non-gaap total recurring revenue or arr was approximately $850 million, up 10.4%. non-gaap arr for saas arrangements for q4 was approximately $278 million, up 17.9%. transaction-based arr was approximately $98 million, up 13.3% and non-gaap maintenance arr was approximately $474 million, up 5.8%. our backlog at the end of the quarter reached a new high of $1.59 billion, up 9.4%. as lynn noted, our bookings in the quarter were relatively flat at $333 million. for the trailing 12 months, bookings were approximately $1.3 billion, down 1.3%, against a tough comparison that included the two large north carolina courts deals totaling approximately $105 million in the prior trailing 12 months.
if the full amount of the texas e-filing extension had been included in our backlog, q4 bookings would have grown 28% and trailing 12 month bookings would have grown 5.8%. our software subscription bookings in the fourth quarter added $11 million in new annual recurring revenue. the bookings growth rate was also affected by the shorter average term for new subscription contracts.
as it was throughout the year, cash flow was robust in the fourth quarter as cash from operations increased 16.5% to $88.8 million and free cash flow grew 25.8% to $83.7 million. we ended the quarter with approximately $758 million in cash and investments and no outstanding debt. our earnings release has the full details of our 2021 guidance, which excludes the impact of nic and any other acquisitions, which may be completed during the year. we expect to update our guidance to include the nic transaction after it closes.
with regard to revenue and earnings, we expect 2021 gaap and non-gaap revenues will both be between $1.190 billion and $1.220 billion, representing a range of growth from 6.6% to 9.3%. we expect 2021 gaap diluted eps will be between $4.03 and $4.21 and may vary significantly due to the impact of stock incentive awards on our gaap effective tax rate. we expect 2021 non-gaap diluted eps will be between $5.65 and $5.77, representing an increase of 2.4% to 4.5%. fully diluted shares for the year are expected to be between 42.5 million and 43 million shares.
as we look ahead to 2021, it's clear that we won't be back to normal for some time. we've said on prior calls that we anticipate that the impact of covid-19 would continue into 2021 and our plan for this year anticipate this ongoing uncertainty. nonetheless, we're excited about our opportunities to accelerate revenue growth and achieve our margin objectives for this year. revenue growth while below our normal targets is expected to be significantly above the 2020 level.
just to refresh your memory, as we entered 2020, our guidance was for non-gaap revenue growth of approximately 10% to 12%, and for margins to be relatively flat with 2019 with an expectation of resuming our margin expansion trajectory in 2020. covid-19 obviously resulted in the 2020 performance that was very different from our initial guidance as we finished with low-single digit revenue growth and 150 basis points of non-gaap operating margin expansion.
we've talked before about how some of the factors that led to margin improvement in 2020 are sustainable while others are not. those factors include a favorable change in our revenue mix from a decline in low margin revenues like professional services and billable travel as well as cost savings in areas like travel, marketing and employee healthcare. i'd like to point out a few of the factors that are expected to impact our margins this year.
employee healthcare expense will have a significant impact on operating margins in 2021. during 2020, we saw an unexpected decline in our healthcare costs as the pandemic curtailed elective surgeries, checkups and much of our employees' non-urgent healthcare, and our net health claims expense per employee declined 8.4% for the year. as those costs returned to normal pre-pandemic levels in 2021 coupled with inflation, we are expecting an increase of approximately $13 million or 21% over the reduced level in 2020.
also our diluted share count is expected to be 575,000 to 1.1 million shares higher than in 2020. we issued approximately 1.3 million shares under our stock compensation plans in 2020, including 1.2 million shares from the exercise of stock options granted in previous years. our higher stock price also impacts the dilution calculation. if our diluted share count in 2021 was the same as 2020, our non-gaap eps guidance would be about $0.18 higher. as a reminder, beginning in 2018, we began a shift in our long-term incentive equity to a mix of options restricted stock units and performance stock units. as that shift continues, we anticipate a significantly less dilutive impact of long-term stock incentives going forward.
our guidance implies operating margins that are modestly below the 2020 level, but above our 2019 operating margins. that trend is generally in line with the trajectory we targeted at the beginning of 2020 and if we achieve our plan, we will finish 2021 with margins in line with or above what we would have expected pre-pandemic. so, to conclude, our 2021 plan reflects a solid combination of organic revenue growth and strategic growth investments especially around our cloud transition.
now i'd like to turn the call back over to lynn.
h. lynn moore -- president & chief executive officer
thanks, brian. as i look back on 2020, i marvel in how our team of professionals performed in the extraordinary environment of the last few months. we were laser focused on continuing to take care of our clients' needs as we always do, while taking care of each other at the same time. and while our financial results certainly weren't what we expected at the start of the year, we adapted to the new realities of the pandemic with very good results. as i've said numerous times during last year, i couldn't be prouder to lead our incredible company and its people. while 2020 presented a myriad of challenges, we view many of those challenges as creating opportunities that tyler is well positioned to take advantage of.
our financial position is stronger than it was a year ago with more than $800 million in cash and investments and no debt on our balance sheet today. we've been able to continue to invest in, and in some cases accelerate all of our long-term strategic initiatives and they are all on track. as a result, our competitive position has also continued to strengthen. we believe the pandemic will further accelerate the public sectors move to the cloud. and we are in great position to support that move.
our client base is large and diverse with more than 27,000 implementations and it represents our greatest asset for both future sales opportunities and the dependable revenue stream it produces. and we have a deep and experienced management team that has weathered difficult economic times in the past. all of these factors make us confident that we are exceptionally well positioned to capitalize as markets return to normal.
with that, i'd like to turn to this morning's extremely exciting announcement that tyler has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire nic inc. in all-cash transaction for a purchase price of approximately $2.3 billion. we're going to spend a bit of time today walking you through why nic is an exceptional addition to tyler family and we'll leave time at the end of the presentation for your questions. but before we begin, i will remind you that we have posted a presentation on the acquisition on our ir website, and i'll refer to some of the slides in my remarks.
i would draw your attention to the disclosures on slide 3 related to solicitation materials and remind you that additional information is available on the websites of both tyler and nic. so, with that out of the way, i'd like to start by highlighting the significant benefits of this acquisition, the largest in tyler's history by a wide margin brings to our business. nic is a leading digital solutions provider to state and federal government entities and will meaningfully increased tyler's presence in both of those sectors, building on the entry points we achieved via acquisitions of micropact and socrata a couple of years ago.
nic also brings to tyler a very large incremental payments processing business for governments, allowing us to meaningfully grow our revenue stream that is highly recurring in nature. nic's unique statewide contract structure and complementary portfolio of offerings will allow tyler to better serve a broader customer base with a more complete set of solutions. and perhaps most importantly, tyler and nic are two companies whose cultures are complementary and well aligned, which i will touch on more in a moment.
in terms of the transaction specifics, this is an all-cash transaction for a purchase price of $34 per share, which equates to an equity value of $2.3 billion or an enterprise value of approximately $2.1 billion inclusive of nic balance sheet cash. we have committed financing to fund the transaction in the form of cash on hand and a $1.6 billion bridge facility, which we anticipate replacing with permanent capital between signing and closing. the transaction has been unanimously approved by both boards of directors and is expected to close in the second quarter, subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals and approval by the nic shareholders.
we expect this combination to be accretive to our non-gaap earnings and ebitda as well as to our recurring revenue mix and free cash flow per share in the first year. it's important to note that we will continue to maintain a strong balance sheet post transaction with a very reasonable balance of leverage and liquidity.
i'd like to briefly touch again on the point around culture and how that played into the rationale for this acquisition. nic is a company that's been on tyler's radar screen for quite some time and we have admired their reputation in the marketplace from a distance. as i and the rest of the tyler management team got to know our counterpart nic over the last few weeks and months, it became increasingly clear how similar our two organizations are, as you can see from the similarities in our respective missions.
tyler and nic are two companies built on integrity and focused on delivering differentiated value for all of our respective constituents, governments, businesses, citizens, employees and shareholders. i view this combination as a continued realization of our mission of empowering the public sector to create smarter, safer and stronger communities. the pandemic has accelerated the shift by governments to online services and electronic payments as more citizens and businesses are interacting digitally with government. nic is uniquely positioned with a deep expertise and robust digital solutions to partner with us in making government more efficient and more accessible to citizens. nic's capabilities and vision align with and are complementary to our connected communities vision and will advance our efforts to bring that to our clients.
on slide 6, we've included a bit more information on nic as well as some key relevant statistics. the company is a leading digital solutions and payments provider serving more than 7,100 federal, state and local government agencies across the nation. nic has enterprisewide partnerships with 31 states and a robust payments business that currently processes $24 billion in payments annually and that amount will increase significantly with implementation of the payments processing contract nic recently signed with the state of florida.
the company's broad set of solutions and a unique go-to-market contracting model allow nic to become deeply embedded with their clients, resulting in predictable, highly recurring revenue growth. for the fiscal year ended 2020, nic delivered revenue of more than $460.5 million and adjusted ebitda of about $108.8 million. nic's complete fourth quarter earnings were also released this morning and you will find their complete results on their website.
on slide 7, you can see the breadth of nic's leading portfolio of digital government solutions. at a high level, the company is focused on delivering user friendly digital services that make it easier and more efficient to interact with government, providing valuable conveniences like applying for unemployment insurance, submitting business filings, renewing licenses, accessing information and making secure payments without visiting a government office.
nic serves both businesses and citizens with solutions to tackle information, interactions and payments for a wide range of government agencies. and importantly, including a variety of delivery methods such as gov2go, nic's unique proprietary, cross agency mobile platform designed specifically for citizens to interact with governments.
we drill down a bit further into nic's focus areas on slide 8, and importantly, how nic's solutions map to our existing portfolio. as we assessed nic's fit with tyler, we thought about their portfolio of offerings through a number of lenses. certain of nic's end markets such as their solutions for businesses, courts and healthcare are highly complementary with tyler's. nic's presence in these sectors at the state and federal level are naturally aligned with tyler's established presence at the local level. other areas such as outdoor recreation and taxes represent natural adjacencies to expand tyler's current business while a sector like motor vehicles is a clear growth opportunity.
the key takeaway from our assessment of nic's portfolio is that there are a number of areas where tyler's existing businesses will benefit from nic quickly and were avenues of growth should open up organically for both of us over time. a similar fact pattern emerges, if you look at nic's geographic footprint, which is shown on slide 9. nic has established relationships across the nation including geographic alignment with tyler in several complementary solution areas with 16 states where both companies have active contracts at different agencies. nic's state enterprise and platform solutions businesses, both of which we'll touch on in greater detail in a moment, already have great breadth and depth and we see a number of white space opportunities to expand these platforms as part of the tyler portfolio. we also view nic's federal client relationships as a natural fit to meaningfully expand our existing tyler federal business.
on slide 10 we provide a more detailed overview of nic's state enterprise business including a look at the long-term relationships the company has built over time. nic's state enterprise solution offers a unique approach to working with governments by putting dedicated local teams in capital cities for support and developing services and solutions that are relevant to all agencies within a state government. nic is able to deploy best practices gleaned over a number of decades and leverage a deep foundation of technological capabilities in tailoring solutions to fit specialized needs. the company's flexible statewide contract vehicles allow governments to avoid cumbersome procurement processes by authorizing nic to develop and implement a wide range of solutions across a number of different agencies. these long-term contracts lead to clear line of sight both operationally and from a revenue perspective, as evidenced by nic's historic ability to grow same state revenue at 8% plus.
nic's platform solutions business, which is illustrated on slide 11 includes comprehensive agency specific vertical solutions that are the product of significant investments nic has made in recent years, both organically and inorganically, and represent scalable solutions designed to address specific areas of market demand. on the payment side, nic has built a comprehensive platform specifically designed for governments that can be integrated into state enterprise systems or offered stand-alone. recently acquired solutions in licensing and healthcare are already showing early wins with new contracts awards across five states while nic has successfully deployed various outdoor recreation solutions in 12 states. the early momentum in this piece of nic's business is clearly evident and is very exciting for tyler. we see significant opportunity to drive outsized growth with these platform technologies.
turning to slide 12, i would like to reiterate how strongly we believe in the merits of this transaction and view the addition of nic as a combination of complementary strengths. with this acquisition we will create a public sector technology solutions leader that furthers our goal of connecting governments with constituents and businesses in a way that is seamless and transparent.
i'd close by noting how delighted we are to soon welcome nic and their employees to the tyler family. i remind you that we expect the transaction to close in the second quarter of this year and is subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory reviews and approval by nic stockholders. as a result, we are somewhat limited in our ability to discuss certain aspects of the transaction at this time.
with that, we'd like to open up the line for q&a.

[operator instructions] your first question comes from kirk materne with evercore isi. please go ahead.
kirk materne -- evercore partners -- analyst
okay. thanks very much and congratulations on the acquisition. lynn, two questions, i think, for you predominantly. just first on the, i guess, the backdrop right now in the tyler business, are you hearing any sort of, i guess, green shoots coming from some of your clients yet in terms of their budgets, i guess, these activity levels around the top end of the funnel. just trying to get a sense on whether you see you guys -- if you see any sort of defrosting in the market a little bit, you said it's a nice deal this quarter, but clearly it's still challenging. so, how do you see that maybe playing out over '21?
and then just on the nic deal, clearly, seems like you're going to leave the business alone for at least the near term. can you just talk about some of the synergies maybe you see from a top line perspective at least, as you look out over the next one or two years maybe the one or two things that you think are maybe lower hanging fruit on that front? thanks.
h. lynn moore -- president & chief executive officer
yeah. thanks, kirk. on your first question around budgets and activity level, as we said going -- we said at the last quarterly call, our anticipation was that covid would continue into 2021. as you recall, most of our clients, their budget seasons are june 30, so they are in the midst of those budgets. when you look back at 2020 and some of the comments i made during the year the pandemic actually it was impacting different parts of our business a little bit differently. we saw a little more impact in our erp space, particularly at the mid and higher end and a little bit more in the appraisal and tax base. we actually had a really good sales year last year at courts and justice when they talk about that a little bit later was actually a record sales year for them. but the number of rfps and demos and all that slowed down really impacted certain parts of our business more, and it's just anecdotal right now.
we are now just one month into 2021, but what we've seen a little bit, particularly on the erp side, we don't talk about awards and wins, but the awards in january in the contract values was something that's certainly up over the last eight months, and is a positive sign. we see things over and like in the appraisal and tax area where there are some fairly significant projects, some fairly large rfps that really got put on the shelf in q2 of last year. we're starting to see those starting to come out, again, that doesn't necessarily mean mini contracts, as you know, or immediate deals, but we are seeing some of that.
there is still going to be headwinds in 2021, obviously with the covid relief that just passed, there is some uncertainty about what that's going to mean. we're still seeing pushes and delays, but i think at your comment about defrosting, i kind of getting an early sense, but again it's anecdotal right now. i think, we'll know a lot more obviously at the end of q1. and as the vaccine rolls out and people start getting more comfortable, i think, we'll start getting better clear site on that.
on the nic front, i just want to say a couple of things, i've mentioned in the opening remarks, a couple of times now about stockholder approval and regulatory approval. there are certain things i can say right now and certain things i can't. i'm going to air right now on the conservative side because this is a big deal and i am so excited. and the last thing i want to do is overstep my bounds on this call with my excitement and do something to potentially jeopardize this transaction.
i can tell you that we see a lot of revenue opportunities, lot of revenue opportunities for nic and lot of revenue opportunities for tyler. it's going to take some time just like all of our acquisitions. as you know you followed us a long time where we are a good acquirer, we bring companies in, we take our time. our first model is make sure we don't break the great company that they have built. we're going to sit down with them and really map out sort of what those opportunities are and what's the best timeline to achieve them while also keeping their strong business intact.
i can just tell you that when we look at those and we look at how are the complementary nature of our businesses and the ability to utilize some of their statewide contracts and what they are doing in payments and what we can learn from them and what they might can learn from us. it's pretty exciting, and i think, i really look forward to sharing a lot more detail as it goes on, but i'm going to try to keep my comments at pretty high level at this point.

our next question will come from keith housum, he his with northcoast research. please go ahead.
keith m. housum -- northcoast research -- analyst
yeah. lynn [phonetic], congratulations on the acquisition. as you guys know i cover nic and they are a quality company with some really good people there, so great job there. just i completely respect the limits that you have on in terms of talking about the deal, but just to be clear though, you guys see this clearly from a revenue synergy standpoint as opposed to any type of significant cost cutting synergies, correct?
h. lynn moore -- president & chief executive officer
yeah, that's absolutely correct, keith. and i think that's our history at tyler is. when we pursue an acquisition for strategic purposes and it's not to go ""create synergies through cost,"" it's about how we're going to invest and grow that business and align it with ours. you've seen that throughout other tyler acquisitions and it's one of the things i'm most proud of. and in fact i mentioned in kirk's response how c&j last year really had a record year in sales and a lot of that has to do with the fact of the acquisitions we've done over the years and how we've integrated them and opened up new markets and aligned them with our business.
and that's exactly what we see with the nic acquisition. it's a great company, as you mentioned. it's the company built on integrity, they've got a great management team, really strong management team as you'd expect, and we're just really excited about bringing them into the tyler fold and getting to work together.
keith m. housum -- northcoast research -- analyst
great. thanks. maybe if i just turn it over to tyler business in the fourth quarter, so clearly software licenses, i guess, no real surprise there, some delays are still continuing. is there a point in 2021 or maybe even 2022 that we're actually going to see the release of some pent-up demand or is it the ability by the clients that sweat their assets where they probably won't, it'd be more blood in. how can we kind of think about a recovery from covid, i hope that as a return to a more normalized world toward the end of the year.
h. lynn moore -- president & chief executive officer
yeah, i think, obviously it's a little hard to nail down. as we said before on calls the demand didn't go away, i mean, everything we do is we provide a central functionality essential services, it's there. and what we've seen for example and what i've talked about in the past, i've mentioned that last year, maybe a little bit more difficult year on sales in our mid to upper level erp space. that's really just a more reflection of people being able to hang on with their systems for another year and sort of sweat it out. and it's my expectation that that pent-up demand will be released. it's hard to predict exactly when.
and again, what we've talked about over the last year is we really lean back on our experience back during the great recession. well, it's not -- it's really not apples to apples, there is a lot of similarities. and what we saw there was sort of a depressed market for a couple of years, but then that market open up and it's sort of exploded. and the fact that we were able to invest and improve our competitive position really put us in a great position to capitalize on that and that's the way we feel about it now. we're just as optimistic about the future as i was coming into 2020.
keith m. housum -- northcoast research -- analyst
great. thanks. appreciate it. good luck.

our next question will come from peter heckmann, he is with d.a. davidson. please go ahead.
peter heckmann -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
hey, good morning, gentlemen. and let me echo those congratulations. i've covered egov since 2005 and i agree there is a very nice complementary fit here both culturally and from a business perspective. and so i think it's going to going to be a nice deal. i know you don't want to talk too much about the details, but could you let us know, is there a go shop provision with the deal, any type of termination fees involved? and then just back of the envelope, it looks like the deal might get you to around 2.5 times levered post deal. is that about the right ballpark?
h. lynn moore -- president & chief executive officer
yeah, pete. and again, thanks for the comments on nic, we couldn't agree more on the cultural fit. and i want to spend a second on that, before i get to your other questions is, we've done a lot of acquisitions over the years and the one thing that we've learned and one thing we primarily look for is cultural alignment, because in our experience acquisitions can -- they can look great on paper and they can look great in banker books and all that stuff that you see. but really it doesn't matter if the cultures are aligned, it just doesn't matter how good it looks on paper, they just ultimately won't work out and that's one of the things that's so exciting about this.
and as i've spent time with harry, their ceo. and as we got to know their management team just seeing their culture and seeing the way they approach the business and how it aligned with us and their vision, that's just a very key point. as it relates to the agreement itself, i believe the agreement got filed or will be filed today. so, as you talk about no shop provisions and termination fees, those are all fairly standard negotiated provisions that you'll see in these sort of public company deals. i would say the terms of those in this agreement are somewhat typical. i'll let you go look those up in the side on those, but yeah, they're fairly typical and things that you would expect to see in a stock transaction.
on the financing front, i'm glad you raised that we've talked about forever our strong balance sheet and you're right. when you look at a net debt to ebitda ratio, we believe it's going to be pretty manageable, maybe somewhere in the 3 times, the high-2s, low-3s, but somewhere around there will be pretty reasonable. the one thing i want to specifically emphasize as well, this is significant amount of debt and it's something that we haven't carried for a long time, it's my goal and my anticipation as we move to more committed financing that we're going to maintain a lot of flexibility and we're going to -- our balance sheet is still going to look very strong, it's one of the things i'm committed to doing and putting this permanent financing together. i spoke to our board about it two days ago.
it's really important that how we structure this debt allows us to continue to do the things that we've done so successfully for so many years and have been a big part of our success. things like the flexibility to continue and invest in all of our r&d initiatives that continue to do acquisitions as they arise and opportunistic share repurchases. it's my anticipation that we will still have that flexibility over the next several years as we work with the debt that i believe to be very manageable. so, i appreciate that question.
peter heckmann -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
great. great. that's fair. and then just as a quick follow-up, in terms of the main buckets of government federal, state, your city and cities and towns, are you seeing one of those that i would assume federal has maybe some less significant budget restrictions at this point. and so, are you seeing a little bit better activity there like for a micropact or a socrata then you would maybe at this level, just given the need for balanced budgets at the state level?
h. lynn moore -- president & chief executive officer
yeah, so, it's interesting, i'd actually -- throughout 2020 that was really more the case, there was probably a little more pressure on the state budgets than there was at the federal level. and we saw that with our micropact and socrata solutions. as we got into the fourth quarter and as actually state budgets have started to stabilize, we're actually starting to see the shift right now. and as we look into 2021, we see the state budgets actually starting to come back and opportunity starting to open up.
and actually right now, at the federal level, it's a little bit more cautious, i wouldn't -- cautious maybe the wrong word, but it's really has more to do with the change in administration. and so there will probably be a little bit of a pause there on deals. we saw there were some deals in q4 once the election happened and you get a change in administration, you get change in organization, leadership and priorities. there is just a little bit of a pause, but i would expect as the year continues to roll out and particularly with some of the initiatives that we're seeing come out at a congress that's going to pick back up as the year goes on.
peter heckmann -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
great. i appreciate it.

our next question comes from scott berg with needham & company. please go ahead.
scott berg -- needham & co. -- analyst
hi, lynn and brian. congrats on the acquisition and thanks for taking my questions. i guess, kind of two here, lynn, starting with the acquisition is, i haven't covered nic, obviously looked at them from a far and this probably ends a 10-year rumor that you guys might ultimately quite hear them. but on their business at least from how i understand it a little bit and correct me if i'm wrong, but some of their state and federal opportunities have a little bit more of a custom software kind of component to it, the pure pre-packaged software, which is predominantly what tyler sells today. how do you deal with that going forward or is that kind of maybe a miss -- misconception in terms of what their products may look like to those larger customers?
h. lynn moore -- president & chief executive officer
i'd say, scott, and i think that was probably more their business model when they started. it's obviously there is still a part of that i think what they have been doing is they've been evolving their business to make it less custom and to make it more leverageable across their client base. you're also seeing what they have done the last several years where they have started to get some more vertical solutions. they have done a couple of small acquisition and starting to push those. i mean, i think part of their overall growth plan, absent, tyler, was to sort of continue to move in that direction and that's the direction they are moving on, and we'd expect that to continue.
scott berg -- needham & co. -- analyst
got it. helpful. and then, i guess, congratulations to jeff for leading the new accelerated move to your cloud platform. but i guess, as we think about that movements at the end of 2023 is only roughly a three years weight to have all your apps to be cloud native or i guess cloud efficient is just kind of a two-part question there is, first, how do we think about margin structure and what the new platform looks like, now that you're getting more visibility around kind of time frames, etc., gross margin structure, obviously on those customers.
and then two, how do you migrate those customers. is this something that you try to push relatively quickly to get some of your current subscription-based customers to move over that or do you allow them to kind of naturally migrate there over a longer time frame? thanks.
h. lynn moore -- president & chief executive officer
yeah. thanks, scott. i think, it's going to be a mix of a little bit of both. and part of it is, as we think about going through a cloud transformation -- really the cloud transformation at tyler. and as you know, that's more than just getting your products into a certain state it eventually really impacts the way not just how you develop products but how you deploy and support them. part of that strategy, as you mentioned, is migrating our customers out of the tyler systems and moving them over to aws.
the principal foundational piece of that though is, is making sure that our products as we move them over there that they operate in at least an efficient if not more efficient way than they are in the current tyler cloud centers, and that's what we're operating on now, i think, you'll see over and we talk about over the next three years. that doesn't mean, all of them are all going to suddenly be magically there at december 31, 2023. it will be getting there in different stages along the way, some sooner than others.
and i think as we go forward and we think about those plans, you'll start to see us develop plans where perhaps new customers are all going into the aws world. you'll see certain areas where our products already are more cloud efficient or closer that we will become more aggressive with our existing customers. and so it's going to be a little bit of blend and a mix, and that's also part of why we created this group. i mean, this group was created for a number of reasons.
it's very exciting. jeff, as you mentioned he's been here almost 30 years, he knows our business inside now. he is the perfect guy to oversee and coordinate and that's really part of what this role is, it's a tylerwide, companywide coordination of all of these multiple streams that you're talking about. it's not just getting our products there, it's getting our plans on migration, it's getting plans on getting out to tyler datacenters. it's improving our it infrastructure and making information security standard discipline. it's all the things it starting to build. how we're going to deploy and support and all of that.
and so, it's a comprehensive effort and you'll -- we will continue to talk more about it each quarter, each -- every three months, six months. and we'll talk about the progress and as these plans evolve and they get a little more specific, but at a high level, that's where it is. and brian, we've talked before on the margins as we move people into the cloud, into the cloud world. we expect significant margin improvement and significant revenue improvement both getting them on the subscription, but then also getting our products more cloud efficient will help margins getting to where we have fewer releases and they're deployed easier, it will help margins, everything that's all about the cloud transformation and that's all going to help over the coming years.

our next question will come from charlie strauzer with cjs securities. please go ahead.
charlie strauzer -- cjs securities -- analyst
hi, good morning. couple of quick questions for you, lynn, you were talking about the balance sheet structure post the transaction and the type of debt you wanted to take on. are you thinking more in terms of like a term loan or credit facility where you could use your strong free cash flow to quickly pay down the debt?
brian k. miller -- executive vice president-chief financial officer
hi, charlie. this is brian. we're actually considering a number of alternatives there. so, we're not ready to quite specify one, but it's clear that the way interest rates are, the way some of the specific debt markets are, it's a very, very attractive time for a company with our profile with the transaction as financially compelling as this one to be looking to raise their debt. and so we've got a lot of options, as lynn said, maintaining flexibility and not limiting our ability to execute on other initiatives is key in that decision. but you'll see more about that in the next few weeks from us.
charlie strauzer -- cjs securities -- analyst
excellent. thanks. and then just looking at nic's performance in 2020 that you clearly had some benefits from some new programs they have rolled out for covid-related things. what -- how should we think about kind of the longer-term growth aspects for the top line of that business? clearly, there is kind of more low-single digits prior to 2020, but help us think about how we should think about that business going forward?
h. lynn moore -- president & chief executive officer
yeah, charlie, i'd say two things. you're right, they definitely get a boost in 2020 on some specific covid pandemic related products and some initiatives around there. what i'd say to that is that really shows their innovation and ingenuity and it shows their ability to spin up something quickly to meet the needs and to roll it out really quickly. and in my -- the way i view it is while that was -- it's something that was really tied to the pandemic, that's something that is exciting to see that they can execute on that and to think that we can do things like that in other areas, particularly as we combine with some of the tyler products.
as you look at their overall revenue growth moving forward, i would say, my expectation is it would be more in line with tyler's. and when you look over the last couple of years you -- if you look at it sort of in isolation on our 10-k or something, it may look like their overall revenue growth may have been lower. part of that was the fact that there was a significant contract that they inherited, it wasn't when they originally sold with the state of texas and when they lost that that was a significant headwind to year-over-year revenue growth.
they have got a number of initiatives inside their business that will be growing at accelerated rates, just like we do at tyler, some of these specific solution initiatives. i think, you're going to see significant growth in their payments business. they -- as i mentioned on my opening remarks, they have recently won the contract with the state of florida to not only provide statewide payments across the state, but also it provides opportunities under that contract to do payments at the local level. so that's kind of at a high level, the way i see it right now.
brian k. miller -- executive vice president-chief financial officer
and i'd also add that over the last decade their same state revenue growth has been more than 8%. so, over a long period of time that's been reasonably close to sort of what our organic growth rate has been. so, they do have really solid foundation of consistent growth and more than 90% recurring revenues. so that will actually raise our mix in terms of recurring revenues on a combined basis.
charlie strauzer -- cjs securities -- analyst
great. thank you very much. congratulations.
operator
our next question will come from matt vanvliet with btig. please go ahead.
matt vanvliet -- btig -- analyst
yeah. thanks for taking my questions, guys, and congrats on the announcement. i guess, on the core business and maybe also how it relates to the acquisition, curious on how much success in some of these larger deals especially the state of texas extension you feel like the socrata data layer is enabling especially as everything kind of moves more digitally. i guess, how much are those conversations happening on a deal by deal basis? and then looking at nic, how quickly do you think you can sort of integrate that and start pushing especially at the state layer where maybe greater visibility is even more paramount?
h. lynn moore -- president & chief executive officer
yeah. thanks, matt. on your first comment, you're right, obviously, we -- the state of texas contract was an extension of our previous relationship. we've done a lot of things there with the state to build in a lot of value to help our ability to recapture that contract. and there is other upsides that come with that contract. one of the things that i've talked about over the last couple of quarters and it certainly haven't heard, yeah, socrata plays a role. it's another value add that we do, but we all sort of seeing socrata play a role in areas all across our company.
and when we purchased socrata, i guess, that was back in 2018, one of the things that we really liked about it is not only do we believe that the future public sector is it will be have a focus around data and insights, but how it can really differentiate our products going forward. and i've talked about in public safety deals, we're starting to talk about it in our erp deals, it's making a big difference. it's hard to quantify, but when we have that kind of functionality and that kind of insights and our competitors don't, it's just -- it's a huge add and it's something that's a big differentiator.
as it relates to ""integration of nic,"" again, we're still vary in the early stages of that and we still have a lot of conversations to have with their management team. this deal, while it's been sort of going on in the back works for, i think, i first reached out to harry back in september and -- but things have been accelerating. and we've talked a lot about the opportunities, but we've got a lot of work to do to get our teams, their teams together and start thinking about those things. some of those are still going to be a little bit limited, again, because of regulatory restraints. but all i can tell you and continue to emphasize is how excited i am, how excited our team is and i believe how excited their team is for the opportunities that we have that we can go out there and do together when we combine these two leadership roles.
matt vanvliet -- btig -- analyst
great. and on the transaction side, continuing to see strong growth there, i'd say i imagine that's a fairly high demand factor for a lot of local governments now. but from a competitive front, are you seeing maybe non-traditional vendors in terms of this area of the market enter in as a lot more kind of digital payments or fintech type companies are looking to reach further into other areas of the market. so, curious, what you're seeing from the trends there and maybe how much that influenced the exact timing of getting this transaction done?
h. lynn moore -- president & chief executive officer
so, i would say that there is a little bit of that, i think, what we always want to differentiate even with this transaction base just like i talked about in our core applications we differentiate with data and insights is the ability not just to do ""payment processing,,"" but to be able to link those services with other offerings and things we do another and value adds. so that we really become more intertwined and tied with these government agencies.
i mean, when -- you're right, when i look out to the future and i look to the future of the public sector market, i see the things like cloud and the provision of subscription-based essential functionality, it's digital services, these transaction-based revenues, it's data and insights, it's our connected communities vision and it's bringing all of that stuff together in a way that really nobody else can. and so, yeah, to your question, there is a little bit of that, but we want to make sure that we get in there and add all these extra values and services to our clients that nobody else can deliver.
matt vanvliet -- btig -- analyst
great. thank you. congrats.

our next question will come from jonathan ho with william blair. please go ahead.
jonathan ho -- william blair & company -- analyst
good morning. i just wanted to maybe start out with understanding, i guess, why is now sort of the right time for the egov acquisition given that you've known them for a little bit of time? and how does that sort of, i guess, mesh with your m&a strategy like do we sort of see a slowdown in activity, i think, you said you wanted to maintain flexibility. but when we think about digestion of something this large, how should we be sort of probably think about that?
h. lynn moore -- president & chief executive officer
it's a good question, jonathan. and it's funny, as you know, i've been with tyler since 1998, egov or nic went public a year later. obviously, they have been in business for several years before that. and literally, they have been on our radar since the day when they went public. we've had internal conversations about them over the years. i would say that part of it is we've been so focused on our mission of getting really all the essential functional areas across local government. as i've said before, we talked about this, we did the micropact acquisition, even socrata, its areas that we've always been interested in, but we just haven't gotten there.
i can't tell you why i didn't specifically pick up the phone and call harry three years ago as opposed to this fall. but i can tell you that we spent a lot of time and a lot of work on it even before i made that call. and again we've had conversations for a long time and their business has grown and matured, our business has grown and matured. and as we've grown and gotten more solutions and more opportunities and as they have grown and increased their footprint, we really see the balance. and when you look at things like the prior question on payments, this is a big strategic driver for us and it's a big strategic driver for them. and they have got a very significant payments business, we've got an emerging payments business and we see the opportunities there.
so, it's just one of those things, but all i can say is we're very excited that we've made this deal that we've made today now. as you talk about our m&a strategy going forward, i would be surprised if this is the only acquisition we do this year, but this is also a big acquisition, it's going to require a lot of focus on our management teams and this is something we need to get right. and so i could see at some point particularly after this deal closes as we go into the second half of the year that sort of like we were back in 2019 where we may take a little bit of deliberate pause.
but as i mentioned, we're going to have the financial wherewithal to continue to capitalize on acquisition opportunities and we're going to continue to look like we always have. and i continue -- i expect that will continue to be part of our roadmap going forward, as we continue to see strategic products are ways to increase our tam or expand our offerings in areas where we already have a large footprint. so, our overall strategy won't change at all, again, it will probably as we get to the second of the year, a little bit more like 2019.
jonathan ho -- william blair & company -- analyst
got it. and just as a quick follow-up, you talked about your competitive position strengthening throughout the downturn. can you give us some concrete examples or some, i guess, greater detail in terms of what you're seeing in the competitive landscape and maybe where you're seeing some folks drop off?
h. lynn moore -- president & chief executive officer
yeah. so, i'd say, first of all, just initially it goes back to all of our investments and continue to invest in those. and what we've seen in the market is that some of our competitors are not making the investments that they may have historically done and we've seen a little bit of that. but when we see things like in our incode group, which is really the lower end of erp it's where our schools is, it's where utility billing and things like that. that group right now are seeing record win rates, i mean, their win rates are approaching 90%, which is just off the chart. and so we get really excited about when we think about the market returning. when we see things like i mentioned earlier on the call, our courts & justice group, 2020 was actually the highest sales year for our courts & justice division. now, they are poc accounting, so it's not all going to flow in right away. but you remember back in 2014, 2015 when that group had really high sales which is when california opened up. that's a process of, i mean, not only our odyssey continues to be strong, but all the investments we've made around there and the expanded products including acquisitions which was your question earlier, and being able to sell all those products and have more functionality and be more competitive.
we talk about it, public safety had another 1 million plus license deal this quarter. they are just on a roll. they had a very big win in genesee county, michigan against motorola and centralsquare. and again, that's a result of our competitiveness, our ability to check more boxes on the rfps, our ability to go up market. and, again, all these acquisitions that are differentiating these offerings. so, those are few examples, and we just like where we sit right now, and we anxiously await for pre-pandemic market.
jonathan ho -- william blair & company -- analyst
congrats on the acquisition. thank you.

[operator instructions] our next question will come from rob oliver with baird. please go ahead.
robert oliver -- robert w. baird -- analyst
great, thank you. good morning, guys. appreciate it. lynn, i had one for you, and then, brian, a follow-up for you. so, lynn, i guess, a follow-up on scott berg's question earlier, just around the details on the saas migration very helpful color there. i did note in the quarter that conversions were up nicely. so, can you talk a little bit about that how you're managing that go to market and obviously you guys since your pivot to a subscription-first mindset has really been predominantly landing with subscription, with new business. but it does seem like conversions are starting to kick up nicely there, so i was wondering if you could talk a little bit about that.
h. lynn moore -- president & chief executive officer
yeah, i think, part of that conversion is also just the general market. and as we said for a couple of years, the market was moving in this direction, certainly, covid i think is accelerating that. we are doing some things internally. it is a focus point for us. i think, one of our greatest opportunities is our existing customer base, whether it's new products that go in there, whether it's converting them to the saas model, continue to push in, inside sales continue to be one of our big growth drivers. and so it's a combination of a lot of things, but you're right, it's a focus of ours.
and as we continue to get our products into a more cloud efficient state it will become even more of a focus and even more pronounced. and it's going to take some time. i mean, i don't want to say this is all going to happen in the next few quarters, but it's going to take some time, but it's definitely the direction we're moving and it's a significant opportunity.
robert oliver -- robert w. baird -- analyst
okay, great. that's helpful. and then, brian, on the deal that you guys announced this quarter that extension on the texas office of court admin. maybe if you could provide some color on what is it within this contract that did not enable you to show that in bookings and backlog and what are the measuring points that we're going to look to see that start to roll into the numbers?

yeah, it's basically a form of a termination for convenience provision that's in the contract both neither we nor the state of texas expect those to be exercised. the state has made some very positive comments about the relationship they've had with texas as we provided e-filing services for the last few years and made enhancements. and so we won that renewal in a very competitive process and with some enhancements to it. it also has, i believe, five one-year extensions on the end of the -- this -- five one year opportunities to extend it. but because there are some termination for convenience provisions that we wouldn't expect to be exercised, from an accounting perspective, they prevent us from being able to put the full amount in backlog like we normally would with a fixed fee e-filing arrangement.
so, i think, there is only, less than $5 million of that contract will go into backlog sort of each quarter. so, doesn't affect revenues but it clearly affects the optics. we've talked over a long time about the lumpiness of some of the bookings, but this one -- was one that just didn't quite fit with the accounting provisions, but it's a great extension, a great testament to the work we've done with texas over the last few years. it's clearly our biggest e-filing arrangement and getting that extension is a major win for us.

operator
hello, and welcome to today's tyler technologies first quarter 2021 conference call. your host for today's call is lynn moore, president and ceo of tyler technologies. [operator instructions] as a reminder, this conference call is being recorded today, april 29, 2021.
i would like to turn the call over now to mr. moore. please go ahead.
lynn moore -- chief executive officer, president
thank you, keith, and welcome to our call. with me today is brian miller, our chief financial officer. first, i'd like for brian to give the safe harbor statement. next, i will have some preliminary comments on our quarter results, and then brian will review the details.
i'll end with some additional comments, and then we'll take questions. brian?
brian miller -- executive vice president, chief financial officer and treasurer
thanks, lynn. during the course of this conference call, management may make statements that provide information other than historical information and may include projections concerning the company's future prospects, revenues, expenses and profits. such statements are considered forward-looking statements under the safe harbor provision of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from these projections. we'd refer you to our form 10-k and other sec filings for more information on those risks. please note that all growth comparisons we make on the call today will relate to the corresponding period of last year, unless we specify otherwise. lynn?
lynn moore -- chief executive officer, president
thanks, brian. our first quarter results exceeded our expectations, providing an exceptional start to 2021. recurring revenues, which comprised 75% of our first quarter revenues, were strong, led by a 25% growth in subscription revenues. however, software licenses and services revenues continue to be pressured by longer sales cycles and delays in projects as clients deal with the ongoing effects of the pandemic. a favorable revenue mix with strong subscription growth, coupled with cost efficiencies, drove a 270 basis point expansion of our non-gaap operating margin to 26.8%. cash flow continued to be very robust as cash from operations grew 26% and free cash flow grew almost 34%. we're pleased to see signs of growing activity in our public sector markets and expect that federal stimulus under the american rescue plan act will have a positive impact on government technology spending going forward. bookings in the first quarter were solid at approximately $247 million, but were down 22.8% against a very challenging comparison with the first quarter of 2020. our largest deal in the quarter was a saas arrangement for our munis erp solution with the city of fresno, california valued at approximately $10 million. other significant saas contracts included erp deals with hall county, georgia and fort smith, arkansas and odyssey courts deal with val verde county, texas. our largest on-premises contracts include an executime time contract with the u.s. virgin islands, public safety and brazos citations contracts with montgomery county, new york and cicero, illinois and an energov contract with the commonwealth of the bahamas.
so far this year, we've been busy on the m&a front. on march 31, we completed two tuck-in acquisitions, dataspec and readysub, for a total purchase price of $12 million in cash. dataspec is a market-leading provider of software for the electronic management of veterans claims. dataspec's web-based software-as-a-service system called vetraspec allows for secure electronic claims submission to the federal department of veterans affairs and reporting capabilities in addition to scheduling, calendaring and payments. dataspec offers county, state and national versions of vetraspec, with state solutions making a majority of its implementations. the solution allows state departments to execute and analyze reports on the entire state, individual offices, regions and districts and individual users. readysub is a cloud-based platform that delivers comprehensive absence and substitute teacher management solutions, serving approximately 1,000 school districts across the united states, with only approximately 20 of which overlapping with tyler's 2,000 school district clients. the solution helps districts with the labor-intensive and demanding task of filling both planned and unplanned staff absences with the most highly qualified substitute resources. with continuous pressure due to substitute teacher shortages, exacerbated by the covid-19 pandemic, districts can more easily retain a pool of qualified substitutes and automate the searching and filing of needed substitute spots. additionally, readysub can integrate districts' payroll processes, eliminating duplicate work and streamlining related payroll tasks.
most importantly, last week, we completed the $2.3 billion cash acquisition of nic, a leading digital government solutions and payments company that serves more than 7,100 federal, state and local government agencies across the nation. nic delivers user-friendly digital services that make it easier and more efficient for citizens and businesses to interact with government, providing valuable conveniences like applying for unemployment insurance, submitting business filings, renewing licenses, accessing information and making secure payments without visiting a government office. in addition, nic has extensive experience and expertise and scale in the government payments area, processing more than $24 billion in payments on behalf of citizens and governments last year, which will accelerate tyler's strategic payments initiative. with the addition of nic's highly complementary industry-leading digital government solutions and payment services to tyler's broad client base and multiple sales channels, the combined company will be well equipped to address the tremendous demand at the federal, state and local levels for innovative platform services. together, tyler and nic will connect data and processes across disparate systems and deliver essential products and services to all public sector stakeholders. nic had revenues of $460.5 million and net income of $68.6 million in 2020. while nic will cease to be an sec reporting company and, therefore, will not issue a first quarter earnings release, they also had a very strong first quarter results that exceeded their plan.
nic's core first quarter revenues, excluding the tourhealth and covid initiatives that are expected to wind down after the second quarter, grew more than 10% over last year. in addition, nic's operating income, again excluding the tourhealth and covid initiatives as well as acquisition costs, rose more than 20%. we are thrilled to welcome the more than 1,000 talented employees of nic, dataspec and readysub to the tyler family and look forward to realizing the tremendous benefits these transactions can bring to our collective team members and clients and to tyler shareholders.
now i'd like for brian to provide more detail on the results for the quarter.
brian miller -- executive vice president, chief financial officer and treasurer
thanks, lynn. yesterday, tyler technologies reported its results for the first quarter ended march 31, 2021. in our earnings release, we have included non-gaap measures that we believe facilitate understanding of our results in comparison with peers in the software industry. a reconciliation of gaap to non-gaap measures is provided in our earnings release. we've also posted on the investor relations section of our website under the financial reports tab schedules with supplemental information provided on this call, including information about quarterly bookings, backlog and recurring revenues. both gaap and non-gaap revenues for the quarter were $294.8 million, up 6.6% on a gaap basis and 6.5% on a non-gaap basis. as you may recall, we were off to a very strong start in the first two months of 2020 before the covid-19 pandemic began to significantly affect our business in march. so we're generally pleased with our growth this quarter against that comparison. software license revenues declined 20.3%, reflecting both extended sales cycles and a high mix of subscription deals at 66% of new software contract value. software services revenue declined 8.6% as a result of the continued impact of the covid-19 pandemic, and our shift to remote delivery of most services resulted in a decline in billable travel revenue. on the positive side, subscription revenues rose 25.4%. we added 84 new subscription-based arrangements and converted 39 existing on-premises clients, representing approximately $52 million in total contract value. in q1 of last year, we added 131 new subscription-based arrangements and had 19 on-premises conversions, representing approximately $98 million in total contract value. subscription contract value comprised approximately 66% of total new software contract value signed this quarter, compared to 73% in q1 of last year. the value weighted average term of new saas contracts this quarter was 4.0 years, compared to 5.9 years last year.
revenues from e-filing and online payments, which are included in subscriptions, were $26.9 million, up 22.4%. that amount includes e-filing revenue of $15.6 million, up 4.8%, and e-payments revenue of $11.3 million, up 59.3%. for the first quarter, our annualized non-gaap total recurring revenue, or arr, was approximately $886 million, up 12.9%. non-gaap arr for saas arrangements for q1 was approximately $302 million, up 26.3%. transaction-based arr was approximately $108 million, up 22.4%, and non-gaap maintenance arr was approximately $476 million, up 4.1%. our backlog at the end of the quarter was $1.55 billion, up 3%. as lynn noted, our bookings in the quarter were solid at $247 million. however, this was down 22.8% compared to a difficult comparison to q1 of last year. last year's first quarter bookings included several large contracts, including two significant follow-on saas deals with the north carolina courts, with a combined contract value of approximately $38 million. for the trailing 12 months, bookings were approximately $1.2 billion, down 13.3%, although they do not include the majority of the $98 million extension of our texas e-filing contract signed in q4 of 2020 because of certain termination provisions in that contract. if the texas e-filing renewal was fully included, trailing 12-month bookings would have been down only 6.4%. the prior trailing 12-month bookings also included four significant saas deals with the north carolina courts, with a combined contract value of approximately $123 million. the bookings growth rate in q1 was also affected by a shorter average term for new subscription contracts. our subscription -- software subscription booking in the first quarter added $10.2 million in new annual recurring revenue.
cash flow was once again very strong in the first quarter as cash from operations increased 26.4% to $71.7 million and free cash flow grew 33.9% to $61.7 million, representing an all-time high for first quarter free cash flow. we financed the nic acquisition with a mixture of debt at very attractive rates that gives us a flexible capital structure. in march, we completed a $600 million offering of 0.25% convertible senior notes due 2026. the notes are convertible into tyler common stock at a conversion price of $493.44, which represents a 30% premium over our closing price on march 4. on april 21, concurrent with the closing of the nic acquisition, we entered into a new $1.4 billion senior unsecured credit facility with a group of eight banks. the facility includes a $300 million term note due in 2024 and a $600 million term note due in 2026, both of which can be prepaid without penalty. the facility also includes a new five-year $500 million revolving credit agreement that replaces our prior $400 million revolver. the combination of the convertible debt, term notes and revolver provide us with a great deal of flexibility. our balance sheet remains very strong and its pro forma net leverage at the nic closing was approximately 3.2 times trailing 12-month adjusted ebitda. and we expect to end the year with net leverage under 2.5 times. the current blended interest rate on the $1.75 billion of debt we have outstanding today is 1.1%. we remain on track to achieve or exceed the annual revenue and eps guidance that we communicated in february for tyler, excluding the impact of the nic acquisition.
as lynn mentioned, nic also had a very strong first quarter results that exceeded their plans. we expect the nic acquisition will be accretive to our non-gaap earnings and ebitda as well as to our recurring revenue mix and free cash flow per share in 2021. because of antitrust restrictions, we took a conservative approach to our integration and strategic planning for nic prior to closing the transaction last week. we are currently working closely with nic's leadership to evaluate strategic growth opportunities that take advantage of the combined strength of the two businesses and determine the impact on our 2021 plan. we expect to complete the fine-tuning of our joint operating and financial plans for the remainder of the year and issue 2021 guidance for the combined company during the second quarter.
now i'd like to turn the call back to lynn.
lynn moore -- chief executive officer, president
thanks, brian. our team of professionals, including our new nic team members, executed at a high level in the first quarter, driving results that surpassed expectations for both tyler and nic and provided a great start to 2021. exiting 2020, our financial position was stronger than ever, allowing us to continue to pursue strategic acquisitions, including nic, the largest acquisition in our history with a purchase price of $2.3 billion in cash. we've also been able to continue to invest in and, in some cases, accelerate all of our long-term strategic initiatives, in particular, our shift to a cloud-first approach. as a result, our competitive position has also continued to strengthen. we believe we will continue to see an acceleration of the public sector's move to the cloud, and we are in a great position to support that move. i'm happy to say that we are on track with the strategic investments in optimizing our products for the cloud that we discussed on our fourth quarter call. this quarter, we saw early indicators that our market is beginning to recover as some delayed procurement processes are moving forward and rfp activity is growing from the levels of the second half of 2020. we also expect that the $350 billion of aid to state and local governments under the american rescue plan act will provide a significant measure of relief to budget pressures faced by many of our clients and prospects and have a positive impact on recovery of our markets. one topic i've not discussed on these calls before pertains to our efforts regarding environmental and social initiatives. tyler's culture guides our commitment to being a responsible partner in the communities where we live, work and serve our clients. this year marks the 50th anniversary of the tyler foundation, which since its creation has provided millions of dollars to charities and causes that positively impact our communities. our culture is also the foundation for our belief in the importance of providing an inclusive and diverse workplace.
we are proud to have been included in the forbes america's best employers for diversity list for the past two consecutive years. the pause in normal office occupancy and business travel due to the pandemic provided an opportunity for us to evaluate our environmental impact across our major office locations and identify opportunities to make our practices more consistent and effective. last year, we formed an environmental task force to strengthen our sustainability efforts across our office locations and the communities we impact. we achieved a significant milestone last year by responding to tyler's first invitation to the dow jones sustainability index survey. more than 3,500 of the world's largest publicly listed companies provide detailed data and background to this global survey for evaluation by its independent sustainability ranking body. completing the survey was an important opportunity for tyler to uncover opportunities to strengthen our core responsibility strategy. we recently published our second annual corporate responsibility report, which is available on our website. this report represents a significant expansion of our reporting on our esg efforts, and we look forward to continuing our journey and sharing our progress in this area. finally, this week, we are virtually hosting more than 5,000 clients at connect 2021, our annual user conference with a theme called virtually possible. team members from across tyler are providing nearly 700 hours of valuable content for our clients using our advanced virtual event platform. we are excited to be able to connect with so many clients at our virtual event, and we look forward to connecting with them in person at connect 2022.
with that, we'd like to open up the line for q&a.

operator
yes, thank you. we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [operator instructions] and the first question comes from matt vanvliet from btig.
matt vanvliet -- btig -- analyst
good morning, everyone. thanks for taking the question. really appreciate it. i guess as you look at some of the commentary you talked about, about slower sales cycles, but really starting to pick up maybe at the end of the quarter. curious what the federal aid bill kind of points to. are there any specific areas in your business that you think will have particular earmarks of spending? are there any limitations that you've seen in the bill so far? just kind of help us out with where you think the biggest upside will be across the portfolio.
lynn moore -- chief executive officer, president
yes. thanks, matt, and that's a good question. i think right now, there's still -- our clients generally know the money is there. there's still a little bit of uncertainty about how to access it. there's certainly money that's been earmarked for it modernization efforts. and so i think what it's done is it's given our clients a little bit more confidence. i don't know that i would say it necessarily benefits one more than the other. although one thing that we were noticing last year was in our state business and that -- our state business was off quite a bit last year, and there was a little bit of uncertainty around there. as it turns out, a lot of the state budgets were not as impacted as they first thought a year ago. and so i think the combination of that, along with this american rescue plan funding, is providing a boost in that state area. we're starting to see that with some of the rfps and things that we knew that were intended to come out that got delayed, and we're starting to see some of that. but i'd say, across our entire product lines, i think there's reason for i'd call cautious optimism in what's going on in the markets, and a big part of that is the american rescue plan.
brian miller -- executive vice president, chief financial officer and treasurer
and i would just add to that, on the rescue plan, that the cares act, the first stimulus, couldn't be used by governments to replace lost revenue. and it was roughly $150 billion for states and just -- $150 billion for the largest cities and counties. this $350 billion goes much deeper across states and local governments. and there are very few restrictions on what it can be used for. the funding is just now becoming available to governments. half of it available roughly now within 60 days of when it was passed. and then the other half is available 12 months from now. so we wouldn't have expected to see much impact on customers' purchasing activities and buying decisions yet, but it certainly points to an opportunity as we move through the year to provide significant relief.
matt vanvliet -- btig -- analyst
that's very helpful. and then i guess just following up on sort of the stages of integration for nic. from a product standpoint and the ability to sort of up-sell, cross-sell both across your customer base and then into theirs, what should we expect in terms of timing? is there any real heavy lifting to get the products to be fully integrated? is there anything that needs to be done from a technical standpoint to push their payments platform into your local governments? maybe just how you're thinking about kind of that process from a more technical and sort of product standpoint.
lynn moore -- chief executive officer, president
yes. sure, matt. i'd say a couple of things. as we mentioned in our comments, we're really just now beginning to sort of dig deep into our integration efforts and our strategic initiatives. and in fact, this week, we had the senior executives of both companies meeting face to face for the first time, which was exciting, and really started brainstorming. and at a high level, we already know sort of some of the major initiatives that we want to take on. and the good news is there's a lot of initiatives. and one thing that we need to do and be careful about is make sure that we prioritize them, look at some of the low-hanging fruit and look at some of the things that will have the most impact. you mentioned payments. that certainly is one of our largest initiatives. from a technical standpoint, there's still a little bit of work to do there. but nic is the unquestioned leader in payments in the public sector at the state level, and it's a growing thing for us. what we see there is the ability to leverage our client base and get payments more at the local level and leverage their technical experience to help boost our payments, talked about other sort of integrations and things.
we talked before about their state enterprise contracts, which provide sort of hunting licenses. and in fact, it's those state contracts, which they classify as state enterprise revenues, where they go in and then they sort of -- they plant a seed and then they're able to go build additional revenues from there. on their own, this first quarter, their -- those revenues were up 20%, which is pretty exciting. and then what we start talking about is what kind of products do we have at tyler that we can really just go in and push there. and i don't think there's a lot of technical integration there that's going to need to be done. but that's another one of our major initiatives that we're looking at right now.
matt vanvliet -- btig -- analyst
great. thank you.
operator
and the next question comes from scott berg with needham & company.
scott berg -- needham & company -- analyst
hi, lynn and brian, thanks for taking my questions. i guess i got two here. first of all, lynn, obviously, covid's still impacting your businesses, as is several in my coverage universe. but as i look at deal flow in the quarter, it looks like your new subscription contracts were, at 84 was substantially weaker than what we've seen at least over the last two or three quarters. i guess, as you look at that business, any product area, in particular, kind of driving maybe some of the softness in the quarter versus license sales, which was pretty much in line with the last couple of quarters?
lynn moore -- chief executive officer, president
yes, scott. i don't -- we talked about it last year. the expectation, really, was that, i guess, i'd sort of call it the covid hangover would bleed into this year, and a lot of it has to do with the fact that our clients' budget cycles are june -- july 1, june 30. and it's a good question. but at the same time, these are the deals that we've signed. and what we're starting to see is, in q1, for example, we're starting to see more rfps, we're starting to see more demos, and we're actually -- some of the awards that we've gotten in q1 that are not signed are actually starting to skew even heavily -- more heavily toward saas. as you know, we don't normally talk about unsigned awards. we talked last year about how covid was impacting different parts of our business differently. and we saw a little bit greater impact, say, more on the high-end financials, where munis is -- where a lot of our license sales are. and what we've seen so far in q1, actually, is that the awards that we're getting and the deals that are coming in are skewing at 80-plus percent to saas right now. so i think that overall trend that we've talked about is still going on. there's just a little bit of lumpiness and a little bit of hangover still from covid.
scott berg -- needham & company -- analyst
got it. you actually targeted a little bit. my second question was on those unsigned awards. brian, we've talked about that, obviously, over the last six or seven years. there's certainly some variance from quarter-to-quarter. as you look at those unsigned awards, was that number, i guess, coming out of q1, materially higher than what you've seen in the last couple of quarters? or was it kind of in line with that, similar amount?
brian miller -- executive vice president, chief financial officer and treasurer
i'd say it's a little bit higher. as lynn said, we saw these pauses in procurement processes in second quarter of last year, third quarter of last year, even to the fourth quarter of last year, where rfp volumes were down. our clients were adapting to remote work. we weren't able to do in-person demos and some clients wanted to see -- it took them a little while longer to adapt to doing a lot of those things remotely. so there were these pauses and delays in sales processes, particularly early stage sales processes last year. and given our normal sales cycles that are nine months to one year in typical deals, we expect that would show up in bookings now as we move into the fourth quarter, the first quarter of this year, these delays. and so, really, our pipeline is still very robust. the rfp activity is picking up. so as we've said all along, it's really a matter of timing. we haven't seen deals go away. we've just seen the timing pushed out, and it's not surprising that it's showing up. and given that more of the deals are skewing toward subscription, it's more evident in the lower subscription bookings than in the license deals.
scott berg -- needham & company -- analyst
got it. that's all i have. thanks for taking my questions.
operator
thank you. and the next question comes from rob oliver with baird.
rob oliver -- baird -- analyst
great. thank you guys, for taking my question, lynn, one for you. i just want to go back to the, i think, matt's initial question on the american rescue plan. obviously, sizable amounts of money flowing into local municipal. i think, brian, you had mentioned that there weren't as many restrictions on the money. some of our conversations, there's still, i guess, there's still some uncertainty about how exactly this is going to be spent. one area, in particular, where we're hearing it's greenlighted in schools, and that's, i think, a noisier market than it's been in the past, but i know you mentioned you guys have 2,000 customers there. readysub tuck-ins seems like it's really perfectly timed just as that was a nightmare to manage through covid. but just curious if you guys can just kind of frame the schools opportunity, or maybe any other early indications of that ""growing activity"" you're seeing as those arp funds are hitting and people are starting to do projects.
lynn moore -- chief executive officer, president
yes, rob, that's a good point you make. and you're right. we talked about it last year, how, again, the impact of covid did impact different parts of our business differently. while we had certain areas of our business, i just mentioned the higher-end erp, schools was an area that was definitely impacted a lot. and our business in schools was off last year. at the same time, i also mentioned last quarter that last year was a record sales year in our courts business. so it's a little bit of a -- it's just different across our business. you're right, the american rescue plan, i do expect there are some money that's specifically targeted for k-12 and higher education. i think there's about $160 million, $170 million targeted for that. and i think what we're starting to see, generally, is just the more receptiveness from our clients in the schools area in terms of getting rfps out, in terms of talking about deals. there was -- i'd say there was an area last year where it was, i wouldn't say silenced, but it was certainly muted a little bit, and that's certainly coming back. and to your point about readysub, you're right. that's a really exciting opportunity for us. it's kind of a small deal. and it's a deal that's not just -- you want substitute teacher application that can go in. it's also becoming more -- that type of application is becoming more and more of a requirement in our erp space for schools. and as i mentioned in my opening remarks, we have over 2,000 school clients. and right now, that application is only in about 20 of them. and it's sort of the same playbook we had. several years ago, we did the executime acquisition. we expect that we're going to be able to grow that product pretty well, and it will be great for our inside sales channels as well as new business.
rob oliver -- baird -- analyst
that's helpful, lynn. appreciate it. and then, brian, just a quick follow-up for you. conversions were up really nicely year-over-year. is that a function of things having frozen maybe in march and comp being easier or customers more willing to convert to subscription or kind of a mixture of the both? i know you guys are obviously leaning in more on subscription and subscription first, but just wanted to get a better handle on the dynamic there. thank you.
brian miller -- executive vice president, chief financial officer and treasurer
yes, it's really more the latter. the last two quarters have been really strong in terms of conversions picking back up again. and i think that's consistent with what we see in the new business market with more and more customers wanting to move to the subscription of the saas model. and as we've said, the complications of trying to remotely access some of these systems has certainly risen to the forefront during covid and increased customers' desires to move on-premises systems into the cloud. and our relationship with aws, our capacity that we have available through aws and is giving us an additional ability to push conversions more aggressively into our customer base.
rob oliver -- baird -- analyst
great. thanks again, guys.
operator
thank you. and the next question is from keith housum with northcoast research.
keith housum -- northcoast research -- analyst
good morning, guys. if i could unpack the backlog number just a little bit more. it looks like the -- or i'm sorry, the bookings number. it looks like for services, actually, the services bookings actually went down by about $25 million in the quarter. was there a cancellation in the quarter?
brian miller -- executive vice president, chief financial officer and treasurer
no cancellations, but you're talking about compared to last year?
keith housum -- northcoast research -- analyst
yes. i think the $247 million that you have in new bookings for the quarter, it looks like software and service bookings were actually down by $25 million.
brian miller -- executive vice president, chief financial officer and treasurer
yes. i think part of that is billable travel that runs through revenue and, therefore, through bookings. last year, we were still traveling through most of the quarter, so you're going to see part of that. that's probably about $5 million of it. i'd say that, in general, the -- as we move more to a cloud business, you typically see a little bit lower level of services with new cloud contracts. but i'd say most of that just goes along with the delays in some of the bookings. so along with -- both on the license and subscription side. but no, we have not seen any cancellations. there have been -- that's really held true throughout the whole last year. we've not seen any meaningful cancellations, either of contracts that are in progress or of projects in the pipeline, really just delays.
keith housum -- northcoast research -- analyst
okay. got you. and if i could unpack the nic numbers just a little bit more, it sounds like it was better than expected. if i heard what you say right, it was -- revenue was up, excluding the one-offs of tourhealth and the virginia pandemic assistance program, more than 10%. but yet, i think you said the enterprise revenue was up 20%. how was the transaction revenue for nic last year last quarter?
lynn moore -- chief executive officer, president
yes, keith, they're interactive governance services, which is, as you know, is transaction-based, that was up 16% year-over-year. so in the areas where they're really strategic and growing, they really had a really solid first quarter.
keith housum -- northcoast research -- analyst
great. glad to see that. and then you don't happen to have the dhr numbers as well, do you?
lynn moore -- chief executive officer, president
dhr was actually...
keith housum -- northcoast research -- analyst
device history records?
lynn moore -- chief executive officer, president
yes. no, i know dhr. i'm going off memory here. i believe dhr was up about 4% in the quarter, give or take, which was nice to see, given that i think it was the first time they've actually increased in the quarter and maybe four quarters. but as you know, that revenue is probably more stable. and again, when you look at interactive government services, their same-site enterprise revenues, that's really their growth drivers. and those were up nicely in q1.
keith housum -- northcoast research -- analyst
yes, absolutely. great. appreciate it. thanks for the color guys. good luck.
operator
thank you. and the next question comes from peter levine with evercore.
peter levine -- evercore -- analyst
great. thanks for taking my questions. so with the move toward cloud, we've seen it over the corporate side, the acceleration of the cloud with the idea that some employees will be given the flexibility of work-from-home, hybrid. obviously, cloud helps to enable that. curious if you're seeing or hearing similar trends on the public sector side. i'm sure there's a certain segment of public employees that could permanently be remote. but just curious now, could this be a catalyst to accelerate cloud adoption?
brian miller -- executive vice president, chief financial officer and treasurer
we had a hard time hearing the last part. sorry. you weren't coming through very clearly. could you repeat the last part of the question?
peter levine -- evercore -- analyst
yes. sorry about that. yes, just curious to know, does -- public employees, right? we've seen the trends on the corporate side where cloud acceleration with the idea that some employees will be given the flexibility, right? so obviously, cloud helps that. but curious to know, based on your conversations, are you hearing or seeing similar trends on the public sector side? what the idea is that could this potentially be a catalyst to accelerate cloud?
brian miller -- executive vice president, chief financial officer and treasurer
yes. i think that's definitely true. typically, you will see the public sector change and evolve more slowly than the private sector. so often those things that -- those trends that start in the private sector take a little bit longer to take hold in the public sector. but just like the private sector, our clients have had to move to doing things remotely. and that is, i think, a significant factor in their ongoing preference in new systems for the cloud and in the conversions from on-premise customers accelerating. courts is a great example where courthouses were physically closed and many of them still remain closed, but courts are an essential function. and so many courts that didn't have the ability to operate their systems remote were just shut down. and we have products, for example, our virtual courts product, that we accelerated, bringing to market early last year that enabled courts to continue to operate remotely, licensing and permitting functions where clients have old legacy -- not our clients, but public sector agencies have old legacy systems that don't allow for remote access. so you don't have people in the office processing building permits and those sorts of things that are slowing down activity. our systems provide for that remote access, and there's certainly an accelerated interest in those. so i think, yes, governments will, like the private sector, over time, look to work more remotely. and also, that's a factor with nic, the ability to interact with government and make payments remotely or online rather than coming to a government office. and as we've talked about their first quarter results, we're certainly seeing that increase in volumes as a result of that trend.
peter levine -- evercore -- analyst
great color. and then lynn, to piggyback off your prior comments on government budgets and the spending bill, any more detailed commentary you can share on whether state and local government budgets are opening up, i would say, more uniformly? or is it more of a state-by-state situation?
lynn moore -- chief executive officer, president
i don't know that i could attribute necessarily anything geographic. i would just say, generally, as a whole, we're seeing a lot of positive signs. we talked about on-site awards. we talked about rfps, particularly in certain areas of our business. take, for example, in the higher-end financials, our fees are up significantly over q3 and q4, even while they're still down from where they would have been pre-pandemic. and so that's an encouraging sign. there were a lot of big deals that we saw maybe in our appraisal space, maybe in our state space, that we knew these deals, we plan on these deals coming out in 2020. and those got shut down, and we're actually starting to see those getting released. so just generally speaking, it's -- there's a lot of encouragement. again, i wouldn't say we're quite over the hump yet, but let's get another quarter of seeing this activity, but i think there's general optimism. and i think it mirrors what's going on in the country. there should be a reason for optimism as people continue to get vaccinated, as businesses continue to open up, as money continues to start flowing, people start interacting. you're going to see that flow through our business as well.
peter levine -- evercore -- analyst
great. and if i could squeeze one more in. sorry,, brian, if i missed it. i hopped on late. but how are you thinking about the combined financials? and what impact, i guess, if any, i guess, specifically the writedown of nic's deferred revenue could have here in '21?
brian miller -- executive vice president, chief financial officer and treasurer
we're still working through all that process. that's one of the reasons we aren't providing the combined guidance at this time. i would say, in general, nic doesn't have a large deferred revenue balance on their balance sheet. their business is more transaction-based rather than software-based. but that's certainly one of the factors that we're looking at closely as we develop the combined guidance. but they do tend to have less deferred revenue than, say, a pure software company.
peter levine -- evercore -- analyst
okay. thanks for taking my questions.
operator
thank you. and the next question comes from jonathan ho with william blair & company.
jonathan ho -- william blair & company -- analyst
hi. good morning. just wanted to -- i guess, i'll make sure i fully understand this. so would you expect this quarter to potentially be the low watermark in terms of maybe year-over-year bookings growth? and do you potentially anticipate that there'll be a catch-up period once the pipeline starts to normalize even more so than it is today.
brian miller -- executive vice president, chief financial officer and treasurer
well, it's hard to tell exactly if it's a low watermark, but we did start to see declining bookings last year in q2. so i think our comparisons will now be against a -- start to compare against pandemic-affected quarters. so really, right now, we're comparing against what was not only the last sort of pre-pandemic or pre-affected quarter, unaffected quarter, but also what was just a very strong quarter with some large deals in it. we do think there would be a catch-up. it's not likely to be sort of a dramatic one quarter kind of a catch-up, but the combination of, one, the fact that these are essential systems and that the pipeline -- they remain in the pipeline, the timing has just been pushed out. so again, we're starting to see that increase in activity, those rfps starting to pick up again and some of those deals moving forward. so we do believe there's a catch-up. it is just a matter of timing.
we -- as we've said before, we also believe that, further down the road, that the -- there will be some procurements that will be accelerated that might have been -- clients might have thought they had years left in existing legacy systems and the need for remote access, security concerns around some of those legacy systems will be factors that will cause them to rethink that and accelerate the replacement of those systems. they'll still need to go through buying processes. they'll still need to budget those, but we do believe that there'll be a longer-term acceleration, but that the sort of pent-up demand in the current pipeline, that there will be an acceleration as that works its way out. and that would be consistent with what we saw in, for example, in the recession a decade ago.
lynn moore -- chief executive officer, president
jon, i'd just add there, too, that -- i like to look at the trends and look at the markets. and again, there's reason to believe the market is starting to come back. we talked about the great recession, but also what's our competitiveness disposition like in that market. and even while in the last 6, nine months, the markets have been off a little bit, our actual win rates have actually been climbing. and so our competitive position continues to grow. and as we look at bookings, we've talked about this a lot over the years, we have a pretty steady stream, but it's always -- there can always be some large skews in various quarters because we do have parts of our business that get some really large deals. last year, we were a little concerned about q2 of last year because q2 of '19, we had, i think, one of our largest deals in tyler's history.
and so that's kind of what we're competing against. and those large lumpy -- those large deals will always sort of throw off a little bookings number. but when i look back at sort of the underlying thing, what's the market doing, what's our competitive position, what's our win rates, that's all trending in the direction that we'd like to see.
jonathan ho -- william blair & company -- analyst
that's helpful. just one question on dataspec and readysub. how do you think about cross-selling those products and leveraging them across your existing clients? and maybe how big of an opportunity could these acquisitions be?
lynn moore -- chief executive officer, president
yes. so i'd say the -- they're a little bit different, the two acquisitions. they're both fairly small. readysub, like i mentioned earlier, that's probably more like the playbook out of executime. and that's a -- this is cloud-native platform. it's built in aws. it's actually -- the founders or former aws engineers. there's a clear need in that space. this is something that, to your point, we can go out and we can leverage and sell across our base pretty well. i don't know that i've got some good sort of markets for that, but it's an opportunity. and again, it's not just the opportunity of rolling out through our inside sales, but it will also help our competitiveness on new deals in the schools market as it's becoming more and more of a requirement. dataspec, i would classify it as a little bit more of a consolidation play. they were probably the leader in the veterans benefits application space. they had 32 state customers. that gives us a lot of credibility so that we can go out as we will eventually probably migrate those customers over to our entellitrak platform, and that just makes us the leader in that space and gives us more credibility as we look to expand in the federal markets as well as the state markets.
jonathan ho -- william blair & company -- analyst
thank you.
operator
thank you. and the next question comes from charlie strauzer with cjs securities.
charlie strauzer -- cjs securities -- analyst
hi, good morning. just a quick question for you. i know you're still working through guidance on nic, but hoping to get a little bit more color there, and also maybe timing as to when you think this quarter, you should be releasing the updated guidance at all. thanks.
brian miller -- executive vice president, chief financial officer and treasurer
well, we've said we'd expect to release it during the quarter. i would expect that to be roughly the end of may, beginning of june. so sometime in the next month or so, we would expect to be in a position to do that. nic, again, we're working through not only understanding what their current plans are for the year, but really how the integration with tyler, the ability to start to address some of our strategic initiatives and cross-selling opportunities and what we think the timing and size of those is and how much of that will go into this year. but they're off to a strong start. as we said, overall, 10% -- a little above 10% growth in their core revenues. they actually, on the covid-related revenues, significantly exceeded their plan on those, but we do expect those to wind down and not really be much of a factor after the second quarter. so their growth rate is a bit ahead of ours. and we talked about some of the strengths in their business from taking advantage of the increased desire of individuals and businesses to interact with governments digitally rather than in person. so generally, they have a positive outlook on the year. and within the next few weeks, we expect to have that combined guidance out and be able to talk more about the plans for working together through this year.
lynn moore -- chief executive officer, president
yes, charlie, if i could just add there, too, i think -- yes, i mean, this is obviously -- it's a top priority, right? i mean it's our largest acquisition of all time. and we talked a little bit about before, and i think brian mentioned in his remarks, we were in this period from signing and close this regulatory approval period. and you can take all sorts of approaches there, and we tended to take a more conservative approach. and i'd love to be able to share those numbers with you today. but it was because of that conservative approach, we're just not quite there yet. and the way i view it is we -- you know tyler very well. you follow us a long time. we're always interested in the long term. and the thought of even potentially jeopardizing or delaying that deal by getting a few weeks head start on some of the stuff, it just didn't seem worth it. but it is a top priority. i think we'll get those numbers out, as brian said, in about a month. but we know that it's going to be accretive to earnings. we know it's going to accretive to ebitda and all the things we mentioned before and the excitements there. and i appreciate if there's even a little bit of frustration, and part of it's just the timing around that we just closed in our earnings releases now. if we closed a month before earnings release, we've probably been ready to do this.
charlie strauzer -- cjs securities -- analyst
totally understand. thank you for that.
operator
thank you. and the next question comes from peter heckmann with d.a. davidson.
peter heckmann -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
hi. good morning. i understand, i would be looking forward to the combined guidance here in a few weeks, so i'll hold my questions on that until then. but just curious on the balance sheet. i mean tyler generates really strong cash flow. but would you expect to direct virtually all of free cash flow to debt reduction until you get to some threshold limit or -- and refrain from the buyback in the interim?
lynn moore -- chief executive officer, president
i don't think there's necessarily a predisposition toward that. i think we're always opportunistic. and i think, at this point in time, acquisitions, we've done 3. acquisitions will probably need to be a little more compelling. i'm not suggesting that we're done with acquisitions for the year, i think i mentioned that on q1. we talked a lot about nic, and i said we may not be done for the year, and we did dataspec and readysub. those were deals that were already in process. and so i would expect that we'll be a little more -- we may have a little bit higher bar, going forward, in the short term on that. and as it relates to share repurchases, again, we're opportunistic. we're very comfortable with our debt leverage right now. one of the things i talked about at the last quarter -- the last call was we want to make sure we retain flexibility. and i think we have that flexibility. and our combined cash flow, if we did solely dedicate it to debt, it would be paid off in fairly short order. but i always want to maintain the flexibility to invest in the business when it makes sense, to do acquisitions when they make sense and to do share repurchase when they make sense. and we've got that. and so you'll see us pay down that debt in a fairly aggressive manner, but we're going to have that flexibility, and we'll always have that flexibility.
peter heckmann -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
okay. that's fair. and then, brian, this may be jumping the gun to you with the question. but in terms of when nic renews a state portal contract or any large contract, would you expect to see them flow through bookings? or would it be like the texas e-filing deal where there's -- it's a little bit harder to quantify it given some of the terms?
brian miller -- executive vice president, chief financial officer and treasurer
yes, it's probably a little early to comment on that. we really need to dig into the terms of those. typically, when we've had contracts that are solely transaction-based like our e-filing that are on a per filing basis, they don't go into bookings at the inception. they just go in as those revenues flow through our income statement because there's not a fixed amount. it's really just our fixed fee e-filing that goes into booking, other than in the case of the texas renewal. so we'll just have to look closely at the terms of those contracts and see how they line up with how we report. so that's part of what we'll be doing as we move through the detailed integration over the -- as we prepare to report for the first time on a combined basis this quarter.
peter heckmann -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
okay. no problem. thanks.
operator
thank you. and the next question comes from brent bracelin with piper sandler.
clarke jeffries -- piper sandler -- analyst
hi. this is clarke jeffries on for brent. thanks for taking the question. firstly, i noticed the reacceleration of payments revenue, up 59% off of the strongest comp last year. wondering if we could get an update on the trends in that business. i know there were some impacts in the e-filing side of the house. but are the payment trends looking like it's steadily improving from here?
brian miller -- executive vice president, chief financial officer and treasurer
they are. there's some rebound in e-filing, although it's not dramatic. i think our e-filing revenues were up sort of mid-single digits. but as courts open back up, we would expect to see volumes pick back up there in that transaction-based business. that does typically have a payments component. but we've talked about our own payment initiatives over the last few quarters and how we are starting to -- with a sort of a newly refined go-to-market strategy, we are trying to push our payments platform into more of our customers, so increase the adoption. and we're certainly seeing increased adoption among their citizens in making payments online. we're adding new customers, and we're bringing in more payment types with those customers that do have our payments platform. so we're still in the early stages within the tyler business of performing against that strategic objective of significantly increasing our payments business. and we really look forward to seeing how we can use the nic payments platform and their expertise to help accelerate that. but the business on its own is doing well within tyler, and it's had really strong growth over the last couple of years. but again, still off a much smaller base than nic has.
lynn moore -- chief executive officer, president
yes. no, that's right, brian. as we roll out payments, you're going to see throughout the rest of the year as we get more and more of our solutions online in the payments. we've been doing that work. we started that last year. and as brian mentioned, really, it's -- while it's still small, small businesses tend to grow fast. and if you look at a three-year run rate, we're probably at three times the revenue as we were three years ago. and our q1 actually out-beat plan, and we were up year-over-year in q1 in our payments. so that's encouraging to see. and as brian mentioned, our e-filing revenues are actually getting back closer to pre-pandemic levels. they're getting closer to the 80%, 85%, 90% now levels of pre-pandemic. so that's all very encouraging.
clarke jeffries -- piper sandler -- analyst
great. and then i would say one thing that -- as we break part the nic business, that stood out is, i think, lynn, you mentioned this briefly on the 20% revenue growth on state-level contracts, is that same-state igs growth that averaged around 15% for the last two years? i'm just wondering if this is an asset that could potentially accelerate post pandemic as some of the dhr headwinds abate, and then you just have new opportunities with new states building off of revenue expansion with existing states.
brian miller -- executive vice president, chief financial officer and treasurer
they are. there's some rebound in e-filing, although it's not dramatic. i think our e-filing revenues were up sort of mid-single digits. but as courts open back up, we would expect to see volumes pick back up there in that transaction-based business. that does typically have a payments component. but we've talked about our own payment initiatives over the last few quarters and how we are starting to -- with a sort of a newly refined go-to-market strategy, we are trying to push our payments platform into more of our customers, so increase the adoption. and we're certainly seeing increased adoption among their citizens in making payments online. we're adding new customers, and we're bringing in more payment types with those customers that do have our payments platform. so we're still in the early stages within the tyler business of performing against that strategic objective of significantly increasing our payments business. and we really look forward to seeing how we can use the nic payments platform and their expertise to help accelerate that. but the business on its own is doing well within tyler, and it's had really strong growth over the last couple of years. but again, still off a much smaller base than nic has.
lynn moore -- chief executive officer, president
yes. no, that's right, brian. as we roll out payments, you're going to see throughout the rest of the year as we get more and more of our solutions online in the payments. we've been doing that work. we started that last year. and as brian mentioned, really, it's -- while it's still small, small businesses tend to grow fast. and if you look at a three-year run rate, we're probably at 3 times the revenue as we were three years ago. and our q1 actually out-beat plan, and we were up year-over-year in q1 in our payments. so that's encouraging to see. and as brian mentioned, our e-filing revenues are actually getting back closer to pre-pandemic levels. they're getting closer to the 80%, 85%, 90% now levels of pre-pandemic. so that's all very encouraging.
clarke jeffries -- piper sandler -- analyst
great. and then i would say one thing that -- as we break part the nic business, that stood out is, i think, lynn, you mentioned this briefly on the 20% revenue growth on state-level contracts, is that same-state igs growth that averaged around 15% for the last two years? i'm just wondering if this is an asset that could potentially accelerate post pandemic as some of the dhr headwinds abate, and then you just have new opportunities with new states building off of revenue expansion with existing states.
lynn moore -- chief executive officer, president
well, i think, brent, that's a good question. i don't know it's -- again, it's probably a little early for me to comment on their multiyear growth plans there as we're still doing our integration and getting our arms around 2021. but certainly, their igs services, their same-state enterprise revenues, those are growing areas for them and those areas that we think we can help complement them and help bring even further growth. so that would be my long-term expectation. i certainly don't have anything more specific in terms of guidance around that right now.
clarke jeffries -- piper sandler -- analyst
all right. great. and congratulations on the quarter.
lynn moore -- chief executive officer, president
thanks.
operator
thank you. and the next question comes from joe goodwin with jmp.
joe goodwin -- jmp -- analyst
great. thanks guys for taking the question and good morning. can you comment on how socrata performed? and then also, has there been any changes in the competitive environment maybe from some other more horizontal vendors with respect to socrata?
lynn moore -- chief executive officer, president
yes. no, socrata's performing very well. we -- one of the things that we've really put a focus on, really, the last 18 months or so is more, we call, cross-divisional bookings, but we're really pushing socrata through tyler's traditional sales channels as opposed to socrata's traditional sales channels. one of the most exciting opportunities, i think, with nic as well is the opportunity for socrata. socrata had a lot of state and federal customers on their own before they came to tyler. and with tyler, we've been focusing on driving that more at the local level. and there's a lot of interest at nic. i mentioned earlier about our management team's meeting earlier this week. and one of the big topics of conversation with socrata and the excitement around what they can do and push data insights at all the various state agency levels. and so i think the outlook there is pretty good. i don't know that i've seen anything specific about a competitor that's anything new or different. socrata has done a number of things in the pandemic, which has been helpful, but also there's been times -- we talked about delays. it's also been some issues in socrata. i felt the same thing the rest of our business has and has not grown quite as fast in the last years as we may have anticipated. but the future of socrata within tyler and our connected communities visions and what we're trying to do, which, again, i don't know that any other company has the ability to do it. it's an important piece of that, and it's something that provides a lot of excitement both within our clients as well as within tyler. so it's -- yes, it's doing well.
brian miller -- executive vice president, chief financial officer and treasurer
and, really, the ability to use that platform to provide advanced data and analytics capabilities within our existing tyler core solutions gives us such an advantage over the horizontal competitors that are strictly public sector-focused and don't have that deep integration with our core products. so we started with the erp and the analytics for finance. we've had great success with public safety. it's really created a competitive advantage for us with our new world public safety products by adding the socrata data and analytics layers. and now we're rolling it out with the appraisal and tax and with the assessment connect product that's adding value to our tax. so as lynn said, really focusing on driving it into our market, both through inside sales and in new sales by adding a socrata component to new software sales.
joe goodwin -- jmp -- analyst
great. thank you.
operator
thank you. and as we have reached a lot allotted time for questions, i would like to return the floor to mr. moore for any closing comments.
brian miller -- executive vice president, chief financial officer and treasurer
before we close, i'd like to add one clarification on an earlier question. there was a question about the $25 million decline in software and services bookings in q1 compared to q4 -- compared to q1 of last year. that's not just services, that's a combination of licenses and services. and most of that is related to licenses. again, we had some large license deals in q1 of last year. we saw a lower number of q1 licenses booked this year in q1. so the major part of that $25 million decline and probably about $20 million of it is in the license side and about $5 million in services, mostly related to billable travel services.
lynn moore -- chief executive officer, president
great. thanks, brian, for that clarification. and thanks, everybody, for joining us today. we hope you stay safe and healthy. and if you have any further questions, please feel free to contact brian miller and myself. thanks, everybody.

2021-Q2,TYL,2021-07-29 10:00:00,"prepared remarks:
operator
hello, and welcome to today's tyler technologies second quarter 2021 conference call. your host for today's call is lynn moore, president and ceo of tyler technologies. [operator instructions] and as a reminder, this conference is being recorded today, july 29, 2021. i would like to turn the call over to mr. moore. please go ahead.
h. lynn moore -- ceo, president & director
thank you, andrew. and welcome to our second quarter earnings call. with me today is brian miller, our chief financial officer. first, i'd like for brian to give the safe harbor statement. next, i'll have some preliminary comments on our quarter results, and then brian will review the details. i'll end with some additional comments, and then we'll take questions. brian?
brian k. miller -- executive vice president, chief finance officer & treasurer
thanks, lynn. during the course of this conference call, management may make statements that provide information other than historical information and may include projections concerning the company's future prospects, revenues, expenses and profits. such statements are considered forward-looking statements under the safe harbor provision of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from these projections. we would refer you to our form 10-k and other sec filings for more information on those risks. please note that all growth comparisons we make on the call today will relate to the corresponding period of last year, unless we specify otherwise. lynn?
h. lynn moore -- ceo, president & director
thanks, brian. first, i want to provide you with an update on the nic acquisition and our progress in the first three months post closing, and then we'll move on to a review of the quarter's results. as you know, we completed the acquisition of nic during the second quarter on april 21. with a purchase price of approximately $2.3 billion, this was by far our largest acquisition to date and our first acquisition of a public company. nic is a leading provider of digital government solutions and payment processing that serves more than 7,100 federal, state and local government agencies across the nation. we believe that the combination of nic and tyler provides tremendous opportunities for incremental growth in both businesses. the combined company is the public sector market leader for payment solutions and we plan to use nic's robust payment platform to expand our local government payments business. we also have an opportunity to leverage nic's strong relationships and state enterprise contracts to deliver tyler solutions at the state level, including our micropact entellitrak platform. we discussed our vision for those opportunities on our investor call in early june. i'm extremely pleased with the progress we've made toward these objectives in the three months that nic has been a part of tyler. our teams have prioritized our opportunities and are very engaged, working well together in a regular cadence. our pre-acquisition impressions regarding the high degree of compatibility between the cultures of the two organizations have thus far proven to be accurate and leaders in both organizations have commented on how natural the combination feels.
our payments teams are working together and have been very encouraged as we learn more about each company's strengths and how complementary they are. as we noted on our june call, the state of florida is a great example of the kind of opportunities we're pursuing. nic is in the process of implementing a statewide payment processing solution for the state government in florida. and the contract allows for local governments in the state, more than 400 of which are tyler clients, to piggyback on that contract and we are actively pursuing those opportunities. for the last two months, we've also been conducting weekly showcases to familiarize nic state enterprise managers with tyler's broad portfolio of solutions and to surface opportunities in their states. we have already developed a growing joint pipeline that is generating active engagements with prospects in nic states. and finally, our teams are actively working together to jointly establish the data and analytics platform for connected communities, leveraging our respective strengths, including our socrata data & insights platform and nic's gov2go citizen portal. together, nic and tyler can now provide the most expansive set of capabilities for citizens to interact with government at all levels. turning to the quarter. nic, like tyler, had a very strong second quarter as they continue to benefit from the recovery from the pandemic with a growing demand for citizens and businesses to interact digitally with government. nic also recorded higher than expected revenues from its tourhealth and pandemic unemployment initiatives, although those lower-margin revenues are currently expected to taper off in the second half of the year. although nic's results are only included in tyler's consolidated financials from the date of the acquisition on april 21, for the full quarter, nic's core revenues, excluding revenues from tourhealth and pandemic unemployment initiatives, grew 23.5%.
we're also very pleased to report that in late june, nic was selected as one of two vendors to provide the internal revenue service with a digital payment processing solution, which will allow individual and business taxpayers to securely pay their federal taxes. the contract has an initial 6-month term with four 1-year renewal options and revenue under the contract is expected to begin in january of 2022. the actual revenue will be driven by the number of taxpayers who choose to pay online and who choose to use the nic platform, and we expect to aggressively market our solution. we currently estimate annual gross revenue under the contract to be between $40 million and $60 million with annual net revenue of $5 million to $7 million after interchange and merchant fees. this contract significantly expands nic's payment processing at the federal level and underscores the strength of nic's platform and leadership in public sector payments. moving on to our consolidated results. our second quarter was very strong, reflecting the inclusion of the results of nic from april 21 with both core tyler and nic operations exceeding expectations. total revenues grew 49.1% driven by the inclusion of nic, as well as the acceleration of tyler's organic growth to 12.4%. recurring revenues comprised 79% of our second quarter revenues and were led by 133% growth in subscription revenues with the inclusion of nic. excluding nic revenues, subscription revenue growth was robust at 24%. software licenses and services revenues also rebounded from the low point in last year's second quarter, growing 17% or 7.6% excluding nic. as expected, our margins were down compared to second quarter last year as some costs and lower margin revenues, like billable travel, that declined in 2020 due to covid pandemic began to return. margins were also impacted by the inclusion of nic and particularly by the continuation of their lower-margin covid-related revenues.
as a result, our non-gaap operating margin declined 100 basis points to 26.5%. bookings in the second quarter grew 50% to approximately $464 million with the inclusion of nic. excluding nic, bookings rose 17.5%. our largest deal in the quarter was a combination license and saas arrangement with the colorado department of regulatory agencies valued at approximately $9.3 million for our entellitrak regulatory, socrata data & insights, and scenedoc mobile field inspection solutions as well as nic's electronic payment solution. and all those solutions will be hosted in aws. this deal is a great example of our ability to add value by offering multiple tyler products, many of which came from recent acquisitions, into a single deal, enhancing the competitiveness of solutions like entellitrak. we also signed a large public safety license contract with the lake county sheriff's office in illinois for our cad, rms, mobile, field reporting, brazos ecitation, softcode process service and socrata data & insight solutions valued at approximately $4.1 million. in addition, we signed four other license deals across multiple product suites, each with contract values greater than $1 million. saas contracts represented 65% of our new contract software value in the second quarter. our largest saas contract was a 5-year deal with dubuque, iowa, for our munis erp and energov civic services solutions valued at approximately $4.6 million. we also signed saas contracts for our munis erp solution with charles county, maryland, valued at approximately $4 million and desoto, texas, valued at approximately $3.5 million. we also signed a saas deal for our tyler supervision solution with riverside county, california, valued at approximately $3.3 million. this is the largest deal to date for our supervision product, which came to tyler through the acquisition of caseloadpro a little less than three years ago. and in fact, the value of the single contract is greater than the total annual revenues of that business when we acquired it. in addition, we signed nine other saas arrangements during the quarter, each with a total contract value of greater than $1 million. in addition to the irs payment processing contract, during the second quarter, nic signed extensions of its state enterprise contracts for digital government and payment processing services with the states of oregon and idaho. nic also signed a 5-year saas agreement for its rxgov prescription drug monitoring program solution with the province of new brunswick, canada, marking the first international deployment for that solution.
we're pleased to see the increased market activity and trends that reflect our markets are rebounding back toward pre-covid levels. now i'd like for brian to provide more detail on the results for the quarter.
brian k. miller -- executive vice president, chief finance officer & treasurer
thanks, lynn. yesterday, tyler technologies reported its results for the second quarter ended june 30, 2021. note that the results of dataspec and readysub, which were acquired on march 31, are included in our consolidated results for the full quarter and the results of nic are included in our results from the date of acquisition, april 21. in our earnings release, we have included non-gaap measures that we believe facilitate understanding of our results and comparisons with peers in the software industry. a reconciliation of gaap to non-gaap measures is provided in our earnings release. we've also posted on the investor relations section of our website under the financial reports tab schedules with supplemental information provided on this call, including information about quarterly bookings, backlog and recurring revenues. gaap revenues for the quarter were $404.1 million, up 49.1%. non-gaap revenues were $405.4 million, up 49.4%. on an organic basis, gaap and non-gaap revenues grew 12.4% and 12.3%, respectively. software license revenues rose 3.4%. subscription revenues rose 133%. excluding the contribution from nic, subscription revenues were still very strong, growing 24%. we added 170 new subscription-based arrangements and converted 62 existing on-premises clients, representing approximately $73 million in total contract value. in q2 of last year, we added 125 new subscription-based arrangements and had 42 on-premises conversions, representing approximately $39 million in total contract value. subscription contract value comprised approximately 65% of total new software contract value signed this quarter compared to 43% in q2 of last year. as we continued our shift to a cloud-first approach to sales, the value weighted average term of new saas contracts this quarter was 4.1 years compared to 3.7 last year. transaction-based revenues, which include nic portal revenues, payment processing and e-filing are included in subscriptions -- and are included in subscriptions, were $119.6 million, up 463%. that amount includes e-filing revenues of $16.3 million, up 14.5%. excluding nic, tyler's transaction-based revenues grew 24.1%.
for the second quarter, our annualized non-gaap total recurring revenue, or arr, was approximately $1.3 billion, up 58.2%. non-gaap arr for saas software arrangements for q2 was approximately $325 million, up 25.9%. transaction-based arr was approximately $479 million, up 463% and non-gaap maintenance arr was approximately $478 million, up 2.4%. our backlog at the end of the quarter was $1.63 billion, up 5.6%. because the vast majority of nic's revenues are transaction based, their backlog at quarter end was only $21 million. as lynn noted, our bookings in the quarter were very robust at $464 million, up 50.1% and includes the transaction-based revenues of nic. on an organic basis, bookings were strong at approximately $364 million, up 17.5%. for the trailing 12 months, bookings were approximately $1.3 billion, up 9.6%, and on an organic basis were approximately $1.2 billion, up 1.3%. our software subscription bookings in the second quarter added $15 million in new annual recurring revenue. cash from operations and free cash flow were both negative in the second quarter as q2 included approximately $19 million of acquisition-related costs. in addition, cash from operations and free cash flow were negatively impacted by the timing of cash collections by nic on behalf of government agencies prior to the close of the acquisition and remittances to the agencies post acquisition. this is purely a timing difference and will normalize in future quarters. our balance sheet remains very strong. during the quarter, we paid down $185 million of the debt incurred under our revolver in connection with the acquisition. we ended the quarter with total outstanding debt of $1.565 billion and cash and investments of $380.9 million. since the end of the quarter, we have repaid an additional $52 million on the revolver. and today, we have outstanding $1.513 billion of debt with a blended stated interest rate of 1.01%. we have raised our revenue and eps guidance for the full year of 2021, which is as follows. we expect 2021 gaap total revenues will be between $1.532 billion and $1.557 billion, and non-gaap total revenues will be between $1.535 billion and $1.560 billion.
we expect total revenues will include approximately $32 million of covid-related revenues from nic's tourhealth and pandemic unemployment services that are not expected to recur in future years. we expect 2021 gaap diluted eps will be between $3.68 and $3.81 and may vary significantly due to the impact of stock incentive awards on the gaap effective tax rate. we expect 2021 non-gaap diluted eps will be between $6.70 and $6.80. interest expense for the year is expected to be approximately $23 million and includes approximately $11 million of amortization of debt discounts and issuance costs. for the year, pre-tax noncash share-based compensation expense is expected to be approximately $102 million. we expect r&d expense for the year will be between $94 million and $96 million. fully diluted shares for the year are expected to be between 42 million and 42.5 million shares. gaap earnings per share assumes an estimated annual effective tax rate of negative 2% after discrete tax items and includes approximately $46 million of estimated discrete tax benefits related to share-based compensation, which may vary significantly based on the timing and volume of stock option exercises. our estimated non-gaap annual effective tax rate for 2021 is 24%. we expect our total capital expenditures will be between $48 million and $50 million for the year, including approximately $10 million related to real estate and approximately $22 million of capitalized software development costs. total depreciation and amortization is expected to be approximately $126 million, including approximately $89 million of amortization of acquired intangibles. now i'd like to turn the call back over to lynn.
h. lynn moore -- ceo, president & director
thanks, brian. as you can see, our team of professionals, including our new team members at nic, dataspec and readysub, executed at a very high level in the second quarter, driving results that surpassed expectations. as i've said before, i'm extremely proud of how our team members have responded to the challenges in the last 1.5 years with incredible grit, grace and resilience. and we're proud that tyler has recently been named a best place to work by publications in washington, d.c., colorado and mississippi, joining several other locations where tyler has received similar awards. we've continued to invest in, and in some cases, accelerate, all of our long-term strategic initiatives, in particular, our shift to a cloud-first approach with a focus on optimizing our products for the cloud and transitioning saas deployments from tyler data centers to aws. as a result, our competitive position has also continued to strengthen. we continue to see indications that our market is returning to normal, as many delayed procurement processes are moving forward and new processes are starting. rfps and sales activities such as demos are trending toward, and in some cases, exceeding pre-covid levels. while not a significant factor in q2, we expect that the $350 billion of aid to state and local governments and $167 billion of aid to schools under the american rescue plan act will provide a significant measure of relief to budget pressures faced by many of our clients and prospects and potentially provide a tailwind over the next two to three years. with that, we'd like to open up the line for q&a.

[operator instructions] the first question comes from peter heckmann with d.a. davidson. please go ahead
peter james heckmann -- d.a. davidson & co., research division -- senior vice president & senior research analyst
good morning, everyone. great to see a very strong quarter for both tyler and egov right out of the box. congratulations on the irs win. just curious, the -- if i'm looking at it correctly, the annual guide, which you just gave in june, but it didn't go up as much as the relative beat in the quarter. there's some elements in the quarter that were maybe more onetime in nature or was it affected just by the timing of the close of nic versus your original expectations? or do you think that there's something that we should be thinking about for the back half in terms of margins?
brian k. miller -- executive vice president, chief finance officer & treasurer
well, the -- i'd say one of the factors certainly is that we've increased the expectation around the amount of revenues, certainly both in this quarter and continuing on into the third quarter around the covid-related services that nic is providing. those have gone on a little bit longer. we expect they'd wrap up really in the second quarter and those are continuing on into the second half of the year. so that's part of the factor around the second quarter outperforming on the revenue side, but not expecting to see that same bump in the second half of the year. otherwise, we took up the guidance a bit. but typically, by the -- in the second quarter, we're not looking to raise numbers quite a bit until we have better visibility around the second half.
peter james heckmann -- d.a. davidson & co., research division -- senior vice president & senior research analyst
okay. okay. and then just -- again, congrats on the irs contract. that's a pretty good-sized deal and -- but do you believe it will be -- will you be recording it gross or net?
brian k. miller -- executive vice president, chief finance officer & treasurer
that's expected to be growth accounting. we're the merchant of record there, and we'll be responsible for the merchant and interchange fees. so it's a higher revenue number, but lower margin.
peter james heckmann -- d.a. davidson & co., research division -- senior vice president & senior research analyst
lower margin. so on a gross basis, maybe margins come through at high single digits or so.
brian k. miller -- executive vice president, chief finance officer & treasurer
yes. i mean if we're looking at -- we said sort of between $40 million and $60 million in revenues and the net revenue number kind of in the $5 million to $7 million range.
h. lynn moore -- ceo, president & director
yes, pete, of their larger contracts, irs and texas are -- will be on a gross basis. florida will be on a net basis when those revenues kick up starting late this year and really going into next year. thank you.

the next question comes from matt vanvliet with btig. please go ahead.
matthew david vanvliet -- - btig, llc, research division ---vice president & application software analyst
congrats on the quarter. lynn, i guess, in part of your closing, you mentioned that a significant amount of stimulus funds sort of still available to local governments in particular. but curious in terms of what you're hearing. a lot of that recently reported as being unspent and people looking at what kind of time duration that might actually entail. curious how much of that is sort of inspiring some of this uptick in rfps and sales activity. and then conversely, has any of the delays in the proposed infrastructure bill put a little bit of a pause in some of these as those governments look to see kind of what else might be coming before they spend some of these funds now?
h. lynn moore -- ceo, president & director
yes, matt. i think i probably read the same general editorial yesterday about the -- some of the unspent funds from the american rescue plan. i don't know that -- i think what it's done is it's provided confidence. we've talked before, the reality is, is that the impact of budgets was a lot less severe than before. those funds are still sitting there. some of those funds do have some timing elements with respect to when they need to be spent, and some of that is still tbd. i think when -- you're seeing the more releases in rfps, the things that we're seeing in the market, the more demos, the activity picking up, i mean, in some parts of our business really to pre-covid levels, some just almost getting back to pre-covid levels. i think a function of that, too, is just the general sentiment and mood out there. i think the american rescue plan provides that confidence. we're also, as you know, most of our clients are now in a new budget year. and i think with those expectations for more funding, they saw the real impact to their budgets from last year were not as severe. and i think just -- i think some of that's coming back. and i think you've just also highlight what we've talked about throughout the last 1.5 years is that the demand for what we do doesn't go away. it's going to be pent-up. and so we're starting to see that. so at a high level, that's what i'd say. and on the delays on the infrastructure bill, i don't know that that's really going to have much of an impact on what we see in terms of bids and rfps in our day-to-day business.
brian k. miller -- executive vice president, chief finance officer & treasurer
i'd add, the american rescue plan, they've got until the end of 2024 to spend that. in fact, they just are getting the first half this year and the second half a year from now of those funds. so there's still a lot of allocations and determinations within these governments around how they're going to spend that money. so as we said in the prepared remarks, we really haven't seen much of an impact in terms of new deals and things that are of a significant size that are specifically tied to those funds. most of the activity we're seeing today is more around the recovery of the -- or resumption of some of those delayed processes and things that would have taken place in the last year otherwise.
matthew david vanvliet -- - btig, llc, research division ---vice president & application software analyst
all right. very helpful. and then following up on a number of deals that you announced with, i guess, both legacy tyler and nic products. so congrats on that. but just curious in terms of sort of an update of where you're at in terms of the full integration of the sales teams, the go-to-market mechanism. are you just starting to get to some of that, and we can see more of these deals coming through? or do you think there's already been a lot of progress, and it's just more of getting through sales cycles from here forward?
h. lynn moore -- ceo, president & director
are you talking specifically with the nic integration?
matthew david vanvliet -- - btig, llc, research division ---vice president & application software analyst
yes, the integration of the go-to-market for nic into legacy tyler.
h. lynn moore -- ceo, president & director
yes. so the integration is going well. we talked about it on our -- i think it was our june update call. we've got a lot of excitement. we have -- our priorities, though, we really want to make sure that they -- we don't do anything to mess up the business. we make their plan, retain their staff, identify these initiatives, get the sales teams aligned and we're doing that. obviously, harry herington, their founder, he decided to retire. one of the key things that we first had to do was establish new leadership. we've done that. elizabeth proudfit's now leading that division. she's been with nic for over 20 years and been responsible for selling most of their major state enterprise contracts, including florida. as i mentioned in my comments, we've hit the ground running. our tyler teams are showcasing products really two to three a week with all of their state gms. our payments teams have gotten together and working on tyler technology integration plans, talking about how we can leverage nic relationships. i guess i'd say all that stuff is -- it's active. it's going on. the excitement continues to be there. i'll echo my comments from back in june, balancing expectations is -- if you've been around a long time, these things take time. but the excitement's there. and we are seeing and identifying joint opportunities. it takes a while for those to come to fruition. but like i said, every time our teams meet, the excitement only continues to grow.

the next question comes from scott berg with needham & company. please, go ahead.
scott randolph berg -- needham & company, llc, research division -- senior analyst
hello, lynn and brian, congrats on a good quarter. i guess two probably simple ones. the first question is on just general deal flow from the core tyler side when you talked about how things seem to be normalizing more toward prepandemic levels, the volume of deal flow certainly speaks to that in the quarter. i guess my question there, is that more just pent-up demand that's flowing out? or are you seeing a true normalization maybe of those cycles in the last quarter or 2? and then my second question, brian, is on your guidance for the year. the non, i guess, ongoing revenues from the tourhealth and the pandemic side from nic was increased from $21 million to $32 million for the year. did that mean the overall nic contribution for the year went up that much? or is it just maybe a shift in revenues within your expected contribution from that business?
h. lynn moore -- ceo, president & director
thanks, scott. i'll start. and i'd say it's a little bit of both. q2 last year was a slow year. and we talked about it in the last couple of earnings calls, about how the impact was really felt a little bit differently across different parts of our business. but what we're starting to see now is that the number of rfps are up significantly from q2 a year ago, up over 50%. trade shows are returning. our unsigned selections, which we don't talk about a lot, those are up significantly. the number of new deals, as you pointed out, that we signed this quarter was, i think, up over 30% from a year ago. when you look at areas like where -- i talked about the last few quarters, where we saw a little bit more slowdown was more in our high-end financials, our munis and our energov solutions. we're certainly seeing the momentum growing there. i think q4 was probably a low in those areas for rfps and selections, and those are up significantly. and remember, those types of deals, they generally take about three quarters from rfp to close. so there will continue to be a lag as we're seeing these rfps come up, but that's continuing other places like our lower-end financials, our incode. i think rfps now are actually back to 2019 levels. so it's there. it's a combination of pent-up demand, but also just the market returning.
brian k. miller -- executive vice president, chief finance officer & treasurer
and on the nic covid-related revenues, yes, that increase in our estimate of what those revenues will be for the year and the increase in what was actually recorded in the second quarter is -- was added to nic's revenue. so that's incremental to our estimates that we previously had for their full year revenues. unfortunately, with some of the resurgence of covid and the delta variant, there's more of a need for testing for a longer period with some of our clients than we had previously expected. and some of those agreements have been extended beyond when we expected that they would roll off. we still expect that they will taper down in the third quarter and pretty minimal revenues from those in the fourth quarter.
scott randolph berg -- needham & company, llc, research division -- senior analyst
excellent statement. congrats again.

the next question comes from charlie strauzer with cjs securities. please, go ahead
charles s. strauzer -- - cjs securities, inc. -- senior md
hi good morning lynn, if you could kind of talk a little bit more about the pipeline and length of the sales cycle. is that shrinking at all? and are you seeing a pickup at all in prospective clients from the rash of cyberattacks that have been in the news lately?
h. lynn moore -- ceo, president & director
first, i'm not sure i heard all that. the first question was about the pipeline. the pipeline is -- i think across all our major core apps, the pipeline is certainly returning. i don't know that it's -- i think there are parts of our business where it's back to full pre-covid levels and in some cases exceeding, some places, it's approaching there. so all the signs are right now out there, all the leading indicators that we talk about, demos and trade shows are coming back, rfps being released, deals without rfps. those are all up significantly sequentially quarter and significant year-over-year. so that's significant. and the second question was about -- i didn't quite catch the second question. charlie, could you repeat the second one?
charles s. strauzer -- - cjs securities, inc. -- senior md
yes, just with the rash of cyberattacks you've seen in the news, have you seen any pickup in the inquiries from your clients about maybe moving to the cloud more rapidly than they may have thought before?
h. lynn moore -- ceo, president & director
you know it's a good question. i think it's just all part of the overall equation. i think the increase that we've seen, i talked earlier about our financial solutions, munis and incode. i mean our new deals there are 85%, 90% saas. a couple of years ago, it was more like in the 50% range. i think it's just -- i think that's just a piece of the puzzle. i don't know that there's anything specific around some of those cybersecurity things, but security is a big part of it. but i think it's that, coupled with covid, coupled with just the general direction the market had been moving over the last several years.
brian k. miller -- executive vice president, chief finance officer & treasurer
this was, by a pretty good margin, the largest quarter we've ever had for flips or customers moving, or existing customers moving from on-premises to the cloud as well. and that's one of the factors, i think. not the sole factor, but a factor in that desire of customers to move to our cloud solution.
charles s. strauzer -- - cjs securities, inc. -- senior md
interesting. and then brian, you could just -- looking at the guidance a little bit, if you can give us a little bit more clarity as to how we should think about the cadence of the next few quarters? just kind of help us plot that a little bit better.
brian k. miller -- executive vice president, chief finance officer & treasurer
yes. the second half of the year, obviously, will include -- we only had a partial quarter of nic. so obviously, we grow in the second half from that. but i'd say, generally, we would expect, and also with the trailing off of the nic covid-related revenues in q4, i think we'll see both of those quarters above, obviously, the second quarter level, but the third quarter will likely be our highest revenue quarter and a bit of a drop-off from q3 to q4 as the covid business rolls off. so q3 is likely to be the highest quarter in terms of both revenues and eps. so there's a little bit different. generally, our fourth quarter is the highest, but there's somewhat of an anomaly there.
charles s. strauzer -- - cjs securities, inc. -- senior md

the next question comes from rob oliver with baird. please, go ahead.
robert cooney oliver -- robert w. baird & co. incorporated, research division -- senior research analyst
great. lynn, thank you guys for taking my question. i'll start with one for you. you've cited the colorado $9 million win, which included entellitrak and nic on aws. that's kind of a great signature win there. and i'm just curious if you can maybe to an extent that you can walk us through a little bit. was that -- i assume that was the tyler contract in oregon. was nic added on throughout the quarter? maybe talk about some of the dynamics there. it seems like a nice template for a pretty nice, meaningful subscription win here very early in the combination between the 2. and then i had a follow-up question as well.
h. lynn moore -- ceo, president & director
yes, that's right, rob. this is a tyler contract from the get-go, and it was -- it really emanated from our -- the micropact acquisition, our tyler federal business. micropact had relationships with nic even prior to our deal. and so it would not be unusual for them to have been in deals together. and so having them part of that is, as you say, it's a nice round out. it also -- i think it highlights -- we talk about a lot of these large deals and i mentioned it in my remarks, and it really highlights the value of our acquisition strategy over the years. i mean, when you talk about -- that's a deal that's -- it's our largest deal of the quarter. well, that's our entellitrak that came from micropact. it includes socrata, another recent acquisition, scenedoc, the nic payments. it includes our strategic alliance with aws. it is kind of a showcase deal for the quarter, and again, i think, validates our acquisition strategy and how it plays in the market even as it may take time for us to sort of build up and get these larger contracts that really put us in a competitive position that makes it difficult for others to compete with.
robert cooney oliver -- robert w. baird & co. incorporated, research division -- senior research analyst
great. that's helpful. and then i just had a follow-up. i mean, you guys have been pretty clear that payments is really the area where you're kind of leading in terms of -- i don't want to say low-hanging fruit because obviously it's not easy, but where you're kind of like leading the charge in terms of the integration. you did make a comment, i believe, lynn, about the florida master limited -- well, the florida opportunity. and i know that with nic sitting on 28 master enterprise contracts. just curious for any early color or indications around receptivity toward kind of the products being sold in there. and i know also those states are being recipients of some funds now. so just curious for any color around that.
h. lynn moore -- ceo, president & director
no, that's a good point, rob. and you're right. we talk a lot about payments, primarily because that was a big strategic initiative for tyler before we even started talking with nic. and what's interesting there is just as our teams get together, how complementary our products are and how the things that was on tyler's development road map were things that really nic had already not just done but perfected and things that tyler had already had with their systems were things that nic needed to do. but you're right, beyond payments, we talk about that a lot, but one of the things that makes us really excited is the ability to sell tyler products through those state contracts and really leverage those nic relationships. i mean, they've got very deep relationships at the highest levels of state government areas where really tyler just didn't have access. and i'm talking about governors and senior decision makers and you get in front of those people and we're able to get in front of those people and try to talk to them about, ""what are you guys trying to get done? what policies are you pursuing?"" and whether it's economic development or hhs or prison reform or whatever it is, and we've got the solutions to do it. and that's really the crux of what we're doing with these weekly showcases with tyler products. we have to educate all of these state, the state gms and the entire nic executive team as to what our portfolio is really all about and how we can leverage that. and i don't want to minimize that because we talk a lot about payments, but that is something that we see as significant upside.

the next question comes from jonathan ho with william blair & company. please, go ahead.
jonathan frank ho -- william blair & company l.l.c., research division -- technology analyst
good morning, congratulations on the strong quarter. i just wanted to maybe dig into some of the billable travel or some of the lower-margin revenue that returned this quarter. is there a way for you to maybe quantify for us maybe how much has returned and maybe what you expect in terms of, i guess, the rest of the year in terms of how that will come back?
brian k. miller -- executive vice president, chief finance officer & treasurer
yes. i don't have the number in front of me for billable travel. it's not significant. it's still well under what we typically did, which was about $5 million a quarter pre-covid. it's probably on the order of 20% of that has come back. but it's come back a little sooner than we expected, just as we're starting to see employees coming back to the offices. our customers are starting to want to see our salespeople and our implementation people in some instances back on site, and we still expect that we'll continue in most cases to deliver the majority of our implementation services remotely. there is a desire in an increasing number of customers to see people back on site. and so that's picked up even a little bit sooner than we expected. but certainly well under half of what it was pre-covid. public safety is probably one of those areas because the -- our clients never went home. the first responders and -- those agencies continue to work, and so they're ready to have us back on site as well. so we're seeing a bit of that come back, but still well under the pre-covid levels.
h. lynn moore -- ceo, president & director
yes. and jonathan, we're also -- we're doing things to try to incentivize more remote delivery of service as well in terms of pricing and things like that. and i think we're still trying to feel it out, as brian said. the expectation is we will not go back to pre-covid levels. there are parts of our business that really sort of still demand on site, as brian mentioned, public safety. but on the others, we're going to work with our clients and working in different ways to try to bring that down.
jonathan frank ho -- william blair & company l.l.c., research division -- technology analyst
thank you. and then just in terms of trying to understand a little bit better the advantages of some of the statewide acquisition contracts that you've signed. can you maybe help us understand how tyler can leverage those contracts? and maybe what the advantages of having those contracts over a traditional rfp process? what can you do with those that you couldn't do before? and what does that sort of make easier in the contracting process? thank you.
h. lynn moore -- ceo, president & director
so you're talking about the nic state contracts?
jonathan frank ho -- william blair & company l.l.c., research division -- technology analyst
yes.
h. lynn moore -- ceo, president & director
yes. so it's a couple of things. i mean those contracts that nic has done an amazing job over the years. it takes them a little bit longer, but really of establishing contracts that are extremely open-ended and as we like to use the term, hunting license. and so it allows those -- under those contracts to pursue a lot of different opportunities with a lot of different agencies and in some cases, even local jurisdictions. it allows them to push products. but more importantly, too, it also -- what they also bring is, as i just mentioned, is their deep relationships with different agencies and different higher execs at the state level, areas that where tyler just didn't have any exposure. and so it's leveraging those relationships, leveraging tyler's products, leveraging those open-ended contracts really creates a whole new opportunity for tyler that we've never seen before. an example would be we're having discussions with a particular state with some court solutions. and we're actually able to have conversations at an extremely high level at a place where tyler traditionally just had not been able to do it. and those relationships are coming from those state contracts. and i mentioned the state of oregon and the state of idaho as renewals for nic. and what's important there is the oregon contract, that's an extension, but that's an extension of a 10-year relationship. the idaho contract is a 2-year extension on a 22-year relationship. so these are very deep relationships that nic has done. getting these renewals is something you don't take for granted, and you've got to continue to deliver value. and i think the flip side of that is what tyler can bring is, as we continue to leverage those relationships and put more products, it will actually bring that more value to those contracts and further deepen those relationships so that those will continue to sustain and survive well into the future.
jonathan frank ho -- william blair & company l.l.c., research division -- technology analyst
[indecipherable] thank you.

the next question comes from keith housum with northcoast research. please, go ahead.
keith michael housum -- - northcoast research partners, llc -- md & equity research analyst
just two questions for you. one on the irs contract. i think i heard you say there's -- you're one of two vendors that have been picked. can you perhaps provide a little more color? are you guys splitting the revenue and the payment process here? or is there an opportunity to perhaps expand that down the road?
h. lynn moore -- ceo, president & director
yes. so you're right. so they went with two providers. no, it's not a partnership. what will be chosen is by the actual citizen or business who chooses to pay. it's not unlike there are certain areas with our e-filing where there, we may be the -- there may be multiple people who are providing that service even though the back end is through tyler. we'll be marketing and doing what we can. we'll be trying to provide the best service. what's interesting, though, is that prior to this contract, they had actually -- i think they had four vendors, none of which were selected here. there are three vendors. and both of us and the other vendor were new selections by the irs.
keith michael housum -- - northcoast research partners, llc -- md & equity research analyst
great. congratulations. and then looking at the nic growth, obviously, that was a strong quarter for those guys. was it more transactional based or would they -- are they having success with the platforms that they were developing prior to your purchase, the payments and the recreational license and such?
h. lynn moore -- ceo, president & director
yes. so i think they had, as you mentioned, a really great quarter. i think the revenue was up around 19%. and really, they really outperformed in a couple of areas. their state enterprise transaction revenue, which includes payments and also their outdoor licensing, their recreation.gov as more and more people are getting outdoors. it's just -- it's up significantly over a year ago. obviously, we also mentioned the covid-related services continue to outperform even as we expect those to taper off. but yes, it's that state enterprise transaction revenue, really payments, outdoor licensing and covid.
keith michael housum -- - northcoast research partners, llc -- md & equity research analyst
great, thank you.
operator
the next question comes from kirk materne of evercore isi. please, go ahead.
stewart kirk materne -- evercore isi institutional equities, research division -- senior md & fundamental research analyst
thank you very much. all right. lynn, can you just give us an update on how it's going in terms of moving more of your products over to aws at this point in time? when do you think you can have maybe a plurality of products running on aws and some of the benefits to the business model from them? i'm just trying to get a sense of how far along we are on that front.
h. lynn moore -- ceo, president & director
i'd say we're still in the early innings there. the expectation for me is, across our business lines, as we get into the second half of the year, we're going to start putting new clients there. we've still been over the last year, still been validating really sort of some of the costs. it's a project we call lighthouse where we've got -- we're taking existing clients across all of our core apps and we're putting them in aws, running them and verifying the costs and seeing -- obviously, we're doing things already to make changes to our products to make them run more efficient in aws, but this also helps provide a road map. and i think as you see going into next year, you're going to continue to see movement of new business into aws because the goal is to eventually move out of two tyler data centers to 1. so we're going to need to start bringing that down. we'll start with new business and then we will probably start accelerating our -- we've already been accelerating our flips, but at some point, put together a more robust migration for existing. but i'd say, overall, we're still in the early innings. and i think we'd probably be in a more better position to report on that kind of progress really starting next year.
stewart kirk materne -- evercore isi institutional equities, research division -- senior md & fundamental research analyst
that's great. thank you for that. and then, brian, just as sort of a point of clarification. i know you don't want to get anything '22 related at this point in time. but is it safe -- should we just be zeroing out the covid-related revenue from nic for '22 at this point in time? is that sort of the -- what you would advise us as we start thinking ahead to next year? i know you don't want to give anything formal, but it seems like that revenue is going to be pretty immaterial next year.
brian k. miller -- executive vice president, chief finance officer & treasurer
yes, that's our expectation now, that there won't be anything there next year.
h. lynn moore -- ceo, president & director
and to be honest, kirk, that's my hope because that means that covid is going away.
stewart kirk materne -- evercore isi institutional equities, research division -- senior md & fundamental research analyst
me, too. so it's all [indecipherable]. all right. congrats on the quarter.
operator
and we have a follow-up from matt vanvliet with btig. please, go ahead.
matthew david vanvliet -- - btig, llc, research division ---vice president & application software analyst
brian, just one quick follow-up. you mentioned the cash flow impact from some of the previously collected but then remitted funds for nic post close. could you just give us a sense for the magnitude there and how much it actually impacted cash flow in the quarter?
h. lynn moore -- ceo, president & director
yes, that was about $55 million, how much the reduction from the liability we had on the books for funds payable to clients, how much that went down from the time of acquisition to the end of the quarter. so pretty significant impact. that's just money that's passing through. so over the course of a longer period of time, that impact is 0. it comes in and goes out. but just the timing of it relative to what was on their balance sheet at the time of the acquisition and paid shortly afterwards ran through our cash flow statement to the tune of about $55 million.
brian k. miller -- executive vice president, chief finance officer & treasurer
yes, the gross versus net payments primarily, which also impacts margins.
h. lynn moore -- ceo, president & director
yes. passing through us.
brian k. miller -- executive vice president, chief finance officer & treasurer

the next question comes from joe goodwin with jmp securities. please, go ahead.
joseph p. goodwin -- - jmp securities llc, research division -- vice president & equity research analyst
hi guys, good morning. congrats on the quarter. just a quick question on the master contracts. great to see the renewals come through. but i guess now that nic is combined with tyler, does that motion of actually securing net new contracts or just new contracts with these states change at all? any commentary there would be great.
h. lynn moore -- ceo, president & director
i don't think there's a fundamental change in that process. and like i said, what i believe will happen over time is nic, as i said, they've done a great job of building these relationships. these are all very long-term relationships. they got to continue to deliver value. and what i think will happen over time is that as tyler is able to enhance that value, it will only -- i think it will only help to facilitate those renewals in the future.
joseph p. goodwin -- - jmp securities llc, research division -- vice president & equity research analyst
no otherwise, thanks.

hello, and welcome to today's tyler technologies third quarter 2021 conference call. your host for today's call is lynn moore, president and ceo of tyler technologies. [operator instructions] and as a reminder, this conference is being recorded today, october 28, 2021. lynn moore, please go ahead.
h. lynn moore -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, jason, and welcome to our call. with me today is brian miller, our chief financial officer. first, i'd like for brian to give the safe harbor statement. next, i'll have some comments on our quarter and then brian will review the details of our results. i'll end with some additional comments, and then we'll take questions. brian?
brian k. miller -- executive vice president, chief financial officer and treasurer
thanks, lynn. during the course of this call, management may make statements that provide information other than historical information that may include projections concerning the company's future prospects, revenues, expenses and profits. such statements are considered forward-looking statements under the safe harbor provision of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from these projections. we would refer you to our form 10-k and other sec filings for more information on those risks. please note that all growth comparisons we make on the call today will relate to the corresponding period of last year unless we specify otherwise. lynn?
h. lynn moore -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, brian. our third quarter results were exceptionally strong, building on the momentum we established in the first half of the year. this was our first full quarter including nic's results, and it was our best quarter ever by most financial measures. we achieved new quarterly highs in revenues, non-gaap eps, free cash flow, adjusted ebitda, bookings and backlog. total revenues grew 60.9% with organic growth of 7.6%. as a result of the surge in the delta variant, nic's covid-19-related revenues from tourhealth and pandemic unemployment initiatives were significantly above plan at $43.3 million.
we had expected those revenues, which have relatively low margins to wind down in the second half of the year, but we now expect they will continue into the first half of 2022. nic's core revenues grew 5% in the quarter. recurring revenues comprised over 80% of our quarterly revenues for the first time and were led by 183% growth in subscription revenues. excluding nic revenues, subscription revenue growth was robust at 23.9%, reflecting our accelerating shift to the cloud. we have now achieved greater than 20% subscription revenue growth in 55 of the last 63 quarters. software licenses and services revenues grew 13.9% or 2% excluding nic.
as expected, our margins compressed compared to last year's third quarter. some expenses like trade shows and employee health claims as well as lower margin revenues like billable travel that declined in 2020 due to covid pandemic have begun to return this year. margins were also impacted by the inclusion of nic and particularly, by the continuation of their lower-margin covid initiative revenue. as a result, our non-gaap operating margin declined 330 basis points to 25.3%. excluding nic's covid initiative revenues and related costs, our non-gaap operating margin was 26.8%. bookings reached a record high in the third quarter at approximately $601 million, more than double last year's third quarter. excluding nic, bookings grew 51.9%, with the biggest contributor being the $63 million renewal of our fixed fee e-filing arrangement with the state of illinois.
we're very pleased to report early success this quarter with joint sales efforts between nic and tyler solutions teams. we signed agreements with the virginia department of housing and community development valued at approximately $24 million to provide a digital and call center solution for tenant, landlord and third-party filing of rent relief program claims. we'll also provide administrative dashboards from our socrata data & insight solutions as well as payment processing capabilities. our largest software deal in the quarter also came from nic with $6.1 million saas contract with the west virginia division of motor vehicles for digital titling.
this new digital vehicle titling and registration management system will go beyond modernization and revolutionize how the dmv manages vehicles and interacts with businesses and citizens. in addition to the streamlining of nearly every vehicle-related process in place today, many legacy paper processes will be fully replaced with secure digital solutions. the solution utilizes technology to govern and secure the vehicle ownership process, adding security, reducing fraud and providing the flexibility that other state dmv's operations are lacking.
the arrangement, which leverages our state master agreement has an initial term of five years. in addition to the saas fees, the agreement will generate estimated transaction revenue of more than $3 million per year. i'd like to also highlight a few more significant deals signed this quarter. we signed appraisal services contracts with the delaware counties in new castle and kent. in addition, new castle county selected our iasworld appraisal solution under a saas arrangement. the deals have a combined value of approximately $19 million. coupled with the appraisal services contract signed last quarter was sussex county, tyler will now be performing a property reassessment for the entire state.
also for our iasworld property tax and appraisal solution, we signed saas arrangements with the regional municipality of wood buffalo in alberta, canada, valued at approximately $3.1 million. franklin county, ohio, valued at approximately $3.5 million and summit county, ohio, which also includes our data & insights solutions, valued at approximately $2.9 million. other major saas deals included a $4.5 million contract with arlington heights, illinois for our erp civic services and payment solutions and a $3.4 million contract with bayer county, texas for our odyssey, softcode and supervision justice solutions. our largest perpetual license contract for the quarter was a $5.4 million contract to provide our micropact and entellitrak solution to manage covid vaccination at stations for the u.s. department of justice.
we also signed a $2.5 million on-premises license contract with the commonwealth of the northern mariana islands for our munis erp and enterprise asset management, executime and socrata solutions. we also signed several significant contract renewals with existing clients, including extensions of nic's state enterprise agreements with the states of utah and oklahoma, and a five year renewal of our e-filing arrangement with the state of illinois, which was expanded to include applications from our socrata data and insights platform. on last quarter's call, we reported that nic had been selected as one of two vendors to provide the internal revenue service with a digital payment processing solution that would allow taxpayers to securely pay their federal taxes, and that revenue under that contract was expected to begin in january of 2022.
following the award, three entities filed protest with the gao. prior to any ruling on the protest by the gao, the irs notified the gao that it was canceling the two awards, including the award to nic. while the irs has not formally terminated nic's contract, it has issued a stop work order under the contract. the irs indicated that it will either amend the current solicitation, allowing all bidders to modify their previous submissions and then reevaluate the proposals or terminate the existing solicitation and start the process over with a new procurement in the coming months. the irs has not yet stated which of these options it will select and we have no information regarding the potential timing of either option. given these recent developments, we do not expect to recognize any revenue under the irs award in 2022.
while the specific concerns raised in the protests have not been made public and are not known by tyler, the decision to cancel the award to nic was not related to nic's performance under the contract, its ability to successfully perform under the contract or any allegations of misconduct or improper behavior by nic. on the m&a front, we completed the acquisitions of vendengine and arx during the third quarter. vendengine is one of the fastest-growing technology companies in north america, operating in more than 230 counties and 32 states. its leading cloud-based platform provides a comprehensive suite of applications focused on the corrections market, including deposit technologies for commissary, ordering and warehouse management and various informational electronic communications, security, accounting and financial trust management components.
arx is a cloud-based software platform, which creates accessible technology to enable a modern day police force that is fully transparent, accountable and a trusted resource to the community it serves. the acquisition of arx allows tyler to offer a full suite of public safety solutions, including arx alert and arx community, designed to maximize efficiency and safety for law enforcement officers while increasing transparency and trust building with communities. vendengine and arx have combined arr of approximately $17.5 million and their additions further strengthen tyler's justice and public safety suites.
now i'd like for brian to provide more details on the results of the quarter.
brian k. miller -- executive vice president, chief financial officer and treasurer
thanks, lynn. yesterday, tyler technologies reported its results for the third quarter ended september 30, 2021. in our earnings release, we have included non-gaap measures that we believe facilitate understanding of our results and comparisons with peers in the software industry. a reconciliation of gaap to non-gaap measures is provided in our earnings release. we've also posted on the investor relations section of our website under the financial reports tab, schedules with supplemental information provided on this call, including information about quarterly bookings, backlog and recurring revenues. gaap revenues for the quarter were $459.9 million, up 60.9%. non-gaap revenues were $460.6 million, up 61.1%. on an organic basis, gaap and non-gaap revenues grew 7.6% and 7.5%, respectively.
software license revenues rose 13.7%. subscription revenues rose 183.3%. excluding the contribution from nic, subscription revenues were still very strong, growing 23.9%. we added 144 new subscription-based arrangements and converted 67 existing on-premises clients, representing approximately $84 million in total contract value. in q3 of last year, we added 114 new subscription-based arrangements and had 46 on-premises conversions, representing approximately $56 million in total contract value. subscription contract value comprised approximately 74% of total new software contract value signed this quarter compared to 47% in q3 of last year, reflecting our ongoing shift to a cloud-first approach to sales. the value weighted average term of new saas contracts this quarter was 3.4 years compared to 4.3 years last year.
transaction-based revenues, which include nic portal, payment processing and e-filing revenues and are included in subscriptions, were $171.2 million, up more than sixfold from last year. e-filing revenues reached a new high of $17.4 million, up 15%. excluding nic, tyler's transaction-based revenues grew 24.3%. for the third quarter, our annualized non-gaap total recurring revenue, or arr, was approximately $1.5 billion, up 79.2%. non-gaap arr for saas software arrangements for q3 was approximately $330 million, up 24.7%. transaction-based arr was approximately $685 million, up 639%. and non-gaap maintenance arr was flat at approximately $471 million.
our backlog at the end of the quarter was $1.77 billion, up 14.3%. because the vast majority of nic's revenues are transaction-based, their backlog at quarter end was only $27 million. excluding the addition of nic, tyler's backlog grew 12.6%. as lynn noted, our bookings in the quarter were very robust at $601 million, up 105.7% and includes the transaction-based revenues of nic. on an organic basis, bookings were strong at approximately $444 million, up 51.9% fueled by the renewal of the state of illinois fixed e-filling filing arrangement of approximately $63 million and the addition of the two delaware appraisal deals totaling $19 million. for the trailing 12 months, bookings were approximately $1.6 billion, up 31.3%. and on an organic basis, were approximately $1.4 billion, up 10.8%. our software subscription bookings in the third quarter added $19 million in new annual recurring revenue.
cash from operations and free cash flow were both record highs for the third quarter at $205.4 million and $192.8 million, respectively. our balance sheet remains very strong. during the quarter, we repaid the outstanding balance of $65 million on our revolver and paid down $57.5 million on our term loans for a total debt reduction of $122.5 million. we ended the quarter with total outstanding debt of $1.428 billion and cash and investments of $348.4 million, and net leverage of approximately 2.3 times trailing pro forma ebitda. we expect the net leverage to be approximately two times by year-end. we have raised our revenue and eps guidance for the full year 2021 to reflect our strong year-to-date performance and our expectations for the fourth quarter. we expect 2021 total gaap revenues will be between $1.577 billion and $1.597 billion, and non-gaap total revenues will be between $1.580 billion and $1.6 billion.
we expect total revenues will include approximately $72 million of covid-related revenues from nic's tourhealth and pandemic unemployment services that are expected to wind down in the first half of 2022. we expect 2021 gaap diluted eps will be between $3.55 and $3.63 and may vary significantly due to the impact of stock incentive awards on the gaap effective tax rate. we expect 2021 non-gaap diluted eps will be between $6.94 and $7.02. other details of our guidance are included in our earnings release.
now i'd like to turn the call back over to lynn.
h. lynn moore -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, brian. i'm extremely pleased with our third quarter results, both from tyler's core operations and from nic in its first full quarter as part of tyler. when we spoke to investors in june, we discussed four priorities around the nic acquisition for 2021. first, don't mess up the business; second, achieve our 2021 plans for both businesses; third, retain nic staff and establish a long-term leadership team; and fourth, identify and launch joint strategic initiatives and get our sales teams aligned. i'm happy to say we are executing on all of those objectives.
both businesses are executing at a high level and are exceeding our 2021 plans. the nic team under the leadership of elizabeth proudfit is enthusiastic about the combination and the opportunities ahead with tyler. and we've hit the ground running, with teams actively working on integration and go-to-market strategies. we're showcasing tyler products to nic's entire state general manager team, and nic's general managers are providing detailed reviews of the nic state enterprise contracts and relationships for tyler's team. we've also established a payments technology integration plan and are in the process of finalizing the joint tyler nic payments organization.
we've already had some early success in joint opportunities, such as our contract with the colorado department of regulatory agencies that includes nic payment processing, tyler's entellitrak regulatory solutions and our socrata data & insights platform, as well as the recent nic contract with virginia for a solution for the rent relief program, which also includes tyler socrata applications. we have a current pipeline of more than 40 qualified sell-through opportunities with nic's state enterprise market across multiple tyler solutions and have identified tyler sales opportunities leveraging nic state enterprise contracts, to speed up the time from award to contract. we're also beginning to build our combined payments pipeline with early sales in florida and louisiana.
we continue to see positive trends in public sector market activity. indicators such as proposals, sales demonstrations and pipelines are all up significantly from 2020 and are generally at or, in some cases, above pre-covid levels. our competitiveness remains strong as reflected by high win rates across our major applications. while not yet a significant factor, we're starting to see purchasing activity that is identified as being funded through the federal stimulus under the cares act and american rescue plan. we expect that the $350 billion of aid to state and local governments and $167 billion of aid to schools under the american rescue plan act will provide a significant measure of relief to budget pressures faced by many of our clients and prospects and potentially provide a tailwind over the next two to three years.
a survey by the national association of cios indicated that most state cios expect that remote work will continue and the need for digital services will increase. cios said they plan to modernize legacy systems in the next two years with human services and public welfare, labor and employment and health services noted as priorities. tyler is well positioned to help public sector leaders address those needs. we also remain on track with our r&d projects around our cloud initiative and with our progress toward hosting new saas implementations and on-premises conversions in aws. our cloud operations team is engaged in 2022 planning with a focus on continued product optimization, data center migration and operations maturity.
finally, i want to welcome the newest member of tyler's executive leadership team, kevin iwerson, who joined tyler earlier this month as chief information officer. kevin is a seasoned it leader with experience managing technology infrastructures for corporations, statewide judicial courts, statewide executive government agencies and u.s. military organizations, most recently serving as cio for the idaho judicial branch. kevin will work closely with our former cio, matt bieri, until matt's retirement early next year. i'd also like to express our deep appreciation to matt for his tremendous leadership of our it and hosting organization over the last 11 years and wish him the best in his retirement.
with that, we'd like to open up the line for q&a.

[operator instructions] our first question comes from matt vanvliet from btig. please go ahead.
matthew david vanvliet -- btig, llc -- analyst
hey. good morning, guys. thanks for taking the question and nice job on the quarter. i guess pertaining to the commentary that was in both the press release and you've talked about this morning in terms of some of the stimulus funding finally sort of making its way into the market. wondering if you could give us some additional color in terms of where you're seeing some of that coming through now? where are some of the newer sales activities pertaining to jurisdictions that feel like they have more budget to spend and maybe you're looking at nic to have types of projects? and anything additionally around types of products that they're most interested in, in terms of using that funding?
h. lynn moore -- president and chief executive officer
yes, sure, matt. it's a good question. it's something that we're starting to track a little bit more. i'd say you're seeing it really across a lot of our solutions, but i think we've seen a lot really on the enterprise side. we're seeing a little bit in schools, and we've seen some over on nic. i think right now, if you look at q3 and q4, there are a few dozen deals out there that are certainly being spurred right now through some of that federal stimulus spending. and i'd expect some of that to continue.

great. and then following up, i guess, on the exact sort of contribution of what the nic business is looking like in the guidance for kind of the full year, what the contribution looks like, understanding that some of that was one time. but brian, if you could help us just kind of what the underlying core business is contributing there? and kind of what the growth continues to look like on a forward basis?
brian k. miller -- executive vice president, chief financial officer and treasurer
yes. so excluding nic, the current guidance would have tyler's forecast, i guess the midpoint of our guidance would be around $1.224 billion of revenues, and that would be the midpoint around 9.5% growth for the full year. and that would imply, again, at the midpoint of our guidance, around 11% growth for the core tyler operations in the fourth quarter. in nic, as we had discussed, the covid-related initiative revenues have continued beyond when we thought even at the end of last quarter, they would wind down. we had a -- at the end of last quarter, our guidance had about $17 million for the second half of the year, and we did $43 million under those initiatives in q3 and expect the full year to be about $72 million. so about another $13 million or so in the fourth quarter. and some of that then continuing on into next year. but nic's core growth, excluding this core -- those covid initiatives was around 5% in the fourth quarter -- i'm sorry, in the third quarter. and there is some seasonality in their fourth quarter core operations, particularly around the holidays and some of the transaction volumes tend to fall in the fourth quarter. so their fourth quarter probably is what -- our guidance reflects that in the fourth quarter numbers.
matthew david vanvliet -- btig, llc -- analyst
all right. great. thanks for the color. i appreciate taking the question.

the next question comes from scott berg from needham & company. please go ahead.
scott randolph berg -- needham & company -- analyst
hi lynn and brian. congrats on a really good quarter here. i guess, i got several questions. bookings were quite strong in the quarter, especially excluding nic. lynn, if we dissect those a little bit, how much of the bookings in the quarter are maybe catch-up deals that were pushed from the earlier stages of the pandemic just in the current period? are you kind of seeing more of a return to a normalized deal cadence here, which you've been enjoying for last decade or so?
h. lynn moore -- president and chief executive officer
yes. i think it's a combination of a couple of things, scott. we did have a couple of very large deals that we signed in the quarter, which obviously were absent in q3. q3 was difficult last year. but i think as i mentioned in my comments, when you look at the market activity and what i've talked about over the last several quarters is over the last 18 months or so, the pandemic has sort of affected different parts of our business a little bit differently. some were hit a little bit harder. and i think i've mentioned before that if you look at, for example, our mid- to higher-end financials, our munis product, that was an area that was hit a little bit harder. and what you're seeing there, for example, is you're seeing awards and deals that are actually exceeding pre-covid levels. and i think that's the example of what you just mentioned, which is -- it's really the example that both pent-up activity as well as, i think, sort of validate some of the investments and some of the strategy that we've been doing over the last couple of years.
scott randolph berg -- needham & company -- analyst
excellent. and then from a follow-up perspective, brian. on the guidance for the year, if i back out the added revenues expected from nic, it looks like your core tyler guidance is roughly flat for the year. how are you thinking about kind of deal mix around subscription versus license deals because the bookings were certainly strong. i guess i would have maybe expected a little bit more increase in kind of the core tyler revenues, but that's probably related to maybe stronger subscription bookings mix than maybe what you're previously expecting?
brian k. miller -- executive vice president, chief financial officer and treasurer
yes, i'd say that's accurate. we're generally expecting the mix to continue to trend toward an increasing percentage of saas. now the fourth quarter, as you know, typically is a strong quarter for public safety, which still is primarily on premises. and so that tempers that a bit, but that also was the case last year. but in general, we expect an ongoing continuation of the trends we've seen where a higher percentage of the mix is fast.
h. lynn moore -- president and chief executive officer
yes. i think i'd add there, scott, that it's -- the amount of saas has actually even exceeded our going into year expectations. and while we expected the market to be moving this way, we've talked before the pandemic has certainly accelerated that. and you look at areas, i'll mention munis again. i mean, we're north of 85% of our deals are saas now. you look at our lower-end financials and encode, north of 80%, where last year, they were 50%. so there is some of that headwind. i think as the model continues to play out, we'll get on the other side of that.
scott randolph berg -- needham & company -- analyst
excellent. thanks for the color. great quarter, guys.

the next question comes from ethan bruck from wolfe research. please go ahead.
aleksandr j. zukin -- wolfe research -- analyst
i think this is -- it's alex here from wolfe. so a couple of questions for me. first, if we think about the -- i wanted to ask about the maintenance revenue in the quarter. the maintenance revenue was, i think, down a bit sequentially. are you starting to see -- is that conversion activity starting to pick up a little bit? and how should we think about it in q4 and beyond?
brian k. miller -- executive vice president, chief financial officer and treasurer
yes. i think that's accurate. so each of the last couple of quarters have been new all-time highs for us in terms of the number of conversions. and certainly, when you look back at the last four quarters, which all kind of filter into the maintenance growth. the last four quarters have well exceeded the flips or conversions that we saw in the prior year. and just as the new business is shifting toward more saas, there's an increasing interest in on-prem customers flipping. so that does have a negative effect on maintenance. but generally, the revenues that are going into the subscription side, as they flip, is about 2 times what the maintenance was.
so that's a component on the other side of the high growth in subscriptions. and then you look at the mix of new business over the last year as it continues to shift toward more saas and less license that has an effect on the growth as well. and then the last thing is some attrition around a legacy product at -- in the federal business where the federal government has mandated some states to move off of our product and on to a federal-provided product that's had a bit of an impact there as well. so -- but the flip, i'd say, the biggest impact, those ongoing conversions, and that will continue to be the case. and at some point, over the next couple of years, likely be a significant acceleration on those as we have the ability to accelerate that through moving those customers into aws.
h. lynn moore -- president and chief executive officer
yes, i think, alex, i guess to summarize, if you look out over the next couple of years, you'll see that subscription revenue line continuing to grow at an increasing pace. conversely, you'll see licenses contract proportionately and maintenance will probably continue to flatten out, as brian mentioned, as those annual increases started getting offset by flips, which our flips are up significantly year-over-year from last quarter.
aleksandr j. zukin -- wolfe research -- analyst
perfect. and i guess maybe on the nic side. so as -- you talked a little bit about the increasing synergy opportunities that you're starting to see in the base. when should we think about -- like when we think about that 5% growth for that core nic business that you talked about, is that something -- like how should we think about that trending or -- is an acceleration that is going to be you guys think is sustainable from that level from here kind of ex the onetime revenues from covid? and on the covid impact, is there any reason why we do think that they end in the first half next year? or are there any of those that actually have the potential to be more durable given the variability of mandates?
h. lynn moore -- president and chief executive officer
yes. i'll start with the last one. i guess i would say on a personal note, i think i said before, i wouldn't be -- i'd be happy if it ended. that means that covid is getting further in our rearview mirror. it's our expectation. the revenues right now are primarily out of three areas. it's out of the state of south carolina, where they're the primary -- doing the primary testing. also, in the state of nevada. and then we've mentioned the virginia unemployment release stuff.
the expectation is -- i mean, it is a little bit of a guess, but it's an educated guess, and we're assuming that, that will wind down. what's interesting about the south carolina revenues is that we'll move from a contractor role to a subcontractor role. so while those revenues will still continue and eventually taper off, i think our margins on those will increase. i think what's important about the covid initiative though is it really shows the ability of nic's team to innovate, it shows their agility, and it also shows the relationships that they have with their state enterprise contracts, if they could spin these things up quickly and create new solutions.
and i think that's what's exciting. when you talk about -- i think your first question was about growth rates going forward. we're excited. i can't tell you how excited the sales teams are as they meet, they get together. i think as we move forward, and we talk about selling all of our different products through the nic sales channels and conversely, what we can bring to nic. but you think about with tyler payments and we're already seeing a lot of our socrata data & insights and entellitrak platform, public safety and civic and munis, all those deals are in the pipeline.
and i don't know that going forward, we'll always be able to sort of segregate these were nic deals because these are tyler products going through them, would probably, at some point, won't continue to isolate nic revenue growth. but what we see overall with tyler is, as part of this acquisition and part of the underlying rationale is that we believe it will help drive tyler's overall revenue growth at a higher level than it would have on its own.
aleksandr j. zukin -- wolfe research -- analyst
that's super helpful. and then the last question, i wanted to ask about the irs contract. is there a way to dimensionalize at least what the expectation may have been for that revenue stream in '22 before the cancellation of the agreement? and any thoughts for us in terms of how we should think about modeling that for next year?
h. lynn moore -- president and chief executive officer
i'll start, but i don't know if you have the number. but the revenues in -- the expected revenues in 2022, we have a number, brian, will get it. but a little bit was uncertain because how fast we could get up and running and with the payments starting early in the year. the real revenue, i think, expansion was going to happen in the later years of the contract. there were some significant revenues expected. and to be honest, it's my expectation that this procurement will come back out in the -- sometime this year. we'll bid it again. and for the reasons we won the first time, we should be extremely competitive going forward. brian, do you have the number.
brian k. miller -- executive vice president, chief financial officer and treasurer
yes. we talked about that last quarter when we had gotten the award. and i believe the number was -- there were multiple providers, and i believe the number was $40 million to $60 million in gross revenues and something more, i think, in the $5 million to $6 million range on a net basis after all the interchange fees. but we currently expect that -- well, we're virtually certain that there won't be any revenues in 2022 that while the irs works through this procurement process that the existing vendors will be held in for another year. so those weren't in a -- none of those revenues have started already, so there was nothing in our current base that goes away. but it's pretty clear that won't be a 2022 impact at this point. and we'll see how fast the new procurement takes place.
aleksandr j. zukin -- wolfe research -- analyst

the next question comes from charlie strauzer from cjs securities. please go ahead.
charles s. strauzer -- cjs securities -- analyst
hi, good morning. a quick question for you. i know you don't like to give out formal '22 guidance until the next call, but maybe you've some early thoughts on what you're thinking about for next year?
h. lynn moore -- president and chief executive officer
well, you're right, charlie. we don't like to get out ahead of ourselves. we -- right now, we are well into our 2022 planning. there's a lot of variations, a lot of factors that go into that. we're still in the early stages. i'd say, we're kind of on track with our normal planning process. i really expect to have better information later this year. and i think it's just a little too early right now to go ahead and forecast 2022.
charles s. strauzer -- cjs securities -- analyst
that's fair. no problem. and then just looking at the labor side, a lot of companies having labor issues, trying to find new qualified people. i'm sure you're not immune to that as well. maybe talk a little bit about the labor side. any difficulties you're having there that's causing wage inflation, etc?
h. lynn moore -- president and chief executive officer
yes, charlie, i think that's a good point. it's -- we're all reading in the news what's going on across multiple industries. the labor market is certainly evolving right now. there's staffing pressures, there's wage pressures. and that said, tyler hasn't been immune to that. i think there's still a little to figure out about how permanent this is versus how transitory it is. you're seeing people leaving careers for lifestyle changes.
we call them sort of covid casualties. you're seeing competition for wages, and more people are now being more accepted to flexible work and work from home that you're seeing people come in and go into markets that they may not have traditionally tried to hire people from. and we're dealing with that as well. i think if you look across a lot of our business units, we're staffed a little bit under plan. our hr team and our recruiters are doing a really good job responding to this. working really hard. but it is something that it's top of mind. it's something that we discuss at the executive level. and you're right, tyler has not been immune to it.
charles s. strauzer -- cjs securities -- analyst
and just picking up a little bit more when you look at your current employment base, are you still asking people to kind of move back on site into the offices this fall?
h. lynn moore -- president and chief executive officer
yes. so we're on track to sort of -- we've taken a phase-based approach, and we've taken a locally phase-based approach as the -- each jurisdiction is a little bit different in the way they've handled it. and so essentially, we're on track right now to sort of come back to what we would call full back in the office at the first of the year. what that means is probably not exactly what it meant before covid. there will be a little bit more flexibility. that's part of the market today. and so i'd expect some of that going forward.
charles s. strauzer -- cjs securities -- analyst
great. thank you very much.

the next question comes from rob oliver from baird. please go ahead.
robert cooney oliver -- robert w. baird -- analyst
my question -- first question is, lynn, on public safety, just wanted to dive into that a little bit. it sounds like you guys are excited about arx deal in terms of the full suite of products that it gives you guys for police. so i wanted to ask about that and whether we would expect that to be available in the bag of solutions for your public safety sales folks that are closing deals in the all-important q4 here?
and then just a broader question about what you guys are seeing and hearing from customers in public safety. i mean, it's really been a circuitous type a year where we went from defund and now it seems like we're in fund environment. and just curious what that means for you guys relative to the pipeline and your confidence levels on public safety into q4? and then i had a quick follow-up.
h. lynn moore -- president and chief executive officer
yes. thanks, rob. that's a good question. arx is a -- we are excited about arx. it was a relatively small acquisition. and arx really, it's a database solution that really helps the chief of police, helps the command staff, help supervisors really have more insight in the activity of the law enforcement that are on the job, helps with compliance issues, helps promote officer wellness by doing things like identifying stress, risk mitigation. and you're right, there has been sort of the talk around the public safety area in a lot of different areas and a lot of focus lately and has been on law enforcement reform. and this was something that was missing in our product suite.
arx is a company that's based in detroit, which is close to our public safety office in detroit. they had been a partner of public safety in a number of deals. this solution had been sought out more and more. and you're right, it really rounds out our portfolio of public safety solutions. i'd expect it to be something like we do a lot of acquisitions that it's something we're going to sell in our inside channels, and it's also going to become a differentiator in new deals. you're seeing more and more public safety entities looking for these types of solutions for the reasons you just talked about. when you talk about the funding for public safety, i mentioned earlier that different parts of our business were impacted differently. and public safety is, not suggesting it wasn't impacted, but it's still going pretty good.
the number of license deals that it's got this year, their expected licenses are up over 35% year-over-year. we've talked a lot before about the investments we've made there and the number of deals that will be $1 million plus and license will be more than we've ever had before. i think the funding is there. the initiatives are there. and we've been making a lot of investments, and we've done some acquisitions around mobility and things like that, that make us even more competitive. so i'm pretty still -- i'm still very excited about where we stand with public safety and where the future is for that.
robert cooney oliver -- robert w. baird -- analyst
great. i appreciate that's great color. and then just one follow-up. i know matt asked that first question about the stimulus funds and you touched on that. but i just did want to follow up just briefly because you guys said in both the press release and in your comments here that you're starting to see some deals that are specifically related to that funding. and you mentioned, i think, the pipeline of, i think it does and sported by federal stim. just curious what you're hearing from customers. you mentioned a pretty wide swath of tyler products. and can we assume that the bulk of tyler's products would qualify and are available under that?
and then if not, i think you mentioned kind of potential tailwind over many years. so are there two ways to think about this? is it one way to think about it, yes, federal stimulus dollars are going to be flowing to tyler, clear, positive? another would be that budgets being shored up also creates opportunities for more confidence in spending? or is that kind of the right way to think about a couple of different buckets?
h. lynn moore -- president and chief executive officer
yes, i'd say -- and to clarify my comments earlier, if you look at the deals in q3 and q4, i'd say there's probably a few dozen deals where they're being impacted. i'm not suggesting that they're being fully funded, but they are -- they have maybe partial funding or part of the equation. i think your comment is around confidence is something that i've touched on before. and i believe the confidence of having that blanket behind them, along with generally what's been going on in the market, is helpful for all the deals. we are seeing federal stimulus when i talk about these few dozen deals, they are across different products of tyler. i don't know that one would really necessarily single out more than others, although there are some stimulus dollars that are specifically tied to schools. so i think generally, it's a positive. it's something that still -- a lot of our clients and prospective clients are -- there's still a lot of them still trying to figure out how do we access them, which dollars are actually there. and it's something that our marketing team, in conjunction with our sales teams, are putting together materials to help educate our clients and help navigate them where we can. but yes, it's a tailwind. generally speaking, it's hard to quantify at this point. but overall, i think it's part of the reason for optimism we have at tyler.
brian k. miller -- executive vice president, chief financial officer and treasurer
and the american rescue plan, there's not much restrictions on what they can use it for. so i'd say, generally, almost anything, tyler has in our portfolios would be available to be purchased or acquired through the arp funds. and they have until the end of 2024 to spend those funds. and the indications we have is that it's a very small percentage of those funds that have so far been spent or even allocated. there's still a lot of work going on in governments around determining how they're going to spend those. but there's a lot of flexibility around what they can spend those on.
robert cooney oliver -- robert w. baird -- analyst
yes, i think they're trying to route one or two school buses for our whole district. so i asked those guys to give you guys a call. so hopefully, you got that here from here in connecticut.

the next question comes from kirk materne from evercore isi.. please go ahead.
stewart kirk materne -- evercore isi -- analyst
congrats on a good quarter. lynn, i was wondering if you could talk -- or brian, if you could talk about just sort of the bookings level for nic on an organic basis. i know obviously, the core tyler bookings were up a lot. but nic's growth is 5%. is the book ahead of that rate right now? i realize there's some rev rec things that probably make it a little tricky. but are you pleased with sort of the bookings trends in nic right now?
brian k. miller -- executive vice president, chief financial officer and treasurer
because they're mostly transaction-based, their bookings and revenue are pretty aligned, yes. they have some software business, and they had a couple nice deals this quarter. we mentioned our biggest software deal across tyler came through nic. but generally, the vast majority of their revenues are coming to transactions. they're pretty much aligned. they're pretty reliable. like i said, there's a little bit of seasonality. so we saw higher growth last quarter. a little bit lower growth this quarter. one of the areas that's been impacted in their business more by covid is the driver history records, which is a significant part of their business. and the growth there is a little slow right now, but expect those to rebound as things get back to normal. but offsetting that is that transaction volumes are generally up, given that people are doing more business digitally with state government. so -- but generally, the bookings and revenues would be pretty similar.
stewart kirk materne -- evercore isi -- analyst
okay. that's helpful. and then, lynn, as you look ahead to '22, you obviously have a much broader product portfolio at this point in time. what's sort of your temperature in terms of sort of focusing on what you have already, harmonizing technology, go-to-market versus doing any other deals? i know you did a couple of smaller tuck-ins this quarter, but you have a huge product portfolio. i assume the focus is going to be on more just sort of, again, harmonizing the technology of what you have and go to market. is that sort of the way we should be thinking about the strategy in the next year?
h. lynn moore -- president and chief executive officer
so i think you're right, we do have a lot of initiatives going on. we do have a lot larger portfolio than we did even three, four, five years ago. we are focused on -- we did just spend over $2 billion on nic. we're clearly focused on that. we're also clearly focused on our cloud initiatives and things that we need to do to continue to optimize our products and do some things with our internal operations as we move there. i've talked before about how we approach m&a generally, and we've done a little bit this year. and i think earlier, when we were talking about nic, i said, we may go back to a couple of years ago, where we have a little bit of deliberate pause.
we did couple of other deals this year, vendengine, dataspec, these were deals that were sort of in the works. i think though, as we go into next year, we're going to remain opportunistic. we're going to continue to look at deals. i continue to look at deals today. i've been looking at deals over the last couple of months, even though while we still have all this activity going on. and when the right deal is out there, if it fits a need whether it's small, medium or large, we're definitely still in the position to execute on that and i expect that we would.
stewart kirk materne -- evercore isi -- analyst
okay. that's helpful. all right. i will leave it there. thanks, guys.

keith michael housum -- northcoast -- analyst
i'll echo, the quarter is great for you guys. congratulations. going back to the nic business and just revising the prior question. it seems like the driver history record for nic has not been up to par since really covid began. is there anything structurally as perhaps has changed that the driver history records perhaps might not go back to the previous growth trajectory they had?
h. lynn moore -- president and chief executive officer
i didn't quite hear the question.
brian k. miller -- executive vice president, chief financial officer and treasurer
i don't -- we're not aware of anything structurally or fundamentally that's changed around that. we expect that those will rebound back to normal levels. certainly, there's no change in the way, insurance companies are getting their information. but -- and there hasn't been a change in our pricing, at least no negative change. and i know in some of our renewals, we've been able to get increases in pricing. so i don't think there's any fundamental change around the dhr side.
keith michael housum -- northcoast -- analyst
got you. okay. i appreciate it. and the -- your contracts, obviously, three four years on average this quarter was very good. and if i remember back to previous conversations, the idea was sort of the time span the more opportunity you have to raise prices on the contract renewals. can you talk about the success you guys are having in terms of pricing changes, those contracts are coming up for renewal?
brian k. miller -- executive vice president, chief financial officer and treasurer
i think in the last -- there hasn't really been a change through covid. we've been generally in maintenance agreements. we've targeted kind of in the 4% to 5% annual increases and on subscription renewals. targets are generally in that same range. and as you said, shortening the initial terms because those revenues are straight-lined over the term of the agreement gives us the opportunity to realize the benefit of those increases sooner. and generally, we're leading with shorter terms. and this quarter had success with that, occasionally, particularly on some of the large contracts like i think back to the north carolina courts & justice, we have a 10-year agreement. so that can bounce around a bit. but we do prefer to have shorter agreements and the pricing has been in line with what we've historically tried to achieve.

the next question comes from jonathan ho from william blair & company. please go ahead.
jonathan frank ho -- william blair -- analyst
congrats on the strong results. i just wanted to maybe start out with some additional color on the vendengine and arx acquisitions that you've recently made and just potentially understanding what the opportunity is to upsell these types of opportunities there.
h. lynn moore -- president and chief executive officer
yes, sure, jonathan. vendengine, we're pretty excited about that acquisition. it was a little bit larger. we're excited on both. i mean, it didn't mean to imply we weren't excited about arx. i think i just talked about arx a little bit. but for vendengine, corrections -- in the corrections market, for us, was something that we've really seen as a significant growth opportunity. we've been investing in some -- in our core corrections product for some time. it's a key part of our tyler alliance, which is our connected communities vision. and it's really sort of -- the corrections areas sort of the crossover points between courts and public safety.
and it's probably the largest market in justice white space that we didn't really have a leading product. and inmate services is becoming increasingly important to that opportunity. there's more and more requirements, rfps around there. we've partnered with vendengine over the years and in a number of deals, and they're really just a leader there. i expect that their revenue this year will be somewhere in the $20 million, all arr, and it's been growing at 30-plus percent for the last few years. i do think we have enough opportunity to sell that into our existing client base, but also it will help us lead with our corrections and stand-alone deals.
so we're pretty excited about that deal. and similar with arx, i talked a little bit about before about the focus on law enforcement reform, and that was a bit of a hole in our portfolio. again, almost similar playbook. we had worked with them some. really like them. really like the product. a good cultural fit. and we really think it will round out our portfolio. and as you mentioned, selling back into our base. i mean, our existing customer base, its' something that i say all the time, it's our greatest asset. and the more solutions we have, the more that we can push through there and drive growth.
jonathan frank ho -- william blair -- analyst
got it. and on that multiproduct sale point, can you maybe give us a sense of how to better understand how some of these incremental products have been uplift in your deals. i think in the examples that you cited, you did mention a number of multiproduct opportunities. what should we think about in terms of maybe net expansion rates or the ability to cross-sell more into the base over time as well as multiproduct on new sales?
h. lynn moore -- president and chief executive officer
yes, we're seeing it across all of our solutions. and we talk about some of these smaller ""tuck-in"" deals. those are deals that actually are really -- are being sold quite a bit now across our product lines. you look at public safety, for example, we've talked about deals where we sell either our core cad or our core records, but it also includes things like socrata. and you probably heard us mention data insights. data insights is becoming a differentiator for us across many product lines.
but we also talk about mobility and brazos and softcode and mobileeyes. these are all products that were done through acquisitions in the last three, four, five years or so. you see it on the enterprise side, things like executime, time and attendance management. we've seen it in the court space. and it is part of our overall strategy. and it makes us that much more competitive as we have a wider range of solutions sort of an enterprise suite as we compete against people who don't have such a diverse set of solutions to fit the client needs.

peter james heckmann -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
i'm trying to figure out on just appraisal. i know it's not a big part of the business, but it seems like there have been some notable wins there. do we expect a real step function change in the size of that appraisal business? or are other older contracts rolling off and so appraisal should kind of continue to be a pretty consistent contributor?
brian k. miller -- executive vice president, chief financial officer and treasurer
i'd say broadly, it's pretty consistent. we have deals -- these projects often are multiyear projects. sometimes two or three years. sometimes, longer. some of them are driven by legislated cycles in certain states like indiana and ohio that have regular cycles, where we have the almost like recurring appraisal projects. others are more one-off. these three counties in delaware that comprise all of delaware that we're getting ready to start. it was a court-ordered reappraisal. so sometimes the courts get involved when it's determine that appraisals are out of date and maybe contributing to unfair distribution of taxes. so that's the case with these. and we're pretty uniquely positioned to be able to have a strong competitive position in those large deals, those one-off kinds of deals. they can be a little bit lumpy. and -- but i'd say we're generally in a range. we're probably on a more active period right now, particularly coming out of covid where some of these projects may have been delayed. but i wouldn't say it'd be a step function where there's big step up, but we're doing really well in that business right now.

okay. that's fair. and then just thinking about the nic business and you've announced some renewals of state contracts that appear to be far ahead of their actual expiration date. and so as you go through and start talking to these states, are you trying to get them to renew early and opt up for additional years? and just as regards to that, we -- certainly with the change in texas and deloitte kind of getting back into the market, how are you thinking about some of their more mid-sized state renewals here over the next 18 months? do you expect any change in the competitive dynamics? or is kind of your base case that a renewal with the ability to upsell some additional tyler applications?
h. lynn moore -- president and chief executive officer
yes. i think i would say my outlook is pretty optimistic. i'll talk about the texas thing first. our payments business, or the nic payments business in texas is one of our strong outperformers this quarter. when you talk about -- we mentioned utah, and we mentioned oklahoma, these were early renewals.
and part of that -- actually, the reason for the early renewal was some of the excitement that's been generated through nic with the customer about what the combined entity of tyler, nic can bring. we've talked about our connected communities vision. we've talked about the different products and offerings that we can bring. and i think both of these states were areas where they're seeing that future and they wanted to go ahead and jump in early, which gives me optimism for what i think we'll see going forward in the market.
peter james heckmann -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
