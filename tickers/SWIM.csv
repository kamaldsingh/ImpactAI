scott rajeski -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, nicole. good morning, and thank you for joining us for latham's third quarter 2021 earnings call. we are proud to say that latham had record sales in the third quarter, delivering net sales growth of 27% to $162 million. our success shows that homeowners appetite for pool ownership and our products is strong and growing.
we achieved this sales growth even though significant raw material shortages limited our fiberglass pool production, which in turn limited the profit flow-through of our growth. for the third quarter, adjusted ebitda grew 2.7% to $36.1 million compared to the prior-year quarter. i'll talk more in a moment about some specific steps we're taking to overcome production constraints and to improve our adjusted ebitda margins. first though, let's focus on our sales growth.
as a market leader in the only consumer-centric brand in the residential pool industry, we continue to position latham as a household lifestyle brand, one that homeowners aspire to own. we are evolving the pool buying experience, driving material conversion from concrete pool to fiberglass and advancing our mission of making high-quality swimming pools an attainable luxury for every homeowner's backyard. thanks to our industry-leading sales and marketing engine and growing consumer interest in pool ownership, we are on track to deliver our 12th consecutive year of top line growth with over $200 million more in year-to-date sales than the prior year. in fact, at the end of 2021's third quarter, we have already exceeded our comparable sales for all of 2020.
moreover, we are also on track to deliver our 12th consecutive year of profit growth. and again, at the end of this year's third quarter, we have grown year-to-date adjusted ebitda by $46 million and exceeded our comparable full year 2020 adjusted ebitda. now let's turn to raw materials. the shortages we discussed on our second quarter call accelerated in the third quarter and limited our production of fiberglass pools at the same time that our order book was growing significantly.
the primary shortfall was in resin availability, which resulted in q3 production approximately 30% below q2 production in less than half of our q3 plan. let's walk through the various supply chain events that have caused these raw material shortages and what our team has been working on over the last several months to improve the situation. over the course of the year, several things disrupted our supply chains. there were weather-related events from last winter's deep freeze in texas to hurricane ida.
there were multiple disruptions that our suppliers had from upstream material shortages of their own, unplanned production outages, labor shortages, and transportation challenges all over the globe. the raw material shortfall in resin was the principal driver of our lack of profit flow-through from our sales growth. that occurred because of three reasons. first, fiberglass pools normally have higher margins than the rest of our products, so we sold a less profitable mix of sales than we had planned.
second, the raw material shortfalls caused production inefficiencies. we make a concerted effort to retain our employees even when individual plants don't have the necessary raw materials. finally, we made the strategic decision to prioritize long-term relationship building with our dealer partners by partially passing through these increased costs to the orders already in backlog. while we have taken pricing to offset the inflation associated with the raw material issues, there's a timing gap before these increases will match the orders that are being sold.
that timing gap affected us somewhat in q2, hit bottom in q3 and will lessen as we go forward and as our program to alleviate the raw material shortfalls takes hold. these issues did suppress short-term margins. going forward, we feel confident that we will regain our margin trajectory from the pricing actions we've taken and from the changes we've made to how we handle pricing on new longer-dated orders. most importantly, our efforts to increase our resin supply will allow us to ramp up production to match our order growth and to improve our sales mix through higher fiberglass sales.
to overcome our resin supply challenge, our new global supply chain leader and his team conducted a search for additional manufacturers who could provide the high-quality resin that we need to manufacture our best-in-class fiberglass pools. as a result, we expanded our sources of resin toward the end of the third quarter, and we are already using the new supply to manufacture pools in our factories. in addition, we have succeeded in obtaining commitments from our existing vendors to allocate more of their production to us. this will enable increased fiberglass pool production in q4 and into 2022.
our efforts to expand our supply base continue. we currently have several vendors in qualification, which can provide additional material for production early in the first quarter. there are also a number of other suppliers that are in the evaluation phase. the combination of all of these efforts will provide us additional resin volume and surety of supply in 2022 and beyond.
while we are focused on expanding the amount of resin available to support the growth of our business, our operations team is also working on several productivity opportunities to improve our yields, which can reduce the material usage of resin in our manufacturing facilities. longer term, we are also developing additional storage capacity for our key raw materials. this will help minimize the manufacturing inefficiencies arising from any future product availability shortages. the next thing i'd like to call your attention to is just how much demand we have for fiberglass pools relative to our production.
as you can see from the graph, ever since the beginning of 2020, homeowner demand for fiberglass pools has outpaced our supply which was lower than expected because of a lack of raw material supply and because the supply shortfall also disrupted our dealer's ability to time their pool installations. latham's fast-growing demand has been driven both by the acceleration of the secular trend in favor of invested in outdoor living and the impact of our new b2b2c marketing approach, engaging homeowners directly, including our new consumer digital capabilities i'll discuss in a bit. you can also see from the graph when the resin supply issues began to hit, which was toward the end of the second quarter, this actually caused our fiberglass sales to decline in the third quarter, which really increased the size of our fiberglass order book and extended lead times. the implications of this are that we are in a position to sell every pool that we can produce far into 2022.
next, let's take a look at our capacity situation. the graph on the left indexes everything to our 2021 capacity. you will understand that we don't want to provide our exact capacity position for competitive reasons. our strategy is to invest in capacity in order to stay ahead of the demand for fiberglass pools.
you can see that we achieved that in 2019 and in 2020. however, in 2021, our plan called for us to operate at about 83% capacity. but because of the resin shortage, we estimate that we will end up this year's operating at around 58% capacity for the full year. we have been adding capacity steadily for quite some time.
since 2020, we have added or in the process of adding capacity to eight of our nine north american fiberglass plants. and next year, we will break ground on our biggest plan ever, a plant located in kingston, canada that will serve eastern canada, the northeast u.s., and the upper midwest. as you can see from the graph, next year, we will have an average of 22% more fiberglass capacity than we have this year, which would provide us sufficient capacity to roughly double our production versus what we expect to manufacture in 2021. that puts us in excellent position to capitalize on the demand for fiberglass pools provided that we have sufficient supplies of resin and other materials and sufficient operations employees to manufacture and distribute the pools.
this year, in anticipation of the sales to come, we have made every effort to keep our operations crew intact even when we didn't have enough resin to manufacture pools. we built a lot of mold this year, and our plans have never been better maintained. we have also begun hiring and training of new operations associates to prepare ourselves for production in the new year. let's turn our attention to the price gap that i mentioned earlier.
when the resin supply shortage hit, it drove the price of resin a good deal higher. we had a choice about whether to pass these costs along to our dealers or not. we chose to do so for all new orders and partially for orders that had already been accepted. we did this in part because in the early days, we were not sure how long the resin supply would be restricted, but mostly, we did it to support our dealer partners in front of their customers and we were eager to continue building the latham brand and confirm the market's positive view on fiberglass.
that opened up a gap because resin is much more expensive and the units we've been selling have been from the backlog that lacks the full impact of recent price changes. as we begin selling pools to enter the backlog after we reprice that gap will narrow. this timing gap began in the second quarter and reached its maximum in the third quarter, as you can see from the gross margin compression in the third quarter's financials. we expect the price gap to narrow during the fourth quarter as we begin to sell a mix of orders that were not repriced in orders that have been repriced, which puts us in a position to affirm our adjusted ebitda guidance for the year.
more importantly, the pricing taken will reverse the gross margin compression and put us on track to resume our upward gross margin trajectory as we move through 2022. i want to thank all of the dedicated employees of latham, who are using their considerable ingenuity and resourcefulness to find new sources of raw material supply to increase our manufacturing capacity and to devise other solutions that will allow us to produce substantially more pools as we move through 2022. many of these actions have already begun. their success paired with robust consumer demand and our proprietary approach to making pool buying simple for homeowners gives us confidence in realizing the sales and bottom line profit goals that we've set for the business.
latham's longer-term success is anchored by the ongoing execution of our growth strategy. so i would like to provide a quick update on each of our strategic pillars. starting with our digital and brand initiatives. our digital strategy continues to drive strong return on investment, particularly our efforts around search engine optimization.
our website traffic remains strong on the back of continued improvements of our organic search rankings. our ability to drive traffic to our content-rich website is placing us at the center of the consumer purchase journey right where we need to be in to drive fiberglass conversion. we continue to invest time and resources, updating our lead flow process with one main objective: to ensure that our leads are as qualified and purchase ready as possible so that we can expedite conversion for our dealers. we have been successful in doing so, leveraging our recently launched my latham tool and pool cost estimator application, which help homeowners define what they're looking for in a package.
we share this information with our dealers so that their follow-up is more substantive thus increasing their conversion rates. we also recently transformed the editorial section of our website, the latham blog. now on a more user-friendly platform with an updated look and feel, the blog includes informative and educational information for homeowners along each step of their pool planning journey. the blog features content range from how to plan for a pool, what to expect with installation and ideas for landscaping to tips on seasonal maintenance and pool care.
we are providing insight on all facets of the backyard experience and allowing users to cultivate a family dream of owning and maintaining a pool into a reality. the enhanced user experience of the latham blog strengthens our position as a go-to resource for homeowners on all aspects of the pool buying journey and is already driving solid conversion into purchase-ready leads. turning to our product portfolio. we continue to invest in all three of our market-leading product lines and are especially excited about some of the capacity initiatives we have in place in fiberglass.
we are planning to break ground in q1 on our new fiberglass manufacturing plant in kingston, ontario, which will be the largest in latham's history, demonstrating our conviction in the success of our fiberglass conversion strategy. this new plant will serve markets in both the eastern half of canada as well as the northeast and the upper midwest of the united states. additionally, we continue to expand our selection of fiberglass molds, which is already the broadest in the industry. we are launching a number of new pool designs, adding to the industry's broadest catalog.
these new designs will include innovative new entry features and tanning ledges, and offer an increased perimeter with perfect 90-degree corners. these shapes can be a sleek modern feel and are very much on trend with today's new pool buyers. now turning to the exclusive relationships with our dealer partners. dealers continue to see strong homeowner interest in pools with orders booking out into 2022 and even into 2023, and our focus is on enhancing their productivity to build up more capacity to meet this growing demand.
through our installation training and business excellence coaching offerings, we have a demonstrated ability to support our dealers as they grow. the investments we have made in this area are allowing us to be a key solution for a perennial industrywide capacity constraint. we will continue our virtual training through the rest of the year with an incredible amount of new content that we are offering to both new and existing dealers. as we look out into 2022, we are excited to begin hosting in-person trainings at our new best-in-class training center in florida.

mark borseth -- chief financial officer
thank you, scott, and good morning, everyone. today, i'll review our results for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2021 and provide an update on our outlook for the full fiscal year. all comparisons are on a year-over-year basis compared to third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2020. please note that 2020 results do not include the acquisition of gli, or our investment in premier pools & spas which occurred in the fourth quarter of last year.
net sales for the third quarter were up by $34.5 million or 27% year over year to $162 million. this year-over-year growth was primarily attributable to an increase in net sales, driven by increased volumes and price and the acquisition of gli. these factors were partially offset by decreased year-over-year volume for our in-ground swimming pool category because of the constrained raw material supply you heard scott speak about. if we include gli sales in the third quarter of last year, our sales growth would have been 6.2%.
by product category, net sales for in-ground pools, which includes our fiberglass products, increased 7.6% to $84.1 million. our covers product category sales increased 71.7% to $44.1 million and liners increased 42.4% to $33.8 million. gross profit increased by 1.4% to $51 million, mainly from our growth in net sales. gross margin decreased to 31.5% compared to 39.5% last year.
this represents 800 basis points of compression or 680 basis points, excluding the noncash stock-based compensation expense of $1.9 million. to provide a little additional color, fiberglass products accounted for about two-thirds of the 680 basis point gross margin compression versus last year. the raw material shortage caused lower fiberglass sales in the quarter, and therefore, a less profitable mix of sales. the lower sales level also caused a negative fixed cost leverage over our asset base and overhead since our cost structure is geared toward higher fiberglass production levels.
a third factor is that we held on to as many of our operations employees as possible so that we can quickly increase production when additional resin arrives. these factors, paired with our strategic decision not to fully reprice our backlog mid-season in the face of rising costs drove a particularly acute margin pressure in q3. as we continue to secure more resin and more fully realize the benefits of our pricing actions, we believe year-over-year margin compression will improve. selling, general, and administrative expenses increased to $48.1 million from $20.1 million in the third quarter of 2020.
this increase was primarily driven by a $24.7 million increase of noncash stock-based compensation expenses, higher salaries and wages associated with increased customer-facing headcount to support future growth. the acquisition of gli and the legal audit, insurance and professional fees associated with being a public company. this translated into sg&a as a percentage of net sales of 29.7%, up from 15.8% of net sales last year. excluding noncash stock-based compensation expense, sg&a was $22.4 million, an increase of $3.3 million and up 17.1% last year or 13.8% of net sales, a 120 basis point improvement versus last year.
as a result, adjusted ebitda increased by $0.9 million or 2.7% to $36.1 million and adjusted ebitda margin decreased to 22.3% to sales. during the third quarter, latham supported the expansion plans of our strategic partner, premier pools & spas by agreeing to reduce our equity position to support an equity infusion by another investor. we continue to hold a 20% equity stake in premier pools, and our long-term strategic partnership remains unchanged. the gain associated with this transaction does not affect our adjusted ebitda results.
net loss was $11.3 million or a $0.10 loss per share as compared to a net income of $17.7 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2020, driven primarily by noncash stock-based compensation expense of $27.6 million. for the first nine months of 2021, net sales increased 68.7% to $491.6 million. if we include gli sales in the first nine months of 2020, our sales growth would have been 42%. looking at net sales performance in our three product categories, we have seen strong growth across our product lines.
in-ground pools increased 68.4% to $285.7 million. covers increased 76.3% to $94.4 million and liners increased 63.4% to $111.5 million. gross profit increased 54.4% to $161.8 million from $104.8 million for the prior-year period. gross margin for the first nine months of 2021 was 32.9% compared to 35.9% for the prior-year period, primarily because of the supply chain headwinds we've discussed.
excluding noncash stock-based compensation expense, gross margin was 34.3% or 160 basis points below the prior-year period. as a result, adjusted ebitda grew 69.5% or $46.1 million to $112.5 million for the first nine months of 2021 and adjusted ebitda margin increased to 22.9% from 22.8% for the prior-year period. net loss was $56.4 million for the first nine months of 2021 compared to a net income of $18.7 million in the prior-year period, driven primarily by noncash stock-based compensation expense of $104.6 million. turning to the balance sheet.
as of october 2, 2021, we had cash and cash equivalents of $90.9 million, total debt of $234.2 million, and our net debt leverage ratio was 1.1 times. net cash provided by operating activities was $29.4 million for the nine months ended october 2, 2021 versus $55.1 million in the prior-year period, with the year-over-year decrease being driven by higher working capital to support our sales growth. capital expenditures totaled $6.2 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2021 compared to $3.5 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2020. the increase in capital spending was primarily related to our fiberglass capacity expansion initiatives.
capital expenditures totaled $19.2 million in the nine months ended october 2, 2021, compared to $9.7 million in the prior-year period. i'll now share an update on our guidance for full year fiscal 2021. we affirmed the net sales and adjusted ebitda guidance we provided on our second quarter earnings call. net sales of $600 million to $620 million, adjusted ebitda of $130 million to $138 million.
today, we have updated our 2021 capex guidance to $24 million to $28 million to reflect our estimates for the current timing of our projects cash flows. we continue to move forward with the projects that made up our original guidance. our outlook for the year reflects our strong financial results for the first nine months of 2021 as well as our confidence in our ability to continue to drive the material conversion of fiberglass leverage our unique direct-to-homeowner digital strategies to generate leads for our dealer partners and capitalize on the outdoor living trends. it also reflects our many efforts to continue to manage through raw material availability and its impacts.
scott, back to you.
scott rajeski -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, mark. we are seeing continued strength in consumer demand as we head into the fourth quarter and are taking the necessary steps to counter raw material shortages. as we look out to 2022, we are well positioned for another year of strong revenue and adjusted ebitda growth, thanks to robust homeowner interest in pools, increasing dealer capacity and resin supply and our pricing actions. we have excellent insight into consumer demand, especially in fiberglass.
and our fiberglass order backlog is increasing, at the same time, consumers are seeing our new pricing. we expect that when the full price increases have caught up to the fiberglass backlog, we will regain our historical trajectory of growing adjusted ebitda faster than revenue by selling a more favorable mix of products, reaping the benefits of our marketing investments, manufacturing leverage from our sales growth and the ability to price faster than inflation. i want to thank our teams for their unwavering dedication to supporting our dealers and homeowners. with that, operator, please open the line for questions.
",":
operator
thank you. [operator instructions] and the first question will come from matthew bouley from barclays. please go ahead. 
matthew bouley -- barclays -- analyst
good morning, everyone. thank you for taking the questions. i think everyone will appreciate all the detail and visibility you gave this morning in the comments and in that slide deck. so thank you all for that.
so on the backlog obviously, you're saying you protected the backlog in recent quarters, and you're in a position, if i heard you right, to sell everything you can produce far into '22. when you get to the homeowner level, how do you gauge sort of how safe, for a lack of a better term, is the backlog in terms of preventing customers from dropping out just given lead times continue to push further and further out and you're getting quoted into '23. how do you kind of scrub the safety of that backlog? thank you. 
scott rajeski -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. so matt, good morning. first of all, look, i think from the 2q earnings call, we heard maybe we weren't as open with all the details of what's going on within the business. so we listened to the feedback.
we wanted to make sure we clearly laid out there the situation on all fronts with resin backlog and the pricing dynamics, and i appreciate your comments on what we provided to you guys here this morning. specifically to your question on the backlog and the consumer, would this have been a long lead time purchase decision for the homeowner. if you've been waiting for a pool for six, nine months, 1.5 years, two years in that decision-making process, which sometimes it takes and you've told the family you're getting a pool, the likelihood of a cancellation is very, very low. second, i think we don't get the order from the dealer until they've kind of confirmed the contract with a homeowner.
and at that point, we see very few cancellations, if any, at all, at that level feeding through. they've locked their slot, they're waiting, and we see almost zero risk in terms of cancellations of the backlog. 
matthew bouley -- barclays -- analyst
wonderful. that's great color. thank you for that, scott. second one, it sounds like you're making a lot of permanent changes to mitigate future supply challenges.
it sounds like diversifying suppliers, you're considering holding more storage capacity. and i think, scott, i heard you say that you're making changes to how you price longer-dated orders, which seems particularly relevant here as, again, folks are getting quoted out to 2023. can you elaborate a little bit on kind of how you're pricing now when you're thinking about these long-dated bookings? and maybe what's changed versus how you historically did it?
scott rajeski -- president and chief executive officer
yes. there's a couple of things there, matt. one, i think working with our dealer partners to make sure they have flexibility in their contracts in the short term to reprice the consumer level as they see prices change more dynamically to not allowing orders to be on the books more than 90, 120 days, kind of thing like looking out 90 days from a quarter standpoint with pricing. and i think the other thing we've done is maybe using more surcharges with flexibility where we can quickly change the magnitude of that at any point in time based on when an order will be shipping out.
so it's not just one thing. i think it's multiple things with more dynamic pricing based on how inflation is moving rapidly on over time.
matthew bouley -- barclays -- analyst
wonderful. well, thank you very much for that, scott. and good luck, guys. 
scott rajeski -- president and chief executive officer
thanks. 
operator
thank you. and the next question will come from josh pokrzywinksi from morgan stanley. please go ahead.
gustavo gonzalez -- morgan stanley -- analyst
hey, guys. it's actually gustavo gonzalez on for josh. so i guess, moving toward price, can you guys kind of talk about the price step-up 3q to 4q? and then how should we think about carryover price into 2022?
mark borseth -- chief financial officer
nice to hear from you, and thanks for your question. we've been increasing prices throughout the year. we increased prices again in q3. and as a result of that, we see this timing lag between the impact of the cost on our p&l and the timing of the price realization in our p&l is shrinking.
so we do believe that the gross margin compression we experienced here in the third quarter is the bottom of the trough, and we will start working upwards from this point into q4. as far as what we see carrying over into 2022 for -- on a cumulative basis, we've been seeing, i would say, low double-digit price increases this year that we would expect that would look to carry over into 2022.
gustavo gonzalez -- morgan stanley -- analyst
got it. that's helpful. and then just as a quick follow-up, how would you sort of rate availability today versus 60 days ago, just sort of on the resin situation? and are you kind of getting what you need now with the new suppliers? or is there still kind of a shortfall? and then if possible, can you kind of highlight what the sort of missed sales opportunity was in the third quarter, given the shortages?
scott rajeski -- president and chief executive officer
yes. so gustavo, first point is, i'd say resin availability is better now than we were 30 days ago, 60 days ago. new sources coming online, situation at our upstream vendor partners improving with the outlook. and i think that trend will continue.
i think more importantly, as we've talk about additional sources coming online as we move into early 1q '22 and through the year, which is kind of why we feel so strong that every pool we can produce, we'll be able to sell next year. and with the size of the backlog, we're looking at a really good 2022. in terms of the impact, i think there's a simple way to look at this. if we produce the same number of pools in q3 that we had produced in q2, it would have resulted in, say, $23 million to $25 million of additional revenue out the door.
we clearly had the demand. we had the capacity and the facilities, we had the labor. so that's kind of a way to just kind of quickly frame it up on a conservative outlook.
gustavo gonzalez -- morgan stanley -- analyst
got it. thanks for the call and the look out there. thanks, guys. 
operator
and the next question will be from susan maklari from goldman sachs.please go ahead. 
susan maklari -- goldman sachs -- analyst
thank you. good morning, everyone. and i also want to thank you for the increased color and the helpful information on the slides there. my first question is, when we think about the guide for 2021, it implies that the fourth quarter ebitda margin will be up about 300 basis points or so year over year.
when you think about the breakdown of that, you gave us a really helpful breakdown as we thought about the third gross margin and what the factors were there. can you help us to understand what the step-up will be in the fourth quarter and how these different parts will come together?
mark borseth -- chief financial officer
morning, susan. nice to hear from you. and thanks for your question. as you know, we don't provide guidance on a quarterly basis.
but at this point in time, with our year-end guidance and our nine months in the bag, it's pretty easy to kind of back into what that range might be. and again, as we think about profits going into the fourth quarter, the gross margin compression that we saw in the third quarter from all the various factors, primarily fiberglass, we see alleviating somewhat in the fourth quarter as we obtain more resin as we run our production facilities more efficiently, and as we get a more profitable mix of sales. so i think when we look at those things and the ongoing strength of the order book and the demand for the products, we feel good about our ability to reaffirm the guidance that we have out there and deliver for the year.
susan maklari -- goldman sachs -- analyst
ok. that's helpful. and then as a follow-up, you talked in your remarks about seeing a continued improvement in the progression of margins in 2022. can you just give us some sense of the cadence that we should be thinking about there? maybe any thoughts on the sequential movements and any differences relative to normal seasonality that we could anticipate as we think about some of these factors starting to improve for you and perhaps coming together.
mark borseth -- chief financial officer
thanks, susan. i'll take that one as well. as we think about 2022, i think there's some fundamental things that we're thinking about as we look into the business. one is demand remains incredibly strong, as you saw in one of our charts today.
so we feel very good about demand heading into 2022. i think as you also know, we have a seasonal business. so it's not just sequentially one quarter is better than the previous. and so with the demand, with the increased supply of resin, we're going to have plenty of capacity to manufacture additional fiberglass pools.
so you put those things together, we feel very good about what we think we can deliver in 2022.
scott rajeski -- president and chief executive officer
and susan, i think the other key one there as well will be as the pricing of the backlog catches up as we move through that. again, the resin supply will drive the higher production, which will clear the backlog faster, which we'll get more price on that backlog. so i think that price inflation dynamic will become a great friend of ours as we move through '22.
susan maklari -- goldman sachs -- analyst
ok. just a quick follow-up on that. when we think about the seasonality of the business next year, obviously, this year, there's been a lot of moving parts that have caused things to sort of move in different directions. do you expect that overall, the seasonality will be more normal in '22?
scott rajeski -- president and chief executive officer
yes. good question there, susan. i think from -- i don't have a crystal ball, we don't know what could happen next year. but i think '21 was start of the reversion to the mean of seasonality versus '20.
i think '22 will be another normalized year. but again, weather, a late winter, early spring, could move that a month or two as we've seen historically in the business. but i'd say it should be more normal. i think we all hope it will be more normal.
susan maklari -- goldman sachs -- analyst
thank you for that color. appreciate it. 
scott rajeski -- president and chief executive officer
well, thanks, susan. 
operator
and the next question will come from david bellinger from wolfe research. please go ahead.
david bellinger -- wolfe research -- analyst
hey everyone. good morning. thanks for taking my questions here. so just in regard to some of the additional data you provided, it's nice to see the demand trends still very strong throughout the q3 period.
so just internally, have there been any discussions or plans to sort of meter or hold back new order growth in some way? were there -- that's sort of a pullback on digital advertising or some other actions to allow for production to catch up with the level of new order demand you're seeing. is there any discussion of that within your current growth situation? just how do you think about that in terms of the brand opportunity?
scott rajeski -- president and chief executive officer
yes, dave, we've not slowed on any front. if you look at the capacity chart, right, we've continued to add capacity on the growth capex standpoint front across all business categories. we've continued to try to ramp labor -- staff labor, get all the rest we need for the outlook to reduce that backlog with the strong demand we're seeing. and again, seeing orders out into 2023 as well.
the one thing -- and i think we talked about this on the last call, we have kind of slowed down the lead engine from the search standpoint because the organic piece of that has taken off so great for us. i mean the leads we're generating are still far outpacing what anyone can actually get in the ground or fulfill. so we don't feel the need to do that. again, that's the result of the strong marketing engine that the team has created here.
so i'd say it's full steam ahead on all fronts to keep the capacity well ahead of the demand to try to shrink that backlog and realize that revenue in '22.
david bellinger -- wolfe research -- analyst
got it. ok. and then just a more qualitative follow-up. you mentioned the resin situation for you improving versus the last 30 or 60 days.
is that more of a comment just on the overall raw material availability or supply chain dynamic in the broader marketplace? or is that more of a function of these internal actions you've taken recently to work around these ongoing issues?
scott rajeski -- president and chief executive officer
i'd say both, it's a combination of both. if you go back to the march time frame when the deep freeze hit, the team kind of rallied and started to look at a lot of different options. i think those options are now coming online, flowing through for us, giving us incremental volume well more than what we'll need us to move forward. and i think the general issues around resin with some of the upstream vendors and some of the supply inputs and challenges, whether it was the epoxy or the methacrylic acid, that situation is improving kind of post the hurricane and the catch-up.
and look, i think that volume is still ramping as we talk. but i think specifically for the resin, it's both from a situation getting better. and again, just working closer with our dealer partners to understand their dynamics and challenges they might be facing.
david bellinger -- wolfe research -- analyst
thanks, guys. appreciate it.
scott rajeski -- president and chief executive officer
you're welcome, david.

[operator instructions] the next question will be from ryan merkel from william blair. please go ahead.
ryan merkel -- william blair and company -- analyst
hey guys. thanks for taking the question. i wanted to start off with sales. i know you have the big backlog, but talk about new order entry and website traffic and any other forward metrics that you follow.
any slowdown there? or sort of full steam ahead on investment in the outdoors.
scott rajeski -- president and chief executive officer
ryan, good morning. i'd say it's full steam ahead from a sales order standpoint. digital lead hits on the website, the new blog, the pool cost estimator. and i think we continue to launch new content out there, and we will continue to do that as we move through '22 with a lot of new and exciting things that will be coming and it's really not had any impact on demand.
now again, kind of the seasonality of business as you're in 4q, there's a natural slowdown as you approach the holidays and all of that. but other than i'd say seasonality aspect, we're outpacing prior year, strength looks good and had a couple of opportunities to chat with several of our customers, bigger customers last week. and they don't plan on stopping until christmas, which again bodes well. i think that was a comment we've made before, dealers are all tired.
it's been a long two years for them with a lot of business, but they're all talking about working right until the end of the year and looking forward to a really, really strong '22 and into '23, which is great for all of us.
ryan merkel -- william blair and company -- analyst
got it. that's great to hear. all right. and then i wanted to follow up on price.
not sure how much detail you want to provide. i know you said price would be up double digits this year. but my question is in 4q, are you exiting at sort of a mid-teens price level? and then the second part, do you need more price at this point? or do you think you have enough?
mark borseth -- chief financial officer
ryan, it's mark. thanks for your question. good to hear from you. we've raised prices several times this year.
we raised prices again on several product lines in the third quarter. on a cumulative basis, we're looking at low -- i will just reiterate the low double digits at this point in time. and we're going to continue to monitor that situation as we go forward. so we'll see what the environment brings.
but for right now, we like the prices that we have out there, and we expect to see that timing lag between price and our costs up, continue to diminish as we go forward.
ryan merkel -- william blair and company -- analyst
helpful. thank you.
mark borseth -- chief financial officer
thanks, ryan. 
operator
the next question will come from ken zener from keybanc capital markets. please go ahead. 
ken zener -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
good morning, everybody. very muscular presentation this morning, guys. after all the equity volatility we saw in the quarter. so i think you guys are very much on the right track as others have commented in terms of clarifying the business.
so of the sequential sales decline in fiberglass pools that you highlighted, scott. how much of that would you say -- can we assume -- i mean, is that just a percentage wise, was there any big mix in there? i mean, because of the volume declines, and where i'm going, if i can assume that's all volume declines as opposed to mix would be roughly, i think, mark, you said two-thirds of the gross margin decline was related to fiberglass. could you split that in terms of how much of that was the volume versus cost impact, right? because there are two different metrics, obviously, in terms of your fixed cost absorption versus the higher cost? just trying to get a sense of that.
mark borseth -- chief financial officer
ken, good morning and thanks for your comments on the presentation. 680 basis points of margin compression with two-thirds of that in the quarter coming from fiberglass. and certainly, mix is a portion of that. i mean, scott mentioned just sequentially what kind of sales impact that had on us q2 to q3, but mix being a component and then just resin availability or lack thereof of having enough, right, drove some inefficiencies in our factories.
and then we also have the timing gap on pricing versus costs that we talked about. we've not separately broken those out at this point, ken. but that two-thirds of fiberglass as we think forward then into q4 and around margin compression as we bring more resin in, as we produce more pools, we look for a better mix and better efficiencies in our factories to help going forward and get back on a better margin or better profit trajectory.
ken zener -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
good. is it fair to say i'd like -- i really appreciate your comments, scott, around the -- how you're interacting with your dealers so that's kind of we talked about is how does that happen when this new inflation environment. can you talk about how the dealers have i guess, been understanding of this new paradigm where we need to be a little more disciplined around contract duration, how they communicate to their customers? your surcharges, which it's not -- we've had sherwin-williams put in surcharges, we've had stanley works is putting in surcharges to large customers, obviously. so can you kind of talk about how that relationship because i don't think it's adversarial, right? but just kind of how they're working through that and how that gives you confidence versus where you were, let's say, two quarters ago before these issues really impacted you?
scott rajeski -- president and chief executive officer
yes. so look, the dealers are all really good business people out there in the industry. they've been around for a long time. they've seen a lot of different environments in markets.
i think we've all had to change our business model on many fronts in terms of what we do. and we've had to have some difficult conversations. and look, i think there's some folks who've been really good in terms of how they price contracts out in the future, anticipating a level of inflation that's going to be out there. i call that a good business practice staying ahead of the curve.
i think they also understand that look, no one likes a price increase, but i think the protection of the backlog was helpful for them this year to work through it. we've slowly put the surcharge out there. we've increased it a few times. we'll continue to monitor it.
i think it's just having good open dialogue with our commercial team, our new commercial leader josh out there with the sales organization, having these open honest conversations. and it's just a new way of thinking and we'll continue to work with them. and look, a lot of these folks have been with us for 20, 30, 35 years long-term relationships. and i think they appreciate the openness and the honesty.
and look, they're a critical part of our supply chain across the board. and that's why we said all along, we've got great long-term business partners who kind of hang in there with us through the thick and thin.
ken zener -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
yes. yes. as we think about '22, given your slide presentation, specifically slide 6, all very, very good stuff. so what do you think is the capacity of your dealers, right? so obviously, you guys had your own internal capacity issues or not capacity, but throughput.
do you think the industry's ability to actually dig holes as it relates to getting all the -- whether it's equipment or the pieces to actually get the pool functioning. what do you think that is? because that obviously seems pretty important, right? like what that part of the channel can do. i mean do you think that's at the 20% growth capacity next year that we saw this year in new pools, perhaps? or how would you frame that up for us?
scott rajeski -- president and chief executive officer
yes. so ken, i think you're right. dealer capacity is a critical piece of how this industry will continue to grow. i think it goes back to the magic of the fiberglass material conversion story we've been talking about.
and again, if we go back to kind of the metric i've been quoting for a while, let's just say, an average dealer's doing 10 pools a year. and in the fiberglass world with 40 installation weeks of capacity if you did one pool a week, you could easily get to 40 as you go through that conversion cycle. so a stand-alone dealer with a crew of one has plenty of capability to go from 10 to 40. and we've talked that if they could get to the point where they're performing as a high-performing dealer doing three a week, that's 120 pools a year.
so the capacity is there, but you had a really good point everything else they need to put that pool on the ground has also got to click. the equipment, the pvc piping and other stuff. but when you look at what's happening in the rest of the supply chain in the pool industry, everything is getting better. it's all improving as we move away from the deep freeze in texas and where we were, inventory positions improving.
and again, back to the dealers. the dealers are getting smarter with how they run their businesses. standing up on early buys and getting equipment stored and buying ahead on materials, looking out at their backlog of what they need. so i don't worry about dealer capacity as we move forward, as we continue to coach, teach and train, and stand them up and bring more dealers into the fold, i don't think that will be a limiter as we look out into '22 and '23.
ken zener -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
thank you. 
operator
and the next question will be from judy merrick from truist securities. please go ahead.
judith merrick -- truist securities -- analyst
thank you. this is judy in for keith hughes. and just to clarify, i'm looking at the monthly resin supply slide that you had. it seems like in the first quarter, you managed your in line or a little ahead on the price increases.
is that right? and then it was not until the second quarter where you headed the mix of price and reprice sales?
scott rajeski -- president and chief executive officer
judy, could you repeat that because i didn't catch the first part of the question, sorry.
judith merrick -- truist securities -- analyst
right. i was just looking at where you -- the slide you had like in march, where you had sort of the resin supply issues and increased costs. but it seems like in the first quarter, you kind of managed your costs and you had some increases there, but it wasn't until the second and third quarter where you had the greater mix of what was price and not repriced? so you were ahead of costs in the first quarter. is that right?
scott rajeski -- president and chief executive officer
yes. so if you look at just, let's say, the supply issue, right, the way the lead times work with supply coming in on the resin base, how we stock, store, manufacture pools, lead times, inventory on the ground. you take all of that -- we had the resin we needed, we kept running. and again, it was kind of a line to continue down and it really amplified at end of june and accelerate as say, july, august, bottoming out kind in september.
and again, we had inventory on the ground. we were able to liquidate some inventory and move pools through as we're building those custom pools to order. and i think it was really in 3q where it really kind of caught up to us where we didn't have the resin to run hard and marks it back on the margin compression, the 680 basis points. two-thirds of that fiberglass.
again, a lot of the manufacturing inefficiency where we kept all the costs, kept the plans, kept the labor, redirected them to build molds, do maintenance on molds kind of -- if the factory is ready to run full steam ahead when resin came in. so i think that answers your question. mark, do you want to comment?
mark borseth -- chief financial officer
i would just add that this speaks, i think, directly to the timing issue that we have between price up and the cost we're seeing on the p&l and the strategic decision not to reprice our backlog. and as we entered into q3. we saw that cost and inflation continue to accelerate in q3. we implemented a surcharge to partially pass some of that along to the backlog, and we just recently announced an increase in that surcharge.
so we've monitored the situation very closely. and we think the margin compression, the worst of that is behind us and should start improving as we move into q4.
judith merrick -- truist securities -- analyst
ok. great. thank you.
mark borseth -- chief financial officer
you're welcome. thanks, judy.
operator
and the next question will come from rafe jadrosich from bank of america. please go ahead.
rafe jadrosich -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
hi. good morning. thanks for taking my questions. so just following up on the price cost lag.
can you just talk about how far out the backlog is that's priced lower. like how far out is the backlog that you're protecting? and when might that start to roll off?
scott rajeski -- president and chief executive officer
yes. so we're not going to disclose specifically how far out we are in the backlog with the actual numbers, rafe. i think as we come back and say we've bottomed out kind of in 3q and the resin supply improves, and the pricing, the surcharges start to catch up with the flexibility and new announcements that we've launched here in the last several months. i think that will be an improving situation from a margin compression standpoint as we roll through 4q into 1q.
and i'd say we'll continue on as we go through all of '22 and out with the new dynamics of what we're doing there.
rafe jadrosich -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
ok. got it. and then as you think about the price increases going forward, maybe not just the price increases that you're pushing through to the dealers. there is inflation everywhere.
how do we think about the relative cost of fiberglass pool compared to a concrete pool? do you think that the value proposition is getting better with this inflation environment? like are concrete pool prices going up more? how do you think about your supply chain situation compared to some of your competitors?
scott rajeski -- president and chief executive officer
yes. i truly believe the favorable economics for fiberglass pool versus a concrete pool still hold in our original thesis, lower upfront cost and a total lower cost of ownership. and again, concrete steel rebar, everything that goes in to build in a concrete pool is up. and more importantly, when you think about the size of a labor crew and the labor constraint that's out there and the length of how long it takes to construct a concrete pool.
and again, if we said the 75% of that cost is labor, that's a significant increase they're taking on the labor front as well, maintaining those crews to get the pool on the ground. so look, i'm not going to say it's better or worse. i think the thesis still holds very strong as we move forward, and we'll continue to drive that.

operator
good day and welcome to the latham group, inc. fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2021 earnings conference call. [operator instructions] please note, this event is being recorded. i would now like to turn the conference over to nicole briguet, investor relations representative.
please go ahead.
nicole briguet -- investor relations
thank you and welcome to latham's q4 and full year fiscal 2021 earnings call. earlier this morning, we issued our earnings press release, which is available on the investor relations portion of our website, where you can also find the slide presentation that accompanies our prepared remarks. on today's call are latham's president and ceo, scott rajeski; and cfo, mark borseth. following their remarks, we'll open the call up to questions.
during this call, the company may make certain statements that constitute forward-looking statements. such statements reflect the company's views with respect to future events as of today and are based on management's current expectations, estimates, forecasts, projections, assumptions, beliefs, and information. these statements are subject to a number of risks that could cause actual events and results to differ materially. such risks and other factors are set forth in the company's earnings release posted on its investor relations website, and will be provided in our form 10-k for fiscal year 2021.
the company expressly disclaims any obligation to publicly update or review any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise, except as required by applicable law. in addition, during today's call, the company will discuss non-gaap financial measures, which we believe could be useful in evaluating our performance. reconciliations of adjusted ebitda to net income calculated under gaap can be found in our earnings press release and will be included in our form 10-k for 2021. i'll now turn the call over to scott rajeski. 
scott rajeski -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, nicole. good morning. thank you for joining us for latham's fourth quarter and full year 2021 earnings call. today, i'll review the key highlights from q4 and full year 2021, provide an update on our growth initiatives and briefly discuss our 2022 outlook.
mark will then give a detailed overview of our financial results and guidance. 2021 was a milestone year for latham and our first as a publicly traded company. latham posted a record fourth quarter with net sales growth of 24.1% and adjusted ebitda growth of 56.5%. in q4, consumer interest and demand in pools remained very strong.
i am also pleased to share that we made significant progress in enhancing our operations and resin supply position during q4. fiberglass production levels and efficiency increased as expected through the end of 2021 with our north american fiberglass production increasing 35% on a sequential basis over q3 and we expect it to continue improving as our resin supply increases throughout 2022. this enabled us to deliver another strong year of tremendous growth for our business. throughout 2021, we continue to execute on our growth strategy, which positions us well to capitalize on the growing consumer demand for fuels and to deliver growth across our market-leading product portfolio.
we continue to drive the material conversion from concrete walls to fiberglass thanks to our direct to consumer model, and we continue to build out our digital tools with my latham and our pool cost estimator. we also expanded our addressable market by adding a new premium quality product to our portfolio at an attractive price point for homeowners with the acquisition of radiant pools, a leading manufacturer of vinyl-lined, insulated aluminum walls swimming pools. this transaction, completed in late q4, demonstrates our ability to execute on attractive tuck-in opportunities and enhance our ability to benefit from growing homeowner interest in pools. i am also very proud of the operations team and the progress they have made over the last six months.
latham has remain nimble in an ever-changing operating environment. we have diversified our raw material supply, especially in the resins used in manufacturing our fiberglass pools. our current resin suppliers have improved fulfillment and we continue advance dialogs on future year supply agreements with them. we're also in the process of adding new sources to ensure we have plenty of resin to support our growth in 2022 and beyond.
as we build our resin position, we have the manufacturing capacity to support our planned growth in 2022, and we will continue to add capacity as we prepare for 2023 and beyond. i am also excited to share that we have welcomed sanjeev bahl as our new coo. sanjeev comes to latham with over 20 years of experience in global supply chain and procurement at companies like newell brands, danaher, stanley black and decker, and united technology group. we believe he is the ideal candidate to lead our talented operations organization as we continue to advance our resin and supply chain initiatives, expand our capacity to support our long-term growth, and drive ongoing lean and productivity initiatives throughout the business.
all of these efforts combined enabled us to deliver our 12 consecutive year of net sales and adjusted ebitda growth and adjusted ebitda margin expansion in 2021. we could not have achieved this success without the devotion of our employees and the commitment of all of our dealers. diving more deeply into our progress on our key growth initiatives, the work we have done with our digital strategy, specifically search engine optimization, has enabled us to remain the digital marker -- market leader in our space. we have improved our search rankings for priority keywords and our website traffic remains very strong with over 2.5 million sessions and over 7 million page views while scaling back our paid search spend in 2021.
we also saw year-over-year growth in page duration times. this means consumers are spending more time on our site. we continue to evolve and enhance the ways we reach homeowners and dealers digitally. this includes continued enhancements to our augmented reality app, which has now had over 84,000 downloads and has resulted in nearly 315,000 virtual tools being installed since 2019.
as we work to drive fiberglass share of u.s. pools installs, we're expanding our capacity to be able to meet that future demand. this includes our new fiberglas facility being built in kingston, canada, which we broke ground on in january. we are seeing ongoing success in expanding our strategic partnerships with latham's exclusive dealers.
we continue to teach our dealers how to scale their business to capitalize on the tremendous amount of demand for pools through our training programs and business excellence coaching, enabling them to add more installation capacity. we see opportunity to continue to drive fiberglass penetration, especially in the sand states, florida, texas, nevada, and arizona. and we are focused on enhancing our dealer base in these regions. our strategic partnership with premier pools & spas is one of the keys to this.
we're really pleased with the exceptional growth we drove with premier in 2021. we're very excited to continue expanding this partnership in 2022. as we look to next year, we expect to deliver exceptional growth well above our three- to five-year targets. in 2022, we are expecting full year net sales to be $850 million to $880 million and full year adjusted ebitda to be $185 million to $205 million.
we operate in a large and attractive market. homeowner demand for our products is strong, driven by secular trends like the acceleration of investments in outdoor living and migration to suburban communities. over the last several years, we have established a strong track record of outperforming the industry. a key to that is the success we're seeing in driving the conversion to fiberglass.
fiberglass' share of u.s. pool installed is well below more mature markets like australia, where fiberglass currently enjoys a 70% share of the market. this means that latham has a long runway for growth. we look forward to continue and execute on our growth strategy in 2022 and working together with our suppliers and dealers to advance our mission of making high quality swimming pools an attainable luxury for every homeowner.
i will now turn the call over to mark to review our financial results and outlook in greater detail. mark?
mark borseth -- chief financial officer
thank you, scott, and good morning, everyone. first, i'll provide an overview of financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2021. all comparisons are on a year-over-year basis compared to fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2020. please note that q4 2020 results do not include our investment in premier pools & spas since we began booking our equity pick up in the first quarter of 2021.
our q4 2020 does include results from gli for two months since we closed that acquisition toward the end of october 2020. our q4 and full year 2021 reflect one month of results from radiant since we closed that acquisition toward the end of november. net sales for the fourth quarter 2021 were up by $27.0 million, or 24.1% year over year to $138.9 million. for the quarter, our 24.1% net sales increase was 16.1% for price and 8% from volume.
all three of our product lines increase sales year over year, led by a $15.0 million increase for in-ground swimming pools to $82.8 million, a $6.8 million increase for covers to $37.8 million and a $5.1 million increase for liners to $18.3 million. we are pleased to have sold more fiberglass pools in q4 than q3, in part due to the increased resin supplies and production you heard scott talk about. on a year-over-year basis, fiberglass sales volume was slightly lower compared to a strong q4 last year. and if we include gli sales for the entire fourth quarter of 2020 and exclude any radiant sales from q4 of 2021, our pro forma sales growth for the quarter would be 16.9%.
gross profit increased by $4.4 million, or 11.5%, to $42.4 million, driven by an increase in net sales, which was partially offset by the addition of non-cash stock-based compensation expense of $1.9 million. our q4 gross margin was 30.5%, compared to 34% last year. lower year-over-year gross margin in the quarter was due in part to non-cash stock-based compensation expense, a sales mix away from in-ground pool sales, particularly in fiberglass, and the timing difference between our price increases and cost inflation, partially offset by improving fixed cost leverage and productivity in our factories. as expected, our year-over-year gross margin compression improved significantly from q3.
excluding non-cash stock-based compensation expense, our q4 gross margin was 31.9%, 210 basis points lower than last year, compared to 680 basis points of year-over-year gross margin compression in q3. with our improved resin supply, we saw north american fiberglass pool production increase over 35% from q3. combined with higher average selling prices, as we increase our fiberglass surcharge in mid-november, we were able to reduce our year-over-year margin compression in q4 by 470 basis points compared to q3 year-over-year results. in q4, selling, general, and administrative expenses increased to $42.7 million, or 34% of sales from $34.6 million, or 30.9% of sales in q4 of 2020.
this increase was primarily driven by a $21.9 million increase in non-cash stock-based compensation expenses to $22.3 million and ongoing public company costs. excluding non-cash stock-based compensation expense and the net of other costs added back in the calculation of adjusted ebitda, sg&a cost in the quarter was $20.6 million, or 14.8% of sales, down $2.6 million from prior year, primarily due to lower incentives. q4 adjusted ebitda increased by $9.9 million, or 56.5%, to $27.3 million. and adjusted ebitda margin increased 410 basis points to 19.7%.
as scott mentioned, results for 2021 marked our 12th consecutive year of net sales and adjusted ebitda growth and adjusted ebitda margin expansion. net sales for the year increased $227.1 million, or 56.3%, to $630.5 million. volumes across our product lines increased 42.6% year over year, driven by strong market demand, homeowner preferences for latham's products, expanded strategic partnerships within our dealer network, and the acquisition of gli. the balance of our year-over-year sales growth of 13.7% came from higher selling prices.
the increase in total net sales across our product lines was $131.1 million for in-ground swimming pools, $47.6 million for covers, $48.4 million for liners. if we include gli for all of 2020 and exclude radiant from 2021, our pro forma sales growth would have been 36.5%. gross profit in 2021 increased 43% to $204.2 million, largely driven by the growth in net sales. gross margin decreased to 32.4%, compared to 35.4% for the prior year period, driven by supply chain headwinds, strategic decisions to not reprice the backlog of orders, which opened a timing difference between our price increases, and the cost inflation associated with the fiberglass pools sold, and non-cash stock-based compensation expense of $8.7 million.
excluding non-cash stock-based compensation, gross margin was down 160 basis points year over year from 2020. adjusted ebitda in 2021 was up $56.0 million, or 66.8%, to $139.8 million. and adjusted ebitda margin increased 130 basis points to 22.2% from 20.8% last year. turning to the balance sheet, as of december 31, 2021, we had cash and cash equivalents of $44 million, total debt of $280.4 million, and our net debt leverage ratio was 1.7 times.
net cash provided by operating activities was thirty $33.7 million versus $63.2 million in the prior year period with the year-over-year decrease driven by increased investments in working capital to support our sales growth. capital expenditures totaled $25.0 million for 2021, compared to $16.3 million in 2020. the increase in capital spending was primarily related to our fiberglass capacity expansion initiatives. subsequent to quarter end, we refinanced our term loan and revolving credit facilities.
on february 23, we entered into a credit agreement that provides a senior secured term loan facility in an initial principal amount of $325 million and a senior secured revolving line of credit in an initial principal amount of $75 million. this refinancing further enhances our financial flexibility, reduces our interest expense, increases our borrowing capacity, and extends our revolver maturity date into 2027 and term loan maturity date into 2029. now turning to our outlook. i'd first like to share a reminder on the seasonality of our business, although we see demand for our products throughout the year, spring and summer are typically our peak seasons as they are the height of swimming pool use, pool installation, and remodeling and repair activities.
as a result, our net sales are historically highest during q2 and q3. looking at net sales as a percentage of total sales for the year, we typically see a relatively even split between the first half and second half of the year. this was not the case in 2020 when the onset of the pandemic and lockdowns shifted our sales split away from the historical first half, second half split. however, we saw a return to more historical norms in 2021.
as you saw on the guidance provided in our earnings release this morning, we expect to achieve another year of robust growth in 2022. investments in outdoor living in the backyard and the demand for our products remains strong. we continue to benefit from our strategic initiatives, including our unique direct to homeowner model and our efforts to drive the material conversion to fiberglass. we've made significant progress in navigating supply chain and raw material-related headwinds, resulting in improving production levels and lead times.
we are realizing the benefits of our pricing actions and surcharges, and as a result, the gap between price and inflation will continue to narrow in the first quarter. notably, our price actions have had no impact on fiberglass demand as the value proposition of fiberglass continues to hold versus gunite, including faster installation times and lower upfront and lifetime costs. in addition, we're delivering beautiful premium products to the homeowners backyard. our outlook assumes softer year-over-year volume in the first half, given the comp against the very strong growth we saw in the first half of fiscal 2021, some labor availability impacts from the omicron variant, and continued improvement in resin supply and fiberglass production, as well as an expected ramp up in fiberglass volume growth in the back half of 2022 as we realize the benefits of our resin supply actions in a -- and then comp a period of softer volumes driven by limited raw material availability in the second half of 2021.
as a result, for the full year 2022, we expect net sales of $850 million to $880 million, representing 35% to 40% year-over-year growth. adjusted ebitda of $185 million to $205 million, representing 32% to 46% year-over-year growth. this growth is well above our long-term targets for net sales and adjusted ebitda growth of 10% to 12% and 12% to 15%, respectively. we also guided to capital expenditures of $45 million to $60 million.
we will continue to invest in incremental fiberglass capacity throughout our network with the majority of the year-over-year increase in capex driven by investments in our new kingston manufacturing facility, as well as incremental steel panel capacity for our vinyl line packaged pool products. in addition to our formal full year guidance, we also want to provide a little color around non-cash stock-based compensation expense. in 2022, we currently anticipate non-cash stock-based compensation to be about $56 million, $52 million of which would be included in sg&a and $4 million in cost of goods sold. of the total expense of about $56 million, approximately 88% is related to the issuance of common stock upon conversion of pre-ipo class b doors.
in addition, we currently expect the first half non-cash stock-based compensation to represent about 60% of our full year expense. lastly, given the unique operating environment, we've also provided an outlook for 2022 first quarter net sales. in the first quarter, we expect to deliver net sales between $170 million and $180 million. in addition, as i mentioned earlier, we do expect a return to more normal seasonality in 2022.
and as such, we expect first half net sales to represent a little less than half of full year 2022 net sales. with that, i'll turn it back to scott before opening the call for q&a. scott?
scott rajeski -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, mark. we drove significant growth in 2021, and we expect to continue our strong trajectory in 2022. we serve a large and attractive outdoor repair and remodel market, and are benefiting from growing consumer demand for our products. we are driving the material conversion of fiberglass, thanks to our unique direct to homeowner model, which continues to transform our industry and position us as a partner of choice for our dealers.
and we feel good about continuing to expand fiberglass' share of the u.s. residential pool starts over time. we have the broadest portfolio of products and a strong reputation for quality, durability, and aesthetics. continued robust homeowner interest in pools, increase in installation capacity in resin supply, and our pricing actions position us well for another strong year of revenue and adjusted ebitda growth in 2022.
our consumer-driven strategy, proven ability to drive material conversion from concrete to fiberglass pools, capacity investments, and disciplined approach to pricing cost management also give us confidence in our 2022 guidance and three- to five-year targets. we'll now open the line for questions.

[operator instructions] our first question comes from matthew bouley with barclays. please go ahead.
ashley kim -- barclays -- analyst
hey, good morning. this is ashley kim on for matt today. thanks for all the detail at the top and congratulations on a good quarter and nice outlook for '22. so i guess my first question just in light of the recent moves in oil, are you thinking about the pricing strategy any differently? potentially building in some escalators or getting ahead with even more price, just given what the impact to resins could be?
scott rajeski -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, so good morning, ashley, and thanks for filling in for matt and thanks for your comments. look, we'll continue to monitor, i'd say, inflation in general, not just oil, but resin, all of our commodities. at this point, i think the key thing is that we've got all the pricing in place that we need to deliver the '22 outlook that we've given. but as we talked in the q4 call, we've got the surcharges in place.
we can be a lot more flexible with the actions we need to take to continue to improve and grow our margin rates.
ashley kim -- barclays -- analyst
thanks, scott. that's helpful. and then just anything on the growth of grand dealers or conversion from grand dealers that you can share? and maybe specifically in the sand states, as you kind of call that out as an area of growth, is that something that you're kind of able to lean harder into with production improvements or just seeing good traction out there with dealers, or any more detail on that strategy you can give?
scott rajeski -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, i think it's more of the same, ashley. we're just going to continue to focus on growing on the dealer installation capacity across the board. more resin clearly has led to greater production, the 35% up in q4. we do have that big sand state strategy.
that's where the premier pools & spas relationship, as well as all the grand dealers that sit in those states exist. we saw really nice progress there in '21 and we expect we'll see them more or i should they better progress in '22 as the resin supply continues to improve.
ashley kim -- barclays -- analyst
all right. thanks. i'll leave it there, and good luck.

our next question comes from susan maklari with goldman sachs. please go ahead.
susan maklari -- goldman sachs -- analyst
thank you. good morning, everyone. my [inaudible]. i just wanted to follow up, scott, on your comment that you have all the pricing in place that you need in order for -- to hit the '22 numbers.
it feels like with the move that we are seeing in some of those underlying energy prices, that the inflationary environment could shift somewhat this year. and so just wondering if you could give a little more color on the price cost where you are with that? and maybe as it relates to lead times in the backlogs, just how to think about those dynamics coming through over the next couple of quarters.
mark borseth -- chief financial officer
hey, susan. it's mark, let me just jump in a little on the price. scott mentioned as we head into '22 and baked into our guidance, we believe we've got the pricing in there that we need based on our current knowledge of our business and what's going on. as we all know, there's a lot of uncertainty out there.
so we continue to monitor that situation very carefully. also, as scott mentioned, it's one of the reasons we decided to implement the surcharge approach on fiberglass, which is the primary backlog that we have in the business. it gives us the flexibility to move that up and down as we see the need to -- as things evolve over the course of the year. so we feel good where we're sitting right now and obviously we continue to monitor that and we'll take the necessary actions as we see things unfold throughout the year.
susan maklari -- goldman sachs -- analyst
ok. ok. that's helpful. and can you give a bit of color, i guess, on the backlogs, exactly where those are sitting now, and how you're thinking about the ability to get through that this year.
i know you mentioned that you expect volumes to be lower in the first half of the year and then ramping in the back half, but just any color on those backlogs and sort of the timing and where we are?
mark borseth -- chief financial officer
yeah, sure, susan. again, mark. we saw that -- let's call it the price gap. the gap between, average selling prices running through our p&l and the inflation close considerably in the fourth quarter of the year.
we would expect that to continue to narrow in the first quarter, susan. as we look out through 2022, it's probably late q2 or early q3 by the time that we've gotten to the point where we've run through all, let's say, all the lower priced pools that are currently sitting in our backlog. so late first half more strongly in the second half of '22.
susan maklari -- goldman sachs -- analyst
ok, that's helpful. thank you. good luck.
mark borseth -- chief financial officer
you're welcome. thank you.

our next question comes from ryan merkel with william blair. please go ahead.
ryan merkel -- william blair -- analyst
thanks. a couple of questions for me. so, scott, first off, you mentioned improved resin supply. can you just unpack this a little bit more? and really, my question is, do you have enough resin to build all the pools in your backlog?
scott rajeski -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, so good morning, ryan. resin supply really improved in q4, i think, as we talked into the back part of the year. the new source came online. we've recently qualified another new source, which actually started to come in, in the last week or so into our facilities.
and just if you look at the production numbers in q4, fiberglass price was up 35% versus q3, and we actually had two of our biggest production weeks in q4 and the entire year of 2021. so, as that rate continues to ramp and increase and as we worked with our existing suppliers and several of the new suppliers we've called and brought on line, we're we're looking to bring in resin to far outpace, not just what's in the backlog, but all the expectations for new orders in '22, what we need to deliver the guidance. and i'd say a little bit beyond that, ryan, we're looking at what we need for '23 and '24. and sanjeev is focused on making sure we have risen to build the kingston plant when that comes online in '23.
and more importantly, just continuing to focus on that fiberglass material conversion story. and as we drive, let's say, to a 40% conversion number, like in europe, we're looking at long-term commitments and agreements with the diverse supply base. so it's more future based on the current backlog and what we're driving to. and i think we feel really good.
and with sanjeev on the team now, we'll drive that much more of a focus on that particular aspect on resin for us.
ryan merkel -- william blair -- analyst
got it. all right. so it sounds like you'll ramp resin supply and maybe second half of this year is when you get to a point where you have enough. is that what you're saying?
scott rajeski -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, i'd say we'll be ramping significantly right now as we speak in 1q. and i think it'll be a nice linear ramp throughout the entire year as we'll have multiple vendors coming on line. another big one coming online in 2q. the offshore sources will continue to ramp in 2q.
and then, q3 and q4 will continue. we'll see continued improvements in that supply. and it's -- [inaudible] a linear line out through time to match our growth rates. that's what we're focused on.
ryan merkel -- william blair -- analyst
got it. ok. and then just can you give us the volume and price breakout for the '22 guide? that would be helpful. and how are you thinking about the surcharges in that guide? is it possible you remove those at some point or even raise them?
mark borseth -- chief financial officer
hey, ryan. it's mark. good morning. as we look at the guide for next year, we're talking top-line growth of between 35% and 40%.
as you saw in q4, we had a price impact of about 16%. i think for the full year, it was close to 14% in 2021. so we're thinking, more than half of our growth in 2022 is is likely to come from price as a result of all the pricing actions that we've taken throughout 2021. and i think as it relates to the surcharge, as we mentioned, as we sit here today, we think we've got the pricing we need for 2022.
that surcharge is expected to stay in place for 2022 in our guide. but the nice thing about that is it gives us the flexibility to more quickly respond, up or down, to what we see in the marketplace. so it's a nice it's a nice lever of that that we can use to manage through the year.
ryan merkel -- william blair -- analyst
very good. thanks for the color.

our next question comes from keith hughes with truist. please go ahead.
keith hughes -- truist securities -- analyst
thank you. i'll start on ryan's question. how much is the acquisition going to add to the -- part of the 2022 revenue guidance?
mark borseth -- chief financial officer
hey, good morning, keith. nice to hear from you. look, we're super excited about the radiant acquisition and you've heard us talk about that previously. we've mentioned when we acquired the business that last year, they did around $35 million in revenue, which while we're super excited about it, it's still a relatively small component of the overall business.
and i think on top of that, like other parts of their order book is pretty well booked out for 2022. so we're probably not going to see much growth synergy until we get to 2023 but specifically, we don't break out exactly what we have built into the guide for radiant.
keith hughes -- truist securities -- analyst
ok. and volume for the year, you talked between first, second half. do you think for the year, and based on the plan you've laid out, do you think fiberglass pools would be up in terms of sales in total in '22?
mark borseth -- chief financial officer
yeah, i think as the volume guide goes, fiberglass sales will certainly be up year over year and will be a contributor to the volume growth. we are guiding softer volume year over year in the first half for a couple of reasons. one, pretty tough comps coming off of the first half of last year. two while we saw more than 35% increase in fiberglass production in q4 versus q3, that will continue to ramp in q1, but we have a little bit of catching up to do versus prior year.
and i think when we get to the second half, as our resin actions continue to pan out as our production continues to scale, we'll be putting out more pools in the second half than in the first half of this year. and as know, keith, we also then have a little bit easier comp in the second half due to the resin challenges we had in the second half '21.
keith hughes -- truist securities -- analyst
gotcha. and given what you just described in the first half of the year with fiberglass, will we continue to see gross margin compression just on mix alone in the first half?
mark borseth -- chief financial officer
yeah, it was -- we were really pleased, keith, with the improvement in gross margin compression that we saw in q4 versus q3, which was expected. and we were happy to put that on board. we would expect for a variety of reasons, including the continued narrowing of the price gap on fiberglass pools, we would expect that gross margin compression to continue to shrink as we jump into q1 in the balance of '22.
keith hughes -- truist securities -- analyst
ok. thanks.

[operator instructions] our next question comes from rafe jadrosich with bank of america. please go ahead.
rafe jadrosich -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
hi, good morning. it's rafe. thanks for taking my question.
mark borseth -- chief financial officer
hey, rafe.
scott rajeski -- president and chief executive officer
good morning, rafe.
rafe jadrosich -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
the 2022 guidance has a big step up in capex for the capacity expansion. can you talk about how much you'll be expanding capacity, like after the kingston facility opened through? what level of sales does that support? and how do we think about the longer term run rate of capex?
scott rajeski -- president and chief executive officer
so, rafe, i'll take the first part and then maybe mark take the back part. so, when we -- sorry, mark. when i -- when kingston comes on line, that will ramp through 2023. so that is a significant step up in the capex numbers that that we flash for '22.
you could almost say the majority of it's probably kingston related and a few other strategic capacity we're making. you could argue that surely will take us out into mid, mid to late '24. but if you step back and just look at what we've been doing over time, right, we've continued to invest in the facilities in many smaller investments, whether it's molds, vehicle, bays, guns, delivery equip bonds for the gardening equipment, the delivery vehicles, burners technology to get more permitted capacity. it's all of those small things, plant by plant, that we continue to do to try to stay at least at 12 to 18 months out in front.
this was a big step up as a result of the fiberglass door conversion story really taking hold in the canadian market, with the [inaudible] brand and latham brand. and it got to the point where we needed a facility up there. and look, we'll continue to evaluate next steps as well as we look at the bigger picture, especially as we drive to that 40% conversion number like we see in europe. mark, any color you wanted to add there?
mark borseth -- chief financial officer
no, i think that's well said. scott, i would just add, as we look at our guide for capex 45 to 60 this year, i mean, it's quite a step up from where we were in 2021. and look, we're going to continue to do those incremental things that scott talked about because the demand for fiberglass just continues to grow. and so we're going to continue to invest there.
but look, the biggest reason for the step up is the kingston investment. most of that spend is going to incur in 2022 as we start getting ready for production in '23. but i do also want to mention that we're also increasing capex spend in our package pool portion of the business. the demand there is very strong.
and so we're bringing some incremental capacity out there. but look, the biggest cause of the jump on here, the kingston investment.
rafe jadrosich -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
thank you. that's really helpful. and then i think last quarter you spoke about the utilization rate and use of just below 60%. where did that finish up for 2021? and then what is the expectation embedded in your guidance in terms of utilization as we exit 2022? how high do you expect that to get up to? where will that compare to your long term run rate?
scott rajeski -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. so, rafe, if you think about -- well, if we just kind of look at twenty one as an anomaly because of the resin shortage and just let's go back to q4, 35% improvement in production rates, some of the biggest weeks of production all year happened in november december on the fiberglass front. going back to that chart, you're probably all familiar with the capacity ads coming online in 2022, using '21 as a baseline, we were talking 20% to 25% increase in capacity and then going back toward a normalized 70% to 80% utilization of the fiberglass facilities based on how the capacity ramps. and that number does not include any of the kingston capacity adds.
so kingston will be additive to those numbers. so you can be thinking, 40% to 50% higher capacity run rate based on that investment when we get into 2024.
rafe jadrosich -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
ok. great. that's very clear. thank you.

our next question comes from josh chan with baird. please go ahead.
josh chan -- baird -- analyst
hi, good morning. scott and mark, congrats on a good quarter and outlook.
mark borseth -- chief financial officer
hi.
josh chan -- baird -- analyst
hi. yeah, i guess my first question. hopefully, we can start to use the phrase post-pandemic here a little bit. but i guess how do you see, pool demand overall trending over the next, call it, two to three years post-pandemic as consumers maybe shift their behavior from staying at home to more normal activities, like how do you see the sustainability of industry demand trending there?
scott rajeski -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, i -- i would let's try post-pandemic. we're just going to different prices.
mark borseth -- chief financial officer
look, i like the enthusiasm, so thank you for that.
scott rajeski -- president and chief executive officer
look, demand continues to stay strong. and if you think about our business strategy, refocusing on the consumer, marketing direct to the consumer, educating on the awareness of fiberglass pools and all of the benefits at the homeowner level, as well as the benefits for the dealer, that story is really resonating and it's showing in the phenomenal growth we've been seeing. and we all know where the european market sits, but more importantly, australia market is 70%. so, no matter what happens, if demand slows a little bit in terms of new pool starts or continues to grow at a 3% to 5% historical rate, that conversion is what's going to drive our growth that much faster, 2x market growth there.
the demand we see for '22 is extremely strong. dealers talking they're sold out. we're working on kind of double if not triple capacity with those dealers. orders and pools are being booked out into 2023 in many areas of the country.
and look, the one thing to step back and look at is we're still a far cry from the peak of new pool starts in the u.s. when it was 175,000 back in '05. so there's a lot of runway. and i'll go back to one of my favorite numbers 90 million homes, existing homes in the u.s.
do not have a swimming pool today. so there's still a lot of backyards looking to have a latham pool put into them. so we feel really strong on the demand front. and look, just the auto covered business is also performing extremely well.
i want to go back to that cover segment because again, that's all about the adoption, the awareness of a product that's not known. and that story is really starting to resonate at the homeowner level as well and i think we'll see nice growth continue in that category.
josh chan -- baird -- analyst
that's really encouraging color. yeah, thanks. and thanks for that. and i guess dovetailing into that from the fiberglass conversion perspective, 20.3 is close -- getting closer.
and so how confident are you that the industry can get to that 25% penetration that you've sort of laid out for '23? and if it does, what does that mean in terms of your growth rate next year? thanks.
scott rajeski -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, i think if you look at the guidance we provided for '22, that's the anticipation of continuing on that trend to try to get to that 25% number in '23 with the growth and where pools starts are. i think what we're looking at since '23 is now a year away, we're looking at where do we need to be on '24 and '25 and kind of really resetting the benchmark of how do we double the fiberglass business in the next three or four years? and that's the capacity, right? and with kingston, it's the resin work we're doing on suppliers. so we still feel pretty comfortable and confident we can hit that number. we'll be in the peak data on pool starts here in a few months.
we'll sit down, go through the analytics, but we still believe we can continue to double this business. the outlook for fiberglass are extremely strong as that conversion story resonates.
josh chan -- baird -- analyst
that's great. thanks for the color and congrats on the quarter again.

this concludes our question-and-answer session. i would like to turn the conference back over to scott rajeski for any closing remarks.
scott rajeski -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, thank you. just a few key points to kind of go back to on the call this morning, as i just said, consumer demand remains extremely strong out there on all fronts for all product categories across the globe for us. our resin supply is greatly improved and will continue to improve as we move through 2022. we're going to continue to add capacity and stay out in front of that demand curve.
that's important to us and that's the big investment decision in kingston. again, just want to thank the team and all of our dealers and partners for just great, great '21 results despite many, many challenges. '21 was a very tough year. i'm really excited about the expectations we've laid out today to deliver exceptional growth in 2022.

nicole briguet
thank you, and welcome to latham's q1 fiscal 2022 earnings call. earlier this morning, we issued our earnings press release, which is available on the investor relations portion of our website, where you can also find the slide presentation that accompanies our prepared remarks. on today's call are latham's president and ceo, scott rajeski; and cfo, mark borseth. following their remarks, we will open the call up to questions.

scott rajeski -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, nicole. good morning. thank you for joining us for our first quarter 2022 earnings call. just a few weeks ago, we celebrated the one year anniversary of our ipo, and i am proud of all that we've accomplished in that time.
we have consistently executed on our strategy, navigated a constantly changed environment, and delivered strong growth. we have entered 2022 in a position of strength, and i want to thank our employees, dealer partners and investors for their ongoing support. the first quarter was a strong one for latham, and we are encouraged by the early excitement and anticipation we're seeing from both consumers and dealers, as we head into the peak pool building season. we've been on the road connecting with dealers and home owners across the country, further educating the market on the value proposition of fiberglass.
what we're seeing and hearing across the board is homeowner demand for pool ownership is strong, and awareness of the latham brand and the benefits of fiberglass continues to grow. we continue to focus on dealer education, and we are pleased that our new world-class training center in florida is now open. the hands-on training that we can provide at this center is in high demand and our schedule is quickly filling up for the rest of this year. this is just one of the many measures we are taking to help our dealers increase installation capacity, and we are excited to welcome new dealers, and quickly and successfully onboard them in a flexible, technologically advanced learning environment.
the homeowner interest in pools is there. and during the quarter, we continue to enhance our ability to meet demand. our fiberglass production continued to improve as we brought on new material sources and expanded resident supply from our existing sources. as a result, north american fiberglass production increased about 50% sequentially in q1 versus q4 last year, and that came on top of a 35% sequential improvement in q4 versus q3 last year.
we continue to make progress on our fiberglass order backlog, especially on pools that were ordered at a lower price that we are charging now. lead times improved across many of our fiberglass plants and models. continuing to improve lead times is a key focus for us across the business, and i'm proud to say that we are tracking back toward normalized competitive lead time in all of our other product categories. we also turbocharged our employee recruitment efforts during q1 and meaningfully filled open direct labor positions.
in turn, this enabled us to successfully navigate labor headwinds related to the omicron variant, in january and february. our branding and digital initiatives continue to differentiate us from subscale, regional manufacturers and remain an important driver of our ability to create demand and drive future growth. the work we have done with search engine optimization continues to strengthen our competitive leadership position in the market. our website traffic remains strong with 700,000 sessions and 2.1 million paid views year-to-date.
this organic web traffic has also further improved our search rankings across all our product categories. in addition, we continue to develop pools that empower homeowners to build a pool that trains. we have made updates in the key product areas with fiberglass, enabling users to view different designs and select what that speaks to their style. all our work to further our branding and digital initiatives, coupled with our operational excellence efforts is helping to drive the awareness and adoption of fiber glass.
as a result of all of these efforts, q1 net sales grew approximately 29% year over year, and adjusted ebitda grew up 43% year over year, getting us off to a great start to the year. q1 was a great demonstration of the team's ability to successfully execute tremendous growth while navigating the difficulties that come with today's disruptive global supply chain. our business continues to face new short-term challenges each quarter, a few of which we expect to impact q2. first, like many others, we continue to face an unprecedented supply chain environment, and we are not immune to short-term supply challenges.
to that end, during q2, we were experiencing a temporary shortage of material that goes into the production of our unique fiber glass flake for several of our fiberglass color offerings. to address this, we are leveraging our vendor relationships to ramp up supply of this input, and we expect to return the full availability of this material in early q3. we have a proven ability to respond quickly to supply chain challenges as our team has done a tremendous job showing up our revenue supply for our fiberglass pools, both through productivity initiatives and supply diversification efforts. just as we saw throughout 2020 and 2021, we believe the breadth of our offerings and strong supplier and dealer relationships will enable us to navigate today's difficult supply chain environment.
second, unseasonable weather in april impacted dealers' ability to install pools in the northeast, midwest and canada. as it gets warmer, when we approach peak pool building months in q2 and q3, we expect installations to pick up quickly. lastly, as many of you know, in april, we experienced a fire at one of our smallest fiberglass facilities in odessa, texas. thankfully, none of our employees were on site at the time of the incident, and i am grateful to report there were no injuries.
i'm proud of our team's efforts to quickly redeploy assets and resources to mitigate the impact of this lost capacity. we have shifted production from this facility to our other fiberglass manufacturing sites, which have capacity to accommodate the additional orders, thanks to our ongoing expansion investments across our manufacturing footprint. we are currently in the process of cleaning up this site and evaluating future uses for the location. in the interim, we are using the odessa facility for distribution purposes to service the region.
although this will impact q2 net sales and gross margin, we anticipate the odessa incident will have minimal impact on the full year, as we quickly shifted production to our other fiberglass manufacturing facilities. despite these near-term issues, we feel good about the actions we are taking to position ourselves for success, as we enter the peak pool building season in the back half of the year. we continue to see growth across our product portfolio, and our dealers continue to book orders through 2022 and even into 2023. where our dealers have additional capacity or are expanding their installation crews, our digital marketing engine is ensuring a healthy supply of consumer lead to drive them to more pool installs.
we will continue to ramp up fiberglass volume growth in the second half of the year, as we realize the benefits of our resin supply actions and comp a period of softer volumes because of the raw material availability challenges we experienced in the back half of 2021. our pricing actions and surcharges have enabled us to counter the impacts of cost inflation on raw materials, freight and labor. we continue to see cost inflation, although the rate of the increase does seem to be abating. we are comfortable with our current pricing levels as the value proposition of our product offerings remain intact, and we will remain nimble in addressing inflation, and are prepared to respond quickly to any future market changes.
thanks to our strong focus on operational excellence, continued execution of our growth strategy, and the health of our industry, we are pleased to reiterate our fiscal 2022 guidance, which implies 35% to 40% year-over-year net sales growth and 32% to 46% year-over-year adjusted ebitda growth. looking further ahead, we continue to build our business for the long term. as demand for our products grows, we continue to expand our manufacturing capacity. we are in the final stages of installing a new state-of-the-art, highly automated line in fort wayne, indiana, which will drive a more efficient manufacturing process for our steel panel package pools and have incremental capacity to support future growth.
i'm also pleased to share that the construction of our new kingston facility remains on track to be in production in 2023. we have also started hiring efforts at the new kingston facility. the dynamics of the large outdoor repair and remodel market remain attractive, as investments in the backyard continue. as the only pool company with a direct relationship with the homeowner and the market leader in every pool subcategory in which we compete in, we remain confident in our ability to deliver outsized growth.
the confidence in our future is shared by our board of directors who have approved the share repurchase program with an authorization of up to $100 million of our common stock over the next three years. with that, i'll turn the call over to mark to review our financial results, outlook and capital allocation priorities in greater detail. mark?
mark borseth -- chief financial officer
thank you, scott, and good morning, everyone. today, i'll review our results for the first quarter of fiscal 2022 and discuss our outlook for the year. first, an overview of q1 results. please note that all comparisons are on a year-over-year basis compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2021.
net sales for the first quarter 2022 were up about $43 million or 29% year over year to $192 million. these results are on top of a very strong period of growth. as you recall, q1 2021 sales grew 191% year over year. price represented 24% of the 29% year-over-year net sales increase in q1, as we continue to realize the benefits of our pricing actions.
volume grew 5% versus q1 of 2021, which, as i just mentioned, was a quarter of outsized growth and a tough comp. net sales increased year over year in all three of our product lines in q1. this growth was led by an $18 million increase for in-ground swimming pools, where we saw strong fiberglass sales growth, that was somewhat offset by softer packaged pool sales, which were impacted in part by a relatively full distribution channel. liners increased about $16 million, and our cover business increased by about $9 million.
gross profit increased $18 million or 35% to approximately $71 million, driven by an increase in net sales, which was partially offset by the addition of non-cash stock-based compensation expense of $1.2 million. q1 gross margins, excluding non-cash stock-based compensation expense, expanded about 220 basis points versus last year to 37.5% of sales. our pricing actions continue to offset inflation on raw materials, labor and freight, which, as scott mentioned earlier, continues to increase, however, at the lower rates of increases than we've been seeing in prior quarters. our average selling prices are increasing, particularly in our fiberglass business, thanks to the improved revenue supply and staffing levels, which led to increased production and sales as we look through our lower-priced fiberglass order backlog.
q1 gross margins also benefited from the building of inventory from year-end to support the business, which aided q1 gross margins by 230 basis points. we expect this benefit will reverse as inventory levels come down through the balance of the year. gross margins were also impacted by negative fixed cost leverage, as we ramp up our infrastructure to support future volume growth. in q1, selling, general and administrative expenses increased to about $45 million or 23.6% of sales from about $27 million or 18.3% of sales in q1 of 2021.
this was primarily driven by a $14 million increase in non-cash stock-based compensation expense to $16 million. excluding the increase in non-cash stock-based compensation expense, sg&a costs increased about $4 million or 13.9% versus prior year, providing some nice leverage to the bottom line. of the $4 million increase, about 30% was related to ongoing public company costs, with the balance related to supporting the ongoing growth of the business. excluding non-cash stock-based compensation expense, sg&a for q1 was about $30 million or 15.4% of sales.
as a result, adjusted ebitda increased by $14.4 million or 43% to $48 million, and our adjusted ebitda margin increased 250 basis points to 25% of net sales. turning to the balance sheet. as of april 2, 2022, we had cash and cash equivalents of $19 million, $65 million of availability on our revolver, and total debt of about $324 million. net cash used in operating activities was a seasonally driven $57 million versus $41 million in the first quarter of last year as a result of both higher receivables tied to increasing levels of sales, and increased inventory.
the increased inventory was driven in part by a strategic decision to minimize the impact of any supply chain interruptions, as well as by cost inflation. as a result, our net debt leverage ratio was 2.1 times at the end of q1 2022. capital expenditures totaled about $7 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2022 compared to less than $5 million in the same quarter last year. the increase in capital spending was primarily related to our fiberglass capacity expansion initiatives.
in light of our share repurchase program announcement today, i'd like to take a minute to touch on our capital allocation priorities. as a growth business, our first and foremost priority is reinvesting in the business, as we see this as a means to drive continued opportunities to generate significant returns and value creation. we've been increasing our capex spend over time as we have accelerated investments in our fiberglass manufacturing capacity. second, we have a history of accretive acquisitions, and we will continue to be opportunistic on executing selective tuck-in m&a and business development investments.
third, pay down of debt. we have a strong balance sheet and low net debt to adjusted ebitda leverage. lastly, we announced the approval of a share repurchase program, which authorized us to purchase up to $100 million of our common stock over the next three years. our strong cash flow generation and balance sheet position enables us to continue to prioritize organic growth investments in the business, as well as strategic m&a, while also providing us the flexibility to further drive shareholder value through a share repurchase program.
we would expect to opportunistically repurchase shares as windows of opportunity arise. now, turning to our outlook. as you saw in the guidance provided in our earnings release this morning, we reiterated our outlook for 2022. net sales of $850 million to $880 million, representing 35% to 40% year-over-year growth.
adjusted ebitda of $185 million to $205 million, representing 32% to 46% year-over-year growth, and capital expenditures in the range of $45 million to $60 million. in addition, at the midpoint of our net sales guidance range, we now expect first half net sales to represent about 46% to 48% of full year 2022 net sales. we delivered robust first quarter growth on top of strong year-over-year comparisons. despite a few short-term challenges in q2, we remain confident in our team's continued execution of our growth strategy, positioning us well to deliver another strong year.
consumer demand for pools is strong, and we are well positioned to capture that demand, as we continue to advance our brand and digital strategy and drive the awareness and adoption of fiberglass. we believe we have taken necessary pricing actions to help counter inflationary pressures, and we've made significant progress in navigating resin supply challenges, resulting in improving production levels and lead times across many of our fiberglass plants and models. as a result, we remain confident in our full year guidance, as well as our three to five-year outlook. with that, i'll turn it back to scott.
scott?
scott rajeski -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, mark. i'm so proud of all the progress we have made, and grateful for our experienced team that works to make us better every day. our conviction in the success of our fiberglass conversion strategy remains strong, as we continue to drive education and spread awareness of the value proposition of fiberglass. q1 was a great start to the year, and we look forward to seeing this continued positive impact of our reimagined pool line experience.
we'll now open the line for questions.

[operator instructions] today's first question comes from matthew bouley with barclays. please go ahead.
ashley kim -- barclays -- analyst
hi, this is ashley kim on for matt today. congrats on the strong quarter and thank you for taking my question.  so just with the q1 margin coming in pretty strong, i think it implies a step down from these levels through the rest of the year, just looking at full year guidance. should we think of that as mostly lost volume leverage in 2q? or anything else to kind of call out there with the cadence?
mark borseth -- chief financial officer
hey, good morning, ashley. nice to hear from you and thanks for your question. very pleased with our first quarter results, as you mentioned, both top and bottom line growth and a very nice margin. a lot of good things happened for us there in the quarter.
we don't provide quarterly ebitda guidance, but our full year context is some ebitda margin expansion. we have a few short-term challenges in q2 that we're going to work our way through, as we go through the year. and i think also as we look at our gross margin which was very strong in q1, we had a nice pickup from some inventory build. we don't see repeating.
we'll probably get some of that back as we go through the balance of the year and worked on our inventories. but we feel very good about the full year guidance and our ability to deliver that.
ashley kim -- barclays -- analyst
and then just my second question, how do you think about investing through downturn, things like going after new dealers, capacity additions, marketing dollars? would you kind of continue to invest through it in order to keep driving material conversion? or what's kind of the outlook there?
scott rajeski -- president and chief executive officer
yes. so, i think, if there was a downturn -- we've got a very strong balance sheet, a healthy business. we generate a lot of cash flow. we would continue to invest.
and one of the things with the magic of what we could do, driving that fiberglass penetration story with a lower upfront cost of that product versus the concrete pool, total lower cost of ownership. we will continue to push the lead generation engine, drive -- lead the demands to our dealers, make sure we keep all of our dealer partners pretty full from a new construction standpoint. and just to remind everyone, we also have a pretty good recurring revenue business with the liner and cover segments of ours, which we can generate a lot of demand as well. so we would continue to invest our long-term thesis as we want to stay upfront of the demand and capacity.
we believe the secular trends in this industry are phenomenal out there. and as consumers want to continue to hunker down and invest in their backyard, we will do what we need to do to stay in the forefront to be the leading pool brand out there.
ashley kim -- barclays -- analyst

and the next question today comes from susan maklari with goldman sachs. please go ahead.
susan maklari -- goldman sachs -- analyst
thank you everyone. good morning. my first question is, can you give a little bit more context on the inflation side of things? i know that you mentioned that you are seeing those pressures somewhat abate. i guess just any context on how we should be thinking about the magnitude of that and how it will roll through the year?
mark borseth -- chief financial officer
as we mentioned, inflation is not gone. we do see it continue to increase. it seems to be increasing at slower rates than we've previously seen. i think the other side of that, and we're expecting that to continue, susan, i think the other side of that is, we are continuing to see the benefits of our pricing actions and realizing some of those, and some of that was reflected in our gross margin during the first quarter.
we feel really good about the pricing actions we've taken. we're staying ahead of the inflation curve as we sit here today, and we continue to monitor that situation very closely. it is very dynamic, and we'll continue to monitor it, and we'll be very nimble adjusting to it as we need to, going forward.
susan maklari -- goldman sachs -- analyst
and then just following up a little bit, i guess, obviously, there's been a lot of concern about consumers and the overall sort of inflationary backdrop and a rising rate environment, all these sort of different macro crosswinds that are coming through. when you talk to your dealers on the ground, what are you hearing about the consumers' interest and willingness to spend on pools? what are dealers really concerned about today? and has their concern shifted any more recently as we've come into the year?
scott rajeski -- president and chief executive officer
yes. so, susan, we've been stating with quite a few dealers recently, as we go back out there talking to folks. and i think the general view is for us in, i'll say, the short and medium term, we've not really seen a slowdown in the demand at the consumer level with our dealers. a lot of our dealers are booked out through 2022 for new pool installs.
many are actually booking out into early 2023 as well. now look, there's also pockets of the country where we have dealers that have capacity. they can still get pools in the ground this year. we have dealers who are continuing to add crews based on the demand.
and for our dealers who may be seeing a slowdown, that's where we're cranking up our lead generation engine to make sure we keep the leads flowing to them. there's plenty of demand out there. i think we feel strong with this fiberglass conversion story, which can help drive with the cost ratability of that project. well, look, in general, i think, we do need to be cautious of it and watch it as interest rates and everything increase.
but the pool buying decision is one that's made over many months, if not years. we'll continue to drive the demand and leads to our dealers. and we feel really good where we sit with the long-term projections of the industry. we're still well off at peak at where we were before.
and i think there's still a lot of room to run in here for us in general.
susan maklari -- goldman sachs -- analyst
and just following up on that really quickly. you made the comment that you've got backlogs all the way through this year and then even into the early parts of '23. are those people that have put deposits down on their pools? or how secure is that backlog? how should we think about exactly what that's indicating?
scott rajeski -- president and chief executive officer
yes. i think we've talked about this a couple of times on various calls. we really don't see cancellations in the industry to any extent. at least we don't -- we've not seen any change in the trajectory of cancellations.
there are some. but the power of it for us is, right -- if there was a cancellation, we can take that pool just to the next dealer and homeowner that's waiting for it. but again, at the consumer level, the homeowner level, right, they're putting down a significant deposit for that pool buying decision. well, it could vary from 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%.
i think the consumer is unlikely to walk away from that cash deposit once they've made that decision. and i think more importantly, once they pull the family and the children are getting a pool, it's going to be tough to tell a kid not to walk away from it. so we don't worry about it. we think it's pretty solid and strong across the board.
and again, the ability to crank up that lead in, and then i can't stress this one off, the power of that seo and driving the demand, we talk about how many homes are out that don't have a swimming pool, homes in existence where folks are out there replacing something else in their backyard, invest in their home line and outdoor lifestyle space. we don't worry about it right now at all.
susan maklari -- goldman sachs -- analyst
ok. all right. that's very helpful color. thank you.
goodluck with everything.
scott rajeski -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, susan.

next questions comes from josh pokrzywinski with morgan stanley. please go ahead.
josh pokrzywinski -- morgan stanley -- analyst
good morning, guys. so just a couple of questions here. i guess, first, could you just sort of refresh us on where we're at maybe versus the start of the pandemic on kind of where the all-in price to a consumer is for a fiberglass pool versus where you think a granite pool might be coming in? just trying to see what kind of the relative inflation looks like and what maybe that gap has looked like over time?
scott rajeski -- president and chief executive officer
good question, josh. and again, i'll say high level without giving specific dollar amounts because i think it varies region to region, fiberglass versus concrete or granite. i think -- overall, i think we still maintain the same gap in a pricing standpoint. i'm not going to say it's exactly 28%.
but let's just take in that 25% to 30% range from the data that i've seen. the average ticket price of a slowing pool to the consumer in the backyard has gone up over the last two to three years by, you could call it, again, just -- an average number, i'll throw out there, 20%, 25%. but the gap and the advantage we have versus concrete still hold, that thesis is still strong. it still resonates at the consumer level for us.
we just continue to see the conversion being driven there. and look, i think this is a point where the rating acquisition really plays well for us where it made a little bit more on the lower-priced entry-level pool. still a great pool, great product. we're seeing really nice success there, where a homeowner didn't want to pay the higher ticket price.
we have that full product offering from that entry-level pool all the way up through the premium product of the fiberglass. we still maintain that advantage, which is very powerful for us in where we sit today.
josh pokrzywinski -- morgan stanley -- analyst
and then, i know that a lot of the strategy around dealers have been kind of getting your best dealers to be able to sell even more. but if you had to break down sort of the volume growth that you guys have seen here, how much of that would you sort of attribute to kind of more sales per dealer versus bringing on more dealers over the past two years?
scott rajeski -- president and chief executive officer
yes. over the past two -- the hard data, it's probably 50-50, right? so if you remember, as we moved through some of the challenges we had last year with resin and, i mean, we don't want to go back there, right, we focused on supporting our bigger and better dealers that were out there, right? we wanted to drop off the best dealers to make sure they did supply our product. so i'd say probably the majority of our revenue has come from driving incremental capacity with our existing dealer base. that doesn't mean that we've stopped the slowdown of signing up new dealers at the core thesis to us, and it's something we always do in bringing on new dealers.
and i would say, i think that's a big lever we're going to use to our advantage now. i think we've talked about the new training center opening up down in florida. we're actually down there two weeks over our board meeting. and i'm telling at some point, we'll get all of you down there.
it is an extremely impressive facility, the work that the entire team has done to stand it up. we're sold out for all of our boot camps as we go through next year. now, those boot camps are going to be new dealers coming into the pipeline for us, to teach them how to install fiberglass package pools, liners, auto covers, the full product array, as well as bringing in some dealers who've been with us for the last two or three years that we've brought on new, who were not able to come to a live hands-on training boot camp like we did in the past. we went to the virtual boot camp training.
so the fact that we're sold out through the rest of the year with those boot camps tells you we've got a good, healthy flow of new and existing dealers in the pipeline to continue to drive that capacity creation in the industry, to get more pools in the ground for the home owner.
josh pokrzywinski -- morgan stanley -- analyst
perfect. appreciate it.
scott rajeski -- president and chief executive officer
you're welcome, josh.

[operator instructions] our next question is from ryan merkel with william blair. please go ahead.
ryan merkel -- william blair and company -- analyst
hey, guys. thanks for taking the question. so my first question is on the outlook. can you help us quantify the impact to 2q either for sales or ebitda from the three headwinds that you called out? and then sort of related, do you see most of the recovery in 3q? or does some of that recovery from these issues also bleed into 4q?
mark borseth -- chief financial officer
coming on top of our really strong q1, we're very pleased with posting up today. scott did mention a couple of challenges that we face in q2, that we believe are very short term in nature. but when we kind of think about those three things, whether it's the fire, which -- very unfortunate incident. so happy that nobody was injured there -- which we believe will have a minimal impact on the full year.
the really tough level that we experienced in the month of april as we kicked off q2, and then some of the supply chain challenges that we're seeing and working our way through, and to be through by the end of the second quarter. i think at the end of the day, you could probably split those a third, a third, a third as we've looked at that and thought about those things. and again, we think of those as for a short-term impact in q2. as a result of that, we combined our very strong q1 with what we think we're going to see in q2 here, and are providing some color around that first half split that we think is going to be in that 46% to 48% of midpoint guidance for the full year.
so you put those two things together, we think we're going to land there for the first half. for the balance of the year, i think the thing i would comment on there, ryan, is, as we talked in our q4 call, and we thought about volumes throughout the year, we did expect to see softer volume in the first half of this year coming off of the really strong performance we had last year in the first half, and then picking up pretty significantly in the second half of this year. unfortunately, we had the tough resin availability challenge for us in the second half last year, so we're coming up on some softer comps in the second half. so we'd expect to see volumes pick up in the second half of this year, which then gets us to the full year outlook that we're very happy to stand behind today.
ryan merkel -- william blair and company -- analyst
for my second question, maybe over to scott back to all this worry about the consumer. scott, i've been taking a lot of questions about how your business might perform in a downturn. so i think it would be helpful if you could discuss how each of your three product segments might perform if we see a consumer downturn? and then also, what could decremental margins look like if you see a sales decline? i'm not looking for anything specific, but maybe a range or even a way to think about it?
scott rajeski -- president and chief executive officer
yes. i'll just put a quick financial model together for you to answer this one. from a high level, i think that the important thing for one to understand here is, the business we've created is just so different from where we were three, four years ago, five years ago, 10 years ago. so i think we're much better positioned in terms of how we run the business overall, and the variability of the cost structure that we've created.
the diversity of the product offering and the regional offer we have -- we now also have the business down in australia and new zealand. so we're positioned a lot better than we've ever been. if you think about the different categories, product categories, that repair and replacement market for us is always a very healthy growing segment of the business. if you want a swimming pool and you need a new liner or a new cover, you really can't go without that very long, right? you want your pool operational.
so that business, we really don't typically see any kind of downturn as it goes. if anything, you might see an uptick where people are making the decision, hey, things are tough, i'm going to give my pool redone, so i'm going to be stuck at home. the -- let's say the in-ground category, which is fiberglass and the other packaged pool segment, again, i think the price point of those pools versus the competitive product, the concrete pool, we have a cost advantage right out of the gate upfront, and we have the lower cost of total cost of ownership. so i think what we would see is the switching power potentially from concrete to fiberglass and/or vinyl liner pool accelerate.
and again, the auto cover category, the cover category is just such a critical component from safety, the efficiency of operating your pool. i think we're in the early stages of really driving the penetration of that one, and we would continue to push that on our products. and even if pool starts, let's say, slow down, flattened out or a slight pullback, the thesis of our long-term growth model is to drive penetration against that other product, right? and we believe we can continue to grab, share and grow. and that's why, as we've been talking over the last year or so since we became public, we have such confidence in that 10% to 12% top line growth algorithm of ours.
look, if it, let's say got all the way around and back to your point on the margins and all of that, i think we've got a lot of triggers we can pull from a variability, the breadth of our offering, all the programs we offer out there across the board from a cost containment, cost contingency, where we should be able to maintain pretty healthy margins across the board in pretty much any scenario that could be out there, other than, let's say, the doomsday scenario of a really deep recession now. but i think, again, we would whether every single scenario that we could come through. and that's what's creates up this team. and if you think about the last three years, how many challenges have been thrown at us, and how the team has performed and the result this business is posted over a three-year period, that's a testament to the strength of our team, our dealers and the brand we have here at latham.
ryan merkel -- william blair and company -- analyst
really helpful. thanks, guys.
operator
and the next question today comes from tom wojs with baird. please go ahead.
tom wojs -- robert w. baird and company -- analyst
hey, guys. good morning. maybe just on the demand side. as you kind of think about incoming orders and kind of the prospective buyer pool or buyer -- i guess, pun intended buyer pool for pools that's out there, have you seen any change in kind of the income level cohort with the new orders? so for example, are you seeing more orders from kind of higher income households or less from lower income house -- so just kind of wondering what the mix on the income level cohort looks like with new orders?
mark borseth -- chief financial officer
yes. good question. we don't really see that detail of, let's say, the income levels for the consumer who's buying the pools from our dealers. but i can share with you a couple of key data points that i picked up with some time i've spent with some folks out there.
the average price point of let's say the pool going into the backyard, continues to increase. and look, there's a couple of anecdotal points where a few dealers have said, they've seen the average price point of the backyard pool install move up significantly by 20%, 25%, which could be an indicator that there is a strength at the higher income level or the higher net worth equity level of homeowners willing to double down and invest in the yards. but again, as the price point has moved up in general, we've not really seen a slowdown in that demand, and there's our dealers being sold out to '23. but i think it is an interesting question.
it is one we watch. but again, back to the breadth of our portfolio, we have a price point pool that starts at the lower level all the way up to the premium level. so even if you did see a slowdown, we would just shift someone from maybe a fiberglass pool to a vinyl pool, they want to be aluminum wall pools and still make sure we got a latham pool in the backyard.
tom wojs -- robert w. baird and company -- analyst
and then just on the weather side, i guess, how does a floor kind of start to april kind of filter in for the rest of the season? i guess, is there any way just to think about how much of your business is in the midwest, northeastern and canada? just for perspective?
scott rajeski -- president and chief executive officer
yes. so look, every year or season in the pool industry, you've got to fight through weather, and it's just part of the business we're in. and there's always a slow start to the season and just back to '19 with the wet spring on record in the u.s., right? i said that probably a couple of times here over the months. and we're really just entering the peak pool building season.
as you come in to, let's say, the middle of may, folks are trying to get that first pool in for memorial day, the memorial day barbecue, right? then there's a big push in june for the 4th of july party. then it's everyone -- you got the whole august, september build season. there's a lot of runway to make up if you get off with slow start, like what seems to be happening here in many areas of the country. so we don't worry about it.
i think that's the magic of our dealers. though, they might have to start working a saturday and a sunday here and there to catch up, but they do that to get those pools and liners into the homeowner. so we don't -- i don't think we really worry about it because -- just look at what happened in '19 -- 2021, right, you keep pushing pools right up into christmas. and i guess that's where the fiberglass product can continue to be installed deeper into the winter months than the other two types of products that are out there, which gives us that confidence that a slow start won't hurt us long term for the season.
tom wojs -- robert w. baird and company -- analyst
ok. ok. good. thanks a lot, guys.
good luck on the rest of your [inaudible]

keith, i'll answer it two ways. one, it really is region dependent where you sit. and what i'll say, there's parts of the country right now where we've worked through the backlog, we're in a really good position, where, if you the consumer, once you're on a dealer and you wanted a pool, we could -- and the dealer had the open slot, right -- that's the key thing. if the dealer had capacity, had an open slot and had a crew, i can ship you a pool tomorrow, in some locations.
so i would say in many places, we're kind of back to what i would call normal lead times where we used to sit. we used to quote it in a couple of weeks. other places, again, if it's a particular model or a region where we're still churning through, it could be out still several months in particular regions where dealers have healthier backlogs, those that are sold out in the 2023. so it's really that dynamic.
and for the rest of the business, again, back to the team, we've done a tremendous job getting back what i would call our world-class leading service levels across the industry, covers, liners, the in-ground vinyl business. we're in a really good position across the board there. and it's not just us, i think it's the entire channel, the wd stock in the product, the dealer can walk in, get the components they need to quickly turn those pools around for the consumer. but fiberglass is a little extended out still in many of the regions of the country.

and did acquisitions quite relevant
mark borseth -- chief financial officer
so we're -- as far as rating goes, look, we're very pleased with the way that business is performing. it's part of our in-ground pool product category, which i think is up around $111 million, $112 million, grew nicely in the quarter. we don't specifically break out radiant -- i'd just remind everybody, it's a relatively small business. i think we disclosed that last year, total sales were somewhere in the $35 million range.
and as pleased as we are with that performance, they also are -- have a pretty full order book right now. so we're not really expecting any real significant growth synergies this year. it's probably going to be more 2023 before we start seeing that.
keith hughes -- truist securities -- analyst
ok. thank you.
mark borseth -- chief financial officer
you're welcome, keith.
operator
and our next question comes from ken zener with keybanc. please go ahead.
ken zener -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
good morning, everybody.
mark borseth -- chief financial officer
good morning, ken.
scott rajeski -- president and chief executive officer
hey, ken.
ken zener -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
well, i appreciate your patience with all these questions around a relatively new market to most of us on the public side of the cyclical concern. so just within that vein, obviously, you held the guidance for the year, that's good, kind of, at least in our world, is better on the gross margin and called out 2q headwinds. so could -- just trying to understand the cadence here. you talked about an inventory lift in 1q.
mark, would you care to quantify the benefit of that?
mark borseth -- chief financial officer
yes. in the first quarter, look, we had some nice things going on in the gross margin. we continue to realize the benefits of our pricing actions. we're seeing asps increase.
we continue to stay out ahead of inflation. the inventory benefit that we mentioned was 230 basis points in the quarter. and look, we're going to give that back over the years as inventory levels come down.
ken zener -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
and could you perhaps -- i mean, generally speaking, i think about hard assets get better, fixed cost absorption. is that the largest component of that 230 basis point risk. is that how we should think about it?
mark borseth -- chief financial officer
no, i think the way you want to think about that is, as we've made some decisions to increase our inventory levels since the end of the year to help support the business, we see some of our overhead being absorbed into the inventory sitting on the balance sheet. we do continue to invest in our manufacturing overhead capability, which gave us some negative fixed cost leverage, because we do want to stay ahead of demand here and make sure that we can address demand going forward. so it's really two different things. one is the benefit of the inventory build.
the other is the absolute size of our overhead going forward that gave us a little negative leverage in the quarter.
ken zener -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
and then, given what you talked about kind of headwinds in 2q, is it reasonable to assume that there might be a little more pressure in 2q versus that adjusted baseline ex the inventory build? or is there some real seasonality to that we might expect? and just asking, last year, obviously, we saw increasing costs 2q, 3q, 4q. so i'm not sure we have a clear sense on the operating cadence there.
mark borseth -- chief financial officer
yes, i think as we look at the challenges that scott mentioned in q2, we tend to think about those more as top line challenges and short term in nature. the supply chain challenge has the potential to impact our revenue a bit in q2 as we work through that issue and come out clean in q3. the same thing with the weather, right, more of a top line issue, which was an april event. i think the one that maybe impacts cost a bit, ken, is the fire, right? we'll have to see how that impacts.
it will have some impact on the top line. we'll probably incur a few incremental dollars there as well in the second quarter, as we think about the guide for the second quarter as part of our first half color of 46% to 48% on the top line.
operator
