thank you. [operator instructions] our first question comes from chris wetherbee with citi. your line is now open.
chris wetherbee -- citi -- analyst
hey. thanks, and good morning, guys. maybe i could start on the container shipping side. so from a big picture perspective, it appears that liners are getting a bit more disciplined using blank sailings and other capacity management tools to be able to sort of manage rate and supply demand within the business. when you think about sort of that consolidation that's occurred and that sort of greater discipline on the liner side, what do you think that means for tonnage providers as we think out over the course of the next couple of years? does the pool get a little bit more selective? are there other things that we're not thinking about? just want to get a sense of how you guys sort of think about that.
bing chen -- president and chief executive officer
good morning, chris. this is bing. to answer your question, it is absolutely true. liners today i think, through this covid-19, is further proof that i think from an industry standpoint, is much more sustainable because i think through the consolidation, liners have been more focusing on delivering the quality service. meanwhile, i think they are also focusing on vertically integrating. for example, i think yesterday, cma acquired a port, and today maersk acquired a port, and also i think they acquired some other liners acquired the land transportation. so from that perspective, i think the liners are increasingly focusing on the quality of their services. and therefore for the tonnage providers, i think what they're looking for is the scale, the quality and reliability.
i think this is exactly what seaspan is building is that through this covid-19 as an example, while we've been impacted through the charter rates, however if you're looking at our utilization, we have been able to maintain over 97% throughout the past quarters. and this is really a testament of even during this unprecedented market situation, i think liners are looking to companies like a tonnage provider, seaspan, where we provide the quality service, at the same time, we provide the flexibility. flexibility in terms of our scale for example, when the liners, they have different needs on the vessel size or location that we were able to swap these vessels by size, by location, and between the customers, which is also the reason why i think we were able to maintain such a high utilization rate.
so in general, i think going forward as a tonnage provider as we said it before, that we need to provide the solution, we need to have the scale and we need to have the flexibility and quality. and that's what the liners are looking for. by simply providing a vessel itself, definitely that's not what they're looking for. they are looking for a partner to support them to grow their business, meanwhile be able to work with them on a variety of needs with the vessel being one of the solution providers, whether it's the technology, whether it's the operations, whether it's a commercial, financing, accounting, so all aspects. i think that's why we are building the business as a true partner and solution provider to them.
chris wetherbee -- citi -- analyst
okay. that's helpful. and then in terms of operating on the containership side during the quarter, should we assume that this quarter kind of from a cost perspective with some of the covid disruptions, is what we should expect this type of cost performance in 3q and 4q? some operators have suggested that things were actually fairly clean from a cost standpoint in 2q, so maybe you might actually see some step-up. but i think you're suggesting that you guys were moving assets around and doing some interchanges of crews during this process, so maybe it' s sort of the consistent run rate. just want to get a sense of how clean these results are from a cost perspective and how we should think about sort of maybe the back half.
bing chen -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, i will give a general update, and then ryan and torsten, you can give more details. on the cost side, we are very proud to say that given the covid-19 impact, that it does create a lot of limitations on operations. however, i think we are extremely proud, and that's why i want to answer your question, because i'm extremely proud of our team. given these limitations, our team, whether it' s onshore and also the seafarers, they've been able to demonstrate our operational excellence. in general, i think the number speaks for itself in a way that our cost on the operational side actually has been minimally impacted. the only impact to us due to this covid is really on the revenue side. and with that, i think that ryan and torsten, you can add more please.
ryan courson -- chief financial officer
yeah, so thanks for the question. if you go to page 17 of the earnings release, you'll see incremental disclosure on an operating cost per day. as we've discussed before, we don't provide specific commentary on run rates or what the back half will look like specifically, but i think looking at the implied guidance for the full year provides a helpful view of what we think opex will be for the back half of the year. i'll turn it over to torsten, but what i will say is torsten and the operations team have done a fantastic job of managing cost during this environment, and there have been a number of cost-saving elements as it relates to covid, whether it's crew optimization or working with various repair and maintenance programs.
but with that, torsten, i turn it over to you.
torsten holst pedersen -- chief operating officer of seaspan
yeah. thanks, ryan. as ryan said, we are not disclosing run rates as such, but the model we have is robust to short and medium-term fluctuations, even as severe as these. we have been trying to reduce cost wherever to mitigate for covid impact. we will see bits and pieces come back in q3 and q4, but that's all included in our guidance.
chris wetherbee -- citi -- analyst
okay. that's helpful. last question, just sort of bigger picture, you've obviously been busy on the containership side. you did the apr deal about a year ago. i guess i just want to get a sense as you're thinking about putting capital to work, where you see attractive opportunities? whether that be on the shipping side, if it's beyond container shipping or if it's sort of elsewhere? just trying to get a sense of where you guys are thinking about opportunities and putting capital to work going forward.
bing chen -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, chris. i will answer the question. just to clarify, on the apr side, we actually just acquired at the end of february this year, so we actually just recently acquired apr. we did announce the apr acquisition last year.
in terms of the capital allocation, that is an excellent question because looking forward, i think what we can say is that we will continue to focusing on to be the best-in-class asset operator and selectively we own the assets and operating the assets. what we can say going forward is that what we will do and what we will not do. what we will do is that going forward, first of all, we're going to continue to strengthen our management team. i think that's evidenced by what we have done and what we have built the management team over the past years, where we were able to focus on execution and deliver the results.
and that's why we were able to transform seaspan and that's why we intend to do the same with apr going forward. so going forward, i think for us, we're going to continue to build the team because with the dynamic team that we have, i think whenever there's an opportunities that we will be able to realize those opportunities and creating the value for our shareholders.
the second thing that we would do definitely is that we're going to continue to grow because we have the financial strength, we have the management expertise, and i think we have the ability to create as we have done so far, those types of growth opportunities, because all of those opportunities have been created with our partners and the customers. so, we will leverage those trends and continue to expand our business and create the value going forward.
the third part i think that we're definitely going to do in terms of allocating capital is that we're going to continue to focusing on our existing business of containership and also the power energy. these two platforms that give us the base and leverage because they are the market leaders in their respective area. we have the customers, we have the financial strength, and we have the industry networks that support us to continue to lead our business. so therefore, we will continue to allocate the capital in those areas.
and fourthly, i think as we said, the things that we don't do is that we will not allocating the capital for the sake of allocating capital. we will never go into any kind of a growth opportunity just because we think it's interesting or we're going through any of type of, for example, auction process. and also, we will not let ourselves to be distracted because we will only grow if we see this right opportunity that can create long-term, sustainable value, and we're going to continue to focusing on growing, whether it's organically, aggressively [phonetic] of our existing business, which is the container shipping business, and also the power business.
chris wetherbee -- citi -- analyst
okay. well, thanks very much for the time. i appreciate it.
bing chen -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from michael goldie with bank of montreal. your line is now open.
michael goldie -- bank of montreal -- analyst
hey, guys. good morning, and thank you for taking my question. my first question revolves around guidance, especially seaspan. it seems fairly unchanged, despite the new vessel acquisitions. can we get a sense of the puts and takes in this updated guidance? are slightly lower charter rates being offset by the new acquisitions?
ryan courson -- chief financial officer
thanks, mike, and happy to walk you through some puts and takes. on the revenue side, we do have the new acquisitions that are flowing in, in the back half of the year. and that impacts obviously revenue and then operating expense. and then you do have, to your point, the offset of some lower charter rates on the back end of the year related to the covid-19 environment. that said, as bing mentioned in his remarks at the beginning of the call, 98% of our revenue for 2020 at this point is contracted. and so, we feel very comfortable with the tightening of guidance that we provided going back for the rest of the year.
michael goldie -- bank of montreal -- analyst
okay, perfect. and then kind of looking at your conversations with your customers, how are those negotiations going? how are they looking relative to your existing contracts that are beginning to roll off? are customers acknowledging the recovering environment?
peter curtis -- chief commercial officer of seaspan
it's peter. that's a good question. i think as we, both bing and i, have said in the presentation that we work very closely with our customers and we have only become closer as we've gone through this trying period. the result has been that we've maintained utilization of the vessels, so in other words, we've been the one to get the employment versus others. we can't really control rates in the spot market. as ryan says, the spot area of our business accounts for 2% of our business of our revenues.
we engaged very early with our customers. it's not a case of simply getting the employment but we engage earlier than when the vessel rolls off. for example, we've done an earlier dry docking on a couple of our large vessels with one of the main liners. we anticipated that they would also be suffering from low container volumes during this period. by advancing that, we were able to negotiate out of that an extension to that contract of over three years, so we seek these kinds of opportunities. we have the flexibility and the capability to perform along those measures.
michael goldie -- bank of montreal -- analyst
okay. that's really helpful.
bing chen -- president and chief executive officer
just to add to what peter said that in terms of our fleet of 125 vessels, for 2021, about 85% of our revenue on seaspan is already contracted. so, we have about 15% of spot, spot meaning those vessels on charter that is less than one year, so our exposure is rather limited. and in addition to that, because we can provide those integrated solutions and services with our customer, we are working very closely with our customer, and we are very confident that in terms of continued rolling these vessels into the long-term contracts. it's part of the nature of our business and as a matter of fact right now because of the rate is relatively low, it's not in our top priority to actually enter into a long-term charter at this point because i think that the rate as we speak right now is recovering.
michael goldie -- bank of montreal -- analyst
okay, perfect. and then my final question has to do with apr. utilization was around 68% for the quarter, and it sounds like those mexicali contracts didn't really kick in or they weren't realized for the full quarter. how can we think about getting utilization up closer to that mid-70% range that we've seen historically? will those mexicali contracts being in full effect for q3 get us closer to that mark?
bing chen -- president and chief executive officer
yes michael, i think the way to -- that's why i think the way we look at the apr business to a certain extent is similar to seaspan's is that we're going to work on both opportunities to improve the utilization. one is through the extension. the other one is through the new business opportunities. as you know, that apr's fleet is more than half, it's under long-term contract. the current covid obviously has certain impact in terms of the reductions to overall -- the power consumption. however, i think we believe it's temporarily slowing down the decision-making process and also of course result in some, i think, cancellation of the projects. for example, back in may, the puerto rico prefer had a demand for about 350 megawatts of power. but due to this covid and for the peak season, they did not need to have this power, so therefore there are certain impacts.
however, i think as we continue to working on both the existing type of opportunities, that the management team are working on other opportunities such as flare -- we started looking at other opportunities such as flare to gas, lpg, and other grid stabilization, so to broaden our portfolio of offerings, so therefore, that we will have more opportunities to get the turbines utilized. so over the period, i think we are still confident we will be able to improve the turbines' utilization through the expansion and also the new opportunities.
ryan courson -- chief financial officer
and then michael, just as a clarification, for the third quarter pro forma for the mexicali, what you'll see is 80% utilization for the apr power utilization fleet.
michael goldie -- bank of montreal -- analyst
okay, perfect. thank you very much.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from ben nolan with stifel. your line is now open.
ben nolan -- stifel -- analyst
hey, good morning. let me start by saying i appreciate the enhanced metrics that you guys put out. any additions to visibility is certainly helpful for my job. i have a handful of questions. the first one is pretty easy for you, ryan. with the addition of the rating here, i'm curious -- it's a little non-traditional, it's not s&p or moody's, why'd you decide to go that direction? not that it matters a lot, just sort of curious.
ryan courson -- chief financial officer
hey, ben, good morning. thanks for the question, and it' s a good one. kroll actually has a dominant position in the rating of industrial transportation companies. and as we think about potential institutional credit access for our business going forward, we think it's an incredibly important relationship and one that we're quite excited to continue to develop.
ben nolan -- stifel -- analyst
okay, perfect. and then i've got one seaspan-type question and one maybe multi-faceted apr question, if i can. but on seaspan as it relates to this most recent transaction, i had seen that it was actually from another vessel owner, as in a liner that might not be right. maybe you can help me, but i' m curious if there are maybe thematically more opportunities from maybe people like yourselves, who are owners, but maybe don't have the same financial position and might be looking to sort of take advantage of maybe equity that they have in their existing assets to improve their balance sheets.
ryan courson -- chief financial officer
yeah. thanks, ben. i think if you look at the fragmentation that exists, and we talk about this in a variety of settings. there is ample opportunity for further consolidation in the owner space. and whether it's in the near term or over a longer period of time, we expect that consolidation to play out. as bing mentioned during his commentary, our drive for consolidation isn't for the sake of consolidation, it's for strategically growing our business with the right risk-adjusted returns behind it. and so, we expect these opportunities on the owner side to continue to be available. but it's important for us to not only think about what opportunities exist, but how to match and marry those with our customers.
ben nolan -- stifel -- analyst
okay.
bing chen -- president and chief executive officer
it's also just tied up to the previous question that we were talking about is that there really -- if we're looking at these opportunities, not only i think you need to have the equity but also you need to have the customer needs. all these growth opportunities we have had so far is all driven by our customers' demand. our liners, they value our services and they want us to provide a service to them. and that is -- i think that's also one of the primary driver for these type of opportunities.
ben nolan -- stifel -- analyst
and then if i could switch over to apr and sort of ask a multi-faceted question, i guess looking at the fleet, a little bit less than half of it is still diesel from what i see, with the balance being gas. i'm curious, number 1 is what's sort of the strategy in terms of the shift toward more gas-fired power generation internally, and is that something where there are opportunities just to buy? any color on sort of what the global position of that might look like or order book of new capacity?
and then sort of tying in with that, it was interesting, bing, that you mentioned looking at sort of other tangential opportunities. something that we've been hearing a whole lot about lately is hydrogen -- possibly hydrogen for power generation. i'm curious if you guys have looked at all at that, and i realize it's early stages, but is that an area that you might, would, or are investigating possibly delving into in conjunction with what you're doing on the gas generation side?
bing chen -- president and chief executive officer
sure ben, i will try to answer the first question, and i think peter and torsten would be able to answer the second question on the hydrogen side access. it's funny that we actually had some discussions this morning -- yesterday.
but with regarding to apr, currently yes, we still have about 500 megawatts of capacity, but over the -- to answer your question, over the time, we are actually intend to divest in all these dpms and focusing on gas turbines because we want to be in the forefront of environmental compliance. so therefore, going forward, we're going to be more focusing on gas turbines and divest the diesel generators.
in terms of the business going forward, as you just mentioned, i think with the existing fleet that we have, we are going to be focusing on increasing the utilization. and that's the first and foremost priorities before we further considering growing the business, because i think there's a lot more that we can improve from the existing business.
then as the market, because you know right now the energy and power market is still evolving. i think that we are very well attuned to the market development. so therefore as the market develops, and as i mentioned earlier whether it's flare to gas, whether it's lpg and other technology requirements, and also the transition from traditional power to those alternative power with the wind and solar, i think that they are more increasing demand, for example, the grid stabilization. so, we're going to grow our business as the market evolves and as our customer demands. so, i think that is something that we are confident that we're going to continue to follow the demand of the market and our customer. but first and foremost, we're going to focus on increasing the utilization of the existing fleet.
ryan courson -- chief financial officer
thanks. bing. i'll let torsten jump in if he has any thoughts on the hydrogen ship side. i think that's an area that we definitely evaluated. as it relates to apr, ben, and hydrogen opportunities, as bing mentioned earlier in the q&a, we evaluate a whole host of different technology applications to the various projects that we've engaged in, hydrogen being one of the many. and i think as we go forward, it will be a mix of evaluating these different technologies as well as different asset and project length combinations from a total growth perspective for apr.
peter curtis -- chief commercial officer of seaspan
yeah, it's peter here. just in regards to the ship side, i can't speak very much to the power generation other than what bing has said. the focus is on utilization and opportunities, near to medium-term opportunities such as the utilization of flare. on the marine side, there's a few considerations that we have to take into account. one is the availability of fuel. a second one is we have to carry this stuff wherever we go. and thirdly, we have to carry enough of it to complete the voyage. so, i think we are all aware of the various horizons facing the marine industry in regards to alternative fuels in line with the imo ambitions on greenhouse gas reduction through 2030 and 2050. so, we are very active in considering alternatives.
it takes many years in terms of the availability of a sustainable fuel to be available to the market, lng, for instance, over 20 years, 25 years to become readily available in the margin market as a fuel because the production which is where the lng tankers go is not necessarily where vessels need to be to tank up as a fuel. so, we have been engaged in a number of feasibility projects. we engage with partners in the broader industry, such as oil majors, classification societies, engine makers, etc. to develop our views and potential visions of where we would go. i think one of the talks around town is about lng as a fuel. thing is that's not a carbon-free fuel, so it is a pathway to improvement. but in the end, we'd have to consider alternative fuels such as ammonia -- it is one potential, or others that would be carbon-neutral by capturing carbon, producing a fuel out of it, so you're not actually increasing the carbon footprint.
ben nolan -- stifel -- analyst
great. i appreciate it. thanks guys.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from randy giveans with jefferies. your line is now open.
randy giveans -- jefferies -- analyst
how are you gentlemen? how is it going?
bing chen -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. thank you, randy.
randy giveans -- jefferies -- analyst
great. i guess first question, other than container shipping and power generation solutions, what other infrastructure areas might overlap with your customers' interests as well as atco's interests? and then is there a role on how maybe diversified the company becomes?
bing chen -- president and chief executive officer
randy, that's a very good question. i think that in terms of what we are looking at the synergy in terms of between the container shipping and the power, i think right now it's more from the business model and i think the -- more with the sharing services. going forward, i think the opportunity will be largely dependent on what kind of further customer demand and also what are the investment opportunities that brings. we do not set specific silos of target where we're going to grow into, rather i think right now, given these two platforms that we have and i think we're going to continue to build on that, and i think vertically and horizontally, we will see the right opportunities and will allocate the capital. but whenever we do, if and when we're going to do that, i think we have to stick to our investment and capital allocation discipline and the criteria. and so, that's what in general what we're looking at future opportunities.
randy giveans -- jefferies -- analyst
okay. and then, focusing on your containership contracts, especially some of the longer-term ones, there's been some recent announcements of maybe a reduction in extension of charters. have you been in talks with some of your counterparties for similar arrangements?
bing chen -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. you are talking about the modification of the charter contract?
randy giveans -- jefferies -- analyst
sure.
bing chen -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. this is actually -- this is [phonetic] our normal course of business, because as you know, that once you enter into a long-term contract, it's a matter of getting paid for the stream of cash flow. given the nature of the business that we are in, we are constantly actually working with our customers. it depends on their business needs, and therefore that we're going to develop the solutions with them. however, i think with these payments, the term changes, there's two principles that we're looking at. number 1 is that there has to be a win-win situation, meaning it's a mutually beneficial for us and also for our customer. the second discipline principle that we hold is that these type of modifications, it's not at any way to compromise the credit quality, meaning the cash flow qualities.
so, that being said, we're actually constantly working with our customers in looking at their business needs and modify the contract in a way that -- what we call less for longer, or more for less. for example in q1 2019, we modified a contract where we actually received accelerated payment of $270 million. and right now, i think due to the market conditions, some of the -- for example, the liner customers, their demand has changed. but however, they would want to retain seaspan's services over a longer period of time. and that's why we're going to have these type of opportunity for less for longer.
but once again, these less for longer, for us, that we will be able to get a longer term of guaranteed utilization, at the same time as long as the rate of the charter and it meets our return requirements. and i think for our customer, they will be able to get what they need in terms of the capacity supply as well as their cash flow management. but once again, there's no circumstances where we will compromise the quality of the cash flow.
ryan courson -- chief financial officer
and then randy, maybe just to follow onto that, i think when bing and i joined in 2018, a big point of inquiry from the investment community was whether seaspan was able to work through renewed extensions across our fleet. and i think if you go back to 2018 and you look at our long-term contracted revenue then versus where we're at now, i think the management team has been really focused on ensuring that that backlog of contracted cash flows supports not only the liability management program that we have, but the scale of the integrated operating platform that we're participating with.
and then if you take a more specific approach to your question for the near term, we've had multiple conversations with customers, nearly every one of the leading global liners on contracts between five years [phonetic] and up to 18 years over the last several weeks even. and so, we feel very confident that these long-term contracts for key supply partners such as seaspan will continue to exist for the foreseeable future, and we're excited about the opportunity to continue to pursue those.
randy giveans -- jefferies -- analyst
perfect. all right. and then, last quick question. in terms of capital allocation, maybe what is the most important priority right now, and how does the current dividend fit into that?
bing chen -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, first of all, the current dividend, we think it's appropriate. however myself and the management team, that we regularly evaluate our dividend policy and present our recommendations to our board for the final decision. dividend policy is part of our capital allocation in a sense that we constantly evaluate what is the best use of our cash flow. so therefore for us, i think this is definitely constantly under our evaluation.
now i think if we're looking at our current stock price relative to the dividend, i think the yield is high, but the way we see that the current situation attribute to maybe two aspects. one is that the general economic environment and the other one is we are still being valued as a capital intensive and a cyclical business. in reality, i think today, as we continue to demonstrate that the reality of atlas is different, different in the sense that we actually -- on one hand, it's capital intensive, but we generate a quality risk-adjusted return. in terms of cyclical, i think we are able to demonstrate again and again that through these cycles, that we can generate stable and predictable cash flow.
so therefore, the reality that has a disconnect, and disconnect is something that i think is, we believe is temporary. and we would also continue because these situations, i think we will continue to focusing on executing and delivering the long-term value. and at the same time, and i think that us as the business that we -- on one hand, we provide the transparency and we deliver the results, but i think one thing myself and the management team needs to do better is to better articulate and better present ourselves to the investors and market, and we believe that ultimately as we create long-term value, the market will recognize that.
ryan courson -- chief financial officer
and then randy, maybe just to follow-on to that, if you think about near-term capital allocation decisions, i would say it's in line with everything we've communicated in the past. we believe that there is great value to improving the credit profile of our business with our long-term goal of achieving a corporate investment-grade credit rating. and so, as we think about alternatives to deploy capital, there's always value in improving the credit profile.
and one of the things that i think that is difficult to see at any given point in time, but by improving the credit profile, it affords us the opportunity to execute on some of these attractive capital allocation initiatives. and so, if you go back to some of the information that we disclosed in the earnings presentation, you'll see we're able to deploy capital at very attractive rates, but we're able to do that because we've been so relentless on the pursuit of credit profile improvement.
and so, i think that you'll continue to see us focused on quality growth, but it will also be with the vein of improving the credit profile because we think that both of those things go hand-in-hand.
randy giveans -- jefferies -- analyst
got it. all right. that's it for me. thanks so much.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from ken hoexter from bank of america. your line is now open.
ken hoexter -- bank of america -- analyst
great. good morning. i'll echo ben's comments on thank you very much for the additional information. maybe bing, if you could provide more color on the current market for vessel acquisitions. is it -- were these willing sellers? was this from the container ship liner companies? and maybe talk a bit about the market for acquisitions.
bing chen -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. good morning ken. and for these acquisitions, once again, none of these [phonetic] acquisition is through any kind of auction process, rather it's a proprietary opportunities. i think it's a mixed of the opportunities either coming from other -- the vessel owners or coming from the liners for a variety of different reasons, where i think we were able to structure in such a -- the transaction where the liners that value our service and want to give us a long-term contract, so that is basically the way we construct these type of growth opportunity.
in a way, first of all, we have to evaluate the type of assets. we want to make sure these are the good assets. they are young, they are large assets, they are fuel efficient, and so therefore these are good assets with a demand and also with a good residual value, because we are managing the assets. then on the back end of it, we need to look at these assets. we never buy any assets on a speculation basis. we only buy the assets when the customer actually need it and they want to sign a long-term contract with us.
and so, these are the type of the opportunities that we will be able to work with the seller and also with our customer. and therefore, that we will be able to create these type of attractive opportunities where, again, it's a win-win situation in the sense that we would be able to provide our services and meanwhile building up our scale and the flexibility and quality. from the customer side, they enjoy our quality, reliability and the skilled services, and that's something we see. as we mentioned earlier, as the liners continue to focusing their end of the services, they are demanding the quality solution provider of the tonnage provider is not a vessel, rather it's a platform, it's a solution, it's a service.
ken hoexter -- bank of america -- analyst
great. and then, i guess i'm going to step back and ask a bigger picture question. we've heard a lot about the move from globalization to localization in supply chains. just want to know how you think about this in terms of your exposure on the containership side and your thoughts on long-term revenue impacts, if any.
bing chen -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. thank you. that's a good question. the way i mean globalization -- despite all these political discussions, i think globalization will continue because ultimately, i think the consumers or businesses will be looking at the cost. and that's one thing. the other thing is the globalization, if you're looking at it from a supply chain standpoint, and i think that the supply chain system have been built over the years with serious capital investment over the time. so even though you want to have this localization, i think number 1, it requires additional capital. number 2, it would need to take time to build a new supply chain. so therefore, i think the globalization definitely is a trend.
now however, is that going to grow as what the globalization has been growing for the kind of speed in the coming years? i think that is going to be slowing down. and i think your question is probably more alert to in terms of global trade. i think global trade definitely will continue. and i think that just is something i don't think that politics will be able to stop it because, once again, you do have to take into consideration of the reality versus the political agenda.
so, in general, we are cautiously optimistic in terms of the continued -- the growth of the globalization and also the global trade. now the case in point, for example, even up to this point with the covid, this is not because of the human, rather it's a natural limitations of this trade. and i think you see the very quick rebound of the global trade. if you're looking at last year with the trade war, and i think still if you're looking at the industry as a whole, and i think our business actually had a record year last year utilization-wise. so therefore, i think from specifically the impact to the container shipping business today, i believe that the impact is minimal. and if and then will be any impact, that's going to take longer time. and this is not something i think we believe that will have the material impact to the industry, and particularly for the long-term contracts we try to secure.
ken hoexter -- bank of america -- analyst
great points, bing. appreciate that insight. last one from me is just a really simple one. i guess, i don't know, maybe ryan, is there any thought from the cornerstone investors to make the stock more liquid? i think the float's only 30% now, and obviously that might be a constraint on some larger investors' ability to move in and out of the stock, so any thoughts to that process.
david sokol -- chairman
this is david. perhaps, i should take this question as chair. i don't see us increasing the liquidity at this point. and i think we -- i think both the fairfax financial as well as washington family are happy with their investment, and i don' t see them selling shares. and in fact, i think consistent with the prior question regarding capital allocation, again depending on where the stock is and where our capital availability is at any given time, i think we're probably more likely to be buying shares than issuing shares, at least under the current environment that i would see.
and i would think that potential share repurchase would be more likely today than a dividend shift, but again, those are all speculative. i think at this point through this covid situation, maintaining our capital and continuing to grow the business is going to be the priority, and dealing with either share purchases or dividend changes would probably be well into the future after covid is behind us.
the only other comment i'd make is obviously if there was an acquisition where we felt we were getting more for the stock than the stock current value, we would certainly consider using stock as an acquisition tool. depending on the acquisition, that may or may not increase liquidity, but -- so i think having said all that, the short answer is i think our shares outstanding are not likely to shift a lot in the near future.
ken hoexter -- bank of america -- analyst
great. dave, appreciate you jumping in. thanks for the thoughts.

operator
welcome to the atlas corp. second quarter 2020 conference call. i would like to remind everyone that this conference call is being recorded today, august 11th, 2020.
i would now like to turn the call over to ryan courson, chief financial officer of atlas.
ryan courson -- chief financial officer
good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us to discuss atlas' second quarter earnings. on the call with me today is atlas' president and ceo, mr. bing chen; seaspan's chief commercial officer; mr. peter curtis; and also available during the q&a session is seaspan's chief operating officer, mr. torsten pedersen; and atlas' chairman, mr. david sokol.
i would like to remind you that our discussion today contains forward-looking statements. actual results may differ materially from those stated or implied due to the risks and uncertainties associated with our business. our known risk factors are discussed in our form 20-f and our reports on the form 6-k filed from time to time in connection with our quarterly financial results, both of which are available on our website for review.
to start, this quarter, we have introduced new non-gaap metrics. we believe these non-gaap metrics will provide our investors a clear understanding of the financial performance of our businesses. i will touch on these new metrics in more detail during the review of our financial performance. for these definitions and reconciliations to the most closely comparable u.s. gaap metrics, please refer to our earnings release or the appendices at the back of this earnings presentation. in addition, we have also provided historical reconciliations for these non-gaap metrics through 2018, which are also available on our website for review.
for today's call, bing will start by providing highlights on our operating performance and corporate recent developments. peter will then provide commentary on seaspan and the containership industry, including impacts from covid-19. i will then wrap up with a review of our recent financial results, including an overview of our new non-gaap financial metrics. i will provide an update on our balance sheet, liquidity and capital allocation initiatives.
with that, i will now pass the call over to bing.
bing chen -- president and chief executive officer
thank you ryan, and good morning, everyone. please turn to slide 4. a lot has happened since our last earnings call, and this is the first full quarter combining apr performance. overall, atlas' performance continues to be strong amid covid-19 due to our resilient business model. we have experienced several macroeconomic downturns in the past and throughout each cycle, and our business continues to deliver strong financial results and quality growth.
during this time, we have focused on four initiatives: first, maintaining asset utilization and expanding our contracted revenue profile; second, ensuring the health and safety of our global team; third, deepening our trusted customer partnerships; and fourth, continuing our disciplined approach to balance sheet management and liquidity. i will highlight these discussions during my update on the development about seaspan and apr energy.
in terms of our asset utilization and the long-term contracted revenue, we have demonstrated resiliency, especially over the last two quarters among the unprecedented market conditions. we've grown long-term contract revenue to $4.6 billion, which provides stability and predictability for our businesses. over 98% of our 2020 midpoint revenue guidance is currently under contract, which is why we are able to tighten our guidance positively this quarter.
at seaspan, we are continuously focusing on expanding existing charter with customers, while strategically acquiring new vessels on long-term charters, as we have demonstrated with our recent acquisition of two high quality 13,000 teu vessels. at apr, like at seaspan, we are focused on operational excellence on existing plants. we are executing on new projects such as the three mexicali sites, which achieved commercial operations since acquiring apr, and focusing on building a pipeline of new quality long-term projects.
these achievements drove our strong financial performance in q2. atlas delivered record quarterly revenue of $363.8 million, with seaspan contributing record containership leasing revenue of $303.8 million. after removing our formal adjusted financial metrics in 2018 to simplify reporting, we are now introducing funds from operations and adjusted ebitda. these two new performance metrics will better reflect our business performance in addition to our standard gaap reporting. we achieved funds from operations per share of $0.64 and adjusted ebitda of $238.9 million this quarter. ryan will discuss the importance of these metrics later.
the 60th consecutive dividend distribution we announced last month reflects our commitment to long-term shareholder value creation. yesterday, we announced that seaspan achieved an investment-grade issuance rating of bbb minus, relating to its cornerstone portfolio financing program and a corporate rating of bb. to achieve this during a time when covid-19 is impacting the global economy is truly a testament to the resiliency of our business model and the dramatic credit improvements we have made since 2018.
please turn to slide 5. we delivered record quarterly revenue, while ensuring the health and safety of our global employees. the wellbeing of our staff remains our top priority. in addition to new business continuity plans, we have implemented new processes and protocols that enable us to continue to deliver our operational excellence. despite the unprecedented pandemic, we facilitated over 800 crew changes in the month of july and integrated 11 vessels into seaspan's fleet during the last eight months. we completed 10 vessel scrubber retrofits on time and on budget despite project complexities and covid-19. we also completed 18 vessel dry dockings.
we continue to focus on environment and safety, receiving our iso 14001 certification, improving our ltif, receiving a u.s. coast guard award for environmental protection, and being awarded outstanding service and operational excellence by our top global liner.
our people are at the core of our success. the fortitude and resourcefulness of our people in unprecedented working conditions has been truly remarkable. i' m extremely proud of our seafarers and want to give our special appreciation for all their hard work and sacrifices they have made to operate 125 vessels 7/24 [phonetic] across the globe through their uncompromised services to our liner customers.
please turn to slide 6, where i will highlight seaspan's development for the quarter. seaspan's performance has been minimally affected by covid-19, as we have proactively adjusted our operations to mitigate potential impacts. seaspan continues to benefit from transformative improvements, long-term partnerships and disciplined growth, while delivering strong financial performance on the back of our solid balance sheet and liquidity management.
we continue our execution on growth opportunities with the recent acquisition of two high quality 13,000 teu containerships for $146 million, which are backed by long-term charter with a leading global liner. this was an attractive acquisition from a risk-adjusted return perspective, which increased our long-term contracted revenue by over $150 million and a contribution of approximately $7 million and $20 million ebitda for 2020 and 2021 respectively. this acquisition was made possible through our long-term partnership approach. as liners are becoming more dominant, they increasingly demand scalable, reliable and flexible partners who provide thoughtful solutions instead of simply supplying tonnage. we expect our continue -- to create those opportunities through our trusted partnership.
while we have been growing over the past year, including 13 acquired vessels with seaspan and the acquisition of apr energy, we have remained disciplined and have not sacrificed our balance sheet nor liquidity simply for the sake of growing. we ended the quarter with a strong liquidity of over $380 million and a pro forma for the acquisition will maintain a strong net debt to equity ratio of approximately 1.2 times. our debt profile remains conservative, with no significant maturity until the end of 2022. i want to reiterate that we have been and will continue to take a disciplined approach to deploying our capital. these investments were all backed by long-term charter with leading global liners as well as meeting our quantitative and qualitative criteria.
in july, we expanded seaspan's $150 million unsecured revolving credit facility by two years, which is important to our liquidity management and a testament of our access to global capital markets through the cycles. just yesterday, seaspan achieved an investment-grade credit rating for its cornerstone financing program, which is a major milestone in our efforts to reduce our cost of funding and scale our asset base.
i'm also pleased to announce the appointment of torsten pedersen as chief operating officer of seaspan. torsten has demonstrated world-class leadership in delivering seaspan's operational excellence over the last two years, and i'm confident that he will excel in his new role as we continue to set the frontier for the operational excellence.
on the commercial side, despite a very challenging market, our team has proven again the strength of our platform by delivering a best-in-class q2 utilization rate of 97.4%. as of today, all 125 vessels in our global fleet have secured charters in place.
please turn to slide 7, where i will provide apr developments for the quarter. as we communicated at our 2019 investor day, we see tremendous upside potential in apr, and are working toward transforming the business to the next level. i'm very pleased to announce the recent appointment of brian rich as the president and coo. brian has deep expertise and networks in the global energy and power sector and was formerly president and coo of apr between 2012 and 2015. brian is well aligned with apr's priority focus going forward, and we are confident in his leadership to drive apr's operational excellence and sustainable growth.
apr's power fleet utilization for q2 was supported by mobilization of eight turbines across three power plants in mexicali. these eight turbines contributed $12 million of revenue in q2, and we expect these projects to contribute approximately $41 million of adjusted ebitda during 2020. due to the mobile and fast power nature of the apr's fleet, we expect the utilization to fluctuate as these turbines are put on different contracts around the world. however, we are confident in our ability to maintain a strong utilization.
while covid-19 has impacted apr's business through a reduction in overall global power consumption, we continue to structure the business as a long-term oriented energy solution provider. our priority is to sustain and improve asset utilization, while focusing on extending the duration of existing contracts. this will require a shift in focus of our partnerships and solution offerings.
in addition, we will continue to be more selective on potential deployment opportunities around the world that meet our risk management criteria. we also continue to execute on our business strategy with strong commitment to esg, divesting idle diesel generators and making operational improvements. just to highlight, during the q2, apr's overall plant availability was maintained at over 98% and an ltir of 0.72.
so with that, i will now hand over to peter.
peter curtis -- chief commercial officer of seaspan
thank you, bing. please turn to slide 9, where i will comment on developments in the global container shipping industry and the impact on seaspan. overall, the container shipping industry continues to operate in somewhat challenging conditions. while these are not ideal, seaspan's position and performance is mitigated by our long-term contracted business, leading position, attractive fleet, and relationships with our leading global partners.
we have both retained and secured charters for our whole fleet against a global idle fleet that peaked 12% in may and has contracted since then to approximately 8% or less. combine this with the disciplined approach displayed by our customers, our performance to date is a testament to our business model. we remain very closely engaged with our customers globally in order to retain business and to seek opportunities to insert ourselves into the niche areas where they have required tonnage solutions in a volatile period of time.
in fact, through this covid affected period, we have only increased dialogue with customers in support of our style of full scope service delivery. and this is proving to enhance our position further. covid's near-term impact is clear with global annualized teu volumes expected to decline approximately 8% to 10% year-on-year from 2019, with pressure primarily on the mainland, asia-europe and asia-north america trades that each comprise approximately 13% of global teu moves.
in contrast, asian countries have steadily been recovering, resulted in intra-asia volumes improving, a trade segment which represents approximately 30% of global teu moves. as we have moved through the first half of 2020, we have seen the most significant dip in volumes having been in march, followed by improvements month-on-month since then. we anticipate a global trade recovery through 2021 as north america and europe recover.
while pressure was experienced on charter rates through the first half, seaspan's position has been mitigated by our relatively small spot exposure and attractive fleet, with over 70% of our vessels being over 9,000 teu capacity. we remain focused on managing our short-term exposure during this time, which comprises approximately 10% of seaspan's fleet by teu, or approximately 2% by revenue for the remainder of 2020.
please turn to slide 10. the decline in volumes has driven the elevated idle fleet as liners both redelivered vessels and idled portions of their own or chartered fleets. the idle fleet levels peaked at about 12% mid-q2 and has declined to the current level of just above 7% [phonetic]. a large proportion of the idle fleet is sub-3,000 teu plus 2% in scrubber refits, and the balance is mostly made up of larger vessels on blank sailings.
against these current challenges, we are optimistic about long-term industry prospects not only from a supply and demand side, but also from a commercial standpoint. as bing mentioned, during these difficult times, customers increasingly look for providers that offer value-added services, a significant competitive advantage provided by seaspan's fully integrated operating platform and keen sense of collaboration with our customers.
we believe we have witnessed somewhat of a paradigm shift in liner behavior in stressed times. this year, they exercised a great degree of discipline through capacity supply control and have managed to support freight rates and have performed much better financially than was expected. we expect their discipline will sustain into the future and the stability of the industry shall be improved. in parallel, liners shall seek stronger tonnage providers more than before in support of their service delivery quality and reliability improvement aspirations.
on the supply side, the order book remains at historically low levels of below 10% with discipline expected to persist. deliveries are expected to continue to moderate into 2020 and 2021 with current builds experiencing slippage. this along with the pick-up in scrapping will continue to provide support toward supply and demand equalization.
freight and charter rates have remained well above 2008 and 2016 downturn levels. even during the height of covid, we have seen profitable charter rates. our customers have also done relatively well supported by their alliance partners, lower bunker prices, and government support where needed. we have been in close dialogue with all of our customers who remain strong throughout this difficult time, and we remain confident in our customer mix which composes of the world's leading liners.
finally, we remain disciplined in engaging in risk-adjusted accretive vessel acquisition activities contingent on mutually benefiting both ourselves and customers. we recently announced agreements to acquire two 13,000 teu vessels, which will be deployed on long-term time charters with a leading global liner. we continue to find optimal solutions for our customers and take advantage of strategic opportunities to grow during this time, while simultaneously maintaining our strong balance sheet.
i now hand over the call to ryan to discuss financial performance.
ryan courson -- chief financial officer
thank you, peter. if you could all please turn to slide 12. as mentioned at the beginning of the call, we are introducing new non-gaap metrics into our financial disclosure to coincide with the first full quarter of consolidated seaspan and apr financial results. these metrics include adjusted ebitda, funds from operation or ffo for short, and ffo per share.
we have chosen to introduce these non-gaap metrics for a number of reasons. these financial performance metrics align atlas' external financial disclosure with our internal management evaluation of financial performance, which is focused on long-term cash flows and return on invested capital. in the past, our focus on the cash flow generation of seaspan and now apr with ffo and ffo per share aligning how we internally view cash flow generation available to common shareholders. as a result, ffo per share will be our headline reporting figure going forward instead of earnings per share.
adjusted ebitda also provides a way for our investors to evaluate our cash flows, pre-financing our capital structure initiatives. this is particularly relevant for the seaspan business, as ebitda is a very good proxy for cash flows available for servicing principal and interest as the business pays very minimal income taxes. this selection of metrics also allows us to provide a clear picture of our financial performance across time periods unobscured by non-cash and one-time items, ultimately allowing investors a more comparable view of performance across these time periods.
finally, our new disclosures provide comparable performance metrics between atlas' business segments across similar peers as adjusted ebitda and ffo are performance and valuation metrics across many similar hard asset businesses like atlas.
to close our review of these new performance metrics, we want to highlight that we have chosen ffo as our key reporting metric going forward, as it represents on a gross and per-share basis the value that is available to our common shareholders. by adjusting out the non-cash swings that have historically impacted our eps and non-core business items, this metric represents cash available for management to allocate to create value for our shareholders. our objective is to grow this metric both on an absolute and per share basis, which will allow us to allocate capital for further strategic growth, while continuing to return capital to our shareholders through our dividends.
please turn to slide 13, where i will provide a summary of our financial results. overall, we are pleased with our performance for this quarter. we achieved record financial results, despite the challenging macroeconomic environment, demonstrating the resiliency in our business. we are confident in the long-term stability of our business with $4.6 billion of contracted revenue and both apr and seaspan businesses being fully funded with no major maturities until the end of 2022.
seaspan's vessel utilization remained strong at 97.4% for the quarter. this is notable despite the broader containership leasing industry's second quarter experiencing the highest idle fleet levels seen in the past decade. we also note that the number of unscheduled off-hire days was limited to only 90, less than 1% of ownership days across the fleet, further demonstrating our ability to effectively manage our short-term charter exposure. apr's power fleet utilization for the quarter was 68.4% as apr's turbines were mobilized and installed for our mexicali projects. a full quarter of these turbines will be reflected in our q3 utilization.
revenue increased 32% to $363.8 million for the quarter when compared to the same period in 2019, with the majority of this increase due to the full quarter of apr's revenue contribution. seaspan's revenue increased 10% to $304 million, primarily due to the delivery of 11 vessels year-to-date, resulting in seaspan achieving a record quarter in revenue.
adjusted ebitda was $239 million, a 37% or $65 million increase relative to the same period in 2019, driven by the contribution of apr and increased seaspan contribution from the delivery of the 11 vessels noted above. ffo was $161 million for the quarter, a 76% or $70 million increase when compared to the same period in 2019, primarily due to the contribution from apr and improved seaspan operating performance noted above. ffo represents atlas' performance post interest and tax, with these items driving the remaining difference.
improvements in our capital structure and decreases in libor drove approximately $9 million in interest savings comparable to the same period in 2019. these interest savings were partially offset by the inclusion of apr's taxes. finally, ffo per share of $0.64 increased 53% relative to the same period in 2019, and was up 21% on a quarter-over-quarter basis.
if you could please turn to slide 14, i will provide an update on our guidance. given our strong performance in quarter two, we are providing an update to our previously provided guidance. as bing highlighted, on a consolidated basis, over 98% of the midpoint of 2020 guidance is contracted as of today, highlighting the minimal spot exposure of our business. the full breakdown of seaspan and apr's contracted revenue is included in our quarterly filings.
for seaspan, we are tightening guidance on both the revenue side by increasing the bottom end of our revenue guidance and also improving the expense side by decreasing the top-end of our operating expense and operating lease expense guidance. for apr, we are reaffirming our previously provided guidance and continue to track well to this guidance. i would like to again note that the apr guidance is for the 10-month consolidation period of february 29th to december 31st, 2020.
apr is a business secured by medium-term contracts with strong upside as additional capacity is deployed either on additional long-term projects or lucrative short-term fast track power solutions. while the decline in power consumption from covid has slowed down our pipeline of potential projects, brian rich and his team are focused on deploying our assets and building a high quality pipeline of global opportunities.
for both companies, we are also introducing guidance for adjusted ebitda. with the implementation of non-gaap reporting, we will continue to guide to adjusted ebitda. we also provide relevant disclosures to the investor community to allow you to forecast ffo and ffo per share.
please turn to slide 15, where we will discuss developments in our capital structure and financial position. we continue to be focused on creating shareholder value through capital allocation, as demonstrated by our significantly expanded operating fleet, while improving our liquidity position and credit profile and maintaining our preferred and common dividends.
last night, we announced that seaspan achieved an investment-grade senior secured issuance rating from kroll bond rating agency for seaspan's portfolio financing program on the back of a bb corporate rating. as we have discussed, this portfolio financing program has grown to over $1.7 billion in commitments and represents the central piece of our capital structure. we intend to diversify our sources of funding through the institutional credit markets and continue to reduce our overall cost of funding and improve flexibility and amortization profile.
over the past 12 months, we have added 13 vessels to our fleet alongside the acquisition of apr, during which, we have also reshaped our balance sheet, lowering our cost of capital and improving both our maturity and liquidity profile. this has been accomplished through a relentless focus on maximizing atlas' cash flow generation. on a trailing 12-month basis, atlas has delivered approximately $500 million of ffo. as a result of this pursuit of cash flow optimization and the improvement in our debt capital structure, both seaspan and apr are fully funded to the end of 2022.
atlas, as a platform and despite challenging economic conditions, continues to enjoy access to the global capital markets. the renewed seaspan $150 million unsecured corporate credit facility on a two-year term is a testament to the business' capital market relationships and their belief in our capital structure strategy.
alongside our introduction of non-gaap metrics, we would also like to introduce our balanced scorecard for evaluating atlas' leverage position. these are metrics that we focus on internally and metrics that we consider when executing new acquisitions and various capital allocation decisions. while there is no one metric to properly evaluate our capital structure and credit positioning, we believe these four metrics in concert provide a holistic view of our leverage profile.
net debt to adjusted ebitda and contracted revenue to net debt demonstrates cash flows available to service debt obligations and provide returns to our shareholders, while adjusted ebitda to cash interest represents our interest coverage. finally, dividends per share to ffo per share provides a view to the cash flows available to our shareholders, which we return through dividends and reinvestment into the business for growth on our credit profile improvement.
lastly, if we could turn to slide 16, while i often discuss our focus on improving our balance sheet and credit profile, i'd like to end off today by discussing our growth over the last 2.5 years. since the beginning of 2018, we have deployed $3.4 billion of capital toward acquisitions, including the acquisition of gci in 2018 and apr in 2020. while deploying capital, we aim for strong risk-adjusted returns on invested capital. although we don't disclose this metric or internal targets specifically, with the introduction of our new non-gaap metrics, we are able to provide investors with the adjusted ebitda contribution and the capital deployed for these various acquisitions. we believe these new disclosures will help demonstrate our track record across our various capital allocation initiatives over time.
we continue to be pleased with the growth in financial performance that seaspan and apr exhibited over the second quarter despite industry headwinds. it is a testament to the resilient business models and the hard work of our global team. we have and will continue to remain steadfast in our focus on disciplined growth and value creation for our shareholders.
and with that, i will hand the call back over to the operator for questions.

operator
[operator instructions]. our first question comes from the line of chris wetherbee from citi. your line is now open.
chris wetherbee -- citi -- analyst
yes. hey, thanks and good morning, guys. i guess i wanted to start a little bit on the bigger picture about the containership fleet and sort of where you see that going. so we have talked a little bit about this in the past, but i wanted to get a sense. you are growing it close to a 10% clip at least in 2020, as you think out to 2021, 2022, with a constrained order book supply demand, arguably in a very reasonably good balance or maybe as good as it's been in quite some time, can you talk about sort of how aggressively you think you can grow the fleet and how you might pursue that? is there a target that we should be thinking about in terms of maybe 10%? is it customer dependent? can you just talk a little bit more in detail about that?
bing chen -- president and chief executive officer and interim chief financial officer
thank you, chris. good morning. yes, in terms of seaspan, as we have demonstrated over the past 12 months that we will be able to grow in our fleet by 18% in terms of teu. in looking at the market, we see that we will be able to continue to grow in a similar even more in the sense that we today are very well positioned for that growth.
first of all, today, we have a platform. the platform is very scalable. as of today, with the acquisition of 15 vessels, we actually had a net of one headcount reduction from the operational standpoint, so that you can see the scalability of our platform. and secondly, in looking at the type of growth opportunities, it is really driven by our customers. it's a customer-driven growth, because all of these acquisitions are driven by the demand of our customers, none of them are on a speculated basis.
and thirdly, if you are looking at the -- that our owner operator space today, seaspan as the world's largest owner operator, we only still account for less than 9% of the market, with the increasing demand from the line of customers looking for scale, flexibility and quality as well as in looking at the increase in regulations from whether imo or from esg perspective, i think it really requires a lot of investment in terms of people, system, processes. and this is where i think our industry that really requires to have the scale, and seaspan today has that scale.
so, with that being said, i think that today we are very well positioned. in looking at the pipelines for opportunities, i think whether it's from our peers looking at from liners, looking at from the financial institutions, i think today they all -- i think are looking for seaspan as the market leader and also the consolidator to continue to provide the scale, flexibility, quality to our customers.
and in terms of the specific numbers, we don't really setup by a number, rather, we are very disciplined in looking at the quality growth. what i mean by quality growth is first of all, looking at the asset quality, if you are looking at what we have done over the past 12 months, those are the top quality assets. and effectively we are looking at is the value that you paid for. we, in general, i think we are paying at a discount to the fair market value.
thirdly, we are looking at is the attached quality cash flow, all of those vessels are attached with the quality long-term contract. and fourthly, if we are looking at the -- these assets has actually a very high residual value, because that is very important. as an asset operator, you need to have a strong cash flow and also you need to have a strong residual value.
and from those perspective, i think today, we are going to continue to enhance our investment criteria and continue to looking at the opportunities that presented to ourselves. overall, we are very, i would say, encouraged by what is out there.
chris wetherbee -- citi -- analyst
okay. okay, that's helpful. and then when you think about the seaspan fleet, is there an ability to in the current market is there ability to potentially increase duration on the average charter remaining? i guess in other words, what is the charter market look like right now just given the relative tightness that we are seeing and sort of where demand is? are you starting to see decent depth return to the time charter market for maybe vessels that are coming off of contract?
bing chen -- president and chief executive officer and interim chief financial officer
yeah. we -- in the current market, obviously, when the market becomes tighter, there is more tendency to enter into the long-term contract. but if you are looking at what we have done over the past 12 months in the height of the covid, we were able to actually assign all those 15 vessels on a long-term contract with about half of those vessels is between the ten years to 18 years and the other half is between five to eight years. so, that is in the most difficult time we were able to actually sign these -- sign these vessels with a long-term contract. when the market environment improves, as we see right now, yes, there will be even, i would say, have a higher tendency, i think we will be able to enter into longer term contract.
chris wetherbee -- citi -- analyst
okay. and then last question for you just kind of dovetails into the first question, which is, how do you think about sort of the capital available for potential acquisitions? and i guess i am thinking both in containers, but maybe outside of containers, i don't know if there is interesting opportunities outside of the container shipping market that you see today. but sort of how much capital roughly speaking do you think you have to put to work and would it most likely end up staying in container or going elsewhere?
bing chen -- president and chief executive officer and interim chief financial officer
yeah, i think that's a very good question. for atlas today, we have about over $650 million of cash from the operations. and then if we are looking at ffo, the numbers is even higher. if we are looking at what we have done over the past three years, i am very proud to say that we were able to actually strike a very fine balance between return the capital to the shareholder, deleveraging, at the same time we are growing our business.
so, if we are looking at the past as a reference in the future, in terms of the continued strong cash flow that is generating by the business, i think today, we have ample capital that is required to grow the business. at the same time, today, i think, as we continue to grow our business, we're also taking advantage of the favorable financing terms that today seaspan is receiving from the marketing general. as you can see we recently just closed $200 million of sustainability linked loan.
and also, in general, our financing the secured financing cost, it's very competitive at -- with the low libor plus the spread is very, very competitive. so, it is a very favorable financing environment for us, and plus that we have a strong cash flow from our existing business. so, we see that, we have a strong liquidity and also a very diversified access and capital to the market. so, therefore, i think in terms of the growth that for sure that we have the ample liquidity and the capital to grow.
now, in terms of the -- the silos whether we are looking at other verticals, i think today with atlas in place, we have two very, scalable platform, one is the container shipping, which is in maritime. the other one is, the energy, the power platform. these are the two platforms that we have, each of them is in a market leader position.
so, if we are looking at today's seaspan, as i said it earlier, there is lot of opportunity for us to continue to consolidate in the market and have those quality growth. it's the same thing with apr. apr today is the leader in the fast power. but i think that as you continue to grow the business, there is -- apr will have more opportunity to broaden its offering in the marketplace. so with these two platform today, we have ample capital allocation opportunity for the quality growth.
but if we have other verticals that opportunities come up, and i believe that those opportunities has to be the right opportunity, in the right time, with the right return. but in general, when we are looking at the capital allocation, we do -- we do hold ourselves in a very strict criteria with a very strict discipline. so any investment that we make, we don't make the investment or make the growth for the sake of growth. we were looking at them from a strictly -- i think the quality and return perspective.
chris wetherbee -- citi -- analyst
okay. okay, that's helpful. i appreciate the time this morning. thank you.
bing chen -- president and chief executive officer and interim chief financial officer
thank you, chris.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of randy giveans from jefferies. your line is now open.
chris robertson -- jefferies -- analyst
hi bing, gentlemen, this is chris robertson on for randy. thanks for taking our call.
bing chen -- president and chief executive officer and interim chief financial officer
hey, good morning, chris.
robert weiner -- head of investor relations
good morning, chris.
chris robertson -- jefferies -- analyst
just wanted to follow-up on chris's question regarding fleet growth. so you talked about the opportunities in the platform for growth, but kind of on the flipside of that, when you are thinking about fleet renewal and the average fuel efficiency across the fleet in kind of a pre imo 2030 world? do you have any plans to divest some of the older vessels that are maybe approaching 15 years or older, and will be ending their time charters in the next year or two? what is the strategy with regards to that aspect of the fleet?
bing chen -- president and chief executive officer and interim chief financial officer
sure. thanks, chris. as we highlighted in our previous earnings call, seaspan is very proud of being the best in class operator. we are the best operating -- operating the assets under any, market cycles, as you can see, over the past, three years through the different economic, political cycles, and also now with the pandemic.
so the answer to that is that we intend to continue to operate all vessels in a best way that differentiates ourselves in a marketplace. and this is also evidenced today by our customers, the liner customers today really consider seaspan as the top premier operator. so, in terms of those vessels, not only we have the best operations, but also we actually actively improve those assets -- these vessels through the modifications of these vessels. for example, we do the bulk [phonetic] spot optimization, we do the propeller redesign, we equipped them with the apms, we installed the ballast water treatment. so, overall with these vessels while they are aging, but we also continue to improve to modify the vessels through our technology expertise to be able to ensure that these vessels, although, their age wise might be older, but they will remain in the top operational condition.
and this is what we do for living and this is what we are good at it. so therefore, that is why today with the 127 vessel fleet, all of these vessels are managed by seaspan and ourselves. so, we are very confident and able to managing these vessels in the most competitive, efficient way.
chris robertson -- jefferies -- analyst
got it. thanks, bing. on the apr energy side of things, so roughly half of the assets are on a longer term charter, it looks like the three projects ending in the mexicali region in september. so, can you talk to your expectations for utilization in coming quarters and how we should think about that?
bing chen -- president and chief executive officer and interim chief financial officer
sure, absolutely. i think this is a good question. and i am sure that many of you wants to have a better understanding of apr, because this is new to the atlas family. so maybe it would be best for me to give an overview as to who is apr now and what apr wants to be and how do we get to the -- to where we want to be.
so, apr today provides the turnkey aeroderivative gas turbine rental solutions to principally suited for emergency and peaking power requirements. apr primarily serves as a gas turbine rental company in addition to providing operations and maintenance services, which effectively is a power bank for utilities and industrial companies.
apr also develops and operates quasi-ipp projects, which is the currently projects that we have under long-term contract in argentina and bangladesh with a contracted revenue of $325 million. so this is where we are right now. as you correctly point out, half of the business is under long-term contract, half of it is on the spot.
but going forward, we really want to expand our offering and to become the leading provider of the bridge to long-term power solutions that's what we want to be. then the question is how do we get there? first of all, today, as we can see the apr has a platform. so we are going to leverage the existing structure so that we will continue to be the best, the market leader in delivering the fast power. and at the same time, we expand our scope of our offerings to provide these bridge to long-term power solutions.
so specifically, in the short-term, i think we are going to continue to working on existing assignment of contracts by extension and also we continue to both reactively and also proactively looking for those power demands that is asking for high capacity, asking for reliable quality and also the fast power, but also with a very high emission standards, because let's remember, we have the technology that's far advanced compared to our peers.
so then, at the same time, we are going to also to build, strengthen our commercial organization, because to develop the long-term power project, we would need to have the strength and the complementary skill sets for our business development team. and also, we are going to be looking at other ways of expanding the corporations, partnership, joint ventures with the other industry players to leverage their -- i would say their skills and resources, including seaspan itself. because, as you know, seaspan is the leader in maritime, and i think we are also potentially can looking at exploring those type of maritime power solutions to the customer.
and over the longer term, that we will be also exploring long term projects that will be -- using the renewable solutions, which will ultimately transition apr to a fossil free energy company with a long term project. so, in general, looking at the utilization for specifically, next year, i would think that, at least, half of those contract, half of those capacities are already under the long term contract. and, in looking at the overall energy demand, let's assume that will be the same as what we have this year.
and i think that we should be able to have the similar if not higher utilization rate, and in terms of the specific guidance that we are going to be providing them during our q4 earnings release.
chris robertson -- jefferies -- analyst
okay, thanks for that bing. alright. and one final question on apr for me, it's a little bit of a detailed question, but can you speak to the tax consideration differences between apr energy and seaspan?
bing chen -- president and chief executive officer and interim chief financial officer
yeah, that is a good question. in seaspan, because it's a maritime in general, as you know that there is such tax advantage so that we do not pay taxes that -- this is legal [phonetic]. that just that the tax rules is setup up in such a way. in apr of course because the operation is in the different jurisdiction, each different jurisdictions have different sets of a different type of import/export vat and also income taxes.
so therefore, apr tax is fully subject to the local jurisdiction, taxation as well as, apr's own corporate tax that is subject to whatever the jurisdiction it is in. so that is the difference between apr and seaspan.
chris robertson -- jefferies -- analyst
got it. thank you. appreciate it. thanks for taking our questions.
bing chen -- president and chief executive officer and interim chief financial officer
thanks, chris.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of ben nolan from stifel. your line is now open.
frank galanti -- stifel financial corp -- analyst
yeah, hi, this is frank galanti on for ben. i wanted to follow-up on apr specifically digging to the unit economics of the mobile gas turbines. i understand that you guys are trying to do some longer term power projects that are more permanent, on a more permanent basis, but specifically the mobile gas turbines, what is the turbine cost and what range of utilization do you expect over the life of the asset and what are those returns that you expect?
bing chen -- president and chief executive officer and interim chief financial officer
yeah. thank you, frank. in terms of the gas turbines, the utilization because of the nature of mobilization and demobilization, so the utilization is largely depends on the term duration of the contract, if -- this is similar to the vessels. if you have the vessels on a short term charter, you will have these kind of, position or repositioning, same thing with the gas turbine that if we have a -- a shorter term assignment of contract, then you have a mobilization and demobilization.
so from an industry standpoint today, if we are looking at, some other participants in the industry, they might use a different technology that is different from gas turbine. and i think the utilization rate is somewhere between 50% to 80%, that will be the average range. and i think today, apr, it is right in that range. in terms of the -- in terms of our -- you are asking the question of the range, right, that the range of the power generating, i think that the range of these turbines can generate somewhere between 25 megawatts to 35 megawatts per turbine.
and today, we have -- we have a total of 30 of them and of which about 16 is on long-term contract, and 14 is on the short term contract basis.
frank galanti -- stifel financial corp -- analyst
okay. and so to that end, if you guys have 30 how big do you expect to grow that business? i mean, i guess, more importantly, how big is that market? because you get to a 100 turbines is that feasible? apr has only 15% of atco at the moment, are there aspirations of growing that, 30% 40% or, i guess it is kind of a bigger question on where do you allocate between apr and seaspan?
bing chen -- president and chief executive officer and interim chief financial officer
yeah. in terms of a capital allocation, as we said it before, we are really looking at each every investment opportunities, whether it's within the industry of, for example, seaspan, or across the different business between apr and seaspan, we're always looking at what is the best way to allocate the capital that generates the maximum return for our shareholder. specifically on the gas turbine, your question is, are we going to grow the turbine to 100, or we are going to grow into some other technology? the answer to that is really, as we said it before, we are going to try to broaden our product offering.
so while we continue to focusing on the gas turbine, which is what we are doing the best in the market, at the same time for us to be able to broaden our offering so that we can diversify and provide a broader offering to our customers. you know, similar to the way as we're looking at our seaspan fleet, if i only have 10,000 teu vessels without [phonetic] have 14,000 -- 12,000, 14,000 or 8,000, so my offering is pretty limited.
so if you apply that to apr, we will be looking at, you have a different type of maybe technologies with the different type of fuel solutions. it all depends on what our customer ultimately wants, and what the investment return that will bring to us. and that is what the basis, we are going to look at growing the business.
but ultimately, as we said, our goal is to broaden our offering so that we can get a -- i would say a longer term solutions power solutions to our customer. and that is our goal. and of course, any of these kind of investments is subject to the same return requirement.
frank galanti -- stifel financial corp -- analyst
okay, great. thank you very much.
bing chen -- president and chief executive officer and interim chief financial officer
thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of ken hoexter from bofa. your line is now open.
ken hoexter -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
okay, great. good morning. bing, can you talk a little bit about just picking on apr for a second, if we look at your revenue forecasts, and the kind of decline you are expecting into the fourth quarter, maybe talk about what's built into that and the exposure you have got on apr? thanks.
bing chen -- president and chief executive officer and interim chief financial officer
thank you, ken. as i mentioned earlier, the fourth quarter will be slightly different from the third quarter because we just finished the mexicali project, which it was a full quarter utilization for eight turbines during the third quarter. as we are in the process of demobilizing those turbines, so the utilization for the fourth quarter will be lower than what we have in the third quarter. that is why you see the revenue numbers will be lower than the third quarter.
ken hoexter -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
perfect. and when you think about the moving the turbines or future utilization, are there geographic regions you are focused on for apr? is there a large emerging market exposure? any thoughts of diversifying the end markets?
bing chen -- president and chief executive officer and interim chief financial officer
yeah. we don't specifically focusing on a particular geographic location rather, we do look at each every opportunities with the same criteria. the criteria is looking at economic return, risk adjusted return, looking at -- what the specific counterparty risk. we have to look at the timing they require, looking at the compliance, environmental, and looking at the safety of our people. so those are the things that we really take into consideration. and one thing that is very different from before is that with the apr being part of the atlas family, we definitely much more focusing on risk and risk adjusted return of any opportunities.
david sokol -- chairman
ken, it's david. if i might make a comment and point out to the investor world as well. one of the things that board is particularly impressed with this year and exemplified in the third quarter is that the company atlas has actually outperformed original guidance and increased the guidance and has in fact even tightened it now going forward in the year of covid. and i think what -- bing has always said, his team had maintained the belief that it's the company's obligation to find a way when we make a commitment, we will find a way to get there.
and the reason i emphasize that is they've had to absorb on the order of $40 million to $50 million of covid costs. and yet, they are still performing, when i watch a lot of companies in the market, who have basically just slashed their earnings, blamed it on covid and i get that in certain cases, they couldn't overcome it. but it's pretty impressive given the downturn that the shipping industry had in the first half of the year, all of the complexities came with covid, crew changes, things of that nature, dry docking issues. and bing, i think your team is to be really credited with the fact that you actually kind of exceeded earnings this year notwithstanding absorbing that amount of cost.
so it's -- i know, you wouldn't say it bing, but from a board perspective, i think it needs to be pointed out.
bing chen -- president and chief executive officer and interim chief financial officer
thank you, david.
ken hoexter -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
thanks, david. i appreciate the improving outlook as well. and just obviously, as bing mentioned at the start kind of a newer line of business for the historical seaspan followers. bing, maybe just switching over to the seaspan side, can you talk a bit about utilization really ramped up obviously given the tightness now, over 99%. what do you view as kind of healthy operating normalized level? your thoughts on how you can capitalize on those higher spot freight rates if at all? and then maybe, i think you kind of touched on a bit of this earlier, but not really all the way, but your thoughts on acquisitions are -- as you see others struggle, do you look to acquire large scale fleets that might be -- is that something you think might be in the offing in terms of as opposed to kind of a couple of vessels you have been doing maybe, are there others that are struggling where you can really consolidate a little bit more faster in the industry, is that a thought at all?
bing chen -- president and chief executive officer and interim chief financial officer
sure, sure. in terms of the utilization, as and [phonetic] actually have a very long-standing track record of the high utilization. i believe that if we are looking at utilization today, we have about 98.6% of the utilization. and this has actually been on average for the past, i would say, ten years or 15 years, it has always been between 90% -- 97%, to 99%. so, given the improving market environment, we anticipate that our utilization will continue to improve.
and i think last year at one point, we had about close to 99.5% of the utilization. one specific i think a characteristics of our fleet as we highlighted before is that we have majority of our vessels on long-term contract. and if we are looking at, as i said it earlier, if we're looking at 2021, we have already about 85% of our revenues under long-term contract. so therefore, as the market continued to improve for sure, that we will be able to continue to also improve the utilization and improve more than i think the -- our peers because that we have a longer term contract basis, higher longer term contract basis.
in terms of the spot rate, the rate right now is very high, and i think that is the good news for the industry as a whole. but at the same time, again, we also have a reasonable amount of spot that is for next year, as i said it's about 15% of our fleets on a spot charter. and i think as the rate goes up, we will be able to take the benefit of those increased rate as well.
on the acquisition side, today, as i said that the seaspan really have a very scalable platform, the way realistically for us to grow, our fleet is most likely to looking at acquiring a fleet instead of a business, and then depends on the opportunities whether we are going to buy a fleet or few vessels, really for us not much of a difference, because we do have a very standardized process that allows us to be able to -- to be able to execute on these type of acquisition in a very effective way.
once again, this year, we actually acquired 15 vessels some of them is in the fleet, some of them is on a one or two vessel basis. but all these vessels are actually being executed while we are managing our business. as i said it earlier, we actually have a net one headcount reduction. so today, our platform is very well positioned to consolidate and continue to grow our fleet.
and as i said it earlier, that we really see a lot of opportunities in the coming month and year.
ken hoexter -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
great. thanks bing. thanks david.
bing chen -- president and chief executive officer and interim chief financial officer
thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes on the line of michael goldie from bank of montreal. your line is now open.
michael goldie -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
hi, guys. thank you for taking my questions this morning. i was wondering if there were any kind of updates for us on cfo search?
bing chen -- president and chief executive officer and interim chief financial officer
sure. good morning, michael. yes, we started this global search of a cfo at the end of september. we actually received a very strong interest from the marketplace. the quality and interest of the candidates is very encouraging. we are right on schedule in making the decisions in due course, and we will inform you and the market once that decision has been made.
michael goldie -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
okay. and then just returning to apr for one second, obviously, utilization is going to come down in the fourth quarter, but can we also expect kind of revenue per megawatt or revenue per turbine to come down as well given that the mexicali project, i think were quite profitable contracts?
bing chen -- president and chief executive officer and interim chief financial officer
no. on the revenue per megawatts basis that whatever those are actually in operation, those in terms of the revenue, it stays the same. only because those turbines that is currently on a demobilization mode, those are the ones that is out of -- out of deployment. but once they come in back, again, any of those deployment, we will have a certain requirement in terms of the revenue per megawatt similar to the way we are looking at the charter rates. so, to answer your question is that we do not expect that to change.
michael goldie -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
okay, perfect. thank you very much.
bing chen -- president and chief executive officer and interim chief financial officer
thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of luc plouvier from capital management. your line is now open.
luc plouvier -- kempen capital management -- analyst
hi, good morning to you. so this is luc plouvier from kempen capital management. i guess i had two questions on sort of deploying capital, you talked about that you were very disciplined in terms of the returns that you are looking for, i was wondering whether you could elaborate a bit on the level of marginal return you are targeting, or whether there is a certain minimum level of return that you're targeting there?
bing chen -- president and chief executive officer and interim chief financial officer
sure. good morning, luc. in terms of return, we don't, i think that if you are looking at what we have acquired the vessels over the last 11 months, i think that you can see the purchase price that we paid, the charter rate we have been able to achieve. and if you are looking at the vessel type, that you will be able to get an idea as to what kind of return.
but in general, if you are looking at the last four vessels we acquired in the third quarter, i think the amount of the charter revenue, that is provided through the long-term charter, the amount of revenue actually is equal to the -- roughly equal to the purchase price. so therefore, if we are looking at the -- if you look at from a return of the invested capital perspective, those capital is already being returned, then anything above that is a return is the additional marginal return on those investments.
so, in general, the other reference you can see is that, as i mentioned earlier, if we have not made the quality investments, we will not be able to have the growth, meanwhile de-leverage at the same time still return our capital to the shareholder. so overall, we do hold a very relatively for sure far above the industry average in terms of what the return on a levered and un-levered basis.
luc plouvier -- kempen capital management -- analyst
and maybe one follow-up question. actually, i was wondering what is keeping you actually from growing faster than you are currently doing? like you mentioned yourself, you are actually de-levering while growing at the same time. so, what is keeping you from being more aggressive on the growth side? is it the lack of opportunities or is it lack of attractive opportunities?
bing chen -- president and chief executive officer and interim chief financial officer
it's the discipline. it's the discipline. because we -- because we hold a very high standards, so therefore, for those opportunities, it doesn't come very often and to the country or most of or all, these opportunities is actually created by ourselves. it's not -- we don't go to the market and taking an auction and saying that ok there is a plenty of assets for sale, but those are not our targets. we are looking for those type of opportunities, where there really, as i have mentioned earlier, from asset perspective, it has to be good assets, specifically it's the large asset, young assets and has a good value, which we are going to buy them at a discounted fair market value.
and also, we have to look at these assets have a strong demand from our customers. that's why we are going to be able to get a long-term contract attached to it. and that's why from risk adjusted return basis, this is what the criteria we are holding to. and so therefore, because we are very disciplined, we only are making those investments when those opportunity arises.
luc plouvier -- kempen capital management -- analyst
and maybe one last question in terms of market share, so i believe you mentioned that for the seaspan business, you currently have a market share of around 8%. so, i was wondering whether -- are the chartering companies structurally gaining market share compared to the shippers over the long run? and could you give any sort of idea on where you see that market share going to in five years time?
bing chen -- president and chief executive officer and interim chief financial officer
luc, you mean the market share of seaspan?
luc plouvier -- kempen capital management -- analyst
yeah, so i mean, both the market share of seaspan, but i was also wondering whether as the leasing companies actually are gaining market share compared to the shippers in terms of owning assets or they actually see that -- because that's what you are seeing in the container leasing industry, for example, that the leasing companies are structurally gaining market share. but i was wondering what that is on the vessel, the container vessel of chartering industry?
bing chen -- president and chief executive officer and interim chief financial officer
okay. yeah, thank you. thank you for clarifying that. i think that today, if you are looking at the overall container shipping market, i think the total capacity is still around 22 million, 23 million teus and the split is still roughly about 50-50 between the liners owned versus the third-party, whether it's a leasing company or owner operator like ourselves or some of the legacy kg structures. i think it looks like the leasing company has increased in this market share. but at the same time and i think that because of some sale leasebacks from whether from the liners themselves or from some other owners for example. so, on a net basis, i think that because the new build was relatively low, so a lot of the changes shifting between the owners and also the liners in terms of the sale leasebacks.
on the seaspan side, in terms of our market share today, we are slightly below 9%. going forward, i believe that we will continue to -- as we said continue to grow. as we grow, we would expect that our market share will grow accordingly. and i think that's what we see as a future.
luc plouvier -- kempen capital management -- analyst
okay, thanks.
operator
thank you. at this time, i am showing no further questions. i would like to turn the call back over to bing chen, ceo for closing remarks.

operator
welcome to the atlas corp. third quarter 2020 earnings conference call. i would like to remind everyone that this conference call is being recorded today, november 10th, 2020. i would now like to turn the call over to robert weiner, head of investor relations of atlas corp.
robert weiner -- head of investor relations
thank you and good morning everyone. thank you for joining us today to discuss atlas corp's third quarter 2020 earnings. i am new to these calls as i joined atlas in early september. i look forward to working with all our stakeholders to ensure the company's performance is well understood and appreciated by members of the investment community.
we have a terrific company which is performing very well as noted in our earnings release. please note, we released our earnings at a new time this quarter, after the close of trading yesterday. please refer to the investor relations page on the company's website to reference the third quarter release or any other investor materials.
on the call with me today is bing chen, president, chief executive officer and interim chief financial officer of atlas corp. joining bing on the call, during the q&a session are atlas corp.'s chairman, david sokol; seaspan's chief commercial officer, peter curtis; and seaspan's chief operating officer, torsten pedersen.
i would now like to remind you that our discussion today contains forward-looking statements, which are noted on slide 2 in the accompanying earnings presentation. actual results may differ materially from those stated or implied due to risks and uncertainties associated with our business. our known risk factors are discussed in our form 20-f and our reports on form 6-k filed from time-to-time and in connection with our quarterly financial results, which are available on our website as well.
with this quarterly report, you will note that we continue to report non-gaap measures, which we believe provide investors a clear understanding of performance of our businesses. these third quarter earnings release -- this third quarter earnings release contains supplemental financial tables and information pertaining to our third quarter earnings report and includes definitions of non-gaap financial measures and reconciliations of such non-gaap measures to the most closely comparable u.s. gaap measures.
these definitions may also be found in the appendices at the back of the earnings presentation, which we will refer to in our call discussion and can be found on our website. in addition, we have also provided historical reconciliations through 2018, which are available on our website. during today's call, bing will discuss, please turn to slide 3, atlas' key investment attributes, highlights of our third quarter operating performance and business developments. this will be followed by an industry update and what we expect to see in the fourth quarter. we will conclude prepared remarks with a review of our financial results and update on our balance sheet liquidity, a summary of q3 and comments on our guidance.
separately, i would like to note that our team will be conducting virtual investor meetings in november, on the 12th, 18th and 30th and in december on the 7th and 14th. please contact investor relations to inquire about the meetings.
i am now pleased to turn the call over to atlas corp.'s president, ceo and interim cfo, bing chen.
bing chen -- president and chief executive officer and interim chief financial officer
thank you, rob and good morning everyone. i want to welcome rob to the atlas team as our new head of ir and he will be working closely with all our investors and analysts. please turn to slide 4. let me begin by saying i am thankful that during these difficult times the atlas team are doing well and staying safe. i am also proud that our team is driving solid performance, while many industries and companies continue to face challenges.
atlas is uniquely positioned as the long-term investment opportunities with three key attributes. first, our resilient business model with $4.4 billion of long-term contracted revenue and a scalable platform delivering fully integrated customer-centric solutions. second, our core competencies is of consistent operational excellence, creative customer partnerships, solid financial strength, quality growth and disciplined capital allocation. this is what drives our execution and the results and it differentiates us from our peers.
third, we have been delivering quality growth, enhancing fleet composition and creating greater diversification of our customers through the addition of quality assets with long-term charters. our third quarter performance clearly depicts a divergence of atlas performance as compared to our peers. our customers are the strongest in the industry, our cash flows are of much higher quality with long-term charters, our fleet is younger, larger and more fuel efficient.
we have seen increased demand for our scalable, reliable and flexible services that are unique and unmatched. this greatly reduced our risk, especially when you compare our profile with our peers who have shorter duration contracts, smaller vessels, older feet, less balance sheet strength and liquidity.
overall, the uniqueness of our strategies and the results from our consistent execution makes us the solution provider of choice. however, as our competitive advantage seems to be overlooked by the investment community, we view our q3 as clear evidence of a value creation for both customers and shareholders through our platform, strategy and execution, which were adopted by this management team about three years ago.
now, let's look at our results. please turn to slide 6. our third quarter results demonstrate the resiliency of our business model and delivery of consistent operational excellence. we continue to strengthen creative customer partnerships, prudently manage our liquidity, continue to return value to shareholders through payments of the 61st consecutive dividend. we delivered quality growth with the acquisition of four more large vessels, all on long-term charter growing our fleet to 127 vessels.
and most gratifying is our team's commitment to consistent execution achieved through our ownership culture. our team's performance was excellent and impressive despite the persistent pandemic challenges. now, let's look at our third quarter financial results. we have a very stable revenue profile with $4.4 billion of long-term contracted revenue, including $4.1 billion at seaspan and $324.4 million at apr.
in the third quarter, atlas delivered total revenue of $386.2 million with seaspan contributing revenue of $305.9 million and apr contributing revenue of $80.3 million. this represents total revenue growth of 36.6% compared to q3 of 2019. adjusted ebitda was $249.8 million in the third quarter and funds from operations, ffo was $173.5 million or $0.68 per share.
ffo increased by 96% and ffo per share increased by 70% compared to q3 2019, which represents industry leading growth and significant value creation. we announced our 61st consecutive dividend payment. atlas is reaffirming financial guidance for the full year 2020 and tightening our ranges to reflect increased confidence as we progress through this final quarter with a great finish to the year. again, these results depict a much different stories when compared to the peers in our industry. this is an important distinction and differentiator.
please turn to slide 7. now, let's look at growth. quality growth enables us to invest in customer solutions, technological innovation, scale, flexibility and our people. more importantly, it creates sustainable value for our shareholders. by quality, we mean successful growth and win-win outcomes for our customers and us. that is quality growth. growth financed with favorable terms for top quality assets at discounted fair market value and with strong cash flow, while maintaining a disciplined capital allocation and strong liquidity. that is quality growth. these are just two examples.
we have added two 13,000 teu and two 12,000 teu vessels which expanded our fleet to 127 total from 112 vessels since the end of november 2019, representing an additional $1.1 billion of long-term contracted revenue, over 13% growth in a number of vessels and 18% growth on a teu basis. we have expanded the fleet through long-term charters, adding newer and larger vessels while diversifying our customer base and with much of the growth coming during a global pandemic. this is quality growth.
part of our distinguished attributes is our financial strength and the access to the capital markets during the challenging environment. this year, we have continued to make significant strides in improving our balance sheet. i am proud of our team for aligning our commitment to the environment and sustainability with our capital structure. we completed our sustainability linked financing, which is the industry's first. this financing added $200 million to our capital structure and is another innovative milestone. we relentlessly focused on improving our credit rating and cost of borrowing. we have also received a bbb- facility rating from kroll ratings.
now, i will comment on operations. utilization remains very strong at 98.6% at seaspan and increased to 80% at apr in the third quarter. utilization is an important measure for seaspan. however, let's go for apr as the equipment is offering transitioning to fulfill new contracts. for seaspan, we continue to develop stronger, creative customer partnership to achieve win-win outcomes.
apr is facing some headwinds primarily as a result of the global effects on energy consumption due to the pandemic. yet, during this period, we continue working with customers and focusing on aligning apr for long-term growth. now, let's look at the industry. please turn to slide 9. the container shipping industry continues to operate in a challenging environment, yet we have seen a resurgence in charter rate since late february and march. since then, we have seen a steady improvement in charter rates, with a pronounced uptick in q3.
in past periods of uncertainty, you didn't see this type of a rapid recovery. we attribute this to greater sophistication in market combined with four positive drivers: first, today's balance of supply and demand; second, an increasing global demand profile; third, the increasing credit health and operating performance of the liners; and fourth, the ongoing maturity of the market.
with seaspan contributing about 85% of total business, atlas is fairly insulated from short-term market fluctuations. our entire 127 vessels fleet has secured charters in place and we have performed consistently well through 2020 despite a global idle fleet that peaked at 12% in may and has now contracted to less than 2%.
with some tailwinds in the market, the credit quality and operating performance of our customer base is improving. major rating agencies switched their views from a negative to positive outlook on the industry and upgraded the credit ratings of many major liners. you can see on slide 9, the projection of global recovery in 2021 is fairly strong, with forecasted growth in the range of approximately 6% to 9% which should support a continuing strong performance for seaspan.
we are now seeing many analysts become more positive about the industry's rising demand and rates, limited supply of large vessels, lower order book, expanding charter tenders and with some analysts calling for higher equity multiples supported by a general favorable outlook over the medium term. as the industry leader with key differentiators and consistent performance, atlas should be a leading manufacturer over the long-term on all the tailwinds i just mentioned.
now, i would like to review our financial performance for the third quarter. please turn to slide 11. we delivered again this quarter. atlas reported consistent solid performance driven by execution, the addition of apr and the significant growth of our fleet compared to q3 2019. these are the company's key performance metrics. ffo of $173.5 million, an increase of 96% compared to the third quarter of 2019.
ffo per share was $0.68 per common share. ffo represents atlas performance after interest and tax. adjusted ebitda was $249.8 million, with an increase of 38.8% compared to the third quarter of 2019. these are unparalleled results.
please turn to slide 12. we are very pleased with our performance and continued progress. we executed very well on our initiatives and have stayed focused on leveraging our five key competencies to deliver sustainable value to our customers and shareholders. revenue increased by 36.6% to $386.2 million for the third quarter when compared to the same period in 2019, 77.6% of the increase in revenue was due to the contribution from apr while seaspan's revenue increased 8.2% to $305.9 million due to the expansion of our fleet.
the 38.8% year-over-year increase of adjusted ebitda was driven by revenue increase, as i just described and also benefited from lower than expected g&a. the 96% year-over-year increase of ffo also reflects the revenue contributions and the lower interest expense. seaspan's vessel utilization remained strong at 98.6%, apr's utilization was 80% reflecting the mexicali project for the full quarter. seaspan's fleet capacity as measured by teu increased by 18% compared to the third quarter of 2019. we continued to see opportunities to execute quality growth of our fleet.
a very important point in this table, our long-term contracted revenue at the end of the third quarter was $4.1 billion for seaspan and $324.4 million for apr for the total contracted revenue of $4.4 billion, with seaspan having an average remaining lease period of approximately four years. these are key points that investors should take note of as we do not see others in our space equally positioned with such resiliency.
please turn to slide 13. our focus is on disciplined capital allocation. our balance sheet is strong, with capacity and flexibility to ensure quality growth. we made significant strides by improving our balance sheet and capital structure.
specifically, the sustainability linked loan consisted of $200 million of term loan with a tenor of six years. the expanded portfolio financing program is now comprised of $300 million revolving credit facility and approximately $1.5 billion of term loan commitments, with standard maturity between 2024 and 2026. we have strong liquidity of over $427.6 million, including undrawn credit facilities.
you will see on this slide that we have made meaningful financial improvement since the new board and management team were installed at seaspan and now continuing in atlas. we have improved two key balance sheet measures, which is debt to assets and net debt to adjusted ebitda. it is important to know that our performance, which has been very consistent and resilient was not matched with similar result in the industry. we believe this is a very important milestone illustrating our outstanding results, which were clearly evident by this quarter.
please turn to slide 14. with our continued solid performance in q3, we are reaffirming our financial guidance for 2020. please recall that we had revised our guidance upwards during our q2 earnings. today, we have reaffirmed our guidance and tightened our ranges for expected revenue and adjusted ebitda. for seaspan, not only 99% of the midpoint of 2020 guidance are contracted revenue as of today, highlighting our minimal spot exposure, but also about 85% of the revenue for 2021 is also contracted.
this is different than others who may rely on continued rising rates, longer tenors and favorable renewals. our guidance for the full year 2020 is the revenue in the range of $1.21 billion to $1.22 billion for seaspan and $195 million to $215 million for apr, adjusted ebitda in the range of $770 million to $795 million for seaspan, and $115 million to $135 million for apr.
please turn to slide 15. our last topic today is the one we hope our listeners will note and come to appreciate, especially those of you who maybe joining our call for the first or second time. we believe atlas represents an excellent investment opportunity across all market cycles. our business model is resilient, stable and consistent with $4.4 billion of long-term contracted revenue, with seaspan having an average remaining lease period of approximately four years.
we have developed and consistently executed our core competencies, which uniquely positioned atlas within its industries. these competencies combined with our deep customer partnership, where we worked hand in hand to solve their needs and grow together. our strong financial position with a solid balance sheet and full access for capital, enables us to partner with our customers for quality growth opportunities.
quality growth, as i spoke about, enables us to invest in customer solutions, technological innovation, scale, flexibility and our people. more importantly, execute on the right opportunities to create sustainable shareholder value.
i will close my remarks by saying that i am very proud of our teams, excited by our collaborative ownership culture and look forward to reporting on our continued quality growth and creation of the value for all our stakeholders. our team is now available to take your questions. operator, we would now like to open the line to questions. thank you.

operator
thank you. [operator instructions] our first question comes from the line of randy giveans with jefferies. your line is now open.
randy giveans -- jefferies -- analyst
howdy, gentlemen? how is it going?
bing chen -- president and chief executive officer
good, thanks, randy.
randy giveans -- jefferies -- analyst
good. so i guess the first question, it's been a while since seaspan or atlas ordered numerous newbuildings. so i guess, around that, why so many maybe so quickly? and what kind of return should we expect on these time charters? are they that much better than some second-hand acquisitions or why such a preference on newbuildings?
bing chen -- president and chief executive officer
hey, good morning, randy. this is bing. i'll try to answer your question. yes, i think you see the numbers of new order came quite intense over the past three months, but this has actually been working quite over a period of time with our global liner customers. this is really a situation where it's driven by the customer demand, ok? this is very different from what you have seen in the past, maybe, few cycles where one is the -- driven by the german kg, where it's the tax driven. and then the other one was around 2013 where you have those pes that come in. they thought that they're going to be able to bottom fish in the market. those are primarily driven not by the demand side rather it's by the speculation.
this time around, this newbuild driven by the fundamental change in the container shipping market, where today our liner customers are very disciplined. the market is very consolidated. liner companies are looking for quality of service, instead of prior -- they're looking for more of a market share. so the market fundamental is different, these newbuild were driven by our customers, and also these newbuild vessels as we noted, they are all 12,000 teu, 15,000 teu, and 24,000 teu. these are the young, large, fuel-efficient vessels that is very versatile and they represent the best assets in this industry.
so, this time around, once again, i think this is very different. it seems to be very fast, but at the same time, really it's the market driven, and most importantly all our 31 newbuild are backed by long-term charter. so this is a very important factor and i think that that's something that we want to highlight.
in terms of the return, as we said it before and we also highlight during our discussion earlier, is that we are very disciplined in terms of only grow with the quality and what the quality is -- two aspects. one is the quantitative and the other one is qualitative. as we stated earlier, our criteria in terms of return has never changed. just i mentioned before, on unlevered ir basis, our returns are very high single-digits. and on the levered basis -- on the normal leverage, i think it will be a very high-teens at least. so, that's the kind of return we had before when we acquired those 15 second-hand vessels during 2020 and now we have these newbuild. so the criteria actually is the same and with slight improvement. so we never compromise in terms of return. so this is why we're saying, these are the quality growth and we are very excited and the other part of this growth is, as david has mentioned earlier, is the diversification of our customer base and further enhance of our fleet composition.
so, from all these aspects, these are the very quality growth and we are very excited we are able to partner with our global liner customers and have this kind of trust and opportunity to support their growth.
randy giveans -- jefferies -- analyst
got it. and then does that mean no real appetite for kind of second-hands at these levels? or just a newbuild is that much better?
bing chen -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. once again, as you might be aware that -- also, at the same time, i think about a week ago, we also acquired two 15,000 teu second-hand vessels that's about one-year-old and those are the vessels that's also under the long-term contract with the customer. so, you're actually asking a very good question is that, we actually are looking at -- we do not differentiate or discriminating whether it's a newbuild or second-hand. rather we are looking at our customer needs, we're looking at the returns, we're looking at the asset, how that fits into the overall -- the fleet strategy, and how we're going to get the best assets that has the highest residual value. so that's the criteria, just to name a few that how we decide to deploy the capital. and again, looking forward, we will continue to evaluate those attractive investment opportunities as long as that brings that kind of return, enhance our fleet, and meet our customer requirement. again, all these growth is primarily driven by our customer, not driven by any speculation.
randy giveans -- jefferies -- analyst
right. okay and then lastly from me, you just mentioned kind of deploying capital. so on the financing side, what's the total capex for these 33 vessels and how are you going to finance the acquisitions from a debt equity split? and then lastly, in terms of the dividend, any plans for possibly growing it with the newbuild orders?
graham talbot -- chief financial officer
so a good question. thanks, randy. i think i'll probably start answering that by saying that the balance sheet is very much managed in the same way as we manage our vessels. so, a very active management, continuous optimization, and continuous innovation. so, whenever we look at any of these transactions, a core part of the capital allocation process is to look at our long-term liquidity and we also often have non-binding term sheets associated with each of the deals that we look at. so, it's not really an issue of how do we get the capital. it's how do we get the right capital and then how does it fit into our longer-term capital structure, to optimize both growth capacity, but also cost.
so, when we look at this newbuild program, we've got a range of different options. and, i'd say, there is a bottoms-up view of how we sort of can finance those with the regular tools and instruments that we use, but then there is the top-down layer as well, which is why we look at our longer-term capital strategy, where we have to sort of think outside the box a bit and we've demonstrated that in the past with some of the more innovative financings and i think we're going to be continuing to look at how we can learn from other industries, other sectors, and how we optimize both debt and equity going forward.
so at the moment, all of these newbuilds are forecast into our cash flows and that is keeping us robust [phonetic] in our covenants that we have with all our existing financing partners and we're very comfortable. so, it's really around optimization, rather than obtaining, when we think of financing these vessels.
randy giveans -- jefferies -- analyst
okay. and in terms of total capex?
graham talbot -- chief financial officer
i don't have the number off the top of my head at the moment, randy. i can get it back to you, though.
randy giveans -- jefferies -- analyst
sounds good. i will turn it over from there. looking forward to the investor day. thank you.
graham talbot -- chief financial officer
thanks, randy.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of fadi chamoun with bmo capital markets. your line is now open.
fadi chamoun -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
thank you. good morning. first, maybe congratulations on really great results over the last few years. and, my question is kind of a little bit of follow-up from the previous question. i want to -- what would the pro forma leverage look like once you kind of have these 31 newbuild into the cash flow?
graham talbot -- chief financial officer
hi, fadi, it's graham. a very good question and something that we obviously spend a bit of time looking at as well as we model all of this out. at the sort of outset on this on delivery, we're looking at just around 60%. we have an internal hurdle rate of 65%, which relates to some of our covenants. but, that's where it's at and as bing and i discussed, that's the forecast. so, we know, we are well within our covenant range on a forecast basis. but, we've also got a few years of work to do on how we optimize that going forward. so...
fadi chamoun -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
okay. and then, given that the nature of these assets are on the larger ships with longer duration in terms of cash flow commitment from the customer, does it -- like, are you inclined to maybe use more leverage because there is more contracted revenues? or you're going to stick to your kind of goal of improving financial leverage in the next few years?
graham talbot -- chief financial officer
no, i think we will definitely stick to the goal of improving our overall capital structure. and, as we've mentioned a few times, getting to investment-grade, that provides us with an additional debt and of capital for future growth, and also improvement around cost. so, at this stage, there is no movement away from that direction.
fadi chamoun -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
okay, and one follow-up on the jv conversation. i think you mentioned some opportunities in the maritime industry. would that be the same vertical you're in today; the container shipping? or are there other opportunities in the jv to maybe expand outside of that in the maritime industry?
bing chen -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, good morning, chamoun. this is bing chen. i'll try to answer that question. yeah, the jv that we have formulated is with the ze group, which is a -- maybe i can give you just a quick overview of who is the ze -- zhejiang energy group. this is a holding company with over 20 years of history. it's similar to that of costco in energy business in china. this is a state-owned integrated energy company. they are mainly engaged in the power plant construction, power generation, natural gas development, power energy services, which includes the development, trading, and transportation of petroleum, coal, natural gas, and energy services including, environmental protection technologies.
so this is a -- as i said, is a conglomerate that has a variety of the businesses. the entities that we are directly joint ventured with is the t&d environmental protection company and they're actually focusing on areas of the air, water, and waste substance and also noise and other type of pollution control. the areas that -- because this is a service company within the ze group that, as a power energy company, they need to have the environmental improvement services and that's what this company is focusing on. so that being the case, the areas that we can potentially cooperate in, with our jv partners through this jv venture -- joint venture is in the maritime because they're engaged in the transportation through the maritime or transportation of those natural gas, coal, the petroleum. those are the areas that we could potentially cooperate in, in the power space because they have a track record of building the large -- and large scale and long-term power project and that will be complementary to what apr's fast power global international experience versus what ze today is primarily still domestic focused.
and in the environmental areas, and particularly in the maritime and also in the energy area. ze -- this joint -- the joint venture partner, they actually also provides the scrubber manufacturing and storage services. this is something that is immediately applicable to the maritime corporations. so there is a variety of areas that we could cooperate both in terms of maritime and also in the energy space and that's what we are very excited about to have such a very credible partner for us to jointly develop the business across these two platforms, both of the companies that we have and focus on developing the business.
fadi chamoun -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
that's helpful. thank you very much.
bing chen -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of liam burke with b. riley. your line is now open.
liam burke -- b. riley -- analyst
yes, thank you. bing, you laid out in an earlier question on the irr -- unlevered irr on the projects, on the new acquisitions were more than acceptable to your hurdle rates. by definition, higher returns get competed away in the future. so, how do we think about what you can do in future investment projects to maintain these types of returns?
bing chen -- president and chief executive officer
hey, good morning. as we said that we have been very disciplined. if we're looking at the past, where we have been deploying the capital over the past three years, we actually had been very consistent in achieving this investment return. the only difference is that during the different cycles, the different market conditions that we make in different type of investments. if you're looking back about a year ago, we did not have any newbuilds, rather we were focusing on the second-hand because we think that is a great time and opportunity where we can create those growth opportunities by closely working with our customers, understanding their needs, their challenges, and be able to develop the solutions and, at the same time, by making those capital allocation decisions to support our customers' growth.
so going forward, if you're looking at atlas, i think that broadly, today, we have two platforms. one is the maritime, the other one is the energy platform. if you're looking at about a year-and-a-half ago -- a year ago, when we acquired apr and formulated atlas group, and i think, there was a lot of concerns of -- in the market that the people are thinking that we are exiting the shipping business and focusing on energy business, but the reality is, i think, just the opposite. and why is that, is because of the market condition. and that is also exactly the reason why we created atlas platform because that gives us the flexibility and opportunity to best allocating the capital and consistently achieving the returns that we set ourselves for.
so in the current market, i think the shipping and particularly in the container shipping market that we see the great opportunity and that is what we were able to capture this opportunity within a very short period of time. it seems to be very fast, but on the other hand, it is only us who are able and capable to be able to execute in this short period of time because we have the people, we have the platform -- the integrated platform, and also we have the partnerships with our shipyard, with our financing partners, and also with our customers.
so, looking at what we have done in the past, and looking at our principles in terms of our people, our business model, and also the strong balance sheet that we have, we will continue to seek the right opportunity and create those opportunities through the creative partnerships that we have with our customers whether it's in shipping or whether it's in energy platform, that i'm confident that we have the right ingredients. we have the competencies as highlighted by our chairman, david. with these competency, what i believe is, you call it a secret sauce, that we will be able to consistently finding those type of opportunity, create those opportunities, and achieve the kind of return that we set out for, for ourselves.
liam burke -- b. riley -- analyst
great. and bing, you've highlighted on the fleet side where your investment sweet spot would be in terms of vessel classes. you do have some smaller vessels in the fleet and the order book on those vessels are exceedingly lower, down to zero. would you be opportunistic on the other side of the equation and sell those assets in reinvestment -- reinvest them in assets that are more in line with your core desire of the larger vessels?
bing chen -- president and chief executive officer
yes, that's a great question. we actually -- we are in the business of managing the assets. so what you are talking about is something that we constantly evaluate and this is the core capability of our business is to managing the assets and managing the risk and to specifically to your question is that for those smaller vessels, as we shared earlier today, about close to 79%, to be exact, our fleet above 10,000 teu, but then anything sub-10,000, which is about -- it's about 20%; out of these 20%, we have the smallest vessel is the 2500 and that's only 10 or 11 of them and then we have the 4500 and 5500, 8500, and 9000 vessels. all these vessels are all under a charter and most of them actually under long-term charter.
so these assets, even though they're small, they're relatively older, but because of our partnership with our customers, because of our reliable operations, all these vessels are on demand by our customer under the long-term contract. so, at this point, they're generating part of this $11 billion of contracted cash flow. so, they are working very well. we will continue to deploy them. at the same time, we'll also continue to evaluate if and when there is right opportunity when these vessels come off to free for potential sales that we will consider that. but, this is something, definitely we will be evaluating constantly. and we also actually have a team, it's called asset integrity group and they are the people who knows exactly the residual value, the conditions of the vessel. so, we're very actively managing them and this is a part of what we call the integrated platform. we manage the entire life cycle of these assets. and, that's what we do and that's what we do the best.
liam burke -- b. riley -- analyst
great, thank you, bing.
graham talbot -- chief financial officer
it's graham here. i'd just like to circle back to randy's question, if that's ok, just to clarify. i just wanted to double-check that the -- my numbers included the two second-hand vessels. so the total capex commitment of the entire portfolio of 33 new vessels is just under $3.9 billion.
bing chen -- president and chief executive officer
and we have $5.9 billion of contracted cash flow for this $3.9 billion investments. so you can understand the return of the invested capital.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of chris wetherbee with citi. your line is now open.
chris wetherbee -- citi -- analyst
hey, thanks, good morning. maybe just sort of following up on that. graham, do you have the six vessels that you announced yesterday, the capex associated with those?
graham talbot -- chief financial officer
yes, i do. that's included in that number.
chris wetherbee -- citi -- analyst
can you break it out?
graham talbot -- chief financial officer
that's approximately $700 million for those.
chris wetherbee -- citi -- analyst
okay, got it. all right, that's helpful. and then, maybe a bigger picture question. i guess, looking back to the apr acquisition, the question at the time was the relative size of that acquisition compared to the containership fleet and portfolio, and the relative small size of that. flash forward more than a year, you've done -- you've made some significant strides in building out the containership portfolio, further minimizing the impact of apr on the total company. so, when we think ahead, does it still make sense to treat this as a portfolio company with investments across a range of asset classes or because of the sort of overweight dynamic within the containership, does it really kind of minimize the impact? it's something you do unless it's something significantly more dramatic in terms of size and apr. so it was a little curious, then, i guess i feel like it might even be more curious now. so, i'm kind of curious, how you think about this going forward? is it something that you'll be considering in terms of doing deals outside of containership or are we kind of all in now in containership?
david sokol -- chairman
this is david. actually, chris, i think it's an excellent question. i think the importance of the, if you will, portfolio effect particularly when talking about these types of assets and frankly just when you think about it, energy assets aren't a lot different than ships in many ways. i mean the ships obviously move from place-to-place and power plants usually don't. but i think the importance of having the different platforms, on one hand, the shipping industry right now, the relationships that seaspan has and that bing and the team have created, we're in a very good part of that cycle and the customer relationships and the demand for new vessels, meeting changed environmental requirements, more efficient haul capabilities etc., allow for that to be exploited right now. and the amazing thing is when you look at the background of contracted cash flows there, that carries the whole company on a substantial growth platform for the next three to four years just by itself.
energy right now is in the kind of the downside of a cycle, if you will. there is an uncertain period, covid has caused a lot of reduction in electricity demand. and you're in the middle of a global environmental transition regarding co2 from a power plant emissions capability in my view, and that's where i spent the bulk of my history. that's going to create enormous opportunity. but, you have to wait for the right opportunities.
if i think back at midamerican energy, when we joined berkshire in 2000, the company had about $10 billion in assets. today, 21 years later, they're over $100 billion. and -- but that wasn't steady growth in each of the platforms, whether it was the pipeline platform, the u.s. utility platform, the foreign utility platform or independent power. they all came in cycles and opportunistic cycles. and that's the important thing i think about this.
so, for the near-term, there's no question. seaspan's growth will overwhelm atlas's overall future, but the energy side will have its time and there is going to be a digesting period at seaspan as this new growth period shows up. i think one thing -- bing touched on something about the difference in the past in the shipping industry in the future. i think it's important to take a minute and think back to how the container shipping industry has grown and the difference that was made when the major liners decided to start looking at alliances, very similar to the global airline industry and rationalize their capacity much more carefully and get much more efficient in the marketplace. that's really what's created the huge opportunity for seaspan through the relationships that peter and bing and torsten have developed with our customers. it's much more efficient for them to operate with someone like us who can sell to them an entire chain of ships or an entire route, improve their environmental performance, and efficiency rather than dealing with a lot of one-offs.
now, we certainly have some capable competitors but that dynamic is much more significant in the marketplace and i think a lot of people have recognized. the energy industry have similar characteristics and there's -- for my dollar, the best time to be involved in an industry is when there's a lot of change going on and that typifies the energy field for the next 20 years. so today, no question, seaspan will overwhelm the current growth parts of atlas. but i'm -- i think we're all confident that the apr side will have it's day, but we're not -- the one thing, this team and the board won't do is, we're not going to do transactions just to look busy or to look like we're doing something. when the right opportunities aren't there, we're going to pass on them and bing has done that this last year.
there have been numerous significant opportunities that the rates return just weren't there. and we're not going to give away the quality of service that this organization has. we're also not going to mislead our customers that we can provide them the quality they want at those kinds of returns. it takes high-performance staff and a very focused team to deliver the kind of performance. so discipline, i think, in capital allocations are critical thing and hopefully that answers the question.
chris wetherbee -- citi -- analyst
it's very helpful color. so, i appreciate the detail in the answer. the follow up that i have is, do you envision that scenario at some point in the next three to five years, where energy can be large enough as a portion of the portfolio to really move the needle in a public company, sort of set aside the idea of in sort of a portfolio approach from a cash flow generation standpoint, but in terms of actually moving a public company?
david sokol -- chairman
yeah, i think the opportunities will be there because energy projects tend to be very large in scale, very long in duration. so i think, the opportunities will be there. it's going to be up to us to execute on them. it wouldn't shock me if 10 years from now, the two platforms had almost an equal balance of earnings and capital deployed. it will be in different chunks. the energy side will typically, largely come in larger projects with much longer duration. but, yeah, i think the potential is there, but we're going to have to -- again, if the rate of returns aren't there, then we'll continue to grow apr at a very slower, steady pace. if the returns are there, we will be excited to accelerate their growth, but, only if the capital dollar spent there is risk-adjusted, a better return than [indecipherable].
chris wetherbee -- citi -- analyst
okay, that's helpful. thank you very much.
david sokol -- chairman
you bet.
operator
thank you. our last question comes from the line of ken hoexter with bank of america. your line is now open.
ken hoexter -- bank of america -- analyst
hey, good morning, dave, bing, and thanks for the great details, and graham. so, you've been growing so rapidly on the container side. just -- maybe a little bit of insight into what gives you the sign of peak of the market? what level of order book got you concerned? and i guess, i'm trying to dig into -- as the market is just extremely tight right now, given the need to catch up on the inventories and where we are and then, once we recover, you could be in a scenario by '23 when these vessels start delivering that we're kind of now in a more of an overbuilt capacity and you start seeing returns or reinvestment renewals start to decelerate.
bing chen -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, good morning, ken. i will answer your question and my colleague, peter will be also here, feel free to chime in. in terms of these newbuild right now, i think it's still, as i said it earlier, it's driven by the customer demand. if you're looking at the fundamentals of demand and supply, first of all, we're looking at -- let's talk about the demand side. demand side, today, it's very disciplined. and disciplined in the sense that the market has gone through the paradigm shift in the sense that if you're looking at today about eight, nine -- top eight, nine companies accounts for about 85%, 90% of the total market. so, they are very much focusing on the quality of services versus before they're competing for the market share.
on the demand side, today, if we are looking at last year, even given the pandemic of the close down and logistics limitation, and everything and also the year before 2019 was primarily a trade war rhetoric between u.s. and china. i think for these two years, if you're looking at the demand side, the global container trade -- container shipping, the volume last year was pretty much flat over 2019. and 2019 actually was a growth over 2018. so, the global trade and the demand is there. if you're looking at the forecast, in the next two to three years, i believe 2021 is supposed to be somewhere around 4% to 5%, '22 is about 3%, '23 about 2%, according to the industry's forecast. the demand is there.
on the other hand, the supply side, i think as you know the -- over the past, at least, three or four or five years, the order book has been in historically low since i joined the industry about three years ago. and if you're looking at the -- with all these newbuild today, i think that these new build today, first of all, they are filling in a segment which is the 15-k that is rather new because this is the most versatile in the sense that as i said it earlier, the demand and also the size of the vessel is both -- bringing both the advantage of the economic, environmental, and technology advance to the entire container shipping fleet. so that is like any other asset class. these are the best new developed assets. and therefore, that was the driven of these newbuild, including the 24-k, which is a new -- completely new class, the ultra large vessels that i think for obvious reasons, because the cost per unit, and for the specific trade route between asia and europe, this is the best assets. so if we're looking at behind of these kind of supply, the supply increased for a reason because there is a justification for those supply because there is a demand for them. so, in our opinion, i think that this is a still a healthy development because the industry, by the way, also every year should also have a certain percentage of the vessels should be retired because they need to be replaced tonnage and in today's environment, i don't think that there is any replacement tonnage that's been scrapped, because they're very tight market. so, if we're looking at demand and supply fundamentals so far, we see this is a healthy development and from our perspective for seaspan's newbuild, as i said it earlier, all of these newbuild have been backed by long-term contract by these top global liners. so, therefore, this is not something that we will be exposed to any kind of market fluctuation, whether it's up or down, rather that we have already have secured these long-term contract. and this is again is the differentiation of our business model. so from this perspective, i think we think that current development is still healthy and as market continue to evolve, we will have to -- we are very disciplined and we are very closely monitoring the development and working very closely with our customers in understanding what their business needs are. once again, every investment and newbuild is driven by the demand of our customers.
ken hoexter -- bank of america -- analyst
so, bing, would you say, the lessors are taking share from the liners? is that pretty steady in terms of their contribution? and then, what are your thoughts about seaspan within the market itself versus the other lessor peers?
bing chen -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, i think if you're looking at what we have been able to achieve over the past few months, it's a very good testament of, one, is seaspan's capability today. i think, we have the unique platform that allows us to be able to execute such a very complicated newbuild project with our customer in different technology, different size, within such a different -- within such a very short period of time. and this is one thing, as i joined the company about three years ago, i keep talking about that seaspan has an integrated platform. and this integrated platform comes in very, very handy in a situation like this, which is why we are able to differentiate ourselves by providing the advice, the services to our customers, and that's why we are able to -- be able to, in situation like this and quickly come to that kind of decision and execution, working with multiple parties throughout this -- the value chain, as i mentioned -- working with the customer, in looking at the technology, looking at different type of propulsion system, for example, lng versus the conventional with what is 24,000 versus 15,000, different size of the ships, different propulsions, with different design, with all the different features, because these vessels are -- even though they are 15,000, but they are different specs with different features.
so therefore, this is something we are very proud that we have the people, we have the process, we have the system, and we have the partners that really it's solution-driven to our customer and that's what i said at the very beginning, is that we are the solution provider to our customer. we don't just offer a vessel. so, that's how we differentiate ourselves in the marketplace, and by the same token, from our customers' perspective, as i also mentioned before. and so, you probably have seen, that our liner customer today are really looking for the quality of their services. for them to focusing on the quality of services, they need to have the quality of the partners that will be able to provide a variety of solutions, not just the vessel, but the reliability of the operations, the most up-to-date, i think, industry trend and the development in terms of environmental, which is one thing that is very important, right, today.
what is the future? what is -- how do we have the lower emission? and things in that nature. and then the part is how you are going to actually managing a project with the newbuild, which is a very complicated process, that you need to have the team, being able to supervise, executing, and then comes to the financing. so from all these aspects, i think our customers are looking for a long-term partner who has the scale and who has the flexibility and who has the quality of the service to support them, to grow their business and seaspan is build exactly for that and that's what we've been spending the past three years and really focusing on these areas and that's why we come to the moment like this, where we were able to execute flawlessly. and that's where something that our team has been very, very swift in delivering this type of service to our customer.
ken hoexter -- bank of america -- analyst
bing, maybe i was trying to get a more simple answer, a numerical answer. do you think the liners are taking more share? i'm sorry -- the lessors are taking more share from the liners and then in that market, is seaspan taking a larger share of the leasing market? or are you saying the market right now overall is just growing rapidly and you're staying static on the shared side?
bing chen -- president and chief executive officer
i think that today based on the information that we have, i believe seaspan actually took a -- quite a significant share of this newbuild in the marketplace. i think overall that in today's market, we team up with the leasing companies, for example. but, i think, at this point, we do take a large share of that newbuild and overall i think that in terms of the numbers of the newbuild -- i don't have the exact number, but i think there is another probably about 20 to 30 vessels either being financed by the liners themselves or being financed by leasing companies, or being financed by a few shipowners.
ken hoexter -- bank of america -- analyst
okay. would love to see that at the analyst day, maybe a breakdown on kind of how the market is developing. and then, just a follow-up on chris and fadi's question on the energy market. what's the goal of the joint venture? are you contributing anything right now? was there an initial investment? does forming of the joint venture mean, we're likely to hear something soon? or was there something being planned that you needed local expertise? maybe just talk about that.
bing chen -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, the joint venture is a joint venture that is going to be based in china, hangzhou, a special trading zone. the capital will be on on-call [phonetic] basis. it is going to be 50-50. we are going to be working with our joint venture partner in jointly developing opportunities in both maritime and energy projects, as i mentioned. some of those immediate projects, for example, in the shipping side, we are cooperating on, for example, the scrubber projects, where we have the needs and they can provide that service and also looking at shipping in general, in looking at other type of the shipping transportation, other than transportation -- other than container ships.
on the energy side...
ken hoexter -- bank of america -- analyst
i understood your answer from fadi. i just wanted to understand was there anything that's imminent in terms of the forming of the joint venture. does that mean something is coming soon? and did you contribute anything upfront? just simply.
bing chen -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, there are things, for example, we are looking at some power projects together because they are looking at some of the projects that we can jointly looking at those type of opportunities. but as a next step, we will have to -- right now, we entered into the agreement, then we also have to formulate -- formally incorporate that joint venture that is going to take several months to formally create that joint venture. at the same time, we will be jointly looking at opportunities in power and shipping space.
ken hoexter -- bank of america -- analyst
okay, so nothing imminent, it takes a lot to form the jv process. and then, the thoughts on -- my last one, just on apr utilization. what's built into the outlook there? any significant change in post mexicali -- the change in utilization for apr in '21?
bing chen -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. the utilization is actually reflected in our 2021 financial forecast. i think in terms of utilization, so far, we have projected, similar to that of 2020. at the same time, team are working -- we are strengthening our business development team. we are looking at different type of opportunities. the one thing that we want to be very much focused on is looking at the quality of those projects where we're going to be very selective in engaging in any type of projects, but anyway, to your question, the utilization due to the short-term nature, the utilization, it will not be the same as what you've seen at the seaspan, which we achieved over 99%. but for apr, the utilization will be in the range around, i would say, 70% to 80%, that will be very high.
ken hoexter -- bank of america -- analyst
thanks, bing. thanks for the time. appreciate the answers.

operator
welcome to the atlas corp. fourth quarter 2020 earnings conference call. i would like to remind everyone that this call is being recorded today, march 9, 2021.
i would now like to turn the call over to robert weiner, head of investor relations of atlas corp.
robert weiner -- head of investor relations

david sokol -- chairman
thank you, rob and good morning everyone. this is dave sokol speaking, chairman of the board of atlas corp. and, i'd like to welcome all participants today and express my appreciation for your time and attention to our presentation. i've asked bing to allow me to open today's call with a bit of a look back over the past three years, which encompasses the time since bing joined as a ceo in january of 2018. what bing and his team have accomplished is extraordinary and deserving a clear recognition.
we have a wonderful company; a global multi-platform business that our team is very excited about. atlas is uniquely positioned as a long-term capital allocation, global multi-platform investment opportunity with key attributes. three of those attributes are; first, our resilient business model, which ended 2020, with nearly $11 billion in total gross contracted cash flow, pro forma for $5.9 billion of gross contracted cash flow added from recent vessel acquisitions, including 31 new builds and two second-hand vessel acquisitions. to create greater clarity for investors, we will be discussing total contracted cash flow today and in the future.
secondly, atlas's core competencies are consistent operational excellence, creative customer partnerships, solid financial strength, quality growth, and disciplined capital allocation. this is what drives our execution and results.
and thirdly, the team has been delivering quality growth, enhancing fleet and asset composition, and creating greater diversification of our customers through the addition of quality assets with long-term quality margin contracted revenue.
our 2020 performance clearly depicts a divergence in atlas's performance as compared to our peers and even more broadly as benchmarks against other mid-cap investment opportunities. bing and the teams' positioning of seaspan has allowed for atlas to aggressively take advantage of current industry dynamics; growing the business dramatically with excellent margin long-term charters and taking advantage of shipyard opportunities due to our team's industry relationships, and design and construction oversight talents. the container shipping industry dynamics were not meaningfully set back by covid and in some ways covid shined light upon the importance of our world's global container shipping efficiency.
our other platform, apr energy was substantially more affected by covid as developing governments were virtually shut down and the resulting economic slowdowns materially reduced electricity demand. however, these delays should turn into opportunities when the global covid pandemic is resolved. the three-year performance you see on this slide, which depicts the management team's performance since 2017, show strong growth in revenues, cash flow and earnings, yet with little contribution from apr, as it was only closed in february of 2020. this performance is reflective of processes, programs, strategies, and leadership that bing and his teams have built and developed over the past three years; a formula for success leveraging the company's five key competencies to produce these results.
we are confident that as we now begin to apply that formula to apr, we will drive similar progress in the future to that of seaspan. a closer look at the results, illustrates the very impressive performance and execution of this team. from the 2017 results through 2020, the performance is quite extraordinary. revenue increased by 70.9% from $831 million to $1.42 billion at the end of 2020; a 19.6% compounded growth rate. adjusted ebitda increased from $496 million to $924 million at the end of 2020, representing a 23% compounded growth rate. funds from operation increased by 146% from $253 million to $622 million at the end of 2020; a 35% compounded growth rate. and cash flow from operations went from $391 million to $694 million in 2020. this represents a cumulative annual growth rate of 21.1%. and we also made significant progress with the balance sheet and the capital structure measurements.
now please turn to slide 5. this slide depicts what i view as very impressive progress; in fact, i would say, great results. this is the performance that growth stocks are made of and we are doing this with significant identifiable and easily valued assets that are backed by long-term gross contracted cash flows and earnings performance. it may be difficult to find other companies with nearly $11 billion of future long-term gross contracted cash flow. atlas is that company. atlas has added long-term gross contracted cash flows by a whopping $5.9 billion in about the last three months. this is very impressive and it may seem that it occurred surprisingly quickly. however, the foundation for this growth have been laid during the prior three years through disciplined execution and a total focus upon the customers' needs and expectations.
since 2017, we've added 71 new vessels and over 890,000 teus, an 80% increase in a little over three years, while at the same time, strengthening the fleet with newer, larger vessels on longer tenured charters. this is exceptional performance, especially when you consider the myriad of challenges posed over the last year from covid. the board of directors and i are very pleased with the team's commitment to high quality growth and high performance.
please turn now to slide 6. on the left of the slide, you'll see seaspan's vessel categories when this team started on our path to high performance. our vessels were more concentrated in smaller, less desirable categories, and with a more spot-oriented mix. now in 2021, you see growth to 160 vessels from 89 at the end of 2017 and the depth and breadth of today's fleet is a far higher quality with enhanced environmental equipment, thereby developing a more desirable and attractive offering to the customers.
seaspan's primary focus is on expanding the 10,000 to 15,000 teu fleet category as these are attractive vessels for major trade lanes and are expected to be the workhorses of the global fleet in the coming decades. these vessel sizes are preferred for major routes, given their operating scale and efficiency. 79% of our fleet on a teu weighted basis is greater than 10,000 teus with an average age of 5.3 years, which we believe is unmatched in the industry and significantly differentiate our value proposition with our customers.
please turn to slide 7. this slide importantly depicts the significant diversification of the company's credit risk profile, which has been a focal point for bing and the board. we work from a very concentrated customer mix to a very balanced mix of customers and revenue sources, which drastically reduces our credit risk. this transformation is even more compelling when you evaluate, over the same period 2017 through 2020, the dramatic uptick in the health of the industry and the much-improved credit ratings of our customers, which have been on a steady rise during this period. atlas is now positioned more securely and dynamically than at any point in the past with a diversified customer mix, a much strengthened and improved quality of our fleet, a strong market, and increasingly positive credit ratings within the industry. we begin 2021 with a strong tailwind and we're very well-positioned to execute future quality growth and value creation for our shareholders.
now please turn to slide 8. we have a strong safety culture at atlas. it is integrated into everything we do as a company. our priority will always be the safety and well-being of our team and business partners through operational excellence in every aspect of our business. torsten and his team walk this talk every day. we take this very seriously at the board level and the teams have robust programs to ensure safe operations, successfully executing our daily workstreams. we value our team members and we want them to return home healthy and safely after every shift. we also have a strong commitment to social responsibility, investing in our team, providing the tools, training and programs to be good corporate citizens. you will see on this slide that our safety record has dramatically improved and sits near an all-time record lows and it's being maintained. this was a focus of ours when i came in as chairman and again the team has delivered. we are optimizing the success formula at seaspan, which we are carrying over to apr, which is seeking iso 14001 certification in 2021. now, if you would please turn to slide 9. as you can see from the graph on slide 9, the formula this management team is implementing is working and effectively increasing value for shareholders. the team has executed with a high-level performance, illustrated by the 90% total return delivered to shareholders of atlas over the past three years, far outperforming competitive peers and even more so, the broader equity markets. before i turn over the forum to bing, our chief executive, i want to conclude my remarks by pointing out the philosophy and practice of the board of directors and the management team. and that is simply that atlas is clearly a shareholder-focused company, performing for all of our shareholders, small and large and consistently delivering increasing value for the shareholders. we expect to continue to deliver exceptional value and returns, demonstrating atlas's compelling investment opportunity. we remain optimistic, determined, and focused on achieving sustainable value and growth. please turn to slide 11. and lastly, the board and i are extremely pleased with the team's progress to date and we look forward to more success. we're pleased, but we're never satisfied. thank you again for your attention. i will now turn the forum over to atlas's ceo, bing chen.
bing chen -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, david and good morning everyone. i would like to first welcome our new cfo, graham talbot. graham is a full-fledged cfo with a world-class finance background and decades of experience at global organizations. since joining in february, he is already a key contributor to our organization. in 2021, i look forward to working with members of the investment community, along with graham and rob, to increase your awareness and appreciation of atlas's resilient and differentiated business model.
now let me turn to our performance and please turn to slide 13. looking back at 2020, what a year it has been for the world and the markets. the pandemic, shutdowns, uncertainties, economic opportunities and consequences, and the volatility caused by that all. 2020 was quite a year of unprecedented challenges. i'm happy to report that not only have we exceeded our financial guidance for 2020, but we have emerged stronger, more resilient, and have proven our operational excellence. i'm very proud of atlas's achievements in 2020, but especially at how our team stood ready, adapt well, stayed focused, overcame obstacles, and execute with precision, safety and compassion.
our 2020 performance was very strong, building significantly upon 2019's momentum. atlas achieved the following financial milestones in the fourth quarter of 2020. our core financial metrics all improved quite dramatically in the fourth quarter of 2020, including total revenue growth of 25.9%, adjusted ebitda growth of 32%, funds from operations or ffo grew significantly by 45.2%. ffo per diluted share growth was 26%, cash flow from operations growth of 53.6%. this is quality growth. all metrics generated strong double-digit growth despite the operational challenges posed by pandemic. this is a testament of our differentiated and resilient business model and our team's commitment to consistent operational excellence and a strong execution.
our 2020 results included a impairment of certain apr assets under purchase accounting principle, following the acquisition in february 2020. the impairment resulted from a independent asset valuation assessment, which also had further third-party opinion and verification. we acquired apr in february 2020 and this process is a typical analysis, which is completed following the first year ownership of acquired assets. but, i would like to reiterate that we do not view this as a changing of our principles and the reasons why we acquired apr.
the apr acquisition value proposition stands strong. the business is stable and the platform remains viable for future expansion. apr has a strong track record and reputation in the fast-power solution space. as we look ahead, we are confident in the prospects of apr. our work will take some time to generate desired results, but we have a good path to follow the seaspan formula and atlas's fiscal discipline and capital allocation.
please turn to slide 15. atlas, seaspan, and apr all made progress in 2020. seaspan had a record year, while we focused on integrating apr into the seaspan model by executing our five key competencies. i will briefly highlight some major achievements. at the atlas level, the most significant for our shareholders is the over-achievement of our 2020 financial guidance. that is the result of diligence, discipline, and execution based on long-term fundamental and strategic planning. the formation of atlas as an asset owner and operator create a business platform that can leverage seaspan's execution and strategy, which was developed when our chairman, david sokol and i teamed up late in 2017. at that time, we set a course to strengthen the seaspan model by focusing on our five key competencies.
our 2020 seaspan performance demonstrates that our strategy have been effective and the business has significantly improved. with the acquisition of apr, we gained a platform with an established presence in energy markets; yet, a business that requires us to apply the seaspan formula to improve and create opportunities for growth in the future. we are confident that we will be effective in fueling apr to the next level.
at seaspan, between december 2019 and 2020, we acquired 15 high-quality second-hand vessels, growing quality fleet to approximately 1.1 million teu. we have since announced a quality growth of 487,000 teu, growing 45.4% in very short time, primarily through new builds, which may appear as a return to seaspan's history of newbuild. but that is not the case as we are applying our disciplined capital allocation strategies, which remains agnostic to newbuilds or second-hand vessels. seaspan is driving quality growth through both channels. this is because, we are growing discreetly in close partnerships with our customers to fulfill their business needs and provide win-win solutions.
very importantly, our new vessel growth of 487,000 teu has added $5.9 billion of gross contracted cash flow to seaspan within the last few months. i'm particularly proud of our partnership with zim to close 10 newbuild 15,000 teu dual fuel lng vessels, backed by 12 years charter. through this transaction, we further strengthened our commitment to esg principles. we continue to expand the scope of our customer solutions by elevating our focus on lowering the impact of emissions through the addition of lng-powered vessels to our fleet. you have seen seaspan execute sustainability-linked financing, which parallel to this fleet expansion and illustrates our resolve to contribute to the greener business community.
as our long-term objective is to achieve an investment-grade corporate credit rating, during 2020, we made significant strides forward in our pursuit. we achieved investment-grade of bbb minus senior secured rating from kroll bond rating agency. we closed $250 million of sustainability-linked loan, a first in container shipping adding to to innovative portfolio financing program to reach about $1.8 billion at the year-end. and we closed an initial placement in unsecured credit markets of $200 million, 3.75% coupon exchangeable senior notes. at apr, we closed $285 million of financing program, insurance flexibility, and liquidity. while it was a year filled with transition, through the team's resolve and despite the energy markets during the pandemic, apr secured contracts to provide 265 megawatts of peaking power in mexico. very importantly, apr was the only company to execute a mobile gas turbine development during 2020. historically, apr's model built a strong reputation for delivering when others could not and primarily focused on serving the situations where, in developing countries, that needs scalable power quickly, in areas that require power periodically or in peak demand or where apr fulfills rescue power during natural disasters or other type of disruptive situations. as we develop apr, we will focus on continuing to leverage our expertise in these key markets, while seeking to expand to long-term contracts. also we are adding new avenues of growth through longer duration contracts in large-scale power projects. our continuous laser focus on our five key competencies is the driving force behind all these achievements. we remain confident that we will carry the momentum into 2021. please turn to slide 17. atlas was certainly not immune to the effect of covid. one of our key markets, energy, was significantly impacted months after we acquired apr. while continued global trade helped fuel a fast recovery in maritime and specifically container shipping, many apr peers, however, suffered through the global impacts resulting from the pandemic. atlas and our shareholders benefited from our resilient and differentiated business model as our operational excellence delivered consistent and dependable financial performance throughout the entire year. other businesses in our markets experienced great variability, less consistency and dependability, and for some in energy markets, a significant decline in business activities. we stayed resilient and delivered. it is important to note that differentiation of our business model creates a high-quality investment profile compared to many in our markets. what sets atlas apart competitively is our focus on the growth and the quality of our predictable cash flows and providing greater, long-term visibility and dependability for our investors. over the last three months, we have added $5.9 billion of gross contracted cash flow. at 2020 year-end, more than 93% of seaspan's 2021 revenue guidance at the midpoint is already contracted. that is a resilient and differentiated business model. we're increasing the quality of our assets. compared to our peers, our fleet is younger, larger, and more sought-after by our customers. we have the scalable operation, versatile fleet, and integrated platform to deliver best-in-class solutions that maximize value creation for our customers. we have the financial strength to create value in partnership with our customers and we are focused on esg principles to enrich our business model and to innovate positive changes within our industry. the attributes on this slide reiterate our competitive advantage and set our business model apart. now, i'm excited to update you on our recent announcement. yesterday, we issued a press release regarding our new joint venture with zhejiang energy group. atlas, together with ze group, will form a new entity to be incorporated in china's hangzhou free trade zone. this jv will invest in projects in the global maritime and power industries. ze group is a leading global company with a strong track record of successful energy-related projects and infrastructure design and development. we're excited by the prospects of the jv and anticipate jointly developing meaningful projects in the future. please turn to slide 19. now, i would like to turn to a brief update and outlook for our markets in 2021. i'm pleased to say that container shipping market is very strong and the energy markets are becoming incrementally stronger, which we view as highly positive developments following all the uncertainty and disruption last year. the container shipping industry continues to strengthen at a rapid pace from the market lows due to the pandemic. idle vessel counts are at historical lows, with charter rates at near historical highs, and availability of any vessels above 4,000 teu is very scarce. while the current container market is great, seaspan, at any given time, only have about 10% to 15% market exposure as the majority of our fleet is secured by long-term contracts. as of 2020 year-end, more than 93% of seaspan's 2021 revenue guidance at the midpoint is under contract. yes, the current rate environment helped us to renew the contracts, but the resiliency of our model is not dependent on those upswings in the market. we remain optimistic about the strength in the rates and the global trade to achieve quality growth for atlas. today's balance of supply and demand is fundamentally stronger than it has been in the past. global demand is expected to continue to rise this year with some catch-up due to the pandemic, but also forecast to continue in years to come. the health of market participants' balance sheets and liquidity have strengthened over the past years. and we are seeing greater sophistication and automation in the markets. technologies enabling decision-making, planning, and execution, have been much more precise versus the past. this is great for the industry to achieve gains while adopting new, green and emission reduction initiatives. you can see from this slide, the projection of global recovery in 2021 is strong with forecasted growth in the range of approximately 5% to 6%. this should support a continuing strong performance for seaspan. we are confident that our focus at apr will produce incrementally positive outcomes and increase returns for our shareholders. please turn to slide 20. the new growth we have announced since 2020 year-end is a very exciting development. as you can see from this slide, we have announced the addition of 33 new vessels to be added to our fleet. these new additions are in very attractive categories; 31 vessels in the 10,000 to 15,000 teu category, a 59% increase. and two new ultra modern 24,000 teu vessels in ultra large category; a new category for us, positioning us as the only full-spectrum teu providers in the marketplace. what is most important is the $5.9 billion of long-term gross contracted cash flow that we have secured with these new vessels. this brings our total long-term gross contracted cash flow, as our chairman mentioned earlier, to $11 billion with an average duration of 6.5 years. you can also see that we are diversifying our revenue sources, particularly as a result of a growing partnership with zim. we have a well-diversified revenue base with very strong customers. this strong growth demonstrates the resilient and differentiated business model we enjoy at atlas. that concludes my formal remarks. and i'm now pleased to turn the call over to graham talbot, our new cfo.
graham talbot -- chief financial officer
good morning, everyone. firstly, i'd like to thank bing for the warm welcome to atlas. i look forward to working with you and rob, as we engage the investment community going forward. i'll begin my remarks by saying i'm very excited to join the atlas team. we have a very robust core business platform and significant opportunity to continue to develop both our maritime and energy businesses, as we simultaneously optimize the atlas shared services model. consistency is the best way to characterize our financial performance. that is, consistency in relation to our core asset cash flows and consistency in relation to quality growth. atlas's fourth quarter financial performance was very strong. compared to q4 2019, our total revenue increased by 25.9% to $362.7 million. 56% of the increase in revenue was due to the contribution from apr, while seaspan's revenue increased 11.3% to $320.6 million, primarily due to the expansion of our fleet. the 32% year-over-year increase of adjusted ebitda was driven by increased revenue, operating expense leverage, and lower than expected g&a in both seaspan and apr. ffo increased by 45.2% as a result of the acquisition of apr and continued growth in seaspan. we ended the year with over $770 million in liquidity and paid our 62nd consecutive dividend. seaspan closed out the year with vessel utilization of 99.6%. that's pretty close to perfection, reflecting a very robust container shipping market, coupled with operational excellence. apr's asset utilization was as forecast at 61.8%, reflecting lower utilization as we demobilized the mexicali project in q3. during 2020, seaspan's fleet capacity reached approximately 1.1 billion teu, reflecting the 15 vessels we added during 2020, which we began to headlight in q4 of 2019. at the same time as delivering these great results, we also improved our safety performance as measured by lost-time injury frequency, which declined by 32% to 0.47 at seaspan and sits at near-record lows of 0.76 at apr. a key investment attribute of atlas is our long-term gross contracted cash flow. we've stood at $4.8 billion at year-end at seaspan and $284 million for apr, the total gross contracted cash flow of $5.1 billion. this does not include any of the recently announced acquisitions and newbuilds, which will contribute further in the coming years. also note, that our $5.1 billion of contracted cash flow which has an average remaining lease period of approximately four years at seaspan and just under two years at apr. beginning late in 2019 and consistently throughout 2020, we grew our fleet by acquiring 15 young high-valued vessels. these vessels further strengthened the quality, width and versatility of our fleet, while also increasing our overall scale, which is an important element of our success. we actively screen both new and second-hand vessel acquisitions and during the year, we turned down a number of opportunities which did not meet our investment criteria. each transaction that makes it through our screening has to be driven by customer needs and the creation of mutually economic solutions. quality growth is a key distinguishing characteristic of our company. but, investors should also take note and be assured by our strong financial and capital allocation discipline. our investments, capital expenditures, and acquisitions are all governed by strict capital allocation disciplines, which target, at a minimum, high single-digit unlevered returns, coupled with risk mitigation that we diligently adhere to for every incremental investment dollar. our ability to continuously deliver high-quality results and growth is not due to a single factor. it is a combination of many factors that provide a unique, full-cycle platform in the delivery of unmatched and timely customer solutions. it is a distinguishing attributes, which not only differentiates us from our market peers, but also in many mid cap equity investment choices in today's financial markets. atlas closed out 2020 with continued strong performance, delivering value for our customers, business partners, shareholders, and employees. while i am new to the company, i must point out, that i find our team's commitment and day-to-day performance gratifying and inspiring, which gives me confidence in our ability to sustain our high performance. please turn to slide number 23. now, we will turn to the full-year financial performance for 2020. again as an outsider coming in, the growth has been stunning to me. many regard the sector is cyclical and driven by external factors, outside of management control. it's clear from our 2020 revenue growth of 25.6%, but this is not true. needless to say, 2020 has set a benchmark for the organization going forward. highlights for atlas full-year 2020 performance include, revenue growth of 25.6% compared to 2019, reaching a record of $1.421 billion; ffo growth of 65.8% to a record of $622.3 million; ffo per diluted share growth of 45% to $2.48; and adjusted ebitda growth of 29.3% to a record $923.8 million. as you've seen from our recent news, together with our customers, we've been working on newbuild opportunities, which resulted in over 31 newbuild vessels under contract. yet, we continue to have some secondary market opportunities as well. as bing mentioned, we have added $5.9 billion of gross contracted cash flows with industry-leading customers. this brings our total long-term gross contracted cash flow to $11 billion and with a total fleet average charter duration of 6.5 years, this is a fantastic accomplishment. please turn to slide number 24. now looking at our liquidity and balance sheet, we've strengthened our liquidity by 64.1% during 2020 to $771.3 million at year-end. in apr, we conducted an extensive third-party asset value assessment, which resulted in an impairment of $117.9 million. a number of factors drove the change, including the continuing impact of lower power demand globally, which is increasingly affecting the market value of assets; a strategic decision to progressively exit diesel power generation market due to our esg principles; and finally, the consolidation and streamlining of warehousing facilities in jacksonville. the lack of a rebound in new projects within the overall energy markets, primarily in our view, associated with covid, that lasted longer than many had anticipated and has resulted in restraints on new capital commitments, which we see continuing. while never desirable, the reduction in asset values are primarily associated with legacy technologies and fuel sources that do not represent where we plan to take the business in the future. in 2020, the team completed several progressive financings, including a $250 million sustainability-linked loan, which is added to our portfolio of financing program both, which are first for the container shipping industry. this takes our facility up to approximately $1.8 billion at year-end. this is an important step aligning our capital structure to green sustainability-linked financial incentives. this is a key focus area for us and is linked to our esg initiatives, which you'll hear more about at our upcoming investor day. seaspan achieved an investment-grade bbb minus senior secured rating from kroll bond rating in relation to our portfolio financing program. this is an important step on our path to achieve our investment-grade corporate rating from one of the major agencies. over the next two to four years, we anticipate being positioned to achieve this milestone. seaspan also closed an initial placement in the unsecured credit markets of $201.3 million at 3.75% exchangeable senior notes. these notes carry an effective strike price of $17.85, which we view as more closely aligned with our value today. the notes mature in 2025, unless earlier exchanged, repurchased or availed by the company. apr closed a $295 million financing during 2020, providing continued flexibility and liquidity. the package includes a revolver, term loan and a fixed rate privately placed component. in january 2021, seaspan issued $200 million in senior unsecured sustainability-linked bonds in the nordic market, which is again creating increasing alignment to green initiatives and further diversifying our capital base. in the bottom half of slide number 24 is an important chart. as the new management team and board came together in mid-to-late 2017, the team here views 2018 as the starting point for measurement of our progress and performance. and when you look at this chart and see growth of 38 vessels, while at the same time you see an increase of nine unencumbered vessels, with very high sustained utilization flat debt to assets and all with a 1.1 times improvement of the net debt to ebitda ratio, this is excellent performance. in summary, our balance sheet is strong and we have increasing capacity and access in the capital markets. going forward, we will continue to actively manage our capital structure to fuel growth and optimize our cost of capital as we progress toward an investment-grade corporate rating. though we upgraded our guidance twice during the year, our final performance was either above guidance or within the communicated ranges. this demonstrates the high-degree of consistency and transparency in our performance, which we continually strive to deliver. we are proud to have delivered these results for our shareholders and remain focused on continuing to execute efficiently, effectively, and with high performance, utilizing our five key competencies to guide our progress. now, a look at our initial 2021 financial guidance. please turn to slide number 26. with a very strong 2020 performance now behind us, we are initiating a 2021 financial guidance today. it's important to note that more than 93% of seaspan's 2021 revenue guidance at the midpoint is under contract as of 2020 year end and the majority of apr's forecasted revenue anticipate through 2021. this creates very strong visibility, dependability, and consistency of our cash flows, which typically has awarded higher multiples and valuation for our investors. our guidance for the full year 2021 is as follows. revenues in the range of $1.325 billion to $1.355 billion for seaspan and a $180 million to $205 million for apr; operating expense of $276 million to $290 million for seaspan and $35 million to $37 million for apr; g&a expense of $41 million to $46 million for seaspan and $45 million to $47 million for apr; operating lease expense of $144 million to $152 million for seaspan and $3 million for apr; adjusted net ebitda in the range of $839 million to $874 million for seaspan and $97 million to $118 million for apr. the financial objectives for 2021 reflects continued significant progress. we have work to do. we have a team that has consistently delivered for shareholders. we are committed and confident in our resolve to perform at a high level. please turn to slide number 28. i will wrap up my remarks by discussing why we believe atlas represents an excellent investment. i hope investors will come to see the clear competitive differentiation in our model and the ability for this team to consistently deliver performance. we believe atlas represents an excellent investment opportunity across all market cycles. our business model is resilient and consistent with $11 billion of long-term gross contracted cash flows and an average charter duration remaining of approximately 6.5 years. we have proven the power of our five key competencies to develop atlas into an increasingly differentiated best-in-class business solution provider. our financial position is strong with increasing liquidity and access to capital and our focus on delivering solutions for our customers will continue to drive quality growth. these are key investment attributes which are unique to atlas and offer investors significant opportunity to partner with an industry leader. while 2020 was a very challenging year for all of us, the team at atlas persevered, as bing mentioned, and delivered excellent performance. i'm very honored to join the team and i look forward to continuing to build the business and stay in front of our competition. operator, we would now like to open the line to questions. thank you.
",2020-Q4,ATCO

operator
[operator instructions] our first question comes from the line of chris wetherbee with citi. your line is open.
unidentified participant
this is william [phonetic] on chris. thank you for taking my question. so first, i just want to start off with your capital priorities, and see the great opportunity. so after purchasing those 26, i was just wondering how you think about the opportunity going forward? are you looking to add more new builds on side? or are you looking to also how do you balance that with like maybe looking at secondhand vessels or thinking about repaying debt or increasing the dividend or maybe even share repurchases?
bing chen -- president & chief executive officer
thanks very much for the question. as we've mentioned before, we don't sort of specifically focus on either newbuild or second hand. it's sort of every opportunity that comes in the market driven by our customers, we'll have a look at. there's still plenty of opportunities in the market. so even after this growth period that we've been through, it's not that there's a now a shortage. but as you can imagine, newbuild starts to get more expensive as things heat up, and sometimes secondhand do become more attractive. but we're a bit agnostic as to which way we go. it really just depends on the deal, that's present in the market at that time. so it's not like we sort of strategically position ourselves to do one or the other.
unidentified participant
all right. and also, its interest in discussing in the context of your overall fleet renewal strategy in both prospects. how do you guys think about maybe selling vessels in the future or maybe some of your older or smaller tonnage? and would you consider selling to strength in the current market?
bing chen -- president & chief executive officer
yes. it's a great question. obviously, vessel prices are increasing in the current market, but also the contract rates. and i think you're well aware that we don't really focus on short-term contract markets. so we are not really players in the short-term peak spot rates that you see. and ideally, we will just do the math, either calculate the vessel values and then look at our cash flows associated with contracting or chartering out the vessels. obviously, the other important element to this is we've got a number of very strategic important customers. so first priority really is servicing their demands, and if they require tonnage and we can get the right price that meet our economics, and that's what we will do. however, it is a good time to sell as well. so it is a good opportunity to recycle capital for us. so it's basically just down to the good old discounted cash flow calculation overlaid with an appreciation for our customers' demands.
unidentified participant
okay. and just one final question. so perception about apr. it seems like you guys are really positioning the business for a pivot to broader opportunities with the energy space. i mean, do you guys envision the potential to grow that business aggressively like you've done on the seaspan side?
bing chen -- president & chief executive officer
yes, we would hope to. i think our chairman made it clear a little while ago about our aspirations that we had for apr and really what we plan to do there is to leverage the capabilities in seaspan. so if you think of some of the core attributes of seaspan, which is very infrastructure-like, very long-term stable cash flow-orientated. that's where we want to start to pivot the energy platform too, away from the very short-term special situations market. that being said, there's good money in the short-term special situation market as well. and we've been doing quite a bit of work over the last year to prepare the business to move forward. the mexicali deal that was recently announced, i think it's easy for people to assume that, that's just a renewal of an existing agreement. but it was far from that. it was a heavily competed, negotiated totally restructured package from what we had worked on previously. so that was quite an achievement to get that through.
and there's also a growing developing pipeline internationally, that we're starting to work on. so it's not that the segment that we're in at the moment is not competitive and delivering value. it's just that longer term, we would like to build in longer-term stable cash flows with top-quality credit on the other side.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of randy giveans with jefferies. your line is open.
randy giveans -- jefferies -- analyst
how are you, gentleman? how it's going?
bing chen -- president & chief executive officer
good. thanks, randy. how are you?
randy giveans -- jefferies -- analyst
great. doing good. so yes, as a result of all these kind of newbuilding orders, you mentioned you have $4.7 billion in capex in the coming years. so i guess, how much debt do you plan on adding against these vessels? and then for the remaining equity portion with your common shares trading at a 3.5% yield, is common equity, the most likely way to finance the remainder?
graham talbot -- chief financial officer
so at the moment, the majority of those newbuilds will be funded by debt. and the portfolio of those debt packages has ltv, i'd say, between 75%, up to 100%, depending on which route we take with them. so that would sort of been a bulk. but that being said, there is capital commitments out beforehand, and that is being funded through equity. and as we said, we had over $800 million in cash at the end of the quarter, and we will plan further raises. at this stage, we're looking at the equity side, but it's really a matter of getting the house in order on the liquidity side, and then we'll work more focused around building the correct overall capital structure. as we mentioned, randy, we're sort of still very focused on delivering on our investment-grade credit rating. and to that end, we are planning to sort of get our first public corporate rating probably around q3 this year. and then following that, we'll sort of start putting the pieces of the puzzle together, to get us through to investment-grade probably over the next year or 2.
so there's quite a few moving parts. and as you mentioned, we should have most of the financing concluded around these vessels by the end of q3 and a significant component by the end of q2. so it's sort of only 1.5 months away.
randy giveans -- jefferies -- analyst
got it. okay. so and then i guess, second question, unlike a lot of your peers, you don't disclose the time charters, durations, rates for your smaller vessels. so with that, can you maybe provide some color on the current average charter durations and rates for your 2,500 to 5,000 teu vessels? and i guess any kind of coming up in the near term? and what kind of charter durations are you looking at for those?
peter curtis -- chief commercial officer
yes, it's peter here. that's a good question. we actually have various situations. generally speaking, we address our roll-offs along the lines of graham has been mentioned, the strategic requirements of our customers. what you see in the market today is an ability to access longer-term durations against this high demand for tonnage. and that's exactly what we're doing. nonetheless, dealing with our customers day in, day out, we're achieving multiyear charter periods.
bing chen -- president & chief executive officer
yes. just -- this is bing. just to add what peter is saying that specifically, for example, for 4,250, currently, what we've been signing is between three to five years. at five years at the rate about $27,000 per day. so this is what the rates we've been signing and also the duration. one of the questions you might ask is that, ok, you might probably haven't seen a huge spike in the q1 revenue in consideration of the current market rate. but really, what we have been -- our approach has been really taking a long-term approach in the sense that if you compare a 5-year $27,000 per day the contract versus a two year or three year, $30,000 or $32,000 per day. you will see a short-term -- will see a short-term spike on the revenue. but after one or two years, your vessel will be for uncertainty versus what we have taken is for a longer period of time. so we are actually seeing the next three, four, five years a very stable cash flow. and also on a total cash flow basis, for example, if looking at 4,250 on $27,000 a day, you get close to $40 million of contracted cash flow. so overall, i think for us, we're taking the current benefit over a stable, sustainable period of time, that is also consistent with our long-term cash -- long-term contract business model.
graham talbot -- chief financial officer
and if i could just add to relevance for q1, we actually haven't had any roll-offs in q1 in recharters.
randy giveans -- jefferies -- analyst
okay. that leads to my final question here. just in terms of those 34 or so, let's call it, 4,000 or 5,000 teu vessels you have, do you have any rolling off in 2021? and so how many?
bing chen -- president & chief executive officer
yes. just for 2021 for the 4,250, we have six of them. we also have four 2,500. these are the vessels that's going to be rolled out in q3 and q4. the reason right now, we have these vessels has not been fixed for long term is not really, as you can imagine, it's not because that we cannot fix it. rather right now for the same vessel, we have been receiving multiple requests from the customers. so, therefore, what we're trying to do is try to use in the limited number of supply to find an optimal solution where we can satisfy different customers. so that's what we are still holding on at this moment. for 2022 and 2023, as we said, our fleet on any given time is roughly between 10% to 20% of the vessels on the spot, in other words, to redelivery. for the 2022, we have just shy of 30 vessels, of which that currently, we are in active discussions with our customers in discussion about the extension of those vessels. we anticipate to probably conclude them toward the second half of the year. and in 2023, we only have about 22 vessels for redelivery. and these are the vessels, again, i think we probably expect to have conversations with our customers toward the second half of the year because it's far down the road. but alternatively, for the 2023 redeliveries, we are also currently using those as part of our new creative service offerings, which company that we are in discussions with our customers, which will be different from our conventionally one-on-one vessel offering. so this is something that gives you an overview of what our roll off in the next three years.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of with omar nokta with clarkson. your line is open.
omar nokta -- clarkson -- analyst
just a follow-up -- just sort of a follow-up to the previous discussion. and you touched on this a little bit in your earlier comments. i wanted to ask sort of about the market in your latest dialogue with liners. obviously, your container demand has been very strong. liners are seeing record freight rates. and you've seen the response of basically chartering or outright buying any available ships and driving rates higher. and clearly, we've also seen a bunch of newbuilding orders all against long-term charters to the most part. given how things are now, have you noticed any shift and how in -- are your customers are thinking about thing? do we feel more comfortable with the supply situation that's currently there and on the com? or is there still a lot more discussions and a lot more opportunities on the newbuilding front?
bing chen -- president & chief executive officer
omar, this is bing. our customers liners today, in general, throughout, i believe, they're rather disciplined. today, if you're looking at all the newbuilds that we're talking about still, these are the segments that it's relatively new. it's very versatile. and i think in terms of total amount of the newbuilds today still in terms of what we have been. in terms of the supply side over the past maybe three or four years, this is the amount that still is reasonable. so fundamentally, we see that from the demand side is very still disciplined. on the supply side, today, we're probably close to 15% to 18% of the total market level volume. but this 18% is still -- is a reasonable amount roles to compensate some of those historically low built over the past three, four years. and right now, as the slots and also the price goes up, and i think the market itself in a way that also, i think that provides the kind of, i would say, the barrier.
and also in this time around, which you have seen is different from the past. is that in -- as you correctly pointed out, it's very few speculative orders. rather, all these new builds are backed by either the liner themselves or by the owners that, like ourselves, with the long-term charter that attached to it. so overall, i believe that the supply side is still rather, i would say, healthy.
omar nokta -- clarkson -- analyst
bing, yes, that's certainly. i agree with that. and i wonder if you maybe just sort of follow-up. you mentioned the steel price is rising. you started ordering in december. and maybe is there any color you can give on how return profiles have maybe shifted over the past, say, four or five months? obviously, the way you guys do your business as i see more project specific. and so maybe the cost of construction maybe isn't that significant to you. but maybe in general, in terms of the return profile, have you noticed anything on that front moving higher, lower versus maybe five ways since december?
bing chen -- president & chief executive officer
yes. for us, the return profile has always consistent. as we said, we are very disciplined, whether it's a new or the second hand, we always make sure that quantitatively and qualitatively, the return that meets our investment criteria. so for us, actually, we see the return so slightly improved. in terms of the overall market today, you can see that i said it earlier, as the price today versus the price in december, of course, there has been increased quite materially in the sense that the raw material, particularly for steels, has increased and others, the price has increased. and also the scarcity of the slots. because right now, you're talking about the slots, it's mostly toward the third or fourth quarter of 2024 to 2025. so therefore, with the increase of the commodity raw material cost as well as the further down to the delivery slot into two to three, four years from now, at that return to become less and less attractive. so that's what i think that's the current market.
omar nokta -- clarkson -- analyst
that's very, very helpful. one final one. graham, you highlight the financing of the 13 newbuild in the second quarter. and basically, the remaining 24 coming up in the third quarter, a pretty quick turnaround, i would say. i think you touched on this, but do you mind just expanding maybe just a little bit on the financing that you're looking at? what does it look like in terms of ltv? and then maybe how the repayment profiles look? and any color you can give on how those financings would be helpful?
graham talbot -- chief financial officer
sure. sure. i know there's -- so there's a number of different financing structures we're using. and some of the, i would say, the sort of more competitive ones take a little bit longer to get in place, and that's sort of the ones we're targeting with q3 and they involve eca financing, which obviously comes with a sort of improved tenor and cost that takes a little bit longer administratively to get all of that in place. so that's sort of a big chunk of what comes in q3. the balance is primarily with chinese leasing companies as a portfolio of them that we've worked with. and normally, by the time the team sort of placed a shipbuilding contract and a charter contract, they're already sitting on multiple term sheets to consider. and so really, it's a matter of considering this whole portfolio of opportunities, we've got to finance and what's the best way to do it. now, all of the options that we're looking at include predelivery financing. so as you're well aware, there's a number of tranches payments that get made prior to actually taking delivery of the vessel. they vary a little bit, but normally four lots at 10%, sometimes three lots of 10%. they're all financed through these packages. some of them actually pay it out on delivery, so then they sort of reverse and allocate the full amount to it.
so that's the sort of portfolio we're working with. and we're looking in and announcing several of those in the near term. they're all very competitive with good tenor. there's a lot of competition in that market, which is great. and we've got very good relationships with the various banks and institutions that we're dealing with the so i'm pretty comfortable that we'll get all of that in place. i think the other thing i'd point out, which is of interest to people, is sort of the capital spend profile related to the new builds. we'll be filing our 6-k on thursday, and you're seeing there, there's a more detailed breakdown of the capital spend over '21, two, three, four in relation to the newbuild program.
operator
our next question comes from the line of sanjay ramaswamy with bank of america.
sanjay ramaswamy -- bank of america -- analyst
great. maybe just shifting to apr. just thoughts on when we can kind of expect that utilization to come back into the mid-70s. you talked about, i think, an ideal contract versus fun marketing, obviously, the shift toward a more contracted portfolio similar to seaspan. but maybe when do we expect that ligation start increasing in the low 60s and kind of what's built into the current outlook for 2021?
graham talbot -- chief financial officer
thanks. i think it's fair to say that mexicali, that will pick up a bit in terms of utilization. based on the allocation of 10 units to mexicali, that means 26 out of our 30 turbines will be deployed. and in terms of the diesel generation units, i think we're running with about 40, 48 or so idle units there out of a fleet of 439. but as we've articulated previously, we're sort of progressively going to be winding down our exposure to the diesel generation market because it's not a strategic direction that we want to plan on. so, i think the main priority at the moment is getting all of those turbines deployed. and currently post-mexicali, we've only got four left idle. and the team is working hard on to deployment of those at the moment. but i think the obvious thing is that this is a very lumpy market. so you get jumps in short-term contracts.
and unfortunately -- fortunately, we participate in sort of special situation-type opportunities, and they're very hard to plan. but they also come with a premium as well. so i think that's what we want to sort of maybe shipped our reliance away from that a little bit and to provide a stronger base, which we can use to amortize our cost over and then sort of also to take advantage of those special situations when they arise.
bing chen -- president & chief executive officer
sure. just to add what the graham just said, we do expect the utilization to gradually improve as coming from now on for this year. so i would think that this year, our utilization should be equal or better than last year.
sanjay ramaswamy -- bank of america -- analyst
okay. great. and maybe just to ask it that just with the ze group jv. is there any -- i mean not a couple of months you announced that jv. can you give any color on some of the opportunities that have started to emerge from that jv? and potentially, i think you mentioned natural gas opportunities at the last call. so maybe away from some contention or maritime and energy into new verticals. but is there any kind of color that you have on some of the initial opportunities there?
bing chen -- president & chief executive officer
yes. as we shared last time during the investor day, our jv partner is a conglomerate, they primarily engaged in three main activities. one is the power generation, and the second one is lng, the third one is the order peripheral environmental transportation finance service, that's supporting the two core businesses. the opportunity that we have with them is in two areas in terms of the jv. one is in the maritime, maritime because they have the shipping activities. and specifically, they also have the environmental technology in areas such as the scrubber. so those are the areas that both from the general shipping as well as from the emission perspective, they have the technology and manufacturing capabilities that we can join force and then get the synergy and expand the revenue sources.
on the energy side, i think that is an area that we can also note [phonetic] and particularly as we're looking at expanding our offerings to larger and the long-term power projects where ze has a credible large power generating utilities companies. i think they have the resources, they have the track record. they also have the expertise to work with us in developing the future long-term large power projects. and also combining, that's -- the third stream is the combining maritime and also power, as you might know, that in terms of the power space that we can develop the marine mobile power solutions. this is something that our ze group that they have already in the process of developing those offerings. and that is something that we can work with them, contributing our expertise and altogether, we can go-to-market and provide us.
so overall, that we're looking at is suppose that from energy from maritime and also combined and energy and maritime solutions. that's the three areas we see that jv will be able to provide those incremental growth opportunities.
sanjay ramaswamy -- bank of america -- analyst
sure. that's very helpful. and just to cap to that, is there any kind of time frame that we can look to see in terms of top line incremental growth from this jv? throughout two-half 2021, 2022 story?
bing chen -- president & chief executive officer
yes. as we -- as you know, that we announced the jv formation about 1.5 months ago. we need to go through a process formally establish a legal entity in china special trading zone, that will take a couple of months to create that legal entity to obtain the license -- the business license. and subsequent to that, it will take approximately 30 days to 60 days to get the clearance from the chinese antitrust clearance. so, i think from a timing perspective, we probably should anticipate this business to be formally in operation by the beginning of third quarter. and in the meantime, even though without the formally establishment of the joint venture, i think we and them are informally looking at, for example, the power project as well as some environmental projects together. so this is running on a parallel basis.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of liam burke with b. riley. your line is open.
liam burke -- b. riley -- analyst
yes. bing, graham discussed in his prepared comments about how the pipeline of potential acquisitions of fleet assets is pretty extensive. with higher asset prices and the charters associated with potential new builds, has that affected understanding your return discipline? has that affected the size of the pipeline as you look at potential future projects?
bing chen -- president & chief executive officer
for us, so far, we have not seen a major impact because even though there might be the increase on the ship prices. but for us, it's always looking at the same return or better return. so therefore, that has to be reflected in terms of the charter rate. so overall, i think so far, the market or our clients also understand the market condition. and i think what we actually was able to and has been able to do is to be able to find the most effective net, i would say, cost-efficient way to develop those projects. and that's what our value added. and this is why also we were able to have the ability to develop a 37 newbuild projects. so i think our customer really is looking to us to be able to provide that kind of solution by working with multiple stakeholders within that process. and going forward, and i think we'll continue to play that role. and i believe that from a return perspective, we always be -- stay very disciplined, whether it's a new build or secondhand.
liam burke -- b. riley -- analyst
fair enough. and if i look at -- i mean, in that situation, you can continue to make acquisitions based on your flexibility of funding plus charters and the cost of the asset. operationally, do you have a sense as to how -- what the size of the fleet would be? or do you just take a look at adding these higher return assets and then potentially divesting yourselves of the lower return assets?
bing chen -- president & chief executive officer
yes. operationally, i think we are very extremely proud of our team and being able to manage and operate such a large fleet in the current extremely logistically restricted environment. and i think our team, torsten and his team, have done an excellent job. we have a total of about close to 5,000 seafarers working 14,724. so i think they've done a great job. in terms of the asset, i think what you're talking about the lower return, high-return on assets. this is something actually is part of our residual risk management function, which our team are managed on a daily basis. we have a team called asset integrity. they're basically looking at from a technical perspective in terms looking at what are the best composition of our fleet. we also have the investment committee, which is looking at from a financial perspective, whether we invest or we divest the assets. as graham has mentioned earlier, for us, we're looking at each every asset, to answer the question, is whether we should operate or whether we should divest. and ultimately, is the cash flow. so far, maybe you have another question in saying, why we haven't seen you guys selling the assets? the reason to be very simple is because that today, when we're looking at our ability to be able to generating the future cash flow, the discounted cash flow.
the total amount of cash flow versus the market sale price, we have not seen those opportunities where the sell prices is greater or equal to the free cash flow that we can generate from the operating of these vessels as i use the example just now for the 4,250 today. 4,250 today, as i mentioned earlier, for $27,000 a day for five years, taking out opex of somewhere around $5,500 per day. so we still have a net cash flow of roughly about $30 million at the end of five years, assuming i scrap the vessel at the end of five years, that the scrap value will be somewhere between $5 million to $7 million. and today, probably more like $7 million with the high steel price. so for 4,250 with a -- by then, it will be 25, 26 years old with a net cash flow of somewhere around $30 million -- $36 million -- $35 million, $36 million. today, the 4,250 in the market that people want to buy somewhere around $28 million to $30 million. so that's why we think we will continue to evaluate on a real-time basis. at the same time, i think our strength of operating the assets and get the maximum utilization and also get the preferred charter terms from our customers, and that's the preferred way to go.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of michael goldie with bmo capital markets. your line is open.
michael goldie -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
at present about 15% of the containership fleet expires in a given year. with the longer contracts of these newbuilds, any potential contract renegotiations, where do you think you can get that annual exploration number down to?
peter curtis -- chief commercial officer
yes. peter here. so i think you're asking where on average, can we get our roll-offs down to on an annual basis, if i understand you, michael. yes. so that's really a function of the existing charters and when they come off. so what we do look at, of course, is what our waterfall in the future looks like. so whenever we go into charter negotiations, we have that in mind. of course, when we do newbuilds, we like to have long-term charters. those vessels come off anywhere from 2 to 3, 3.5 years from the date of signing a contract. so that takes care of that. so really, the flip side of the coin is the near-term of, which i think bing has described quite adequately, we certainly engage in a strategic manner with our customers. he mentioned the a novel approach to it that we're working on right now, which covers both ends of the spectrum and ultimately achieves longer-term charters.
so, i'll give you some illustration. so last year, 2021 looked like, say, 25 vessels. we're down to about 11 now. and we're in active discussions on how to take care of those 11 then put them away for extended periods of time. we're already in discussions around 2022, how to box up some of those 30 vessels for multiyear contracts. and 2023, that's a little bit of way away, as you heard earlier. along in the short is, our approach to our customers is on a full spectrum-offering basis. and we discuss with them their needs well into the future. and try and lock in tonnage, be it, new build, be it acquisition from the existing markets or the tonnage that we have at hand.
bing chen -- president & chief executive officer
just to add -- just to add to what peter said. in general, not only in the current good market, we, as a general approach, is that we always proactively working with our liner customers, looking at what their network planning needs are, and then we're working on a very proactive basis. and so, therefore, in terms of these roll-offs, currently, even for 2022, the reason that we still have about close to 30 vessels is because that we are still in a similar situation right now as we in 2021. we have multiple customers looking for the same vessels. and that is why we are also in the process of working on the optimal solutions where we can satisfy all our customers with an optimal solution. but in any given time, our utilization, as we said since the beginning of the company until today, we have always maintained an over 98% utilization over the past 18, 20 years. if you're looking at last year, looking at this year, this quarter, we have 99% -- over 99.2%. last year, we have also over 98%. so the utilization rate, hopefully, will be a good reference point to show that our ability of being able to constantly redeploy and constantly generating growth.
so, that's -- these are the two things, i think it's really the differentiation side factor of seaspan's business model because we are always able to deploy these assets, and we always find a way whether current good market or in -- even in 2020, if you may recall, in the height of april and is a year ago, this time, when china was locked down, we were able to deliver four second vessels to our customers. that was a year ago. so this is something that we are -- this is something that we have been able to deliver the kind of service to our customer and build that kind of trust and that's how we're going to continue to manage our business going forward.
michael goldie -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
perfect. and just one more. given all of the new build orders, where do you think your market share is today? has it increased as a result of all these new contracts?
bing chen -- president & chief executive officer
yes, yes. if you're looking at our just purely on an absolute basis, by these new deliveries come into the operations, we will reach the capacity of 1.7 million teu. and if you're looking at in an independent owner-operator space today, we are far, i think, in the lead than our peers. so i think it definitely, for sure, as the tonnage provider today in the space that in terms of that market, we definitely are far apart from our peers. the other part is that more importantly is looking at the -- not only the fleet size, but also looking at the fleet composition. i think it's very important that this growth that it really represents the best asset quality. they are the largest. they are a large vessel. they are the most fuel-efficient vessel. and they are also versatile vessels. so these are the best-in-class assets. today, we are the only one in our owner-operator space that has this composition of the best-in-class assets. and that is, i think, is equally more important than the size.
operator
thank you. our final question comes from the line of ben nolan from stifel. your line is open.
ben nolan -- stifel -- analyst
so i had a couple left here that i wanted to work in. i'm a little curious about sort of the creative chartering strategy that you discussed a little bit. is part of that, your ability to sort of offer existing assets to clients and maybe pair that with also doing newbuilds with them? for instance, giving them access to your vessels, maybe even at a little bit of a discounted rate for the current hyper-inflated spot market. but in exchange, you're also sort of able to do newbuilds or something like that, kind of levered your market position with your financial strength?
bing chen -- president & chief executive officer
thank you, ben. what i mean by creative chartering in the newbuild case, as you just highlighted, is that really, today, if you're looking at liners, i think they all financially, i think, are very strong and they have abundant cash flows. so theoretically, today, liners could go directly to the yards, which are today also know who liners are. but the reason they're going to us because, as you know, that doing a newbuild is that is a very, i would say, comprehensive, a very complicated process that involves the design, the understanding, the negotiation with the shipyard, understanding that what their specific requirements, the slot availability and then, etcetera. so the -- for seaspan really is the, what i call a super connector where we can put ourselves being in the middle and execute in a very effective and efficient way to deliver the best solution, whether it's slot, whether it's a design, whether it's a decision on the fuel selections and the technical part as well as financing and operations. so that is why the -- we are always able to provide that kind of a solution.
sometimes the liner customer wants to get a better idea in terms of what are the fuel selections. sometimes, they want to have an early slot. sometimes, they want to have a different type of a design that they may want to modify also the times. so this is something where our team have the multi-disciplined capabilities and expertise. and this is something that we have always referred to in our discussion, saying that we have the integrated platform. the integrated platform is multi-disciplined for a case like a newbuild. that it is a very complicated process. and my colleague, peter, he will be able to elaborate a lot more on the complexity of this kind of project. and that's how we will be able to always to be able to find ways to deliver the kind of solutions to address the needs of our customers, whether it's technical, whether it's construction, whether it's an environment, whether it's operation or financing.
ben nolan -- stifel -- analyst
right. okay. so i guess what you're saying is that you're not sort of leveraging your existing portfolio to help win newbuilds? you're able to do that sort of independent plan set?
bing chen -- president & chief executive officer
correct. largely, yes. largely, that is correct.
ben nolan -- stifel -- analyst
okay. now maybe if i could shift a little bit to the macro. obviously, you guys and others have ordered a lot of ships since the first of the year. that as have been talked about almost entirely on long-term contracts, and the liners are obviously very hungry for tonnage. is there a point at which you start to look at in the future, let's say, the 2023 order book or something like that and say, boy, that we might be headed for a little bit of a rough patch here. is there any sort of future concern as to just the sort of normal troughs of markets like this as a function of supply? or are we not yet at that stage in your view?
bing chen -- president & chief executive officer
yes. fundamentally, we believe we are still of the opinion that the fundamentals of supply and demand is still healthy. if we're looking at what the recent new build, yes, the absolute number might be higher. but if you're looking at over a period of time, over the past three years or four years and also looking at the next three or four years, on an annual basis, the new tonnage that's been released versus the replacement of the tonnage. i think still that is, in general, it's balanced. plus on the demand side, i think the liners today are still, as i said earlier, they are rather disciplined. and if you're looking at the global trade, i think today, yes, on one hand, for sure, the covid has made the situation, i think, more severe. but just taking out the covid, i believe, the overall the demand and overall growth on the global trade according to the industry estimate, is about 5%, 4%, 3%, 2% increase the next three, four years. so that you will have a continued increase of the global trade. at the same time, the supply side, this is reasonably, i think, it's a reasonable growth. and let's also remember that for the past three years or four years, we had historically low order book. and also in the last few years until this year, i think that in terms of the scrap, has been almost immaterial. so i think in 2013, '14, to 2023, 2024, yes, there might be more tonnages coming in. but i think the impact will be the cascading of those older vessels, the smaller vessels.
and for seaspan, really, for all those newbuilds, we have the long-term contract ranging from 5 to 18 years. so really, for us, this is actually -- we are expecting -- we're looking forward to the future because that's where our growth is going to come to the reality. and to our existing fleet, we -- as we said, at any given time, our spot or redelivery is somewhere between 10% to 15%. if we're looking at right now from '22, '23, i believe that our number and also teu, number of vessels and the total amount of teu is very manageable in a month. and i think for 2022, we should be able to, i think, to get most of them fit by the end of the second half of the year for 2023 and on what we actually -- as i mentioned earlier, in active discussions with our customer, looking at even having different ways of providing the services or tonnages to better service our customer needs with more flexibility. at the same time, allows us to be able to have the kind of flexibility as well to optimize the fleet and servicing all our customers without significantly increasing the actual number of vessels. so this is something that we are looking forward to into the -- in the coming years as the market continues to evolve.
ben nolan -- stifel -- analyst
okay. and then lastly for me, if i could, just to kind of balance sheet type question. graham, as you -- and i realize that there's still a lot of moving parts here. but based on sort of where we sit today, do you have any thoughts as to sort of what maybe the annual amortization profile of the debt should look like going forward? and then maybe sort of connected to that a little bit. you talked about getting a corporate investment-grade credit rating later this year. when you think about that, is that like a typical s&p and moody's? or are you still contemplating that being sort of what's accrual rating?
graham talbot -- chief financial officer
yes. so the call rating was something that was done in relation to the portfolio lending program initially that was put in place last year. the work that we're doing currently and have been for a little while now is with moody's, and we've also commenced engagements with s&p and fitch. so, when i refer to -- just to be clear, not investment-grade by q3 this year, i wish, but the first step is obtaining our formal corporate rating from one of those institutions that we've just been discussing. and that will then position us with the rating in the market that everyone knows and understands. and then we're on a journey from there to push that up to investment grade. this will take a period of time. it could be one to two years. we don't have a set time line for it. we've got to balance up, as you say, using components to get there. but all i can say is it's very top of mind, and we're very committed.
obviously, through the newbuild program, we start to push up on the gearing a bit. and we're very conscious of that, and we sort of model out our cash flows through out and past the newbuild program to make sure that got all of that adequate plans and. and of course, it then comes off very quickly after that, once you start to get the cash flows coming in from these new vessels entering into the fleet entering service. so there is a tightening; there's no hiding that. i think everyone's well aware of it. but we've got plenty of time to work on optimizing that, and it's not a concern for us at the moment. like i said, our cash forecasting is comfortable within all of our covenants and limits that we set. and so it's really a matter of how can we work it harder to optimize it during that time frame further.
ben nolan -- stifel -- analyst
right. and any idea what we should be thinking about from a debt amortization annual debt amortization profile print?
graham talbot -- chief financial officer
yes. i'm not sure if i have an admit number i could give you, ben. i can -- each package is slightly different, it would be the 25% and 10% amortization on different packages. i'm happy to get back to you with an answer.
operator
thank you. i'm showing no further questions in the queue. i would now like to turn the call back over to management for closing remarks.

",0.99985,1.0,2021-05-04 08:30:00,"prepared remarks:
operator
welcome to the atlas corp. first quarter 2021 earnings conference call. i would like to remind everyone that this conference call is being recorded today, may 4, 2021.
i would now like to turn the call over to robert weiner, head of investor relations at atlas corp.
robert weiner -- head of investor relations
thank you, and good morning, everyone. thank you for joining us today to discuss atlas corp.'s first quarter 2021 earnings. we issued our earnings release last meeting after market close. we will refer to our quarterly earnings release accompany earnings presentation and supplemental documents today in this conference, which all can be found on the investor relations tab on our website, www.atlascorporation.com.
i would like to remind you that our discussion today contains forward-looking statements, and i'd like to draw your attention to the disclaimer on page 2 in the accompanying earnings presentation. with this quarterly report, you will note that we continue to report non-gaap measures, which we believe provide investors a clearer understanding of the performance of our business system. the first quarter earnings release contains supplemental financial tables and information pertaining to our first quarter earnings report and includes definition of non-gaap financial measures and reconciliations of guts non-gaap measures to the most closely comparable u.s. gaap measures. these definitions may also be found in the appendices at the back of the earnings presentation, which we will refer to in our call discussion, which can be found on our website. in addition, we have provided historical financial information through 2018 and which are also available in the q1 supplemental workflow on our website.
please turn to slide number 3. on the call with me today are bing chen, president and chief executive officer of atlas corp; graham talbot, chief financial officer of atlas corp. joining us on the call during the q&a session are chief commercial officer; peter curtis; and csp's chief operational officer, torsten pedersen. we will open up to a question-and-answer session following our formal remarks.
please turn to slide number 4. i am pleased to now turn the call over to atlas corp.'s ceo, bing chen.
bing chen -- president & chief executive officer
thank you, rob, and good morning, everyone. thank you for joining our call. please turn to slide 5. i'm pleased to report a strong q1 financial performance, which was directly in line with our expectations. we are on track to achieve our 2021 annual financial guidance. and our performance affirms our long-term focus on quality growth and differentiated investment attributes.
let me reiterate that our business is not subject to short-term market swings like many others. we are highly dependable and consistent since our fully integrated platform is built on long-term contracted cash flow, backed by global ed liners. in the first quarter of 2021, atlas achieved revenue growth of 20.8% to $372.6 million; adjusted ebitda growth of 21.1% to $237.9 million; ffo growth of 27.6% to $159.2 million; and ffo per share growth of 13.2% to $0.60 per share. and we recently paid our 63rd consecutive quarterly dividend. i'm proud of our team as these results reiterate our continued resiliency, operational excellence and performance for the remainder of 2021 and beyond. we stand ready and focused on facing any challenges ahead.
please turn to slide 6. in just five short months, seaspan added 37 new builds and four secondhand vessels. through our total investment of $4.7 billion, we have added a gross contracted cash flow of $7 billion. and since this quarter alone, we achieved 47% growth of our fully delivered fleet on a teu basis, adding 536,000 teus. this sets a record for seaspan and perhaps within the industry. this historical growth has been made possible due to our focus on the following key aspects of our business. first, we always have a good understanding of the underlying market situation and anticipate a few steps ahead. second, our customers' needs always come first. third, we are constantly creating opportunities versus participating in auctions. fourth, our relentless focus on building our five key competencies. and this we have a world-class team of highly experienced professionals who are ready to execute at all times. for the same reasons, we have able to successfully complete 15 secondhand acquisitions in 2019 and 2020 and adjusted to our record new build program. this quality growth is important as it facilitates great scalability, reliability and flexibility to create win-win outcomes with our customers through all market cycles. especially with these new builds, we have gained deeper trust from our customers through our ability to assist with vessel design, shipyard negotiations, construction, financing, chartering and operations. this is a great example of the fully integrated platform, as we always talked about.
as the table shows, we have significantly strengthened our fleet in the following segments. 9, 12,000 teu newbuilds; 2, 24,000 teu newbuilds, which are our first ultra-large vessels and also the first for owner-operator vessels for this segment; 26, 15,000 teu newbuilds in the strategic category, featuring 10 dual fuel lng newbuilds, along four secondhand acquisitions of 2, 15,000 teu and 2, 8,500 teu vessels.
please turn to slide 7. the past three years has been transformational, and this has continued in q1 2021. here, we highlight the dramatic change since the start of 2021. we have upgraded our offering with significant additions to the 15,000 to 16,000 teu segments as well as for the 24,000 teu segment. today, 79% of our fleet on a teu basis is positioned within the strategic 10,000 teu and greater segments which are expected to be the workhorse vessels in the coming decades for global trade. we are very pleased to have evolved our fleet into such a comprehensive, diversified and versatile portfolio to meet our customers' needs and truly lead the industry.
please turn to slide 8. we have also classified our customer mix when i first joined, costco chartered approximately 40% of our fleet on a teu base. today, no single customer charters more than 20%. our customers are eight out of the top 10 liners, with our top three customers representing 54% of the revenue at the end of q1 2021 compared to 75% at the end of 2017. this is clearly a differentiation as we are growing in tandem with our customers while fulfilling their needs through creating win-win outcomes. we continue to be well positioned for quality growth through our deeper and broader partnerships with each customer.
please turn to slide 9. our record fleet growth, free optimization and customer base diversification drives a third important distinction of our resilient and differentiated platform. the growth of our gross contracted cash flows. since the start of 2021, we have grown gross contracted cash flow by 102% to $12.1 billion. these are long term, highly visible cash flows secured by customer demand. this results in higher quality cash flows, longer lease durations and increased resiliency of our business through all economic cycles. our deep and creative customer partnerships, best-in-class execution and solid financial strength makes atlas the reliable solution provider of choice. this slide clearly shows our record progress achieved in q1. as i mentioned, gross contracted cash flow increased by 102% to $12.1 billion. fully delivered fleet grew by 27%, adding 36 vessels. we increased teu by 47% to 1.7 million teu. average fleet age decreased by 2.1 years to 5.2 years. and the remaining lease term increased to 6.8 years from 4.3 years. this high-performance execution enables us to deliver consistent and sustainable value creation to our shareholders.
please turn to slide 10. esg is important and timely. as responsible corporate citizens, it is important to lead the industry's development of esg initiatives. our teams are highly committed to leading our industries through operational excellence, high business standards, ethics and principles. we look forward to issuing our inaugural sustainability report at the end of q2. also, we are proud of our recent strategic partnership with the maersk mc-kinney moller center for zero carbon shipping and become a signatory of the un global compact. our strong commitment to esg is also evidenced by our long history in innovative sailor ship designs and also adding 10,000 to 15,000 teu dual fuel lng results. finally, we see the increasing for esg as an important requirement for our customers, lenders and investors. our teams have made great progress through linking our capital structure with sustainability measures such as our recent sustainability-linked loan and bond financing.
please turn to slide 11. conclude my formal remarks by providing an update on our 2021 priorities, which we outlined at our investor day. first, quality growth and disciplined capital allocation. this has been clearly demonstrated by our team during the quarter. for seaspan, we have increased our total teu by 47% to grow our gross contracted cash flow to $12.1 billion. for apr energy, we are proud to successfully secure mexicali fast power contracts, which now marks our third year in a row of providing power to the region. apr's contracted service are rated at 330 megawatts through 10 gas turbines compared to last year's contract for eight turbines rated at 265 megawatts. this increases our penetration in an important market with significant future growth opportunities. second, we are further enhancing our multi-platform business. for seaspan, we continue to optimize our fleet, while diversifying our customer mix. for apr, we continue to exit the diesel generation market through a measured and prudent approach. a big part of increasing our competitiveness is the quality of our people. and in this regard, we recently had and experienced cfo, lord, to further strengthen the apr team.
our jv, with the ze energy group, will provide unique and innovative growth opportunities for both parties. in addition, it will provide further revenue diversification in the maritime and energy sectors, we look forward to providing updates. we also continue to be innovative leaders by continuously optimizing our capital structure and improving our financial position. our financial strength and flexibility for executing opportunities is unmatched and is one of our key competitive differentiators. overall, we have a record start to 2021. our achievements thus far solidifies our exciting future and ability to create sustainable value for our shareholders. i look forward to reporting on our progress in the coming months.
please turn to slide 12, and i will now turn the call over to our cfo, graham talbot.
graham talbot -- chief financial officer
thanks, bing. good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. please turn to slide number 13. q1 2021, the team delivered continued strong performance compared to q1 2020. revenue increased by 20.8% to $372.6 million. adjusted ebitda increased by 21.1% to $237.9 million.
ffo was $159.2 million, which increased by 27.6% over the first quarter in 2020. our first quarter earnings per share was $0.31 per diluted share compared to $0.15 in the first quarter of 2020. seaspan's fleet new capacity grew by 68.9% or by 48 vessels. and asset utilization for q1 2021 was 99.2% and 63.7% at seaspan and apr, respectively. at quarter end, gross contracted cash flows for atlas stand at $12.1 billion. closing liquidity was up 112.7% to $837.5 million. and that was declared and paid its 63rd consecutive dividend.
our performance continues to reflect both the predictability and stability of our returns, coupled with the impact of quality growth in our asset base. this performance differentiates us from our competitors as well as many mid-cap companies in the public market. our operational excellence, creative customer partnerships, quality growth, financial strength, and disciplined capital allocation, that is our five key competencies continue to be highly effective in delivering sustainable value to our shareholders.
please turn to slide number 14. during the first quarter of 2021, we've continued to enhance our capital structure and liquidity. we're constantly working to optimize our cost of capital and position our financial resources to stay nimble and flexible to pursue opportunities. our liquidity stood at $837.5 million at march 31, and we have 31 unencumbered vessels with $1.1 billion in net book value. additionally, we continue to make progress on our objective to achieve an investment-grade credit rating. kroll bond rating has recently placed seaspan on upgrade watch in relation to the current investment-grade rating of bbb- for our portfolio financing program and bb corporate rating. they have noted our diversification of capital sources and continued strong operating and financial performance as key reasons for the improved outlook. you'll see on this slide, the continued progress atlas has made over the past year, effectively managing our liquidity and debt, while at the same time, significantly growing the business. it grew by 48 vessels and improved fleet utilization while deleveraging, as evidenced by our net debt to adjusted ebitda ratio, which improved by one full turn or one times.
please turn to slide number 15. now i'd like to discuss several initiatives that our finance teams have been hard at work on to further strengthen our financial position. for our secured debt capital, we're working on several priorities. firstly, we're working diligently on the financing of our current growth investments. to date, we have secured financing for the four secondhand vessels we acquired, which is approximately $400 million. we expect financings to 13 newbuild vessels will close during quarter 2, which is approximately $1.4 billion. and we're in advanced engagement for financing the remaining 24 new build vessels, which is approximately $2.9 billion, and these are expected to close during q3 of this year. additionally, atlas has been developing a global base of credit and equity investors. on the credit side, we recently issued two unsecured notes in the nordic market. specifically, the first was closed in january for $200 million and was our inaugural nordic issue, a 3-year sustainability-linked unsecured mode of 6.5%. the second, in april for $300 million, as a 5-year sustainability-linked unsecured note at the same 6.5%, so an increase in amount and tenor over our issuance.
as mentioned, we actively manage our balance sheet and liquidity to ensure that we maintain our strength for future growth and through cycle stability. we had ample liquidity at the end of the first quarter, and increased nearly 113% over last year to q1, providing atlas with significant flexibility and strength to deliver operational excellence, fund our growth and meet our commitments to debt and equity holders. we've experienced dramatic increase in both the company's access to capital market opportunities and a broadened scope of capital market solutions available to execute. accordingly, the challenge is not obtaining capital, but obtaining the right capital to meet our objectives.
please turn to slide number 16. on this slide, you'll see our balanced capital structure, illustrating our continued diversification of capital sources. our primary goal is to continue our progress toward achieving investment-grade corporate credit rating. by doing so, we need to actively manage our balance sheet and continuously seek opportunities for improvement. we need to maintain and consistently optimize the global base of diversified capital sources as well as continue to increase our access to the capital markets, while also executing on a wider base and breadth of capital market opportunities. this needs further strengthen our balance sheet while facilitating growth. in other words, ensure strict and prudent capital allocation. finally, we're focused on increasing our maturities to better match the long-term nature of our contracted cash flows. as you would appreciate, this is a process of constant optimization. capital is our natural resource and a key value driver in our business. and as such, needs to be carefully managed.
please turn to slide number 17. i will finish my remarks with details about our recent growth and contracted cash flow. on this slide, we illustrate the power of long-term charters, which provides stability and dependability in our business and is a defining investment attribute of our company. as bing mentioned earlier, we've set a seaspan record, if not an industry record, by adding 41 total vessels in less than five months' time. we're very proud of the high-performance execution of our teams to achieve this milestone. as you see on this slide, we've significantly added to our cash flow profile, increasing visibility of our returns and creating greater dependability in our investment thesis. it's important to note the gross contracted cash flows represented in the slides do not include any future growth. this depicts only what we have under contract today, and we're an active growth-orientated company, and we expect that to continue as we move forward.
in summary, atlas has a very strong financial position, clear avenues to fund growth and considerable access to capital. the container shipping industry is expecting strong operational performance and improving credit profiles, and energy projects are beginning to develop. within the context of these strong improving industry profiles as well as the prospect from improved credit rating at atlas, i'm confident in our ability to continue to deliver quality growth through disciplined capital allocation to drive sustainable and increasing value for our shareholders.

[operator instructions] our first question comes from randy giveans with jefferies.
randy giveans -- jefferies & company, inc. -- analyst
howdy, gentlemen. how it's going?
bing chen -- president and chief executive officer
good morning, randy.
randy giveans -- jefferies & company, inc. -- analyst
good morning. good morning. i guess, couple of questions, starting with those vessels. you chartered out or you extended charters or you signed new charter or you forward fixed 45 vessels during the second quarter. i guess, on average, what is the new duration and maybe rate of these charters?
bing chen -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. randy, i'll try to answer that question. the number of the vessels, as you correctly pointed out, is 45 for the q2 and 58 for the year-to-date. the average duration is about between the three to five years. that is the duration. and the rate is pretty much reflect of the respective -- the cost you have to ask the vessels at the market rate. we actually will disclose those rates in our 6-k. and for example, the 42, 50s, i think if it's on the three years or five years, the rate could be ranging from $28,000 to $34,000 a day. and it's really pretty much reflect of the current spot market rate, taking to consideration of the longer term.
randy giveans -- jefferies & company, inc. -- analyst
got it. okay. yeah, i appreciate that color. it seems like you only have a handful of vessels still to come in 2022. so i'm assuming you'll kind of look to forward fix those before this year ends, is that the strategy?
bing chen -- president and chief executive officer
yes. we have -- to be exact, we have six vessels to be fixed in 2022. we are actually right now evaluating the alternatives as these vessels are highly in demand, and we are evaluating different alternatives to the customer needs. so we will be evaluating as the situation and as the market continue to evolve. but i think at this point really we want to take the different request from the customer and make the final decisions at the later stage.
randy giveans -- jefferies & company, inc. -- analyst
okay, fair. and then second question for me. just looking at your capital structure and capital allocation, you've raised some very attractive debt here, long-term, very low rates, looking at that unsecured debt, 5.5% coupon through 2029 i believe. you still have some more expensive preferreds outstanding. so any thoughts on kind of repurchasing or maybe calling in those higher-priced preferreds, redeeming those and then maybe issuing cheaper ones? and then second part of that question, and it comes to capital allocation. for your dividend, is the plan now to collect the vessels, de-lever and then start looking to increase the common dividend or what is your plan for that?
bing chen -- president and chief executive officer
graham, do you want to comment on the preferred and i'll comment on the dividends?
graham talbot -- chief financial officer
sure. look, i think progressively, of course, we're going to continue to optimize the structure and take out any higher cost debt, and that's going to be an ongoing process. i think at the moment, as you're well aware, our focus is to reduce the cost of capital, simplify the balance sheet, but also to achieve an investment grade. so that sort of comes into the second question around how we allocate capital through the dividends. obviously, it's key that we have to continue to grow the business, that's part of who we are. but at the same time, we need to allocate funds back to the balance sheet to get to investment grade.
so we still got quite a way to go in terms of delivering all that. i think we've made an excellent start over the last couple of years with getting to where we are now. but you rightly pointed out, we've still got some more expensive tranches in there which we can remove over time. and we've now demonstrated that we have good access to deep liquidity and the right markets to do so.
bing chen -- president and chief executive officer
okay. and with regarding to the dividend, the dividend distribution are evaluated by us on a regular basis and determined by our board. we view the current dividend policy to be appropriate. we're constantly evaluating our best use of capital. in addition to, as you mentioned, the increase, the return of capital to our shareholders and where there's -- when that happened is there's no better opportunity to deploy the capital.
as what graham just mentioned that we can have a variety of options to deploy these capital, the quality growth that we have highlighted today is a testament of this management team and this business platform that is able to create value. and we are confident to continue to identify and executing on these capital allocation opportunities. we are always being thoughtful on how we allocate our capital. our key focus is on preserve liquidity and also want to continue to de-lever the debt to facilitate our investment grade goal, as graham just mentioned. at the same time, we also want to be prepared for any investment opportunities. therefore, we're very carefully considering all options.
that being said, we do believe that our share price has been undervalued. we're a long-term-oriented business, as we shared with you today. and believe that as we continue to deliver results, improve the transparency that the market will recognize the value. for us today, the share price has not reflected our business for a variety of reasons. now with graham as our cfo, we have started to better present our business to improve the transparency and better present our business. and the other reason is that we're likely still today being compared with the cyclical and capital incentives -- intensive peers. looking at, for example, the container shipping space today. i don't think that we really have the real comparables to compare.
so as we continue to create long-term value, we are confident that long-term investors will come to that conclusion and come to the fair value of the business. but it is our fiduciary duty to evaluate the options and the tools that typically are available to make sure that we address the fair value of our business in the context of capital allocation. we want to make sure that we will take whatever is necessary to make sure that those options and tools typically that is available for us to make sure that the business is fairly valued. so from our perspective, i think we've got our dividends -- to increase the dividend s at this point, it's not in a game.
randy giveans -- jefferies & company, inc. -- analyst
okay. that's fair. well, thank you so much for the color.
graham talbot -- chief financial officer

our next question comes from omar nokta with clarkson.
omar nokta -- clarksons platou securities -- analyst
thank you. hey guys, good morning.
graham talbot -- chief financial officer
hi, omar.
omar nokta -- clarksons platou securities -- analyst
hi, there. good early morning. thanks for the detail in the supplemental pack, obviously, very helpful and just shows really just how deep your market position really is in the shipping market. and i guess, now from your updated guidance, you've got consistent earnings growth built-in here for the next few years. and with that, you've got a pretty sizable cash flow stream that you can count on. i guess, just wanted to ask, where do you see atlas now investing free cash flow going forward here? do you still see opportunities in the containership space on the newbuilding front? are there any adjacent sectors you're looking at that are of interest or do you focus a bit more, pivot toward apr and on the energy side? any color you can give there?
bing chen -- president and chief executive officer
sure. in container shipping space, as we have demonstrated, i think today as the market leader, we'll continue to see the customer-driven demand for us to provide the support for their business growth, which is why we were able to have this number for the newbuild in the short period of time. pulling forward, of course, i think we continue to see the growth opportunities. of course, we've been very selective to make sure that any of those opportunities is meeting our investment criteria. but at the same time, i think that we see there are other types of growth opportunities, particularly in areas, for example, environmental and also in areas of recycling of the capital, which i think this is an area that we are looking at as the next opportunity for us to support our business needs.
in terms of apr, we acquired the business about a year ago, it's just a little bit over a year ago. this is a business, obviously, when we are acquired, we know what we bought and we know what we intend to transform that business going forward. we have been spending the last year in really realigning the organization and really make sure the business continue to focusing on doing what is the best, which is the short-term, fast-power solutions to our customer.
at the same time, we've also looking at adjacent opportunities within the fast power space. as you know that energy, power value chain is quite long starting from energy production, transportation to application. and today, the apis is only at the application end with a very specific segment, which is the fast power. we are, as we announced in q1, that we have formulated joint venture with the ze energy to look at jointly developing both the maritime and also energy opportunities.
recently, about two weeks ago, we also signed mou with china kuantan energy in developing solar opportunities in china. and this is an opportunity where kuantan is one of the five top soe power groups in china. this is a solar project that is 25 years duration and that is in the northern part of the china where we are going to be a joint investment with this strategic partner, and that's just only the phase 1 and it is in the renewable space. and this has both the commercial and also strategic value for us to team up with such a state-owned enterprise, major energy power players in china. this is a different partners than the ze, which is a provincial power energy company.
so in terms of the growth opportunities for apr, i think we have a lot of exciting opportunities. as our chairman stated in the previous last quarter's earnings call that our ambition is to transform and build this business to the equal or bigger business as we have in seaspan. so there are plenty of immediate capital allocation opportunities. the key for this management team is to really focusing on the discipline to make sure that we consistently stick to those investment or capital allocation criterias to have the best allocation alternatives. we do not necessarily discriminate -- prefer one business to the other. rather, we are very agnostic in terms of the investment opportunities. the key is to looking at them from the customer perspective, from economic return perspective and also from a business rationale standpoint.
so currently, we have two platforms which is container shipping and energy. but as we also previously announced that we also -- within the shipping space -- within the container shipping space, they are vertical and along the value chain, the opportunities that we could also be potentially looking at. and in the energy space, as i mentioned, that is a quite broader value chain and the industry itself currently is in transformation.
so there's a lot of uncertainty, which in a way also explains why apr's transition will take some time, and part of it because the current covid, which slow down the demand from the market. the other part is that the industry itself is going through the transition. but we see this as an opportunity where we can find those kind of creative solutions as we have done in seaspan. so we're quite excited to develop the both business and allocating those capitals.
omar nokta -- clarksons platou securities -- analyst
thanks, bing. that's very helpful and thorough. so it definitely sounds like it's not just -- you don't have trust your eyes on different opportunities, your hands are there as well.
i wanted to maybe just follow-up on sort of the conversation you had with randy just about chartering some of the vessels and wanted to get a sense of liner appetite. clearly, you've been able to fix ships that are rolling off contract out as far out as 24. we've seen a lot of chatter here recently where there has been some interest on the part of ship owners and to take a vessel and put it on a one or two spot voyage-type charter that pays astronomical rates relative to anything we've seen.
my question, i guess is, you mentioned, bing, kind of looking at various opportunities, one is that an opportunity you're looking at. and then two, from that dynamic, do you think that that is something that -- the idea of putting a vessel on a very quick money-making voyage before deploying it on a contract longer term. is that dynamic something that is being pushed for by the ship owners you think or the liners really kind of pushing for that as well? any color you can give on that?
bing chen -- president and chief executive officer
sure. i think i don't know specifically. i believe that each -- every situation has its own context and background. as we stated that from seaspan's perspective, we are focusing on long-term because we don't believe in short-term opportunistic taking advantage of the market situation. because ultimately, i think that we know that market will eventually sooner or later revert back to normality. and it is important, i think today for the relationship between the owner and operator and the liners to have that kind of sustainable long-term, trusted, win-win partnership.
what you are referring to in the market, yes, we've been asked or been heard about these type of a situation, but i think that is really -- sometimes is custom -- liner customer decided to use for one voyage. sometimes it's because the -- i think the owner would like to take advantage of that situation, but i believe that this still is the minority. but i think from our perspective, we really believe in long-term partnership, and we believe in building that kind of a trust.
and over the time -- and i think it's very important, this industry actually is being characterized by the boom and bust characteristics. and this is exactly the situation, as what you mentioned, which i call is a zero-sum game, because sometimes you get me, and then when time's not good, the liners will get you. and let's not forget, for example, a year ago in march 2020 in the market there were the prevailing terms, which are one month's firm, 12 months' option, ok? so i believe that if you are in the business for long run that you will average out. and also, i think for this kind of zero-sum game relationship is not something that we would like to pursue in. rather, we believe in building sustainable, win-win situation as a partnership.
that's what we've been focusing on. and this is why in the current market, we actually take the benefit of the current market through forward fixing, through the newbuild and also through the secondhand, which is all driven by our customers because they come to us and asking for support. and also, one thing, even today, i think we've been asked by our customers and some third-parties for potentially considering selling some of our assets, and this is something we are also in consideration and evaluation of that.
so for us, this is very important that we're focusing on these specific market condition and how we can best support our customers' needs long-term, and therefore, building that kind of a trust preferred partnership. and when times comes to the difficult times that we will be also the one that will be there for our customer, and this is a long-term business model which we have been purposely building. and today, i think we've seen the benefit in a good time. we definitely will also see the benefit in the market when it's not too good.
omar nokta -- clarksons platou securities -- analyst
thanks, bing. that's very thorough again and really sounds like a very sound strategy. thank you. i'll turn it over.

our next question comes from liam burke with b. riley.
liam burke -- b. riley -- analyst
good morning, bing. good morning, graham.
bing chen -- president and chief executive officer
good morning.
graham talbot -- chief financial officer
hey, liam.
liam burke -- b. riley -- analyst
bing, you've got the vessel orders and you've been moving up on the capacity side of the individual vessels, is there any thought -- as to looking at the fleet, is there any -- are there any assets that you prefer to divest, or are you happy with the makeup of your fleet right now?
bing chen -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. in general, we are very proud of the fleet that we have, and particularly with these newbuild as we highlighted, over 70% of our fleet above 10,000 teu, which are very versatile fleet and is highly in demand. so, in general, i think we are very pleased with our fleet composition and this has also been built purposely together with the demand of our customer. i mean, one thing important is that we worked -- we develop our fleet composition based on our customers' needs.
that being said, as i mentioned earlier, we did -- we have been received request interest from the liner companies and also some third-party financial institutions in -- asking us if we are being open to sell some of assets, because i think they have needs for their business or for their investments. this is something that currently our team evaluating with several considerations, because, on one hand, we have such a composition for a reason. on the other hand, we would also be open-minded in considering the request from the customers and from the financial institutions. one of the potential areas of the fleet that we will be considering, for example, is the 4,250, where i think with the -- with our continued fleet optimization and i think we will have the extra capacities that allows us to be able to consider strategically divest some of these vessels at the criterias, which we set up within ourselves. so, i would say, the most likely will be the -- below 10,000 teu category and specifically maybe around 2,500 to 4,250 segment.
liam burke -- b. riley -- analyst
great. and understanding that all of your vessels come with long-term charters associated with itself, but how do you look at capacity rolling out over the next several years?
bing chen -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, sure. that's a great question. for our capacity rolling out, which we have shared in our presentation, most of our newbuild is going to be delivered between 2022, 2023 and 2024. this is also corresponding to the industry's overall order book release over that period of time. today, we have about 4.9 million teu of newbuild. out of this 4.9 million, about 45% are third-party, meaning that 55% are built by the liner themselves. out of this 45%, about -- we -- our new newbuild accounts for about one-third, and the other one-third is about the leasing company, and then the other one-third is other owners/operators.
from the release perspective, we are very confident because as we shared earlier from our existing fleet, we are forward fixing majority of our capacity all the way up to 2023, and this is as of today, which is 2021, and we believe that we will continue to forward fixing these capacities on existing fleet side.
from these newbuild perspective, as we mentioned earlier, for each every of these newbuild are backed by a long-term charter. the shortest is five years and the longest is 18 years. majority of them is between, i would say, 10 to 18 years. so, therefore, these newbuild actually they come, each every one of them come with the long-term charter attached to it and they're also stacking out over the period from 2022, 2023, 2024. so, overall, i think from our perspective, both the existing fleet and also the newbuild have been fully chartered.
from an industry perspective, i think today as supply and demand, in general, are still fundamentally balanced, even though we're looking at, let's say, with this 4.9 million teu of newbuild that translates into the supply side of the release of -- for example, 2021 is about 4.5%; 2022 is 3%; 2023 is about 6.5%. and that is assuming there is no scrapping. and in the past year or two, as we all know, this year, for example, there is no scrapping probably, or minimal. so therefore, if you're taking out the scrapping, you're thinking about addition and also you're considering the growth in the marketplace today. the demand, i think, is still -- according to the industry forecast, is still very solid and with growth in the coming years.
and on top of that, we have this pandemic, which adds to the burden of the logistics that makes situation even -- make the demand even stronger. but overall, even without covid, i think demand continues to be strong and the supply continue to be measured. the industry has consolidated on the liner side, which we see the significant efficiencies in both the covid situation last year and also this year. and i think from the owner space today with our new build, i think we are in a position to consolidate the market and we will continue to work with our customers to further fulfill their needs, at the same time, i believe that we will continue to consolidate the market as well. so overall, i think the market from a demand and supply perspective is fundamentally balanced.
liam burke -- b. riley -- analyst
great. thank you, bing.

our next question comes from ben nolan with stifel.
frank galanti -- stifel nicolaus -- analyst
hi, this is frank galanti on for ben. i want to second [phonetic] i think what omar said in regard to increased disclosure, it's very helpful. so, thank you for that. but i wanted to ask about the fixed forwarding strategy. in the presentation, you mentioned that there are six vessels coming off in '22 and 19 in '23. do you see any incremental demand for those types of contracts putting them on term contracts today?
bing chen -- president and chief executive officer
yes. in today's market, the reason we have not fixed the six is because, as i said earlier, we tried to balance the different requests from the different customers. in today's market, these six vessels could be very easily fixed, rather we are right now at this point trying to balancing the different interests. the same thing with some of these 2023 vessels. i mean, the way we working with our customers is obviously to take a strategic view in considering what their short-term needs, as well as what their long-term needs and that's how we allocating our fleet capacity similar to that -- in a way, similar to that we're allocating our capital, because we all believe in long term and also believe in optimizing our strategic partnership with our customer.
so from a forward-fixing perspective, we continue working with our customer on evaluating their business needs and also taking, as i mentioned earlier, creative solutions. there is some other ways that we are considering in fulfilling our customers' needs. for example, a couple of years ago, we developed those floating rates, which today we have about 15% of our fleet is on these floating rate, which has the exposure to the current high spot rate. so even though our business model is long term, but out of our long-term committed capacity, about 15% of our capacity is exposed to the short-term current market high rate. so, in looking at the future growth opportunities, as i mentioned earlier, we continue to be ahead of the market, anticipating our customer needs and develop the kind of solutions, in this case, specifically, is the capacity. how do we develop that kind of capacity solutions to our customer, and that is something we actively working with our customer and these are the vessels, which is the base material for us to working with our customers.
frank galanti -- stifel nicolaus -- analyst
okay. that's helpful. on the floating rate contracts, i guess kind of two parts, were any of these forward fixed contracts, do they have a component of floating in them? and then i guess, how does that -- floating rate, how is that calculated?
bing chen -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. majority of our forward-fixing contracts are on a fixed basis, and some of them are on a forward -- on a floating basis. for example, we have some vessels that we forward fixing, starting from 2023 or 2024 going forward for another five years. so, you are talking about 2028 to 2029. in those situations, mutually that we have agreed with our customer to have one or two years of those five-year terms on the floating basis. those floating basis are basically based on that particular segment's market index. you can think about it like, in financings, the libor rate, so whatever the prevailing market rate at that time. and this is what i mean by today, we have roughly about 15% of our long-term contract in our existing fleet under these type of floating rate structure, which in today's market, we actually enjoy this high spot rate. but just to clarify, for all our newbuild, the 55 newbuild, zero, none, none of those vessels are under floating, they're all under fixed charter rate. and also the costs are fixed. also, we are not subject to any commodity or shipyard price fluctuation.
frank galanti -- stifel nicolaus -- analyst
okay. great. very helpful. thank you very much.

our next question comes from sanjay ramaswamy with bank of america.
sanjay ramaswamy -- bank of america -- analyst
hey guys. this has been really helpful. thanks for taking my question. just a question being -- can you give us any sense on potentially what the normalized size of this fleet could be maybe over the next 12 months? maybe some color just on the split between where you see kind of secondhand vessel acquisitions kind of ahead of newbuilds and divestments kind of putting that altogether, what the number from a normalized basis would potentially look like in 12 months?
bing chen -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, that's a good question, sanjay. thank you. we actually don't specifically set up a hard target as to how -- what our size should be, rather we're really working with our customer. it is our customer's demand that drives our fleet composition and fleet growth. currently, i think because of the environmental requirements, and i think with the eedx, eeix [phonetic], which is energy efficiency design for the new vessel, energy efficiency for the existing fleet. these requirements, i think, our customer has a need and also from our perspective, i think, we want to be in the forefront of the environmental and technology, that's why we have been able to capture such a great opportunity in these newbuild.
and if we're looking back about two years ago, i believe, i was asked why seaspan did not have any newbuild, because back then, we don't think the market is ready for that. so, this is just an example as to -- our fleet composition of growth is really driven by our customer. of course, we take into consideration of our own views on what the segment is and what kind of return that we would require. for example, if we're looking at the fleet composition of what we have built of these 55 newbuilds, a large portion of that is 12,000 and above. the reason being that these are the most versatile assets and that could be used for a variety of trading routes versus those bigger ones that is very limited for a specific route. so these assets has a lot of value, flexibility, at the same time, we actually build these vessels locked in the price and also the delivery slot at the very favorable term. and in today's market, for example, if you build -- rebuild these vessels, the value-wise for those conventional will be somewhere between $15 million to $20 million mark-to-market gain on the no-contract attached basis. so, this is on the newbuild side.
and also on the segment side, we still believe in the above 10,000 segment is an area where from the global fleet perspective that has been underbuilt. for example, i believe that the 15,000 teu segment today, it only represents about 7% of the global fleet. meanwhile, looking at the -- from an efficiency standpoint, looking at from the infrastructure standpoint, i think 15,000 teu vessels is very well fitted for that purpose. that being said, for example, we also have built 7k teu vessels, that is another segment where today, i think if you're looking at from 3,000 to 7,000, or 4,000 to 9,000 teu segment, they combined represents about 42% of the global capacity. at the same time, this segment has very little newbuild over the past years. so, with the 7k vessels, which is in that particular sub 10,000 teu segment, it's very versatile, could be used for a variety of trades that today has been serviced by these 3,000 to 9,000 teu vessels. so, in looking at these newbuilds, as i mentioned, that it really is looking at what customer needs and also what our views in terms of the market.
for the secondhand vessels, we have strategically, at the same time, very selectively looking at the secondhand vessels, particularly in the current market, now in 2019 and 2020, we actually acquired 15 of those vessels. those are very strategically timed in a way that those vessels were acquired at a good time with a very competitive value. at the same time, once again, they've been attached for the long-term charter. so, those are the second vessels we've been focusing on when the market, at that time, weren't such a growth opportunity. in today's market, we see the value has been quite competitive. in that sense, that we've been very, very selective. and the four vessels we have acquired are really, again, requested by our customer and these vessels have been also attached with the long-term contract. and most of those investments actually been -- could be returned within that charter period of time.
and in looking at going forward, i think both in terms of secondhand or newbuild, i would think that from our perspective, we'll be very selective and very disciplined and working with our customer. if those criterias from a market, customer, and our fleet composition perspective, they all will meet our criteria and we will make those investments and continue to grow. but we will never grow for the sake of growth and also speculatively growing in thinking, which segment it's going to be. so, ultimately it's going to be customer-driven.
sanjay ramaswamy -- bank of america -- analyst
very helpful. that's a great thing. and maybe just one on -- just a follow-up there. just in terms of where steel prices are right now and just hypothetically saying that steel prices were to go up, let's say, 15%, 20% from here, i mean what kind of impact do they have on kind of how you look at the return hurdles of some of these newbuilds? maybe just talk through how that would impact you and looking probably toward the secondary market for vessels?
bing chen -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. the steel price actually has zero -- again, zero impact to our newbuild, because our price is already fixed, has no impact to our newbuild. as i said and i would want to just to rehighlight that, for all of our 55 newbuild and also potentially, if and when we have some newbuilds going forward, we will not be exposing to that shipbuilding cost. we always have a fixed cost and that's the cost that contractually the shipyard is bind into [phonetic] and we are not exposed to that.
the high steel price actually is beneficial for us should and if when we decide, for example, to sell the vessels, those value will go up because the scrap value will go up. but other than that, from our perspective, there is no exposure to any commodity or equipment price volatility because that's all been fixed. in other words, we have no inflation risk.
sanjay ramaswamy -- bank of america -- analyst
right. that makes sense. and just more so when you decide to then build newbuilds maybe over the next 24 months, does that then obviously factored into the price that you're locking?
bing chen -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. let's say, if we will be building new vessels going forward and i believe i would assume that shipyard will take that into consideration and price into the shipbuilding price, and in turn when we taking on the shipbuilding price, we will have to also reflect that price into the charter rate. so, effectively, if and when there is such adjustment that will be reflected in the charter rate, yes.
sanjay ramaswamy -- bank of america -- analyst
sure. okay. yeah. thanks, guys. it's been great.
bing chen -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.

our next question comes from michael goldie with bmo capital markets.
michael goldie -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
hi, guys. thank you for taking my question.
graham talbot -- chief financial officer
hi, mike.
bing chen -- president and chief executive officer
hi, michael.
michael goldie -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
so, a large, large part of your newbuild program is delivered through 2024 and won't be fully appreciated until 2025. so, how should we think about 2024 ebitda guidance and how well it reflects that fully delivered fleet or rather how much upside is there to that 2025 run rate?
graham talbot -- chief financial officer
yeah. i think, mike, we touched on this briefly that we have provided the schedule of the timing of coming to market of the newbuilds for each of the packages. so, you can see in the information that we've released that the window, which means a progressive delivery of all of those vessels flows through. you're correct that we do have a big chunk of our deliveries come through in 2023 and then there is another 17 in '24, but, of course, they're not for the full year. but we have disclosed all of that information and it's certainly available for you to sort of model using those delivery dates that have been provided.
michael goldie -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
okay. and then, is it too early to be thinking about forward fixtures for 2024?
graham talbot -- chief financial officer
i don't think it's ever too early -- sorry, i'll let bing answer.
bing chen -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. we are -- as graham said, it's not necessarily too early. from the timing perspective, yes, it is about three years away from here. so, it is hard for liner customers to make that full anticipation. but i think the only possibility for the liners to consider is because they value our services. and if it's a reliable service, they know they will always need certain capacity and that -- they come to those kind of owner/operators to secure those type of tonnage way ahead, three years ahead, which also explains why in today, we will able to fix 58 vessels, which is 50%, roughly about 50% of our existing operating fleet. this is because our customer really value seaspan's service and they want to lock in the base capacity from the operators like ourselves. so, looking at 2024, 2023, we continue to engage with our customers in exploring both using the conventional ways of forward fixing and also some other creative ways, which we are working with our customer. so, the long answer to your question is, it is possible and we are working with our customers, leveraging our platform, our services and our flexibility to create those type of forward fixing opportunities.
michael goldie -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
perfect. thank you very much, guys.
bing chen -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.
graham talbot -- chief financial officer
thanks, mike.

our next question comes from j mintzmyer with value investor edge.
j mintzmyer -- value investor edge -- analyst
hi, good morning, bing. good morning. graham. thanks for taking the questions.
graham talbot -- chief financial officer
hi, j. how are you?
j mintzmyer -- value investor edge -- analyst
doing well. thanks. so, i'd like to turn to slide 19 and talk a little bit about the remaining capex. you've mentioned $4.1 billion is secured or in progress, it's about $1.7 billion that's unfinanced. what are the -- i mean, i realize there's couple more years to go, but what are the aspirations for that $1.7 billion? and how much of that do you think can be in some sort of debt? and how much of that needs to be in either organic cash flow or new equity?
graham talbot -- chief financial officer
yeah. it's a great question, j. so, at the moment, this $1.7 billion specifically refers to the 18 newbuilds that were announced in june, july. so, the reason sort of this chart is broken up that way is that we did make a commitment in the q1 results around financing for the new builds that we announced at that time and we are ahead of that schedule in terms of delivery of that financing. this tranche that's coming over june, july, the $1.7 billion, we're working through that at the moment. when i say working through it, we've got multiple different opportunities that we're discussing as to how to structure that.
we've also got material liquidity at the moment. so, for example, a number of the financing structures that we've already locked in do include the pre-delivery installments on the vessels. but given that we've got liquidity available, we're negotiating with some of the financers -- financiers to allow us to pay that utilizing our cash and then on delivery, we can take that debt back if we need it. so, we're looking at ways to optimize utilization of our cash at the moment, but also retaining the secured facilities that we have agreed.
my view is this $1.7 billion, probably in the next month or so we'll have agreed what structures we'll use for it. and like i said, we've discussed it before that there is a range of different opportunities we have. there's certain debts in different marketplaces, whether it's in the leaseco [phonetic] market, the jolco [phonetic] market, the eca market, and we're actively working through all of those to work out the best deal that fits our structure. so, that's sort of where we are on the $1.7 billion.
j mintzmyer -- value investor edge -- analyst
okay. that's helpful, graham. thank you. it seems to me, if i'm backing out the calculations, graham [phonetic], today, you're pushing nearly 90% leverage there on those newbuilds. is that fairly accurate?
and then second of all, it seems -- judging by your stock price, which is down since march, it seems like the market is bearing some sort of common equity issuances. can you confirm that you don't foresee a need for any common equity?
graham talbot -- chief financial officer
yeah. so, certainly, equity issuance is not on the table at the moment. and i think we've made it very clear that at our current stock levels that's just not something that we would consider to value decretive to issue stock when we're trading at these levels. so, i think what's more important for us is to get our financing locked in and to demonstrate delivery against the newbuild program and de-risk it. i think that is why we're so focused on getting this financing structured correctly. as to ltv, some of it's down around the 75% level and some of it's up around the 100% level. so, it's a real mix. but yeah, on average, yes, you're looking at 85%, 90% sort of range across that portfolio.
j mintzmyer -- value investor edge -- analyst
well, that's -- it's phenomenal levels. congrats on getting that done. final question related to all this, you have a significant newbuild program going through mid-2024. how much additional capacity do you have to grow if your clients come to you and then want to add more say '24, '25, '26 tonnage? how much in terms of maybe billions do you think you could grow from here?
graham talbot -- chief financial officer
yeah, it's a very good question. i think it does come down a bit to timing, j, because then i guess you do enter a point, eventually, where you do need to probably do an equity raise. but i think we've got to make sure that that's done at the right time. so, i'm not going back on my previous comment to say that it's not on the cards, but there will be a growth point if it happens, it's just going to be careful balancing out of the profile, because as you're well aware, we've got this delivery profile coming through '23, '24, then you have rapid cash flow coming in very quickly, which allows us to de-lever and allocate capital back to where we want it to on the balance sheet to get back to our ambition around investment grade. so, barring any other activities, for me, that's the sort of timeframe i'd be looking at to get to investment grade based on the plans we have today.
j mintzmyer -- value investor edge -- analyst
all right. thanks, graham.
bing chen -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. and also just to add to what graham said is that from a business perspective, i think we definitely have the capacity to continue to operate and continue to grow our business from a fleet perspective. as graham mentioned that as our newbuild comes to delivery, starting from, for example, 2021, we have one vessel 2022, 2023, all the way to 2024, for example, we have an adjusted ebitda of $1.5 billion. and by then, the business is actually generating sufficient cash flows. at the same time, and i think from a business perspective, we got the scale -- we got the economic scales of operations and also our customers will be able to meet their business requirement through the kind of partnership that they have with us in providing those kind of solutions in -- particularly in this case, if and when there are the newbuild request.
but most importantly, from our perspective, the evaluation or the criteria is the quality of growth. the quality growth, as we said, is the long-term contract attached to it. it's the good assets. it's coming from the customer and also the return of those investments that meets our requirement, as we said. any of these returns on these newbuild -- to the matter of any investments we make is at high single-digit unlevered return. and that has been and will continue to be that. so, therefore, i think in our case, it's not so much of the constraints of the capital or the capacity of managing and operating these vessels rather is to have that kind of opportunities that meets our investment and growth criteria, which is why we consistently highlight the quality growth and long-term business model, that's the -- basically, the trademark of atlas.
j mintzmyer -- value investor edge -- analyst
certainly makes sense. so, thank you, bing, and thank you, graham. and congrats again on a great quarter.
graham talbot -- chief financial officer

operator
welcome to the atlas corp. second quarter 2021 earnings conference call. [operator instructions]
i would now like to turn the call over to robert weiner, head of investor relations at atlas corp. you may begin.
robert weiner -- head of investor relations
thank you, kevin, and good morning, everyone. thank you for joining us today to discuss atlas corp's second quarter 2021 earnings. we issued our earnings release last evening after market close. we will refer to our quarterly earnings release, accompanying earnings presentation and supplemental workbook today in this conference, which all can be found on the investor relations tab on our website, atlascorporation.com.
i would like to remind you that our discussion today contains forward-looking statements, and i draw your attention to the disclaimer on page 2 in the accompanying earnings presentation. with this quarterly report, you will note that we continue to report non-gaap measures, which we believe provide investors a clearer understanding of the performance of our business system.
the earnings release contains supplemental financial tables and information pertaining to our quarterly earnings report and includes definition of non-gaap financial measures and reconciliations of such non-gaap measures to the most closely comparable u.s. gaap measures. these definitions may also be found in the appendices at the back of the earnings presentation, which we will refer to in our call discussion, and can be found on our website. in addition, we have provided historical financial information through 2018, which are also available in the earnings supplemental workbook on our website.
please turn to slide number 3. on the call with me today are bing chen, president and chief executive officer of atlas corp; and graham talbot, chief financial officer of atlas corp. joining us on the call during the q&a session are seaspan's chief commercial officer, peter curtis; and seaspan's chief operational officer, torsten pedersen. following our prepared remarks, we will open up the forum to a question-and-answer session.
please turn to slide number 4. i am pleased to now turn the call over to atlas corp's ceo, bing chen.
bing chen -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, rob, and good morning, everyone. thank you for joining our call today, i will present our q2 2021 results and share the key characteristics regarding our business model and quality growth, which are central to our value proposition.
first, let's look at our q2 results. please turn to slide 5. i'm pleased to report a strong q2 financial performance, which was at the high end of our expected range. we are raising our 2021 financial guidance due to our strong first half performance and our exciting momentum for the rest of the year. to date, 100% of our forecasted gross contract cash flows are secured for 2021. together with our relentless focus on operational excellence, we are confident in delivering our targets.
during q2, atlas achieved revenue growth of 8.3% to $393.9 million. adjusted ebitda growth of 14.1% to $272.5 million. ffo growth of 20% to $193.5 million. and ffo per share growth of 14.1% to $0.73 per share. and we paid our 64th consecutive quarterly dividend. we have also completed several major projects and achieved significant milestones within a very short time. we continued delivering quality growth through q2 with 18 additional newbuilds, 45 forward fixing charters and deliveries of three secondhand vessels.
we secured additional funding for our newbuilds, restructured our fairfax notes, raised unsecured capital, secured favorable credit ratings and simplified our balance sheet, while lowering our cost of capital. at apr, we successfully deployed 13 turbines across two key projects. we are excited to serve peaking power and grid stabilization to our customers. i'm proud of our team's continued high performance and resiliency. we are well positioned to finish 2021 strong and already executing our growth in 2022.
now i would like to explain how we create and deliver value through our differentiated and resilient business model. our business model firmly sets us apart from our peers through our unique combination of attributes, and it is important that this is well understood by the investment community.
please turn to slide 6. we are a global multi-platform investment franchise, and we consistently generate value through our business model and quality growth. our resilient and differentiated business model sets us apart significantly from our peers. while liners focus on flexibility and generally keep short-term charters with our peers, we have been consistently winning our liner customers' long-term commitments and growing our long-term cash flow through operational excellence and creative customer solutions. these solutions are delivered through our scalable, flexible and reliable integrated platform.
through industry and economic cycles, we generate predictable long-term growth contracted cash flows with industry-leading customers. currently we have $16.2 billion in gross contracted cash flow and an average charter duration of 7.2 years. we do not focus on short-term zero-sum game relationships, rather we focus on long-term win-win partnership through our integrated platform and solutions we create.
our revenues do not fluctuate with short-term market movements, but provide stable returns throughout the industry and economic cycles. all of our newbuilds are fixed in costs and backed by long-term fixed charter with industry leaders. we do not speculate and we are not exposed to inflation risk on newbuilds. our business model differentiates us from our peers through our solutions, platform and ability to execute, which cannot be easily replicated.
i would like to explain what quality growth means and why it is important to our stakeholders. over the past eight months, we have dramatically enhanced our fleet composition and achieved a greater customer diversification through 55 newbuilds and four secondhand acquisitions, all with high-single-digits unlevered returns and all are backed by long-term fixed charter with leading liner customers. no one else in the industry nor in the container lessors' history has achieved this before. this is a testament of our world-class execution and deep partnerships with shipyard and liners. no peers can match our business scale, operational excellence, customer flexibility, fleet versatility, financial strength and creative solutions.
we have forward fixing 45 operating vessels in q2 and 58 year-to-date to meet our customers' demand and growing our long-term cash flows. we've built partnerships that are sustainable, meaning when times are good for liners, they do not take advantage of us and vice versa. our liner customers treat us as a long-term preferred and trusted partner.
now let's look at our fully integrated platform and how it makes atlas' differentiation possible. slide 7 depicts the portfolio of integrated services we provide for our customers. investors often ask how the seaspan consistently deliver quarterly growth and continue its leadership in the market. the answer is that we always provide turnkey solutions to our customers by leveraging our integrated platform, which we have been investing in our people, process and systems over the past 20 years.
our full lifecycle expertise from initial design, construction through operations, commercial management, environmental technology, all the way to the demolition, enables us to develop creative solutions. we facilitate liners' growth by delivering our solutions, which in turn facilitates greater scalability, reliability and flexibility for our platform, resulting in win-win outcomes for our customers through all market cycles.
our integrated platform is underpinned by this management team and our people. our five core competencies determines how we create value and gain our customers' trust and commitment. we have an industry-leading safety records of 0.4 ltif and 98.5% of utilization in q2, which is a result of our committed team. seaspan's long-term fleet utilization since our ipo in 2005 average above 98%. this is what we mean by operational excellence. the focus on operational excellence extended through the entire organization. our business model, integrated platform, our team's focus on five core competencies and the value-added services positions us for sustainable growth and shareholder value creation through all market cycles.
please turn to slide 8. while the container shipping market remains highly competitive for liner companies and owner-operators, seaspan has been a leader in transforming our sector through consistent advancing in our market, creating quality growth and delivering sustainable shareholder value. we are acquiring and building strategic assets, focusing our fleet optimization with a larger and more efficient vessels. our 10,000 teu and greater segment comprises 78% of our total teu. we are focused on cleaner fuel and apply industry-leading technical solutions in designing, building and modifying our fleet.
the additions of 7,000, 12,000 and a larger teu vessels to our fleet positions seaspan competitively and strategically for the future global fleet evolution. we have also diversified our customer base of the top-line of companies with a 22% decrease in concentration of seaspan's top three customers. despite the market challenges over the last few years, we have been continuously optimizing our assets and customer portfolio, while delivering creative solutions.
please turn to slide 9. seaspan has been a market leader in vessel efficiency with our hallmark of saver program, which has produced 40 innovative newbuild vessels since the program's inception 10 years ago. we make these investment based on customer-driven demand and are leading the industry's size category expansion through increased teu efficiencies. today lng is the only commercially viable alternative to traditional bunker fuel with no definitive single path forward to the next generation of fuels. we actively participate in industry forums working on viable energy transition pathways for the future and ensure that we do not develop stranded assets.
our orders for the 20 dual fuel lng newbuild place us at the leading edge of innovation, building upon seaspan's history of adopting greater efficiencies. we have taken a prudent approach toward the type of fuel we're using for newbuilds with some dual fuel-based and some conventional. this approach positions seaspan well for the future evolution of the fuels as both vessel types can be retrofitted to adapt to the new technologies.
we see the decarbonization of the shipping as an opportunity for seaspan to support our customers' decarbonization journey and to provide the leadership through this energy transition. we are continuously focused on newbuild design improvements and environmental enhancement as well as evaluating and modifying seaspan and apr operating fleet to see greater efficiencies. as an example of creative solutions, we recently partnered with zim to install innovative fuel tanks to accept conversions to ammonia-based fuel for five of the newbuild lng vessels on order.
slide 10 illustrates our commercial agility as well as our trusted and creative customer solutions. we secured 58 forward fixing charters year-to-date. forward fixing is entering into new charter agreements with customers well in advance of the current charter agreement expiring. the new charters of forward fixing agreements extend the terms which begin after the current charter terms expires. we now have no redeliveries in 2021, six in 2022 of 4.8% of our delivered fleet and 19 in 2023 or 13.4% of our delivered fleet as measured by the number of vessels.
our ability of forward fixing 58 vessels is a testament to the trust that we have built with our customers, while we continuously focus on creative solutions to facilitate their success. not only does this provide our customers with reliability and certainty, it also strengthens our resilient business model by growing our contracted cash flow and average charter duration. seaspan and apr now both have 100% anticipated gross contracted cash flow secured for 2021.
please turn to slide 11. as we have mentioned previously, we do not grow for the sake of growing. we are only interested in quality growth driven by our customers. we have a comprehensive sets of quantitative and qualitative criterias, which we implement to allocate capital. this is embedded in our operating model. and as a result, we do screening out many opportunities that do not meet our criteria. this management team has been consistently executing quality growth in our strategic and daily business decisions.
please turn to slide 12. shareholders should be pleased that our strategies and execution have led to consistent quality growth through market cycles and has solidified seaspan as the leader in the containership owner-operator market. we have strategically grown our business through a thoughtful and innovative approach. newbuild vessels has been the predominant focus throughout the seaspan's history. in seaspan's 20 years history, we have built 109 vessels and now we've added 55 newbuilds for a total of 164 newbuilds, which is nearly 90% of our fully delivered fleet.
by teu and by number of vessels, our fleet is nearly three times the size of our nearest competitor on a fully delivered basis. and we have consistently maintained 98% fleet utilization since our ipo in 2005, while at the same time improving our safety records. over the past three years, the industry has gone through challenging times with the trade war and global pandemic. and we have still managed to consistently deliver quality growth and operational excellence through these market cycles. our expertise, execution and solutions have attracted customers to seaspan as their preferred long-term partner.
slide 13 never gets old for me as these sets of metrics are self-explanatory. it is the pay off for all of our stakeholders. a quick review of our year-to-date progress as of q2. gross contracted cash flow increased by 218% to $16.2 billion. these are long-term high visible cash flows secured by high creditworthy counterparties. fully delivered fleet grew by 46%, adding 59 newbuilds and secondhand vessels. we increased teu capacity by 73% to nearly 1.9 million teu in total for the fully delivered fleet. average fleet age decreased by 2.8 years to 4.8 years and the remaining lease term increased to 7.2 years from 3.8 years. by all measures, these are impressive results and viewed by many as industry record setting achievements. this significant progress did not happen by accident. it is our team's for thoughtful execution and unwavering discipline and determination. they are a direct reflection of our team's high performance execution and atlas' integrated platform and the resilient business model.
please turn to slide 14. i will conclude my formal remarks by summarizing my points today centered around our business model and quality growth. first, our business model is resilient and differentiated from peers in our industry. we are proud of our broad and deep partnership with strategic customers, which are underpinned by long-term contract cash flow. the strength of our business model, the breadth of our integrated platform, the excellence of our operation results and the long-term commitment by our customers.
second, our creative customer partnership drives our quality growth through all market cycles. for seaspan, we delivered the right solution at the right time. no one can match our capabilities. we have 55 newbuilds on the construction, which contributes $9.1 billion of gross contracted cash flow and we have the financial and operational capacity to continue our growth. the strength of our service offering and operational excellence is demonstrated by our customers' forward fixing charter for 58 vessels, well ahead of the current charter expirations. we took the same approach with apr customers as the current mexicali project is our third consecutive annual contract, while we are working to develop opportunities in new markets.
our partnership have resulted in total gross contracted cash flow rising to $16.2 billion along with consistent and increasing high-single-digit unlevered returns, and this is the quality growth. atlas' long-term financial guidance is based on our confidence in the team's ability to continue high performance execution. year-to-date, we have continued our drive record achievements for atlas and particularly at seaspan. it has been a great first half of 2021. we are confident to raise our 2021 financial guidance and provide long-term financial guidance that reflects the achievement that this team has accomplished to date. in summary, atlas is a dynamic, market-leading and quality growth-oriented company determined to consistently create value for our shareholders.
please turn to slide 15, and i will now turn the call over to our cfo, graham talbot.
graham talbot -- chief financial officer
thank you, bing, and good morning, everyone. thanks for joining us today.
could you please turn to slide 16. as highlighted by bing, we've delivered a strong year-to-date performance. and the outlook for the balance of the year has enabled us to increase our financial guidance, which i'll get to later in the presentation. bing has already highlighted the key financial metrics for the second quarter, so i won't repeat them here. however, i would like to highlight that at quarter end, our adjusted earnings per share, excluding the non-cash debt extinguishment charge, which i'll detail later, was $0.39 per diluted share compared to $0.26 in the second quarter of 2020. closing liquidity was up 231% to $1.27 billion compared to the second quarter of 2020, which does not include the proceeds from our recent u.s. high-yield growth. the entire organization has been working hard on growth delivery, capital structure optimization, and of course, continued operational excellence, resulting in our strong year-to-date performance.
please turn to slide 17. this page highlights this management team's relentless focus on continuous improvement. where we are today is the culmination of 20 years of operational excellence, coupled with strong execution and a resilient business model. management is pleased with these results, but of course, never satisfied. we have still got more work to do, but we also recognize the significant achievements that have been delivered.
atlas is being consistently growing its asset base, improving the quality of the seaspan fleet, increasing the duration of charters and improving the diversification of our customer base. this results in improved service to our customers, increased stability and profitability in our financial performance and increased competitive advantage in the market. at the same time, delivering consistent quality growth of our key financial metrics with revenue growing over 80% and adjusted ebitda and cash flow from operations growing over 100% since year end 2017. our credit metrics, unencumbered assets and capital structure have all improved materially and will continue to do so as we execute our plan to achieve an investment grade credit rating and improved capital efficiency.
now i'd like to discuss our newbuild program in greater detail. please turn to slide 18. it's been hard to miss the news of our newbuild program, which commenced last december. while we are agnostic to the method of growth, newbuild, secondhand or both, our strict financial discipline is one of the most prominent guides in our decision making. as bing mentioned, we partner with our customers to optimize fleet capacity, roll-offs, renewals, forward fixing and the timing thereof to increase the amount and duration of our cash flows.
this slide outlines our new build program with some vessels currently in the construction phase as we speak. we will be providing regular updates on the status of this program as we progress through financing, construction and deliveries. this slide outlines details on the vessels gross contracted cash flows, capital expenditure and charter durations by vessel package and by year for all 55 newbuild vessels. you can also see the schedule delivery times for each of the vessel packages. the 55 newbuilds will generate gross contracted cash flows of $9.1 billion with fixed investments of $6.3 billion.
now please turn to slide 19, and i'll update you on the financing status of the growth program. this slide details funding progress for the 55 newbuild vessels under construction. we're leveraging our extensive banking relationships to finance these vessels on a secured basis. we have identified specific financing sources for all of our needs, all of which are progressing well and expected to be finalized well in advance of delivery dates. we've closed $1.9 billion of funding, an additional $1.4 billion of funding commitments have been received and we have approximately $800 million of funding that is progressing and on track to close in q3 2021.
this funding covers 37 of the newbuild vessels, and we are actively assessing optimal financing avenues for the 18 newbuilds that were announced in june and july of 2021. this amounts to $1.7 billion of unfinanced cash outlay shown in the chart. we're very confident in our ability to complete financing for all of our newbuilds and as -- we have ample liquidity and received strong interest from our financing partners. and as discussed previously, the challenge is not to obtain funding but to secure the best funding for our portfolio and financial structure.
please turn to slide 20. we've presented this slide in the past, yet it's worth repeating this quarter as it highlights the power of long-term charters and provides stability and dependability through industry and economic cycles. this chart has been updated to reflect the gross contracted cash flows delivered from our current growth program, layered on top of the cash flows we received from our current operating fleet under existing charter and power agreements. as of q2 2021, this equates to $16.2 billion of gross contracted cash flow with an average contract duration of 7.2 years.
bing has said this and i'll repeat it. we purposely build this business to be a long-term and predictable business. we are not driven by speculative short-term growth. and it's noteworthy that this slide does not include any future growth or rechartering activity. two areas where we have proven our expertise, as evidenced by our consistent track record of delivering quality growth. we are an active growth-orientated company, and i would expect that to continue as we move forward.
now let's move to the balance sheet as i'd like to highlight several initiatives we have recently completed to strengthen our business and simplify our capital structure. please turn to slide 21. so during the second quarter, we completed several key initiatives that have significantly strengthened our balance sheet and created increased financial flexibility to continue to pursue quality growth opportunities. i'll center my comments around three key points; our pathway to investment grade credit, the continuous improvement to our capital structure and finish with comments on the recent news surrounding our supportive strategic investor, fairfax financial.
a key element to our progress in strengthening our relationships with the global base of institutional investors. in this regard, we closed two tranches of debt, including a $500 million u.s. sustainability-linked private placement of non-amortizing notes with approximately 12-year weighted average maturity and a 4.1% weighted average fixed interest rate. we recently closed our initial entry into the u.s. high-yield market with our senior unsecured 2029 blue transition sustainability-linked notes. the offering was oversubscribed by five times. and as a result, we upsized from $500 million to $750 million and closed at the tight end of our price range of 5.5%.
during q2, we further optimized our capital structure with the redemption of $335 million of 8.22% average cost preferred shares and the early termination of several smaller higher cost debt facilities. this has led to both a reduction in overall cost and simplification of our capital structure. atlas has been fortunate to enjoy the support of our strategic partner, fairfax financial, who recognizes the maturation of atlas' financial strength.
during the quarter, we entered into an agreement to restructure the $600 million of fairfax notes on our balance sheet. $300 million of the notes were exchanged for series j preference shares at 7%. and in conjunction with this transaction, we issued 1 million warrants to fairfax with a strike price of $13.71. the remaining $300 million of notes were restructured to be pari passu with our existing unsecured debt holders and are callable at any time. and we are planning to redeem these notes in q3 2021.
at this time, i'd like to explain some specific accounting implications of these transactions. when the fairfax notes were issued, warrants were granted concurrently. under accounting rules, we are required to recognize the difference to fair market value of these warrants on the balance sheet. this results in a discount on debt issuance of $163 million being booked at the time of the original transaction. the amount is then amortized over the term of the notes, and has resulted in an annual charge to interest of approximately $20 million.
as highlighted, during the quarter, we exchanged $300 million of the notes. and therefore, have written off the issuance discount associated with these notes of $51 million. this is a non-cash charge and represents the accelerated amortization of the debt discount and is reflected in our q2 '21 financial statements. as stated, we do plan to redeem the remaining $300 million of fairfax notes in due course. this will result in the remaining discount to be charged to our p&l at the time of repayment. the remaining debt discount is approximately $69.5 million as of june 30, 2021. once again, this is a non-cash amount and removes a significant overhang from our future capital cost.
please turn to slide 22. on this slide, you see the ratings we recently received from three of the top rating agencies; standard and poor's, fitch and kroll. we received a bb rating from both fitch and kroll and a bb- rating from s&p. this puts us ahead of our expected trajectory toward achieving investment grade corporate rating. to get there, we are focused on increasing our level of liquidity, our proportion of unsecured debt, increasing our portfolio of unencumbered vessels and prudently managing our debt profile and leverage metrics, and of course, managing our growth and risk profile.
now let's turn to financial guidance. please turn to slide 23. today we're providing one-time long-term financial guidance for atlas due to three primary reasons. firstly, the extraordinary markets conditions in our industry. secondly, we are in a significant capital delivery phase and actively forward fixing existing contracts. and last but certainly not least, we have made significant progress on the execution of our capital plan and our journey to an investment grade credit rating.
the amount of progress and change that we have implemented has been unprecedented in our industry. therefore, we felt it's important to provide additional disclosures to the investment community to assist in understanding the cumulative impact of all of these elements. due to the rapidly changing energy environment, which continues to be impacted by the pandemic, we have chosen not to include any growth for apr energy in the financial guidance. while we do not believe this will be what transpires over the period, apr's business is contract-driven and the visibility as to timing and size of expected new contract wins is in determinable. and it would not be prudent for us to make commitments that we cannot credibly forecast.
taking these assumptions into account, atlas is expected to increase adjusted net earnings from $311 million in 2020 to $695 million in 2024, representing a compound annual growth rate of approximately 22% over the guidance period. this forecast incorporates our existing fleet and all growth announced up until this point in time or put another way, it doesn't include any further growth other than what we have already announced to the market. therefore, this represents a relatively conservative forecast based on known activities underpinned by a high proportion of contracted cash flows.
in addition, we have expanded our fleet disclosures this quarter to our detailed information for short-term rates, which we previously classified as market rates, and we have also added data and visibility in our q2 financial workbook surrounding forward fixing contracts. providing greater transparency for our investors reflects confidence in our highly predictive -- predictable business model and our proven track record of execution. this information provides investors with greater clarity and appreciation of the compelling investments atlas represents.
please turn to slide 24. i'll wrap up my remarks by outlining why we believe atlas represents an excellent investment. after i joined earlier this year, i closed my first conference call with investors with this slide, and it remains as relevant today as then. i hope investors will come to see the clear competitive differentiation of our model, quality growth through cycles and the ability for this team to consistently deliver performance. these are key investment attributes which are unique to atlas and offer investors significant confidence to partner with an industry leader.
thank you for your interest. operator, we would now like to open the line to questions. thank you.

operator
[operator instructions] your first question is from chris wetherbee of citi. your line is open.
james -- citi -- analyst
hey guys, good morning. james [phonetic] on for chris. i just wanted to get sort of your view on the broader -- appetite for newbuilds. there is some -- i guess the best way to think about it is, there is a lack of supply chain fluidity and that and it's set -- deteriorating more recently and rates have taken a leg higher, do you think that's a headwind, necessarily the newbuilding ordering in the near term and once that clears, do you think there is an appetite for a significant fleet growth. just trying to get -- understand your outlook in terms of sort of the new buildings longer term. thanks.
bing chen -- president and chief executive officer
hey, good morning, james. that's a good question. in terms of the newbuilding, i believe that we talked about it during the last quarter and in general what we say back then is demand and supply, in general, are balanced. over the past quarter, i believe that the newbuild, although continued but the pace is slowing down, we, however, added 25 newbuilds with the demand from our customers from two leading global liner customers, all of these newbuilds are backed by long-term contracted cash flow. specifically, i think they add about $4 billion gross contracted cash flow and with an average of 11.4 years of duration, but from the overall industry perspective, i think the newbuild actually still is in control, meaning that there is very almost to non-speculative orders.
so that means that any newbuild that has been put in over the past quarter, they are all coming from the real demand, and going forward, i do see that the market continues to be under control, meaning that i think the -- there are still some specific interest in newbuild, but they're in the different segments, they are in a different time frame in terms of delivery, but i see that overall the newbuild demand are very cautious and i think very much under control.
in terms of the supply chain congestion, i think this is really depends on two things. one is the global coordination and control of the pandemic. currently, the supply chain congestion is largely caused by the uncoordinated standards among different countries, that's the one thing. and the other, its condition depends on actually how the covid is going to be under control, meaning that, with the vaccine, with the different ways to protect the people and i think that's going to have impact in terms of how quickly we will be able to return to some kind of normality.
in terms of headwinds, as i said it earlier, that overall i think the market consensus still believe that the current strong market will last at least until i would say the first quarter to second quarter of 2022. some optimistic views is going to be last until the end of 2022. but eventually, i believe that the market will go back to some kind of normality, and i think at that time actually seaspan's business model will -- comes to really differentiate in the marketplace in the way that, as we mentioned earlier, we actually have very little charter roll-off for the next three four years. specifically, for example, we have zero for 2021, we have six vessels for 2022, 19 vessels for 2023 and 31 vessels for 2024.
this is assumed that we do not do any forward fixing between september 30 to the next four years, but in reality, we actually have already forward fixing some of the vessels in between and as i mentioned earlier also, regardless of the headwinds, it's very important to highlight that with our existing fleet, we have already forward fixing, 60 of them, and that's why we have very little roll-off in the next years, but at the same time, our new build, all of these newbuilds as i said before, 70 out of that one is already delivered ahead of the schedule, two is to be delivered this month again it's going to be ahead of the schedule, and also the remaining two is also expected to be delivered ahead of schedule in q1, q2 2022. but all all of our newbuild vessels are backed by long-term contracted cash flow, meaning that none of them are speculative and all these newbuild has backed by long-term charter. so from a headwind perspective, i think seaspan is actually best positioned if and when the market happens and i think that is really the highlights of our business and we are very pleased with what we have achieved.
james -- citi -- analyst
got it. i mean just sort of clarify given the congestion and the lack of sort of longer-term visibility, do you think that's been a headwind to additional newbuild ordering and sort of seaspan's fleet growth and sort of attached to that once it clears, do you expect another round of sort of orders to come through?
bing chen -- president and chief executive officer
well, i think it really depends on how quickly that the demand from the liner side that they would like to replace or increase the capacity of the fleet. as i mentioned earlier today, the fundamental change in the container shipping industry is the landscape of the market in the way that liner companies are very much consolidated. they are in general very disciplined. with that discipline in place, i would anticipate even with the returning to the normality, i believe that the growth of the newbuild will be primarily driven if that's going to be happen. i will be thinking that they will be driven by those continued newbuild vessels that with the better design and with different fuel intakes that type of vessels. in other words, primarily it's going to be driven by those carbon reduction initiatives and environmentally improved at newly designed the vessels. but i think that will be still be under -- under control. it would not be in the speculative manner because the industry is very much transparent and the demand has to come from the liner companies.
james -- citi -- analyst
got it. and then just real quickly, i just wanted to touch on capital structure and your asset base. you've mentioned unencumbered assets and unsecured debt, how should we -- unsecured debt rather, how should we think about sort of the mix of those in terms of target percentages, absolute amounts, just wanted to understand how you're thinking about that? and that's all from me. thanks.
graham talbot -- chief financial officer
i think on the unencumbered assets, there isn't an absolute target there. it's a matter of just continuing to grow that base, obviously is providing unsecured assets in the business to which we can use unsecured credit lines. on the unsecured mix, there is a number of targets out there. we're progressively sort of working up to 35 plus percent. obviously, it's a matter of balancing it out over time, and as we've discussed before, chris, the journey to investment grade it is not an imperative that we have to do tomorrow and we've got to balance out a number of different things here, which is also continuing to fund our growth, continuing to return capital to our shareholders and maintaining all of our debt covenants. so it's a finely tuned balanced and we are confident about our ability to manage those attributes as we move toward an investment grade rating over the next few years.
james -- citi -- analyst
thank you.
bing chen -- president and chief executive officer
thanks for the questions.
operator
thanks for the question. your next question is from randy giveans of jefferies. your line is open.
randy giveans -- jefferies -- analyst
bing and graham, how is it going?
graham talbot -- chief financial officer
very well, thank you.
bing chen -- president and chief executive officer
good. thank you, randy.
randy giveans -- jefferies -- analyst
good. i guess look at the newbuilding program, you have 69 newbuildings to be delivered. are all of these going to be new vessels or some be maybe a replacement for older vessels, i guess put another way, any updates on potential vessel sales to raise liquidity, given the strong secondhand market?
bing chen -- president and chief executive officer
randy, to answer your question, all the 69 newbuild vessels are brand new vessels. they're really new vessels. in terms of, are we looking to sell any vessels, as i said before, we are opportunistically looking at opportunities. the challenge of selling the vessels at the current market is that as all our vessels are under long-term contract. so we need to take into consideration of our customer relationship that needs and also at the same time and i think that with the long-term contracts already in place, that we have to be very selective looking at the right counterparty with the right opportunities then we would also consider selling of those vessels to those selective counterparties, but that will be very much opportunistic.
graham talbot -- chief financial officer
and maybe if i just add to that, randy. as we've discussed before, this is just a matter of economics valuation. the market is high in terms of vessel valuations, so it is tempting to recycle certain vessels in the fleet. but at the same time, we've got customers that have got some very high demand at the moment per tonnage. therefore when you run the economics, it's often difficult to justify a sale when you can actually put them back on contract term. so then it comes down to customer relationships and making sure that we look after our customers and take the right economic decision.
randy giveans -- jefferies -- analyst
and then you have $5.3 billion in debt -- financing secured for the newbuilding program, another, i think you said $1.6 billion in the advanced stages. so you'll have $6.9 billion against the $7.6 billion in assets. so that's i guess 90% financing on the newbuildings not overall. are there certain kind of leverage ratios required for an investment grade rating and with that investment grade rating, or i know the pursuit of that, any dividend constraints during this time? it seems like the dividend might be kind of capped here for the next few years during the delivery period, is that fair?
graham talbot -- chief financial officer
yes, so there aren't specific covenants, randy, from the ratings agencies in relation to this, but there is a number of different ways to view our business whether you're viewing it for a shipping business, or a leasing business, which gives rise to certain views and perspectives from the rating agencies. as you correctly point out on our newbuild financing, we are looking at an average ltv of around 90%. so it's an average. there are some 10 different packages involved with that 70 vessels and that's a fairly complex package of 20 or so different counterparties that we've worked with and there's a very exciting elements in there, but we're just working with the counterparties to organize press releases around those, which we will do in due course.
so obviously, the part of our journey to investment grade is actually raising more unsecured capital and then using that to pay down secured capital. so over time, we will be progressively looking to access the market again to rise relatively cheap capital through the high yield market, for example, and then use that to recycle out of secured capital. but the package that we put together here is very, very competitive and has some very unique elements to it. and i'm hopeful in the next few weeks that we will be able to communicate more details around the uniqueness of these financings.
randy, is still there or? operator?
operator
your next question is from benjamin nolan of stifel. your line is open.
macalla rogers -- stifel -- analyst
hello, everybody. my name is macalla rogers from stifel asking a question on behalf of ben nolan. i thank you all for the update and our question revolves around apr, is there any update on how you're thinking about the long-term strategic positioning of apr. pre-covid, the plan was to grow the gas fleet and focus more on long-term contracts, is that still the idea and is the market getting back to the point at which that is possible? thank you.
graham talbot -- chief financial officer
thanks, macalla. great question. bing, over to you. no, i was just going to say macalla that our strategy hasn't changed there. as you're aware, we had a very successful quarter last quarter with the turbine deployments. so our top priority is still to make sure that the current asset fleet is fully utilized or maximized as much as possible. but as we've stated previously, our ambition is to pivot the business to include more longer-term fixed price contracting for power generation and supply through both gas turbine business, but also through renewable energy. and as you are aware, we've now got some new management in place and we are currently working on building out that pipeline of opportunities and i would say that, yes, the market has shifted and there's certainly a lot more opportunities in the market we're seeing today than we had previously. and we are building a fairly robust portfolio of opportunities, which we're working on maturing at the moment.
macalla rogers -- stifel -- analyst
thank you very much. it's very helpful.
graham talbot -- chief financial officer
thanks, macalla.
operator
your next question is from omar nokta of clarksons securities. your line is open.
omar nokta -- clarksons securities -- analyst
thank you. hey guys, good morning. i just wanted to -- just wanted to follow up on bing's comments, obviously, one of the biggest topics in the industry today is the disruption and delays and all the port logistical issues and wanted to ask in terms of -- as operators of the ships, is there anything that the liners have asked you to do recently to help alleviate some of the logistical logjams? is there anything that could possibly be done from your side? just looking for any color you can give on that.
bing chen -- president and chief executive officer
yes, good morning, omar. i think that the one thing that has been constantly, i think we see increasingly from the liner companies that the demand for the ship owner and operator is the quality of service, the reliability, given the current challenge of the logistics and i think as we mentioned earlier, we actually have been able to achieve a very high utilization rate of our vessels. in this quarter it's 99%. as i mentioned, year-to-date, we actually changed our crew in the number of 5,800 and that is very, very significant in the way to alleviate or provide that kind of a reliable service to our liner customers while they're dealing with a lot of the port and logistical congestions.
as you also know, there are several incidences that've been happening over the past months and many of these incidences is due to the end of the quality of the -- the ship management and operators that cause a lot of additional, i would say,difficulty or challenges for the liner customers. so that's what the one areas i see that has been consistently demanding from our customers -- from our liner customers and also increasingly in the period during this -- the logistical challenge time. i don't know, peter, if you have anything else to add?
peter curtis -- chief commercial officer, seaspan
thanks, bing. yes, omar, i think that the -- essentially the unwinding of the disruption would take some time more and that the impact really as we've said several times before, is that it doesn't impact us in regards to our employment. the real essence that we can provide to our customers is, as bing said, is the operational excellence. what we've seen the -- probably the past six months an increase of speed of vessels, which of course demands reliability. so that's essentially the primary area that we can support.
bing chen -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. and the one -- the other aspect is, this is also something that we have been always -- been very proud of is, the load ability. i think our vessel actually last month achieved the maximum loadability of i think 10,000 teus, meaning a vessel of 10,000 teu actually load up 10,000 boxes --10,000 teu boxes. so in a very, i would say, high demand environment that the loadability difference, we will provide additional capacity to our customer, so in the way to help them to alleviate the demand and the shortage and that is also something that differentiates that the owners in the marketplace like ourselves where we have reliable, quality of service at the same time with these type of loadability i think it also helped alleviate their demand.
omar nokta -- clarksons securities -- analyst
thank you. that's very helpful. good color and a follow-up question. and you also talked about this in your opening remarks, and also in the q&a, just about the charter appetite excerpt for newbuildings. i just want to understand from your perspective, given you are very involved and at the forefront really a lot of the newbuildings, you were very active and you've got deliveries coming at '23 and '24. as it is today, do you get the sense that liners are taking kind of a wait and see approach for '25 and '26 deliveries, or is there still a good amount of demand there just all in the planning phases? what do you think about that?
bing chen -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, as i said earlier, i think that we do work regularly with liner customers. in general,i think liner customers are looking into the newbuild opportunities from the size, from the fuel proportion systems and from the design. this is something that is constantly in dialog and this is where we provide a lot of our own insight views as well as being able to work with all of the stakeholders, whether it's a shipyard, whether it's a clad society or the liner customers. generally, i believe that liner customers are very cautious about the newbuild because right now if you're looking at the slots, mostly the slots will be only available in 2025 and beyond.
so therefore realistically, if you put in any order most of the orders has to come for delivery in 2025 that is about four years down the road. at the same time and i think it's still there is, there is a certain uncertainty about how the demand is going to be look like and what are the potential other fuel sources could be used for the newbuild. so overall,i would say it's cautious and in a wait and see, but there are some liners that are still looking at potentially some newbuilds, as they are pretty certain about certain directions with the design and also the fuel they can adopt.
omar nokta -- clarksons securities -- analyst
great. thanks, bing, for that. i'll pass it on now.
bing chen -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
your next question is from ken hoexter of bank of america. your line is open.
ken hoexter -- bank of america -- analyst
hey, bing, graham, and team, congrats on being well-positioned to take advantage of the market. you noted some accelerating, -- you accelerate your targets back in 2q and rates have risen kind of exponentially since then, yet you didn't really tweak this year's targets, even at this point. you mentioned maybe you look at '22 next quarter. maybe give your updated thoughts on this year as we close out the year and then thoughts on that three-year outlook given the market exposure.
bing chen -- president and chief executive officer
sure, thank you. thank you, ken. you are right. we are not raising our guidance for 2021, but we strongly reaffirm our increased 2021 full-year guidance, which is published in q2 earnings. however, the increased guidance is very certain as we have all revenue have secured as i said for 2021. according to our policy, as graham mentioned earlier, we will provide a revised guidance for 2022 at our q4 and also at our investor day, we will provide a revised long-term projection for 2022 all the way to 2024 and beyond. the reason is that we are not adjusting, because our policies only adjust twice a year, but if you -- as we mentioned earlier that the our significant growth over the quarter is really driven by a variety of factors, one is that we have three ahead of the schedule newbuild deliveries and we have 15% of the index-based tc rates, we have 99% of the fleet utilization, we have 60 forward fixing and also, while our crew changes, obviously the logistic wise, the cost has increased, but that cost has been offsetted by our continued operational excellence in driving down the processes in automations. so net-net, our opex is only marginally increased -- immaterial increase over the quarter.
and looking forward, obviously i'm not providing the long-term projections here, but the one thing that i highlighted earlier, our business is very well positioned or is best positioned in the coming years. if you believe there are headwinds in those years, simply because as i said, we have very little charter that's going to be rolling off, ok? as i said, again i repeat, we have nothing for '21. we only have six for 2022 and we have 19 vessels for 2023. we have 31 for 2024 that is as of september 30. this is assuming we don't do any any forward fixing, but -- and at the same time for all those newbuild, that is -- 70 newbuild all of them are backed by long-term charter. so in terms of our business both in the current year, next year and the year after, is the most the certain business because the way our business model, because the way our contract is structured is exactly countered those economic and industry cycles and that's why we are very certain about our future performance in the years to come despite the fact of the market volatility or some general economic cycles.
ken hoexter -- bank of america -- analyst
great. thanks, bing. [indecipherable]
graham talbot -- chief financial officer
no, i was just going to add, as bing mentioned and we've discussed previously, we do have a small portion of our fleet, which we have on shorter-term contracts and for that shorter-term is actually still three to five years so it's not like spot, and those contracts, some of them are on context and some of the more broker rights and they reset on three months and six months sort of rests. so i know we've discussed previously about the uptick in the market, and when do we see it on that, that portion of our fleet and you're definitely seeing that in q3 of this year. so there has been a significant uptick in the rights for that portion of the fleet and the details of all of that's included in the supplemental data that's loaded up on the website for q3.
ken hoexter -- bank of america -- analyst
great. thanks. thanks, guys. if i can do a follow-up on apr. you're on -- you had some projects that ended. graham, you threw out there, in the quarter, they were more short-term. so can you talk to us about utilization expectations as you move to the fourth quarter and then maybe you mentioned, david sokol, who's on the line. so david, since you acquired apr within the seaspan family, and now, atlas corp. every move has been to add more containerships, which obviously great timing and great for the company. but what is the point now of having that conglomerate? why not spin out apr to allow the refined focus sounds like management's turned over a couple of times there to allow a refined focus given really the truly disparate entities and seaspan now kind of establishing its self-funding.
david sokol -- chairman
yeah, yeah, ken. great question. well, let me start with the fact that the focus of our board and our management team is to build an organization that lasts. historically, the small kind of owner-operator support mechanisms of the shipping sector if you look back five and 10 years, it was very short-term oriented trying to take advantage of price spikes and trying to avoid when possible the trough that occurs. that's not a game that we want to play and so the team led by bing and graham and torsten in operations, etc., had recognized that our liner companies need long-term support and we want to be a company that is sustainable over the decades in the future, not just a year or two, and that transition is really taken place and it started in mid-2017 and is really unfolded with clarity in the last year and a half as these newbuilds have come along.
i emphasize that before getting to your question with apr, because if you look at seaspan today and we are intending to do something similar at apr, but if you look at seaspan today, it's long-term contracts nearly $18 billion of long-term contract, no one in this industry has ever even approached numbers like that. and these charter lengths [phonetic] run as long as 18 years. with financings that matched those long-term charter rates. torsten and peter and the team have moved operational excellence to literally unheard of levels in the past. long-term injury rates down below 0.4 [phonetic], when for many in the industry numbers like 2 to 5 are not uncommon. on-time delivery for our customers have gotten extraordinary numbers.
again, the business is built around taking risk that we can manage and not taking risk we can't. so the port congestions for instance that you're seeing on the west coast that's not a problem we can manage, it's ultimately a political subdivision problem, if you will. and so we don't take those risks. so the fact that there is a lot of congestion is affecting a lot of shippers and that's unfortunate. people trying to move product, getting them ready for christmas, etc., but our economics don't change because we get paid whether the ships are waiting in line to get to the port or whether they're being unloaded and reloaded in the port.
again, emphasizing the fact that driving the company to be built to last to get our credit where it needs to be on a long-term basis, which dramatic improvements have taken place. so apr on the energy side is something that we want to do the same with. unfortunately from what's happened through covid, a month after we closed on apr. globally covid largely shut down emerging markets, largely shut down developed markets. so it has taken us longer, although i will say that the team that's in place now is highly focused, doing an excellent job of both keeping the short-term utilization rate high and moving to longer-term contracts. we've got a significant backlog of opportunities that are now being progressed. they've got significant opportunities that we're analyzing in some of the renewable fields around the world, but it's going to take time. just as it took time to get seaspan to where it's clearly a differentiated organization in the shipping industry is going to take us time for apr to get where it needs to be.
having said that, they've substantially outperformed our own expectations for 2021 and we expect continued performance in the future. but to get apr to the level of seaspan, it is going to take time. we haven't been shy about that. we've urged investors to look at seaspan on kind of a flat basis going forward -- i'm sorry, apr on a flat basis going forward, because we don't want to over-promise and under-deliver. but the same kind of dynamics are going to take place on the energy side, when you see such dramatic transitions in energy policy taking place globally and some very inconsistent energy policies that also provide opportunity. so getting rid of apr frankly wouldn't make sense from our perspective. we still look to long-term, have multiple platforms where we can run high-quality businesses in the infrastructure world, continue to grow them and make them very sustainable and very built to last rather than just short-term oriented.
so long term -- our long answer to your question, ken. but really from our board's perspective, notwithstanding the fact that we view the stock is substantially undervalued. we've all been around enough to know that when you perform at this level consistently long enough people pay attention, and we certainly have two large shareholders that believe in the future of the business and the management board does as well.
ken hoexter -- bank of america -- analyst
great. thanks, david. thanks, bing and graham. i appreciate the time.
bing chen -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
your next question is from michael goldie of bmo capital markets. your line is open.
michael goldie -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
thanks, guys, and good morning. hi guys. so we've been touching on this a little bit, but looking at longer term and shift toward carbon-free container shipping, do you expect this to eventually drive another wave of the newbuilding and one might that be 2030 time frame, further out? any thoughts there.
bing chen -- president and chief executive officer
hey, good morning, michael. i will answer that question. and peter, feel free -- and peter, torsten feel free to jump in. the answer to that is, i don't think so. because if we are looking at the carbon free initiatives, it is true that the vessel has to improve from two aspects. one is from the vessel design to improve the efficiency. the other one is looking at the fuel selections. the way we're looking at is that ultimately it's going to -- not going to be one solution. it will be multiple solution in the two categories, one will be in the areas of light gas, the other one will be in the liquid.
so if you're looking at the newbuild that we have done out of these 70, we have actually, have these two categories. one is lng, the other one is the conventional one, which is using the liquid fuel. and these vessels potentially could also be modified to take the future green fuel whatever those fuels are. so as the industry today still trying to look for the final solution still, i believe that even though there is no exact solution yet, but i think in terms of the path, it's probably there. and in terms of the newbuild assets, i would say still would be in these two categories. and also i think if that is the case, i would think there are some more potential retrofits of those vessels that could be used for future fuel whether it's hydrogen, methanol, ammonia or any other potential fuels.
and the other part is, looking at carbon-neutral is to looking at potentially the co2 capture on the vessels, so there are many different ways, i would think that similar to what we're looking at initially looking at the high sulfur in putting on the scrubber or burning the low-sulfur fuel. so in general, i would think that they will be the newbuilds and those newbuilds will take whatever the new, i would say, the fuel possibilities going forward, but i do not anticipate a massive wave of the newbuild of vessels adopting whatever the new solution, which today we still do not have.
peter curtis -- chief commercial officer, seaspan
bing, i'll add on to that, michael, i think that's a good question. i think building on what bing has mentioned about the future in terms of fuel choices, which i think we will precipitate some degree of newbuild into the future. bearing in mind that the liners today are very disciplined, they work within the alliances, which are very disciplined. so we don't see any of the -- any reason for some of the more sort of volatile traction [indecipherable] a number of years ago.
so on top of that, we also believe that the growth of the fleet that is sustainable in regards to global gdp growth. when you have a look at the curves of global gdp, they are not really volatile, of course, we've had a few shocks in 2008, 2009 and more recently, but generally there is a consistent growth and containerization of the meaningful globalization will follow suit. so the fundamentals we believe will require replacement of vessels in addition to the fleet capacity. and then last but not least is, when you look at global trades, it's not just what many of us tend to think of the main east-west trades like asia-europe or the transpacific, those two combined are daily 25% of global moves.
there are other trades that have grown significantly intra-asia, for example. intra-regional trades are well over 30% of global trade and as these different trade lines grow and the ports associated with those trade lines improve their facilities, so there is demand for additional vessels and vessels of different types and sizes to note 7,000 teu recently, 25 units. so i hope that provides some color to you.
michael goldie -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
that's helpful.
david sokol -- chairman
bing, if i could just add another comment to peter's comment, i think it's important to think about when you think about container shipping from a co2 standpoint, you start with the fact that there is no more efficient way to move goods around the world from a co2 perspective than shipping today already. now there is definitely going to be changes in fuel types and efforts -- significant efforts that both we're making and others are to become more co2 efficient and to find solutions in the future, but i think the industry has now gone through a couple of years of thinking about this problem along with governments that are represented in this discussion and it's becoming clear that there is some uncertainty as to what the right fuel is for say 2050 to get to full carbon-neutral, but that makes sense. in the sense that it's already in industry that's highly efficient, there is no way to move products around the globe anywhere near as efficiently as container shipping does, which speaks to its rapid growth over the years. but this transitioned to what the ultimate solutions will be, whether there are methanols or hydrogen or others, it's going to take time. in the meantime as bing said,enormous efficiency improvements are being made, shifts to lower -- lower carbon fuels are being made. that ultimate transition is going to take time for the -- the technology to exist both to produce the fuel storage and use it efficiently. so there will come a time obviously when there'll be a lot of either retrofits or newbuilds that use those fuels, but there are certainly not two or three years out.
michael goldie -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
okay. that's helpful, and also, kind of on that same topic as we over time move toward better co2 efficiency, is there further opportunity for consolidation in the lessor space as maybe some of the smaller players who are less sophisticated can't offer the same solutions.
bing chen -- president and chief executive officer
that's absolutely right, because as the further requirements on the co2 emissions that will put a lot of pressure on the lessors to be able to have, one, the team, the human resources, the expertise to work with the industry participants, the customers to develop the solution. the other part is also need to make the investments both the human capital and financial capital, and also the business -- the business platform required for those that who are able to meet these challenging requirements. so for those owners that will just provide the vessels, and i think they would have a difficult time to be able to provide that kind of solutions to the customer, whether it's from a human capital expertise perspective as well as from a capital perspective.
michael goldie -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
perfect. thank you.

operator

i would now like to turn the call over to robert weiner, head of investor relations at atlas corp. please go ahead, sir.
robert weiner -- investor relations
thank you, boina [phonetic]. good morning, everyone. thank you for joining us today to discuss atlas corp.'s third quarter 2021 earnings. we issued our earnings release yesterday evening after market close. we will refer to our quarterly earnings release, company earnings presentation and earnings supplemental workbook today in this conference. these all can be found on the investors tab on our website, atlascorporation.com.

i am now pleased to turn the call over to atlas corp.'s ceo, bing chen.
bing chen -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, rob, and good morning, everyone. thank you for joining our call. today, i will focus on differentiation of our business model, market dynamics and recent achievements of seaspan and apr energy. then i will hand over to graham talbot to present our q3 2021 results and financial update. please turn to slide 4.
now let's turn to atlas third quarter performance highlights. i'm very pleased to report continued strong performance in the third quarter of 2021. we continue to benefit from a robust container shipping market and the deployed apr's assets in new contracts and regions. in q3, atlas delivered robust revenue growth of 17%, adjusted ebitda growth of 29%, and adjusted earnings-per-share growth of 107.4% compared to the same quarter last year. all of seaspan's vessels were chartered for the full quarter achieving a utilization rate of 99%. as up to 15% of our fleet is exposed to floating index rates, we were able to benefit from the current market high. this together with our continued strong cost control drove our strong q3 performance.
apr executed two grid stabilization projects and achieved a q3 utilization of 92%. it is also in progress of building a pipeline of quality long-term growth opportunities. during the quarter, we continued to deliver quality growth through our customer partnerships, driven by our customers' demand. seaspan strategically added 25 new builds to its fleet in q3. we have now invested in total of 70 newbuild vessels in the past year, backed by 11.5 years of average charter term and generating $11.3 billion of gross contracted cash flows. we also continued creating consistent value for stakeholders across all aspects of our business.
we paid our 65th consecutive dividend, advanced our esg goals by issuing our inaugural sustainability report, executed ongoing improvements to our capital structure and continue to add new talent to our team, including board member, katie wade, and apr ceo, benjamin church. i would now like to talk about some of the operational drivers of our third quarter performance. please turn to slide 5. as one of our key competencies and differentiators, consistent operational excellence continues to drive our organization's performance. seaspan achieved an asset utilization rate of 99% in both q3 and since its ipo in 2005. this is evidence of consistently delivered industry-leading excellence, especially as it has been maintained throughout the unprecedented global pandemic.
despite the difficult operating environment, seaspan also successfully managed the fleet of 132 vessels with best-in-class operating safety with a historically low average monthly ltif of 0.37 over the last 12 months, and over 5,800, i repeat, 5,800 crew changes made year-to-date despite all logistic restrictions. our excellence in vessel operation and chartering is indeed a competitive differentiator. we partner with our customers to understand their needs and overcome their challenges through creative win-win solutions. for example, we analyze their vessel size needs, fuel adoption plans and supply demand forecasts to craft our solutions and foster deeper partnership.
another example of this partnership is seaspan's forward fixing of 60 charters year to date with our customers. this has resulted in zero charter wrote off in 2021 with just six in 2022 and 19 in 2023. i'm proud of our team's execution and our newbuild program and power project deployment. we recently took delivery of the msc carol, the first of five 12,200 teu newbuilds about two months ahead of the schedule. this marks seaspan's successful delivery of a total of 110 newbuilds in its 20-year history. we anticipate the remaining four sister vessels to follow the same ahead of the scheduled delivery with two vessels, the msc elena and msc rayshmi, expect to be delivered in november. our team's fierce execution and decades of expertise ensure the long-term consistent delivery of best-in-class vessels. apr successfully completed two mobile turbine deployments in q3, including apr's third consecutive annual project in mexicali.
please turn to slide 6. the container shipping market continues to experience favorable conditions. thanks to a strong recovery in the trade volumes combined with ongoing supply chain disruption, which has absolutely no impact to our business. global trade has rebounded and surpassed pre-covid level across all trade lanes attributed to stronger-than-expected improvements in global economics, pent-up purchasing demand, economic stimulus and changes in consumer spending patterns. the charter market is also thriving. the charter rates are at historical highs due to a lack of tonnage across all vessel classes. port congestions around the world, particularly in the us and china, which is a large contributor to the historically low of 0.7% idle fleet. land freight is also experiencing its own challenges with logistics difficulties limiting container distribution from the ports. seaspan continues to take advantage of this market upswing, working with our customers, develop long-term solutions through strategically these newbuilds, which all backed by long-term charters and forward fixing of charters at improved rate for long duration.
please turn to slide 7. market consensus does not expect these conditions to persist. as supply chain issues are resolved and newbuild order book delivered over the next four years, rates are expected to normalize to a more balanced equilibrium, while many of our peers take advantage of the current high rates through the short-term chartering at the expenses for long-term cash flow certainty. seaspan continues to focus on building long-term customer partnership with the focus on creating sustainable value and quality growth. we prioritize predictability over the short-term gains through long-term charters with quality counterparties, which is why our business model is resilient in all market conditions, such as the trade war and current pandemic. our 70 vessel newbuild program is a perfect example, contributing $11.3 billion of gross contracted cash flow over a weighted average charter duration of 11.5 years. the atlas business model is showcased by a set of industry-leading metrics such as our $17.9 billion of gross contracted cash flow, nearly 2 million teu fleet, average charter duration of 7.5 years, and average age of fleet of 4.7 years. these are unique in the market and insulate us from market volatility and it provides long-term predictable performance.
please turn to slide 8. our competitive differentiation in the market is clearly demonstrated when analyzing seaspan's history of being a trusted partner to the world's leading liners. seaspan has partnered with its customer for over 20 years, defining the industry's future pathway. we've built a reputation based on our operating excellence and newbuild expertise, supported by our track record of developing the most fuel-efficient designs and new vessel classes. we continue leveraging our expertise in the third quarter with the addition of 25 newbuilds of 7,000 teu vessels. they are all backed by a weighted average charter duration of 11.2 years producing over $4 billion of gross contracted cash flow. we've seen strong demand in the 7,000 teu segment as they are well positioned to replace and they redefine the aging 4,000 to 9,000 teu segments. this segment currently makes up approximately 40% of the existing global capacity, but represents less than 8% of the newbuild order book.
please turn to slide 9. we continue to focus on optimizing our best-in-class fleet composition and portfolio of top customers. year-to-date, while we continue to develop our fleet in the high demand 10,000 teu in larger segments, more recently, we strategically expanded our presence in the 7,000 teu segments. we also continue to deepen and diversify our customer base among the top 10 liner companies. we partnered with zim through numerous newbuilds and deepened our relationships with our existing customers. seaspan is pleased to partner with industry-leading customers who have proven their credit quality through record earnings and ample liquidity with several also recently receiving rating upgrades. while the industry has financially strengthened, we have reduced concentration of our top three customers by 19% over the past three years. this results in further increasing our credit quality profile.
please turn to slide 10. i would like to summarize, with this slide, which illustrates the progress and transformation atlas has achieved under the leadership of this management and their dedicated teams. recapping on our year-to-date progress through q3 2021, gross contracted cash flow increased by $12.8 billion. these are long-term predictable cash flows secured by quality customers. fully delivered fleet grew by 58%, adding 70 newbuilds and four secondhand vessels, increased the teu capacity by 83% to nearly 2 million teus on a fully delivered fleet basis. this is approximately 4.5 times larger than the industry average, decreased our fleet average age by 2.9 years to 4.7 years, less than half the average age of our competitors, and increased our fleet's remaining charter duration to 7.5 years, more than double the average duration of our competitors. these metrics are truly unique and substantially exceed our nearest competitors. no other company has delivered performance with the consistency and transparency as atlas has. these results are continuous evidence of atlas's unique and highly differentiated business model within our markets. we are confident to extend our leading position and return increasing value to all stakeholders.
i will now turn over the call to our cfo, graham talbot.
graham talbot -- chief financial officer
thank you bing, and good morning, everyone. if you could please turn to slide number 11. our q3 results were strong and continued to reflect the high performance of our team. during q3, atlas achieved performance relative to q3 2020, revenue growth of 17% to $451.9 million, adjusted ebitda growth of 29% to $322.2 million, ffo growth of 42.9% to $248 million and ffo per share growth of 36.8% to $0.93 per share. adjusted earnings per share diluted was $0.56, an increase of 107.4% and our closing liquidity was up by 123.8% to $957.1 million. we're pleased to report apr strong asset utilization of 91% for the third quarter, driven by previously announced grid stabilization projects in mexicali and california. both of these projects have now concluded and we're actively working on redeployment of the turbines.
we continue to demonstrate the resilience of our business model by delivering strong performance through all market conditions. while the industry is impacted by operational challenges presented by the pandemic and ongoing supply chain disruption, our revenues remain unaffected as we focus on supporting our customers in the efficient execution of their business. both businesses remain well positioned for the future, giving our team the confidence to reaffirm our 2021 financial guidance, which we increased following our strong performance in the first half of 2021.
please turn to slide 12. we continue to show these metrics as their improvement showcases the substantial progress this organization has achieved over the past four years. atlas has had a relentless focus on continuous improvement, operational excellence creative customer partnerships and quality growth, which are bound by disciplined capital allocation and driven by our financial strength. our improvements in the quality of our fleet and operations enhances our service to our customers, provides predictable performance and extends our industry-leading position in the market. this quality growth has been delivered alongside considerable increases in our unencumbered asset base and available liquidity through continuous improvements in our capital structure. we have managed our growth effectively from a credit perspective as we continue to pursue an investment grade credit rating and lower our cost of capital.
please turn to slide 13. during the third quarter, we continued our focus on strengthening and optimizing our balance sheet. specifically, we completed the upsized $750 million, 5.5% blue transition notes offering in the us high-yield market, which was well oversubscribed by top global institutional investors and price to reflect our substantial credit improvements. this was our inaugural issuance in this market something we've worked tirelessly toward and is a key element of the evolution of our capital structure.
during the quarter, we redeemed the remaining $300 million of fairfax notes. this completes the restructuring of the debt position with atlas. similar to when we exchanged $300 million of fairfax notes, the 7% preference shares last quarter, this quarter's completed redemption comes with a debt discount extinguishment of $71 million. so i'd like to reiterate, this is a non-cash charge and represents the accelerated amortization of the debt discount, which would have previously been recognized as interest over the tenure of the notes.
full redemption of $600 million fairfax notes highlights their continued support by removing debt with preferential terms, which enables us to simplify and create additional flexibility in our capital structure. fairfax continues to be a key and supportive investor in the atlas group. furthering our progress toward achieving investment grade rating, we are upgraded recently by kroll bond rating agency to bb plus along with the bb range of ratings from fitch and standard and poor's. these agencies commonly referred -- referenced seaspan's improvement in business risk management, our increasingly diversified customer base and funding sources as key drivers for their ratings. i also highlighted that our increasing unencumbered asset base and proportion of unsecured debt with supporting factors. we continue to assess opportunities to strengthen and simplify our balance sheet as we progress toward an investment-grade credit rating.
please turn to slide 14. this slide contains details of the progress of funding for our 70 newbuilds. we received considerable interest from the financing community to participate in these transactions and have leveraged our extensive banking relationships to tailor these financings to our requirements. we're happy to report that we have secured $5.3 billion of financing on attractive terms and an additional $1.6 billion of financing is in advanced stages and on target to close before year-end. this diverse and attractive portfolio of 10 financings is evidence of our industry-leading agility, creativity and overarching operational excellence.
our financing team has been meticulous in delivering competitive costs, tenures and flexibility across these facilities to meet our capital structure objectives. this has been delivered well ahead of our planned timelines and securing financing of this quality and magnitude in such a short time frame is a testament to atlas' dominant position in the capital markets, our access to capital and world-class execution from the seaspan team. this is a key element underpinning our growth strategy and i'm pleased we have secured these competitive financings ahead of schedule.
please turn to slide 15. in our q2 results, we presented a slide similar to this one. this has now been updated to include all 70 newbuild vessels announced to date, which resulted in an additional 839,000 teu and $11.3 billion of gross contracted cash flow. now that the delivery process is underway, we have updated the table to include details of vessel delivery status and we plan to provide ongoing updates on the programs progression quarterly.
to date, we've received the first of our 70 newbuilds. this 12,200 teu vessel was delivered approximately two months ahead of schedule and we forecast that the other four sister vessels will also be delivered ahead of schedule. please turn to slide 16. this slide illustrates the superior returns delivered by this leadership team, but along with our teams around the globe have achieved dramatic growth and financial performance over the past four years. this has been achieved through a diverse set of market conditions, which is further evidence of our resilient business model that delivers value through all market cycles. i'd like to highlight that adjustments made to performance metrics are one-off by nature and are excluded to assist the market in understanding the underlying performance of our business.
our organization continues to focus on delivering consistently strong performance and we look forward to demonstrating this through our updated 2022 guidance, which we will present during our fourth quarter earnings call. now please turn to slide 17 and i'll provide my summary comments before opening the line for questions.
i'd like to leave you with four key takeaways. first, atlas continued delivering quality growth driving a $17.9 billion long-term gross contracted cash flow balance with industry-leading counterparties. we do this by deepening our relationships and developing win-win solutions to meet customer needs, whether that be through newbuilds, secondhand acquisitions, forward fixtures, general rechartering or daily operational excellence.
second, the delivery of our newbuild vessels and associated financings are ahead of schedule. we've secured $5.3 billion of funding ahead of our planned schedule and nearly $1.6 billion of financing remains outstanding, which were well advanced and expect to close before year-end. we also took delivery of our first 12,000 teu -- 12,200 teu vessel ahead of schedule and expect that to be the case for the other four sister vessels. third, we are making significant progress on our journey to achieving investment-grade credit rating. our team continues to strategically optimize our balance sheet. we are now achieving bb range corporate ratings from three accredited rating agencies, one of which was an upgrade to bb+ in the third quarter.
and thirdly -- and finally, our financial performance is on track to achieve the updated 2021 guidance that we shared with the market at the end of q2. given our continued quality growth in the third quarter and multiple newbuild vessels expected to be delivered ahead of schedule, we are confident in surpassing our previously stated long-term guidance. not only is our team confident in our future but we have also recently had a strong indication of the confidence from the washington family and affiliates, who recently purchased 2.5 million shares of atlas at an average price of $15.34 in september. this is a great signal and vote of confidence from a smart and capable investor and we continue to appreciate their support as the original founding shareholder.
thank you for your interest today. operator, we'd now like to open the line to questions. thank you.
