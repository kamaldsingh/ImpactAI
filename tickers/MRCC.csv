welcome to monroe capital corporation's second-quarter 2019 earnings conference call. before we begin, i would like to take a moment to remind our listeners that remarks during this call today may contain certain forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our goals, strategies, beliefs, future potentials operating results and cash flows. although we believe these statements are reasonable based on management's estimates, assumptions and projections as of today, august 7th, 2019, these statements are not guarantee of future performance. further, time-sensitive information may no longer be accurate as of time of any replay or listening.
actual results may differ materially as a result of risks, uncertainties and other factors, including, but not limited to, the factors described from time to time in the company's filings with the sec. monroe capital takes no obligation to update or revise these forward-looking statements. i would now like to turn the call over to ted koenig, chief executive officer of monroe capital corporation.
ted koenig -- chief executive officer
good morning, and thank you to everyone who has joined us on our call today. as always, i'm joined by aaron peck, our cfo and chief investment officer. last evening, we issued our second-quarter 2019 earnings press release and filed our 10-q with the sec. for the second quarter, we generated adjusted net investment income of $0.35 per share, in line with our quarterly dividend of $0.35 per share. this represents the 21st consecutive quarter we have covered our dividend with adjusted net investment income.
our continued dividend coverage is a testament to the overall monroe capital platform, our unique origination capabilities and our credit underwriting and portfolio management process. at quarter end, our investment portfolio had a fair value of $630.8 million, a 33.9 million or 6% increase from the prior quarter end, and included investments in 87 companies across 21 different industry classifications. the increase in the size of the investment portfolio was primarily due to an increase in new deal fundings during the quarter. in the quarter, we had $60.5 million of investment fundings, partially offset by $24.7 million of sales, repayments and prepayment activity. this new deal momentum and asset growth is the direct result of our proprietary deal origination team located in multiple offices throughout the u.s.
and our broad industry vertical coverage of the following areas: business services, healthcare, technology, software, specialty finance, and of course, the middle-market pe community. as of june 30th, our largest position, not including the investments in our mrcc senior loan fund joint venture, which we refer to as the slf, represented 3.7% of the portfolio in our 10 largest positions, excluding our investments in the slf, were 27.3% of the portfolio. our portfolio is heavily concentrated in senior secured loans and specifically first lien secured loans. 92.9% of our portfolio consists of secured loans, and approximately 90% is first lien secured. we are pleased with the construction, diversity and the senior secured nature of our investment portfolio at this point in the credit cycle. as of the end of the second quarter, our slf had experienced portfolio growth to $235.6 million in fair value, a 24% increase from $189.6 million at fair value at the end of the prior quarter.
weighted average yield in the slf portfolio declined slightly to 7.5% when compared to the end of the prior quarter. as of quarter end, the slf had debt outstanding on its leverage facility of $143.3 million at a rate of approximately 4.8% or libor plus 2.25%. we have worked purposefully to create approximately $224 million of fixed-rate longer-term liabilities going into this next credit cycle. the recent amendment and upsize of our revolving credit facility, coupled with the increase in the 2023 notes, provided us with both significant amount of additional borrowing capacity, which has helped fuel our growth and allows us the flexibility to continue to take advantage of the reduced asset coverage ratio requirements as we implement the regulatory relief from the small business capital availability act. we have purposely positioned mrcc to be able to proactively take advantage of organic growth, as well as any inorganic growth opportunities that may be presented to us. i am now going to turn the call over to aaron, who is going to discuss the financial results in more detail. 
aaron peck -- chief financial officer and chief investment officer
thank you, ted. during the quarter, we funded a total of $56.7 million in loan investments. additionally, we funded $3.8 million in equity to the slf. this growth was offset by partial sales and repayments on portfolio assets, which aggregated $24.7 million during the quarter. at june 30th, we had total borrowings of $412.6 million, including $188.6 million outstanding on our revolving credit facility, $109 million of our 2023 notes and sba debentures payable of $115 million.
future portfolio growth will predominantly be funded by the substantial availability remaining under our revolving credit facility and the uninvested cash held in our sbic subsidiary. as of june 30th, our net asset value was $255.9 million, which is down slightly from the $259.1 million in net asset value as of march 31. our nav per share decreased 1% from $12.67 per share at march 31st to $12.52 per share as of june 30th. this decrease was primarily as a result of unrealized mark-to-market valuation adjustments. turning to our results for the quarter ended june 30th.
adjusted net investment income, a non-gaap measure, was $7.1 million or $0.35 per share, consistent with the prior quarter's results. at this level, per share adjusted nii covered our quarterly dividend of $0.35 per share. looking to our statement of operations. total investment income for the quarter was $16.7 million, compared to $16.2 million in the prior quarter.
the increase in total investment income for the quarter was primarily as a result of an increase in interest income principally due to portfolio growth. fee income during the quarter was below our historical average levels, driven primarily by only a small amount of prepayment activity during the quarter. moving over to the expense side. total expenses for the quarter of $9.6 million included $5.1 million of interest and other debt financing expenses, $2.7 million in base management fees, $0.9 million in incentive fees net of voluntary fee waivers of $0.3 million, and $0.9 million in general, administrative and other expenses. total expenses increased by $0.5 million during the quarter, primarily driven by an increase in interest and other debt financing expenses as a result of growth in our borrowings to support the growth of the portfolio. regarding liquidity.
as of june 30th, we had approximately $66.4 million of capacity under our revolving credit facility. as of the end of the quarter, we had fully drawn all of our 115 million in sba debentures. as of june 30th, the slf had investments in 63 different borrowers aggregating $235.6 million at fair value with a weighted average interest rate of approximately 7.5%. the slf had borrowings under our nonrecourse credit facility of $143.3 million and $26.7 million of available capacity under this credit facility. at this level of funding, the equity in slf is generating a dividend yield of approximately 10% to mrcc and our jv partner.
we would expect the slf to continue to grow over the next few quarters. i will now turn the call back to ted for some closing remarks before we open the line for questions.
ted koenig -- chief executive officer
thanks, aaron. since going public with our ipo in 2012, we have generated a 48.6% cash-on-cash return for our shareholders based on changes in nav and dividends paid since our ipo assuming no reinvestments of dividends. we believe this performance compares very favorably to our peers and puts mrcc in a small group of bdcs that have delivered this level of performance for shareholders. based on our pipeline of both committed and anticipated deals, we expect to continue our new investment momentum for the remainder of the year with growth in both our core portfolio and within the slf. we continue to believe that monroe capital corporation provides a very attractive investment opportunity to our shareholders and other investors for the following reasons: no.
1, our stock pays a current dividend rate of approximately 12%. no. 2, our dividend is fully supported by a consistent adjusted net investment income coverage for the last 21 straight quarters. no.3, we have a very favorable shareholder-friendly external advisor management agreement in place that limits incentive management fees payable in periods where there was any material decline in our net asset value; and no.4, we're affiliated with a best-in-class external manager with offices located throughout the u.s.
with over 115 employees and approximately $8.2 billion in assets under management today. mrcc is one of the few bdcs that has access to distinct proprietary deal flow, which over the long term should result in differentiated returns and an increase in shareholder value. thank you all for your time today. and with that, i'm going to ask the operator to open the call for questions.

[operator instructions] our first question comes from tim hayes from b. riley fbr. your line is open.
tim hayes -- b. riley fbr -- analyst
hey, good morning, guys. thanks for taking my questions. my first one here, just wondering if you can give us some of the characteristics of the new investments this quarter. and as we move into the later innings of the credit cycle, are you doing anything differently or looking at -- deal a little differently, whether it's the industries you're focusing on, maybe going -- i know you're predominantly first lien, but still kind of increasing concentration there, doing larger deals or anything with leverage multiples?
aaron peck -- chief financial officer and chief investment officer
yeah, thanks. the deals we did in the quarter are very consistent with the types of deals we've always done. continue to be relatively conservatively leveraged first lien deals. predominantly sponsor-backed transactions are what we're seeing today.
as a firm, we typically are doing deals that average around 50% loan to value, between 4 and 4.25% on average multiple of ebitda. so -- and we're not seeing any continued decline in spreads, so it's pretty consistent with the spreads that we've been seeing. so there's not really any difference in the trends of the new deals we're doing. as for things we might be doing differently as the cycle continues to extend, we've been underweighting the more cyclical borrowers for some period of time now, and that continues. we're definitely more careful about cyclicals, doing much fewer deals that -- in cyclical industries.
and when we will take on a cyclical industry, we're doing at a very conservative leverage. but that's really what we're seeing in the market today and what we've been focusing on.
tim hayes -- b. riley fbr -- analyst
ok. and then this kind of goes hand-in-hand with that. just wondering, if we look at regulatory leverage, it shot through one times this quarter. and if we rewind the clock back a year, you were at 0.4 or 0.5, give or take, and we're targeting one times leverage.
this is a bit higher than maybe we would have expected this quarter. just wondering if you -- what your target leverage range is now. and if you would say kind of originations over the past year have been a bit maybe less risky in certain ways than the preceding year as you've been able to take up leverage.
aaron peck -- chief financial officer and chief investment officer
yeah. no. i think if you look back, tim, we've said for a while since the change in the rules that we intended to go above one to one. so that shouldn't be a big surprise.
maybe the velocity with which we were able to do it is surprising to you, but it's not surprising to me because monroe has always had a very, very active pipeline. and with the lower leverage limitations prior to the change, we were -- bdc was forced to pass on a lot of opportunities because the yield was too low to generate commensurate roe. so i'd say what we've said for a while to investors, and i think it's consistent with what we've done, is as the additional regulatory leverage is available to us, it'll allow us to take on some of the deals that we view as slightly less risky, which, if you believe in an efficient market, which i do, also involve some deals that are slightly lower spread. but that is -- so that is consistent with what we've said, which is we intend to bring it up over one to one.
we are, i believe, taking on deals that are maybe on the margin less risky than what we had done in the past. and we continue to expect to grow our regulatory leverage over the next couple of quarters, i'd say. i don't know where we'll wind up. it really depends on how the portfolio shakes out in the new origination shakeout, but i'd say think of it as maybe up to 1.25 to 1.3 times kind of regulatory leverage as a next target.
and then we'll certainly update next quarter with what we're seeing in the pipeline and where regulatory leverage should go.
tim hayes -- b. riley fbr -- analyst
ok, got it. thanks for the comments.

our next question comes from christopher nolan from ladenburg thalmann. your line is open.
christopher nolan -- ladenburg thalmann -- analyst
hey, guys. aaron, the fair value in rockdale went up a little quarter over quarter. was that simply change in the discount rate?
aaron peck -- chief financial officer and chief investment officer
it's really in the margin, i think. it's not a particularly material change. so i wouldn't read much into it. it's just as you go through sort of a waterfall analysis and look at how things sort of play out on the valuation side, they have small shifts up and down.
so there was some, i think, in the estate some realization of certain assets in the estate, so that has something to do with it as well.
christopher nolan -- ladenburg thalmann -- analyst
ok. on sba, i know that you guys have fully tapped it out. but reading the q, it looks like the -- you can capitalize this up for $175 million in borrowings. is that an option here? or is there a family of funds type of thing going on?
aaron peck -- chief financial officer and chief investment officer
yeah. there's a family of funds limitation that we're at today. i think over time, we're going to look at what happens as our older sba -- sbic license starts to pay down debentures, and we may be able to revisit that. but for now, i would not look at us as having any near-term additional availability of debentures.
but what we really can do to help here, what we're trying to work on doing is getting some of the cash that's sitting in the sbic today to work over the next couple of three quarters. obviously, it's difficult to find deals in a competitive environment that are sbic-eligible. but we're hopeful that we can find some good deals in the pipeline, and there are a couple now that look like they could qualify. and so, getting that cash to work is really going to be a good help in driving nii performance.
because right now, we're just sitting on cash, which we could put directly into deals.
christopher nolan -- ladenburg thalmann -- analyst
got you. and finally, what's the spillover income for the quarter?
aaron peck -- chief financial officer and chief investment officer
yeah. hang on, i have that right here. today, the spillover income is approximately $9.9 million, about $0.48 a share.
christopher nolan -- ladenburg thalmann -- analyst
right. i'll get back to you.
aaron peck -- chief financial officer and chief investment officer
thank you, chris.
operator
our next question comes from brian hogan from william blair. your line is open.
brian hogan -- william blair and company -- analyst
a quick on education corporation of america. can you give like just some color on what drove the writedown there this quarter and then the outlook for just the rest of your nonaccruals in general and the timing of the resolution?
aaron peck -- chief financial officer and chief investment officer
so yeah. i think what you have to look at there is eca has basically been split into two investments now. so that's the confusion here. eca had an asset that's called necb, new england college of business, which is a performing school that's doing ok and was a good ongoing asset.
and so, basically, through the receivership situation there, we've credited a bit some of the debt and taken over necb. so when you look at the marks, you sort of have to look at it by combining eca and necb. and more or less, when you look at it that way, the valuation hasn't really changed quarter to quarter.
brian hogan -- william blair and company -- analyst
ok. and then the outlook for resolution of nonaccruals in general timing-wise?
aaron peck -- chief financial officer and chief investment officer
yeah. i mean, we've -- the only real update i can give you, look, the eca situation is going to be ongoing for a period of time. that's going to be extended. the rockdale situation ought to have some resolution in the next quarter or two.
it's -- the arbitration there is happening as we speak, and we'll see -- it'll take some time for that case to get through all the arguments, and then the arbitrator has some time to make a decision on what he wants to do. so i would expect to see that resolve itself, if not in the third quarter, maybe into the early part of the fourth quarter. we'll obviously update. the other nonaccruals, just as a reminder because this is a constant source of confusion. we have a couple of names where a portion of the holding is on nonaccrual because there are situations in which we took over a piece of debt or a piece of paper that we didn't pay for as part of a restructuring.
that includes the promissory note at curion and a third lien piece at incipio, and those are the only parts of those that are on nonaccrual. there was really no cost associated with those two. and so, i don't know. the only time those would ever really go in accrual would be if there was a massive recovery in the business.
but because those are no cost, i mean, it doesn't make any sense to put them on accrual status. and then there's a small piece of preferred millennial brands that we don't really expect to ever see value from. those are all the nonaccruals.
brian hogan -- william blair and company -- analyst
and then on the competitive front, can you talk about kind of like the deal flow? how competitive is it? and then also, like quantity and the quality of the deal flow? any changes there?
ted koenig -- chief executive officer
yeah, this is ted, brian. maybe i'll take that one. the market is competitive. it's always been competitive.
nothing has really changed in that regard. we're -- for us, the way we look at things is that we're competing in a competitive marketplace that everyone else is competing in. but because of the vertical businesses we have and the strength we have and the amount of direct originators and the offices, what we've tried to do is create a little bit of a differentiated model. our platform, the monroe platform has grown substantially. we're over 8 billion today.
early last year, we were probably 5 billion. and it's -- the growth is primarily driven through proprietary relationship deals and deals that we have a special expertise in, whether it's specialty finance or software or technology or healthcare. and we're winning most of our fair share of those deals. in the general market with the middle market pe business, we're getting our share, but i will tell you that that share has always been a competitive process. and today, there's lots of firms in our business that have capital, and some are willing to go higher on leverage or lowering the rates.
and those are market dynamic factors that we're not going to be able to change and we're not going to be able to control. so from our standpoint, we try to deal with that as best we can, and that is identifying and closing on opportunities that are not being chased by everybody else or deals where we have some competitive advantage in as a platform. just to give you some perspective on this, we did 75 transactions last year. and that's 75 transactions out of about a total of 2,000 looks or inbound logged transactions. that was 2018.
2017, we did about 72 transactions. that was 72 transactions out of over, again, 2,000 looks. so i'm not concerned about getting deals done. we've got plenty of looks with over 2,000 opportunities a year in the platform.
what i'm more focused on as an organization is the quality of the deals and making sure that we're staying focused, as aaron said, on somewhere around 50% loan to value and deals that hit our return thresholds. it's easy to put money out in this business. it doesn't take a lot of originators, it doesn't take a big organization or a big infrastructure. we've got 116 people, i think, today in six offices throughout the country.
what makes -- what's hard in our business is to get the right combination of leverage and return, and that's really where we're focused on today.
brian hogan -- william blair and company -- analyst
all right. and then last question for me -- actually, two, a couple of housekeeping. the fee income, i know it's very lumpy in nature, but can you kind of give the outlook? do you expect it to bounce back or -- a run rate level of kind of, call it, normal level that you're thinking about? and then one follow-up.
ted koenig -- chief executive officer
the fee income -- aaron can chime in here. but fee income, brian, is direct relationship to payoffs, the early payments. and the last several quarters, with interest rates being steady and pe firms buying companies for very large multiples, there hasn't been the incentive to refi early or pay off early. several years ago, there was a much lower holding period with pe firms because they were tending to turn their deals quicker.
now with the multiples that are being paid, it's much harder to turn your deal in the first year or two and generate prepayment fees for us. and generally, deals are staying longer in the portfolio. so i'm not anticipating a significant increase in fee income. now that said, we had an abnormal quarter, where we had very little of it. so i think that from our standpoint, it's episodic.
we can't count on it. aaron can give you maybe some overall feel for it. but i think that it's going to be more muted than it was in the last couple of years.
aaron peck -- chief financial officer and chief investment officer
i wish i could give you more guidance. it's really completely something we can't predict and really have no idea. it is true that it was much lower this period. on average, we had a higher level of prepayment activity and fee income associated with that. i will also say that early in the fund's life, we were able to get higher prepayment penalties associated with deals.
and in the more recent couple of three years, there's been a lower level of prepayment fees as well so that when we do get prepayments, they tend to be lower fees associated with them. but if you look, fee income this quarter was $60,000., i mean, we've never -- i can't remember the last time we had a number like that. last quarter before that was about $560,000. so definitely sort of an aberration.
and -- but then again, could it be that again next quarter? yes, it probably could be, but i don't expect it to be. but we really don't know. and payoffs tend to end up coming closer to end of quarters, as well as i don't have a lot of visibility for you, unfortunately.
brian hogan -- william blair and company -- analyst
all right. and then last question from me is, with the increased leverage, you're talking 1.25 and maybe obviously, you can go up to two but i know you wouldn't take it there. but obviously, it drives more assets, and i know other bdcs have reduced some of their management fees for assets above the one to one ratio. i mean, have you given that kind of any thought of reducing the base management fee on any level of assets?
aaron peck -- chief financial officer and chief investment officer
yeah. so we're really focused on delivering returns to shareholders in the form of nii-covering dividend. and so, what we have chosen to do to date is to look at waiving fees voluntarily to make sure we're covering. and we're going to continue to monitor sort of our performance level, and we'll make decisions about that in the future if we think that it's warranted based on our ability to cover.
i think if you look at where we are in nii coverage today, all things being equal, if we could get the cash to work in the sbic subsidiary, which we're working hard to do, and if we could try to get some of the money that's locked up in nonaccruals out and reinvested in accrual assets, our visibility for coverage looks really good. and to my thinking, at least today, if we're delivering a dividend yield where we have -- a lot of bdcs have cut dividends over the last several years. we never cut a dividend. we've only increased it once and have never cut.
if we can cover the dividend and continue to cover it with room over a long period of time, i feel like we're doing a pretty good job for shareholders. but we'll watch it. we'll monitor it. and the board will revisit it in the future, and we'll continue to think about it and look at it.
but to date, we haven't made a determination. you got to remember that we have a business model, as ted just went through, that includes a lot of people. we've really invested in infrastructure of people here to generate the unique deal flow. and i think if you look at a lot of other bdcs our size, you'll find that their employee base is considerably smaller than ours.
operator
our next question comes from robert dodd from raymond james. your line is open.
robert dodd -- raymond james -- analyst
actually, you answered a lot of it with the comments about the fee income, but just kind of a follow-up on that. obviously, for asset-light stretch, particularly if rates fall and spreads widen, but you mentioned that prepayment fee structures have compressed. i mean, what's the norm that you're seeing out in the market right now? i mean, maybe three, four years ago, it was kind of a three to one. and obviously, assets that were put on then, if they repay within that, you get more.
but what's kind of the norm -- kind of a going rate today in the market that you see it?
aaron peck -- chief financial officer and chief investment officer
yeah. look, every deal is different, and it depends on whether it's sponsored or non-sponsored, and it depends what industry it's in. but yes, i think you're right. it was much more common to see kind of a three to one structure going back several years.
what you're seeing these days is private equity firms are heavily negotiating. we're seeing it more often to be more like a two to one structure, sometimes it's even one to one and a half in the first year of prepayment. and also, a lot of the market has moved toward only earning a prepayment penalty on a refi. but on the sale of the company, a lot of times it gets waived.
and so, i wouldn't say that you can look at our portfolio and apply those numbers across the entire portfolio because it is a very different deal ideal. some of the stuff we're doing in specialty finance has sometimes lockouts on prepayment and has make-wholes, but that's not at all the most common. and the most common is more like a two to one structure with a waiver if there's a sale of the company.
ted koenig -- chief executive officer
yeah. i mean, robert, there's -- i want to have one follow-up to your question. you didn't focus on this particularly, but i'm going to tell you why, from a prepayment standpoint, there's been less flow of variability in our side. as i said earlier, we made a conscious decision to focus on safety.
and with some of the higher-risk deals with much higher leverage, we're taking more risk. there's much more variability you can negotiate in back-end prepayment success fees, things like that. when the market allowed us to play in a lower-leveraged market and we weren't funding the same level as we are today, we were trying to pack in different upside features in deals, and we were relatively successful doing that. today, at this juncture, with the economy, credit cycle, tariffs, uncertainty coming out of the white house, fighting with most of our allies today, i'm very concerned and i want to make sure that we're doing everything in our power to protect our shareholders and our portfolio.
so i will tell you that over the last probably year or so since the government shutdown, we've been very much focused on not taking risks that could come back to hurt us here long term. and that's why i think you've seen maybe a falloff of some of the other fees that historically we've generated in the past. so that said, we're still going to be aggressive when we can. but i'm much more focused going forward here in the near-term cycle on protecting capital than i am trying on to swing for the fences here with certain returns. and that's an industry issue.
i will tell you that not all managers, from what i'm seeing, are doing that. and it's just all a function of the platform. we've built a pretty successful platform here at monroe, and my focus is on maintaining the consistency of the dividend and the stability of the dividend.
operator
we do have a follow-up from christopher nolan from ladenburg thalmann. your line is open
christopher nolan -- ladenburg thalmann -- analyst
is it fair to say that you guys are targeting larger deals? i ask because the parent organization is now $8 billion of aum. and with a fund that size, i imagine that you're focusing on larger opportunities just to move the needle. so is that applying to mrcc as well?
ted koenig -- chief executive officer
we're doing both, christopher. we haven't left the markets that we've historically played in because that's where we're known. but the benefit of having a larger platform is that we're also getting the opportunity to participate in some of the larger deals just because we're a larger player. and other groups want parts of our deals so we tend to be sharing more on the larger-deal basis.
but with respect to the same markets that we've always played in, our firm is still a 5 million to 35 million ebitda size company, and our average ebitda has always been in that 15 to $20 million range. and that's still true today, even though our firm has grown substantially.
christopher nolan -- ladenburg thalmann -- analyst
follow-up question is, as of a year or two ago, following up on tim hayes' question. you guys are covering the dividend with like a 65% leveraged regulatory debt-to-equity ratio. that doesn't seem to hold anymore for various reasons. i mean, should we look at the new normal that you need a regulatory debt-to-equity ratio over one-time to cover the dividend?
aaron peck -- chief financial officer and chief investment officer
yeah. i mean, i think, look, i think a lot of it has to do with the nonaccruals. so the fact that we unfortunately had a growth in the nonaccruals has been part of the reason that we've -- that we're probably not able to generate the same level of nii at a lower leverage. but also, rates are different.
i mean, rates are coming down again, and so that's not ideal for us. we have done a lot of good things to try to help that, including getting our cost of borrowing down. but yes, look, i mean, i think it -- given what our asset -- and what i mean by that is while you haven't seen a major change in our average coupon in terms of total yield on a spread basis, it's narrower than it was. it went up.
as rates went up, spread was down a little. and so, i don't want to guide you that there's a specific regulatory leverage level we need to cover the dividend, but it's definitely higher than that kind of 55-ish percent regulatory leverage that we're at. we -- by the way, we never wanted to be at that level of leverage. we always thought that was too low.
we were successful back then in being in a position to build and raise capital, both on an equity basis accretive to nav and also through the bond market. and so, we were in this recycling mode, where we are paying down the facility and then reborrowing, which artificially kept our leverage lower than we expected it to be. but we're really comfortable given the portfolio mix being at the regulatory leverage levels that we've guided toward. and as i said earlier, if we can get the cash to work in the sbic and we can resolve some of these non-accruals and get them into earning assets, i think we should be in pretty good shape with regards to dividend coverage.
christopher nolan -- ladenburg thalmann -- analyst
ok. thanks guys.
operator
i'm showing no further questions at this time. i'm going to turn the call back over to ted koenig for some closing remarks.
ted koenig -- chief executive officer
thank you. firstly, we appreciate all of you joining on the call today. i realize that people are busy. there's lots of things happening in the economy.
and i will tell you that for -- from a firm, at monroe, we're very, very focused on not only the industry issues that we're facing, but also some of the macro issues. we've got fortunately the size of a platform today where we can spend some time doing more research and doing more industry analysis, and it's been a nice thing to do at a time and place where there's lots of uncertainties in the market. so the one thing that i want to leave you with today is that we're in an uncertain market and things are happening very often beyond our control as investors. and some of the things that happen from time to time that are beyond our control very really affect industries, in particular, companies in those industries, and it's very hard to predict. so what we've tried to do is take our business down and simplify a lot of the moving pieces to it in our analytics and in our portfolio management and monitoring.
so we're going to continue to do that, and we'll be back to you next quarter with a report. hopefully, we'll see more stability in world affairs and other things that are happening that are the more uncontrollable factors. but for the time being, i want to assure you that we're doing our jobs, and we're digging in hard, and we're spending a lot of time on the portfolio side. we've hired several additional resources into the firm on the portfolio analytics side, as well as on the special assets and work outside. and that's a real distinct difference in the monroe platform. so i want to thank you all for joining.
enjoy the rest of the summer, and we'll be back at you in september quarter. and again, as always, to the extent you have any individual questions, please feel free to reach out to aaron. we're always -- we always enjoy speaking to you on a periodic basis. so thank you again.

welcome to monroe capital corp.'s fourth-quarter and full-year 2019 earnings conference call. before we begin, i would like to take a moment to remind our listeners that remarks made during this call today may contain certain forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our goals, strategies, beliefs, future potential, operating results or cash flows although we believe these statements are reasonable based on management's estimates, assumptions and projections as of today, march 4, 2020. these statements are not guarantees of future performance. further, time-sensitive information may no longer be accurate as of the time of any replay or listening.
actual results may differ materially as a result of risks, uncertainty or other factors, including, but not limited to, the factors described from time to time in the company's filings with the sec. monroe capital takes no obligation to update or revise these forward-looking statements. i will now turn the conference over to ted koenig, chief executive officer of monroe capital corp.
ted koenig -- chief executive officer
good morning, and thank you to everyone who has joined us on our call today. i'm joined by aaron peck, our cfo and chief investment officer. last evening, we issued our fourth-quarter and full-year 2019 earnings press release and filed our 10-k with the sec. for the fourth quarter, we generated adjusted net investment income of $0.37 per share, higher than our quarterly dividend of $0.35 per share and higher than our adjusted net investment income of $0.35 per share in the third quarter.
this represents the 23rd consecutive quarter we have covered our dividend with adjusted net investment income. turning to the market. we continue to believe that overall business conditions remain solid in the lower middle market, which we define as companies generating $35 million of ebitda and below. we believe mrcc is well-positioned in this market.
both small and medium-sized middle market companies are increasingly turning to private credit asset managers who are nonregulated lenders for financial solutions. we see evidence of this by the fact that monroe reviews approximately 2,000 investment opportunities each year. the major reason for this is our proprietary origination platform. these deals tend to be lower leveraged and have better credit and covenant structures than deals in upper end of the middle market today.
one of our most important sources of deal flow is from our own existing borrowers. this allows us to expand and grow our best customers. our incumbent portfolio accounted for 37% of our investment fundings in 2019 and 63% in the fourth quarter. we believe that these opportunities provide attractive proprietary investments as we typically have had the experience and time to observe company and management performance before increasing our exposure to these borrowers.
that is the positive side of the coin. the negative side is that there continues to be strong flows of new capital into our sector. newer entrants tend to put pressure on both pricing and loan structures. this trend is magnified in the broader middle market, which we define as borrowers with ebitda higher than $35 million per year.
in the lower part of the middle market where monroe has built a significant sustainable brand, we do not see much of this type of behavior, and while our part of the market has seen increased competition and reduced yields primarily due to lower libor spreads, we have been able to maintain reasonable spreads and strong covenant packages and deal structures. given our underwriting standards and credit focus, we find that we are passing on more and more deals in the market currently. despite seeing very limited signs of market weakness, we tend to be more industry and sector specific. we remain acutely aware that we are likely in the later innings of a long cycle of expansion in the u.s.
economy. in addition, we have added uncertainty of what will likely be a divisive 2020 presidential election campaign and still unknown long-term economic impacts of the coronavirus. as a result of this uncertainty, combined with a commonative monetary policy witnessed by yet another rate cut this week, we feel interest rates will be lower for longer. we believe this combination of factors will contribute to more of a wait-and-see approach from borrowers and private equity sponsors.
as a defensive measure, over the past several quarters, we have continued to focus on our origination efforts on industries and companies that we believe are less cyclical, and we have been careful not to follow the larger market in pushing average leverage up in structuring deals with either no covenants or extremely loose covenants. most all of our deals are structured to include libor floors, which helps to maintain our yield given the recent pullback in rates. additionally, we have reduced our regulatory leverage during the most recent quarter. we have remained disciplined in our origination and underwriting and continue to structure deals with strong covenant packages, which we believe is important.
our ability to maintain this discipline and remain selective in the deals we close is the direct result of our large proprietary deal origination team, which consists of 22 origination professionals located in multiple offices throughout the u.s. and our broad industry vertical coverage teams in the following areas. business services, healthcare, technology, media, software, specialty finance, real estate, and of course, the middle market private equity community. across the monroe platform, we evaluated approximately 2,040 investment opportunities in 2019 that were originated by our team.
we closed and funded 90 of these investments, 50 of which were to new borrowers. this large and diverse pipeline of opportunities allows us to remain extremely selective in the deals we close in our funds. and as a result, we invest only in what we believe are the strongest borrowers. and we structure our deals to provide us with covenants and monitoring tools necessary to protect our investments.
on average, the monroe platform closes approximately 2.5% of the new investment opportunities we evaluate in a given year, which affords us the luxury of being highly selective in our investment decisions. specific to our portfolio, as we disclosed in our earnings release and 10-k in january of 2020, an arbitrator issued an award in favor of one of our borrowers, the estates of rockdale blackhawk, in a pending legal proceeding between the state and the national insurance carrier. the lenders to rockdale, including mrcc, will share in the proceeds of this arbitration award with the state. the exact amount of the award has yet to be finalized because attorney's fees, interest and certain other amounts included as part of this award still need to be determined and finalized.
we expect this to resolve over the next few quarters. but based on this award, we expect proceeds to exceed the cost basis of our outstanding loan balances to rockdale. we believe this to be a very positive development and something that we have discussed with you on previously quarterly calls. accordingly, at the end of the fourth quarter, a fair value mark of our holdings in rockdale has increased.
during the fourth quarter, our portfolio decreased by $41.3 million on a net basis. this decline was attributable to $83.5 million of paydowns and payoffs on existing deals, partially offset by portfolio growth of $42.2 million during the quarter. approximately $36.3 million of these new loan fundings was attributable to existing portfolio company expansion. as we said in the prior-quarter conference call, we expected to see a decrease in our portfolio during the fourth quarter as we anticipated several payoffs in the ordinary course just after the end of the third quarter, which have occurred.
at the end of the fourth quarter, our per share nav was $12.20 per share, a 1% decline from the end of the prior quarter. monroe capital has a greater than 15-year operating history in direct lending. and over that period of time, investors have enjoyed very low defaults and strong recoveries in monroe capital direct loans. while we believe that many of our recent unrealized mark-to-market declines are related to specific idiosyncratic credit issues with a select few borrowers, our senior management team is continuing to spend a significant amount of time analyzing these credits and focusing on our workout and collection strategies.
we are very focused on realizing the highest possible recoveries on the assets that have been marked. the recent rockdale blackhawk arbitrator's award is a good example of that effort. mrcc enjoys a very strong strategic advantage and being affiliated with a best-in-class middle market private credit asset management firm with over $9 billion in assets under management and over 125 employees as of january 1, 2020. monroe capital will continue to devote whatever resources are necessary to generate acceptable levels of adjusted net investment income and improve nav performance of mrcc going forward.
i am now going to turn the call over to aaron, who is going to walk through with you our financial results. 
aaron peck -- chief financial officer and chief investment officer
thank you, ted. during the quarter, we funded a total of $42.2 million in investments, consisting of $5.5 million in loans to new borrowers, $23.7 million in new fundings to existing borrowers and $13 million in fundings under existing revolving lines of credit and existing delayed drug term loans. this growth was offset by partial sales and repayments on portfolio assets, which aggregated $83.5 million during the quarter. at december 31, we had total borrowings of $404.3 million, including $180.3 million outstanding under our revolving credit facility, $109 million of our 2023 notes and sba debentures payable of $115 million.
any future portfolio growth will predominantly be funded by the substantial availability remaining under our revolving credit facility and the uninvested cash held in our sbic subsidiary. since quarter end, we have made significant progress in investing a portion of the uninvested cash in the sbi subsidiary, which totaled $27.4 million at the end of the quarter. turning to our results. for the quarter ended december 31, adjusted net investment income, a non-gaap measure, was $7.7 million or $0.37 per share, an increase from the prior quarter's adjusted net investment income of $7.2 million or $0.35 per share.
at this level, per share adjusted nii covered our quarterly dividend of $0.35 per share. as of december 31, our net asset value was $249.4 million, which was down slightly from the $252.4 million in net asset value as of september 30. our nav per share decreased 1% from $12.34 per share at september 30 to $12.20 per share as of december 31. this decrease was primarily a result of unrealized mark-to-market valuation adjustments.
looking to our statement of operations. total investment income increased during the quarter primarily as a result of an increase in fee income, principally due to a success fee realized upon the payoff of our investment in tap room gaming. interest income declined during the quarter, driven by our lower average portfolio balance, decreases in libor and a reduction in libor spread in the portfolio due to repayments of higher-yielding assets during the quarter. during the fourth quarter, we did not put any additional positions on nonaccrual status.
moving over to the expense side. total expenses for the quarter increased slightly, primarily driven by an increase in net incentive fees. in many prior quarters, we voluntarily waived incentive fees to ensure dividend coverage. this was not necessary during the fourth quarter as adjusted nii exceeded the dividend on its own.
interest and other debt financing expenses also declined during the quarter as a result of a reduction in our borrowings due to the smaller average portfolio balance in the quarter. regarding liquidity. as of december 31, we had approximately $75 million of capacity under our revolving credit facility. at the end of the quarter, our regulatory leverage was approximately 1.16 debt to equity, a decrease from the regulatory leverage of nearly 1.3 at the end of the prior quarter.
the current level of regulatory leverage is within the targeted leverage range we have guided you to on prior calls. we do expect some net portfolio growth in the first quarter, which could result in a higher level of regulatory leverage going forward as we reinvest a portion of the fourth-quarter repayments in the first quarter of 2020. as of december 31, the slf had investments in 64 different borrowers, aggregating $239.8 million at fair value with a weighted average interest rate of approximately 7%. the slf had borrowings under its nonrecourse credit facility of 142 -- excuse me, $147.2 million and $22.8 million of available capacity under this credit facility.
at this level of funding, the equity in the slf is currently generating a dividend yield of over 11% to mrcc and our jv partner. regarding rockdale blackhawk, as ted discussed, there was a pending confidential and private arbitration of an accounts receivable claim with a national insurance carrier with a material amount in dispute. that claim serves as collateral for the mrcc loan to rockdale blackhawk. the underlying arbitration proceedings were completed in mid-august and final trial briefs were due and submitted to the arbitrator in late september.
an award was issued in january 2020. as ted stated earlier in the call, there is still some amount of uncertainty over the exact amount that will be payable to the state and available to the lenders, but the initial award was very positive and should result in a substantial recovery for mrcc and the other lenders to rockdale in excess of the cost basis of our outstanding loan balances due to the lenders' right to receive excess proceeds pursuant to the terms of a sharing agreement between the lenders and the estate. if there are any updates that could have a material effect on the value of this position, either positive or negative, we will update the shareholders at the appropriate time. during the quarter, we experienced a mark-to-market decline on our investment in the worth collection.
headquartered in new york city, worth is a direct-to-consumer luxury and contemporary women's apparel business. in the fourth quarter, the company experienced further declines in sales and increased attrition of its sales reps. despite previous indications that the private equity sponsor that owns worth would continue to support the company's liquidity, which it had done in prior quarters, the pe sponsor declined to provide further support. as a result, there is substantial doubt about the company's ability to continue to survive as a going concern, and the current mark reflects that doubt.
i will now turn the call back to ted for some closing remarks before we open the line for questions.
ted koenig -- chief executive officer
thank you, aaron. in closing, we continue to execute on the same plan at monroe as we have for the last 16 years: investing in origination resources to cast the widest net possible of proprietary deal flow, being highly selective in our underwriting and maintaining a strong and active portfolio management discipline. we are entering 2020 with continued caution and discipline, recognizing that our overall firm and platform is one of the largest and most stable in the u.s. lower-middle market private credit space.
that gives us the ability to be selectively competitive when the right situation presents itself. it also gives us the ability to pass when we believe the situation is not right, which will be more and more important in the coming year as we are confronted with market challenges and uncertainty. we continue to believe that monroe capital corp. provides a very attractive investment opportunity to our shareholders and other investors for the following reasons.
our stock pays a high current dividend rate, our dividend is fully supported by consistent adjusted net investment income coverage for the last 23 straight quarters, and we have a very shareholder firmly, external advisor management agreement in place that limits incentive fees payable in periods where there was any material decline in our net asset value, and base management fees have been reduced at higher leverage points. and lastly, we were affiliated with a best-in-class external manager with offices throughout the u.s. over 125 employees and approximately $9.2 billion in assets under management as of january 1, 2020. thank you all very much for your time today.
and with that, i'm going to ask the operator to open the call for questions.
",":
operator
thank you. [operator instructions] and our first question is from bob napoli with william blair. please go ahead.
bob napoli -- william blair and company -- analyst
thank you, and good morning. just with the virus, the coronavirus out there, i guess, what investments do you have? or do you have investments that are affected by the travel industry? and obviously, this could become potentially a broader macro effect, although it doesn't seem to have in the u.s. quite yet. but i was just curious, as you look at your borrower base, who is most at risk for areas that are most susceptible to the virus currently?
ted koenig -- chief executive officer
good question. thank you, bob. i anticipated that question, and we have done a pretty intensive review of our portfolio over the last several weeks as i hope most private credit managers have. we do not have very much, if any, exposure in the travel, leisure, aircraft, transportation space.
so i think from a portfolio standpoint, i think we're in pretty good shape on that. i'm more concerned about the tangential effects of it. and i don't think we're in a position to know yet what's happening. i mean i was in europe last week, and i will tell you that i was at the largest private equity conference in the world in berlin, and there were no asian participants there.
and there were no italian participants there. in chicago, the housewares trade association was canceled, which was roughly about 50,000 people. so i think that there's a lot of general concern in the market today. and as long as we don't panic in that we focus on the facts, hopefully, this will be a q1 and q2 issue, and everybody can get back to business in q2.
but we need more information there. all i can tell you is that from a portfolio standpoint, the mrcc portfolio, as well as monroe capital is in relatively good shape and not a risk.
bob napoli -- william blair and company -- analyst
great. thank you. i second the motion on the first- and second-quarter effects. hopefully.
just on rockdale blackhawk, when do you get paid? and i mean, do you have the write-up in the quarter? is that a conservative? is there more potential write-up from that? or is there some risk to that amount?
ted koenig -- chief executive officer
yeah. so here's what i can tell you. now the challenge is that we're being as transparent as we can because we're under some confidentiality arrangements right now with the arbitration procedure. i anticipate that that may change in the future.
and if it does change, then we'll be able to say more on it. but what i can tell you is that the example of the recovery, in this case, is a marked asset, and we spoke on previous calls to you and other members of the analyst community that we don't cut and run as a firm on our credits. now we may take marks. and we try to be as transparent as we can with you and our public shareholders on the marks.
just because we take marks that doesn't mean that we believe that the assets are not collectible at full value or at a higher level than the marks. and that's a very important distinction because over the last several quarters, like others, we've taken some marks in certain industries. we've spent over a year with a significant amount of effort of senior management and our portfolio management team and legal counsel and experts and others in pursuing this claim because we knew and we thought we were a winner on this just as we may believe we are in other claims within our portfolio. but until it actually converts, there's a limit to what we can do and say to the community.
so i'm asking the community to just understand that that's our business. that's what we do. that's what we're good at, and that's what we're going to continue to do with all of the marks that we have in our portfolio, and it wouldn't surprise me to come to you on future calls and be able to talk about other credits and resolutions of other credits. but on this particular one, what i can tell you today is that we received a very favorable ruling in the arbitration.
we expect recoveries to be substantially in excess of our cost basis. and that it's going to play out over the next couple of quarters is my guess because there are -- as part of the arbitration, we were awarded reimbursement of certain costs and expenses. and those need to be determined and finally agreed to. and that's all part of the order.
so i'm asking you to be patient with us on this. and aaron and i will be back to you as soon as we possibly can.
bob napoli -- william blair and company -- analyst
thank you. last question from me. your confidence level in being able to continue to cover the dividend, maintain the dividend. you have a 13% dividend yield and a 0% interest rate market, if you would.
and you've done a good job maintaining that dividend to this point is that the book value, you need to be able to maintain, obviously, the book value to be able to continue to support that dividend. so just some thoughts around that big picture question, if you would.
ted koenig -- chief executive officer
listen, obviously, i can't predict the future, but i'm telling you on this particular point, we feel good about where we are with the company. we're going to collect a bunch of money on rockdale. we've got a bunch of money that has been deployed from our sbic sub. we've got a lot of headroom in our credit facilities.
so i think this is a really good development, and i think we're going to be humming a longer.
bob napoli -- william blair and company -- analyst
all right. thank you. appreciate it.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from tim hayes with b. riley fbr.
tim hayes -- b. riley fbr -- analyst
hi, good morning, guys. thanks for taking the questions. my first one is just a follow-up on bob's last question there. and upon redeploying the proceeds from rockdale and 4q loan repayments, how close do you think that will put you to consistently covering the dividend with adjusted nii signs foregoing incentive fees?
aaron peck -- chief financial officer and chief investment officer
thanks, tim. this is aaron. so good question. all i can say to you is we're very focused on it.
we feel good about our ability to continue to deploy assets at a level that supports our current nii. if that changes, we'll certainly let you know, but getting cash back on this nonaccrual asset that's substantial is pretty meaningful in our ability to do that. if you look at it versus our nav, there's a fair amount of capital tied up in this. so when we can get that cash back to work on an accrual basis, that's very favorable.
tim hayes -- b. riley fbr -- analyst
and obviously, the near-term outlook probably a little bit more uncertain, just given the fears around coronavirus and the volatility in the markets, but how long do you think it will take you to redeploy that capital, given the pipeline you have in front of you? and just as a follow-up to that. and on the coronavirus, do you see near-term volume falling off given the uncertainty? and are you seeing any changes in demand from your portfolio companies or prospective portfolio companies currently?
ted koenig -- chief executive officer
good question, tim. i'll take that. this is ted. we have over $1 billion in pipeline right now in the firm.
now we've got -- as a firm, we manage $9.2 billion of assets. the bdc is obviously much smaller. i don't see any issue in being able to redeploy assets as they come due or as prepayments happened with the bdc. so from mrcc standpoint, i think we're going to be in really good shape here over the next three to six months.
now obviously, the market, in general, coronavirus is going to have an effect as i told you in my earlier remarks, but i don't see that impacting our ability to deploy capital in the near term.
tim hayes -- b. riley fbr -- analyst
ok. got it. that's helpful. and then your stock currently trading at about 87% of nav and a 13.2% dividend yield, you just delevered a good amount this quarter.
so i'm just curious as to how you think about potentially allocating capital toward stock buybacks at these levels?
ted koenig -- chief executive officer
and that's a good question, too. we really haven't had a chance to dig into that. at the board level, obviously, we talked about everything. i think that you'll see over the next near-term here, our no.
1 goal is going to be deploy capital in good deals. and we think that we've got a positive arbitrage in deploying capital in good deals, and that's what we're very, very focused on doing.
tim hayes -- b. riley fbr -- analyst
got it. ok. and then just one more for me. would you be able to disclose if you have it in front of you that is the average leverage multiple, ltv and/or interest coverage on debt portfolio companies?
ted koenig -- chief executive officer
i will tell you i don't have that information in front of me. but from a market standpoint, as i mentioned in my earlier remarks, there is a -- generally, i'm speaking for the general market now, there's a different level of leverage in the upper middle market and the lower middle market. upper middle market today is close to around 6 turns of leverage. and in the lower middle market, it's closer to 4.5 turns in the neighborhood.
and from a coverage standpoint, we're similarly situated where we've got a better margin of coverage in the lower middle market. and that's why we like to play in that market.
tim hayes -- b. riley fbr -- analyst
i guess then -- i don't know, again, i know you don't have the exact data in front of you, but would you be able to, from a high level, touch on just how those metrics have trended over the past year, whether they've been stable? or are you seeing them kind of creep up a bit?
ted koenig -- chief executive officer
yeah, sure. again, in general speaking, what i can tell you is that it's moved a little bit over the last year or so, 18 months. if you look at the larger market, that market has probably moved half a turn to almost a full turn. we're seeing today 6 to 7 times leverage is pretty common in the larger middle market space.
and we used to see around 4 turns in the lower-middle market space and that market today is probably closer to 4.5 turns and up to 5 turns. so that's, i think, a good flavor. now if you ask me how does that compare to the last cycle we were in that i thought was the most frothy cycle in my career. in 2007, we were probably at 3.5 to 4 turns of leverage in the lower middle market.
so we're probably up about a full turn in the lower end of the middle market. and we're probably up closer to almost 2 turns in the higher end of the middle market.
aaron peck -- chief financial officer and chief investment officer
i would guess, though, ted, that coverages were probably not as different back then because the general level of rates going precycle were quite a bit higher than where we are today.
ted koenig -- chief executive officer
yeah. from a coverage standpoint. you're right.
tim hayes -- b. riley fbr -- analyst
makes sense. ok. i appreciate the color there.
ted koenig -- chief executive officer
and i guess my last comment to your question on the stock is i think our stock price is too low. so that's a separate comment.
tim hayes -- b. riley fbr -- analyst
understood. thanks, guys.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from christopher nolan with ladenburg thalmann.
christopher nolan -- ladenburg thalmann -- analyst
hi, guys. ted, congratulations on growing monroe to $9.2 billion. that's impressive. rockdale -- hold on a second, my headset.
hello?
ted koenig -- chief executive officer
we're here, chris.
christopher nolan -- ladenburg thalmann -- analyst
ok. great. on rockdale, the fair value on that increased $19 million from about $9 million last quarter. given that this was december 30 and the court adjudicator was announced in january 2020, what was the cause of this increase in fair value?
aaron peck -- chief financial officer and chief investment officer
yeah, great question, chris. and it's something that we have to be really thoughtful about when we have information that comes post quarter end because, as you pointed out, and you're correct, the valuations are as of 12/31. clearly, we've been saying for some period of time that as this extended on, we felt that bolstered our position. and based on all the reads we got from all of the legal advice we were getting, we felt like as time went on, that that increased the probability that we would have a positive resolution.
and so the mark at 12/31 reflects a higher probability of a positive resolution. it does not necessarily incorporate what we believe the total recovery to be because that was not knowable at 12/31.
christopher nolan -- ladenburg thalmann -- analyst
got it. second question sort of related to ted's earlier comment on tangential exposure to the coronavirus. what happens if your portfolio companies start having a working capital shortage because of supply chain issues and so forth? who will step up? will it be the pe sponsor? will it be the lenders such as yourself? how does that work out?
ted koenig -- chief executive officer
good question. i will tell you, that's probably one of the best questions because what happens when you have something like a coronavirus an issue, it doesn't really translate into a p&l issue right away for most borrowers. it translates into a liquidity issue for the borrowers. and the reason why it translates into a liquidity issue is that sales go down for a very short period of time, revenues come down, receivables come down.
inventory tends to come down, particularly companies that are heavy in the manufacturing business. and payables tend to extend. so what happens is you get a working capital squeeze in these companies, and they need cash. so our portfolio is primarily driven by business services, software, medical reimbursements, things that are not the subject of a working capital or liquidity squeeze.
companies that are much more susceptible to that are companies that are manufacturing or heavily importing. we purposely, over the last several years, rotated our borrower base into less of a manufacturing and importing and dependence on heavy metals or oil and gas, things that are more cyclical. so we feel we're in a pretty good position with the mrcc portfolio. your question was more of a general nature.
and i will tell you that when that happens, when there's a liquidity squeeze, what generally happens is that if the company is within their leverage covenants, then very often the lender may extend additional credit within the leverage guideline covenants. however, if the company is at its leverage guideline covenants or at where they intended to be, then the private equity firm may have to step up in a short period of time and provide some type of interim bridge that is fully reimbursable when the normal working capital comes back. so that's hard to answer your question.
christopher nolan -- ladenburg thalmann -- analyst
great. thanks for taking my questions, and i'll follow up off-line.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from robert dodd with raymond james.
robert dodd -- raymond james -- analyst
hi, guys, and congratulations on the quarter. a couple of house, sort of, housekeeping ones first and then a bigger picture question. on rockdale, and i know it's under confidentiality, etc., but would an arbitration settlement kind of, would that constitute fee income to you? or would that go to a realized gain, depending on what it is ultimately?
aaron peck -- chief financial officer and chief investment officer
yeah, it's a good question. we're still examining all of that and how it will flow through. it most likely would not be considered fee income. it most likely be considered a realized gain, and there'll probably be some potential for other income over time, depending on what elements of the settlement, how that plays out through, what we are owed.
so there is some accrual of interest, for example, that will be calculated that is not currently accrued in our p&l movement. so that could be an interest income metric, but we'll try our best once this is settled, and we have more to say to try to break out for people exactly the components so that it's very clear as to what's flowing through where.
ted koenig -- chief executive officer
yeah, just to be clear on that, too, robert. that's a great question. on something like this, remember, we're in the business of charging interest, current interest, accrued interest, default interest on fee income. so there's a number of different line items here that aaron will make more clear as time goes on.
but one of the things we're waiting for right now is the arbitrator to rule on a number of our additional fees and expenses. so until that happens, we really can't give you much more guidance other than it's a very positive development, and it's going to be really good for mrcc.
robert dodd -- raymond james -- analyst
yeah, understood. and exactly that point. i mean, it's obviously been dragged, it's going on a while now, and i would imagine there's some catch-up income that's going to flow through as well. then secondly, on the fee income in the quarter, which was very high, and it doesn't look like it was prepayment income.
so far as i can tell from the filings. so can you give us any color on what the source of that was in this quarter?
aaron peck -- chief financial officer and chief investment officer
yeah, sure. so you're right, it wasn't necessarily prepayment fee. it was related to a prepayment, though. so we had an investment in a company called tap room gaming.
and as a part of our investment, we had structured something called a success fee that would be based on the value of the company upon a sale and repayment of our loan -- for the value of the company on the repayment of our loan. and so that occurred in the quarter. and most of the fee income in the quarter was associated with that. now you say it was very high in the quarter.
it's certainly higher than it's been in recent quarters. but it is not inconsistent with levels we've had in previous years. so definitely higher than the last couple of quarters, but not what i would consider extremely high versus what we've seen historically.
ted koenig -- chief executive officer
two things on that, too, robert, is that historically, in periods of heavy refinance activity, we tend to see more prepayment income. and as aaron mentioned, in the last couple of quarters, we just haven't seen a lot of prepayment income. if you go back a couple of years, you used to see a fair amount of prepayment income in our portfolio. so that's one area.
but the other thing that i think is not really understood and not really easily manageable by folks in your business is that we play in the lower middle market. and tap room gaming is a good example of deals that we have in our portfolio that we have success fees and ways to create additional return that we can't book because it hasn't occurred yet. but a number of deals in our portfolio because we play in this nonsponsored small end of the market, we've created additional opportunities to make income from the portfolio when and if the companies pay refinance or sell. and this tap room gaming was an excellent example of a deal where we structured a success fee as opposed to a warrant or as opposed to equity in the company.
and then when the deal was refinanced or sold, we got the benefit. now a lot of that was episodic. but when you've got a portfolio, the size of our portfolio, we expect that over time, those things are going to happen. so i just want to make sure that you understand that and the community understands that this is something that we'll be coming back to you with, hopefully, in the future with other instances.
robert dodd -- raymond james -- analyst
understood, ted. i mean, yeah, in your lower-middle market coupon, i know oid are not the only sources of income that you can generate from a portfolio company. the last one for me is back to the virus, but a secondary effect, so to speak, libor, obviously, i mean, the fed cut 50 basis points. you mentioned libor force in your prepared comments.
can you give us any more color of where the average floor is, how many of them are in play today, so to speak, since, obviously, libor has moved now? and how much protection you've got within that portfolio for additional libor moves if the fed moves again in summer?
ted koenig -- chief executive officer
good question, actually. so in our deals, you have to understand how financial institutions work, maybe i'll give you a short lesson on this quickly. banks and insurance companies are very much tied to cost of funds. and as the cost of funds go down, this 50-basis-point cut this week was a very negative effect on most banks and insurance companies.
in our business, private credit business, particularly monroe and mrcc in the lower middle market, we have libor floors in virtually every deal we have. we set those libor floors at usually where libor is. so if libor is a point and a quarter or a point, whatever it may be, we tend to set our floors at that level. so if you look at our portfolio, when we do deals, we tend to set somewhere between a point and a point and a quarter with our libor floors.
and to the extent that libor tends to move much more, we don't see a lot of exposure in our asset spreads with libor floors.
robert dodd -- raymond james -- analyst
appreciate that. thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from chris kotowski with oppenheimer.
chris kotowski -- oppenheimer -- analyst
most of mine have been asked, but just a little bit more clarification on maybe the capacity in the sbic subsidiary. you said there's $27 million of cash and $56 million of -- or $57 million of leverageable capital. does that mean you would like, first, use the cash and then there are further debentures that you can draw? or how would that work and flow through your financials?
aaron peck -- chief financial officer and chief investment officer
yeah, i'm sorry if we somehow confused on that. so no, there's $27 million of cash at december 31 that's investable. there's no more debentures that's available. so that's the max amount of cash that's available to invest in the sbic subsidiary.
we wouldn't necessarily expect to invest all of that because we have some delayed draw term loan exposure in the sbic subsidiary that we need to reserve some cash for in case we get a draw. but we do have the ability to substantially increase our investments in the sbic by use of at least a portion of that $27 million of cash, but there is no additional capital available in the sbic sub.
chris kotowski -- oppenheimer -- analyst
ok. and then just, obviously, this quarter, i guess i wanted to get -- tend to clarify again a little bit. i mean this quarter, we saw a bit of a decline in the investments. the language in your opening comments, i would say, was cautionary.
but then i also heard you say that with $9 billion of aum and $1 billion in pipeline that there should not be any problem in maintaining the bdcs, the investment portfolio. so does that mean one should expect to see kind of this quarter's decline in the total investments made up in coming quarters?
ted koenig -- chief executive officer
so again, a good question. we had a high level of prepayment activity in the fourth quarter that we anticipated. we had a number of companies that were being sold. so we kind of gave you some heads up, i think, in our last quarterly call in the third quarter that we're expecting to see that.
we don't see the same prepayment activity coming this quarter. we've got a nice pipeline. we're putting money to work. i think that you anticipate more of a normalized deployment from us now.
the nice thing about having a very large platform is we've got a very large pipeline, always. but again, i tried to give you some cautionary words only that we're trying to be careful, too. fourth quarter, the market was running pretty hot. and we made a decision as a firm to be thoughtful and not chase the market.
and when you've got a large firm, you've got the ability to make those decisions if you see that the market is running a little too hot. i think with coronavirus and some of the other things that we're facing currently in the market, we don't see the same level of hotness right now. and i think we're going to get back to business.
aaron peck -- chief financial officer and chief investment officer
and i would just add one thing, which is one thing we've been consistent on when we talked about leverage in the portfolio is that the leverage targets that we think about are directly related to what we're doing on the portfolio side that you can't live in a vacuum and just say, we're going to be at a certain leverage point because it depends on the perceived risk of the assets you're putting on and the more conservative that portfolio that we look -- that we see, the more likely we'll be willing to be slightly higher on leverage. and we, over the last couple of years, have really pushed the portfolio more and more to straight first-lien senior secured loans, which is in part why our yield has come down. of course, there's other competitive pressures in libor that have also contributed to the yield declines, but it's also a shift into a more defensive portfolio, which can take a little bit more leverage, which we did purposefully to take advantage of what we thought was a better positioning in a late cycle to be a little bit more leverage and a little less risky portfolio. and so that's always part of the thinking as well.
so look, what we said was we thought we were going to get a bunch of prepayments that we knew about. we allowed the portfolio leverage to go a little higher than we would have wanted otherwise at the end of last quarter. and that's moderated here in the first quarter. and it's gotten probably a little bit on the lower end of where we thought leverage would be based on the portfolio mix, and we have the ability to consider taking it up a little from here and the final level of where we go, we'll have to do, of course, with what we see in terms of opportunities, but also as we assess the portfolio mix in terms of risk.
chris kotowski -- oppenheimer -- analyst
ok. and then last for me is, there was a mark on company called forman mills. it's still on accrual, but i think it's about 70%, 72% of cost now. is there any color you can give us on that?
aaron peck -- chief financial officer and chief investment officer
yeah, sure. so forman mills is a name we're obviously monitoring very heavily as we do with all of our names, but particularly names that are marked below par. so what's really happened with forman mills and forman mills is in the general low-priced retail segment. it's a sponsor-owned business.
the company had some challenges with regards to some of its internal systems and some inventory purchases that were ill-conceived. they've, i think, really put the company back in a position to start growing again. they feel good about their prospects, given their customer base. but as a result of some of their issues, they needed some additional capital.
and so what you're seeing in the market is really more about some working capital that was provided to the company by both us and the sponsor as a loan. so what you didn't see was a major shift in terms of the enterprise value of this company, which you just saw was a higher loan balance, which is what contributed to the decline in the mark. but based on everything we're seeing with the right levels of inventory because they were not in a good position with regards to inventory and some additional support to their factors, we would expect to see revenue and ebitda improvements over the prior year. so we continue to think that the trajectory here looks positive, which is why, at this point, the company is still on accrual status.
it really just still expect to get a recovery here with regards to both our par amount, as well as all of our interest.
chris kotowski -- oppenheimer -- analyst
ok. that's it for me. thank you.
operator
thank you. and our next question is from chris york with jmp securities.
chris york -- jmp securities -- analyst
hi, ted. hi, aaron. thanks for taking my questions. the first is on rockdale.
and i recognize you're limited on what you can provide us, but you do have a loan here that is not accruing interest and it's material to earnings. so do you expect this investment to return to an accrual post the close of the legal proceeding?
aaron peck -- chief financial officer and chief investment officer
no. chris, what will happen with this is once everything is concluded, we expect to receive a cash payment for the loan and any other settlements that we get, and we'd expect to redeploy that in earning assets. there's no situation where this loan starts then paying us interest again because there is no real ongoing operations at rockdale. so it's more about a recovery of our loan, and hopefully, additional recoveries as you can see from the mark and then redeploying that cash, that's the expectation.
chris york -- jmp securities -- analyst
got it. i was a little confused. that makes a lot of sense. elaborating a little bit on balance sheet leverage.
and i know it depends on the portfolio and risk, but are you still targeting a operating regulatory leverage ratio of 1.25 to 1.3 times longer term?
aaron peck -- chief financial officer and chief investment officer
yeah. we still think that that's consistent with what we would expect here. anywhere between 1.2 and 1.3 is sort of a reasonable range for regulatory leverage based on what we see in the portfolio mix. that's correct.
chris york -- jmp securities -- analyst
perfect. and then, ted, last question here is a little bit on strategy. as you said in your prepared remarks, monroe is focused on the lower middle market. and i think the market certainly thinks that monroe is a leader in the lower middle market.
that said, the platform has achieved strong growth in assets under management, and we've seen monroe compete in some more traditional and larger middle market deals. so why should investors not think that your growth is leading to a drift in style?
ted koenig -- chief executive officer
good question, chris. listen, i can't tell you that that's not the case. we've grown our portfolio significantly. we're about a $10 billion player today in the market monroe capital is.
and what we've been able to do is we've done it in a unique way as opposed to go up market like others have and compete against some of the much larger asset management platforms. what we've done is we've expanded our platform, and we've gotten wider and deeper with new products. as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, we've developed more of a niche focus on specialty finance, software, in technology and in healthcare, areas where we think we can make a difference on a proprietary basis. and we've hired professionals into those areas that are knowledgeable with deep contacts and relationships so that we can pull transactions from the market in these various niches.
so if you look across our platform, a couple of years ago, we were probably -- at the monroe level, we were probably somewhere around an average ebitda of $16 million, $17 million ebitda. today, we're probably close to $19 million average ebitda, and that's across the entire platform of over 500 companies. so we've been sticking to our knitting. we're obviously getting involved in a few larger deals because some of our competitors are inviting us into some of the larger deals because we may bring a certain expertise or add a certain amount of value.
but our core originations, if you look at the 50 deals that we mentioned, that aaron mentioned in our remarks earlier, those 50 deals, which are directly originated transactions, are in the core, lower end of the middle market. now we have an active clo business as well at the firm. we manage over $3.5 billion of clos, and that clo business does play in the upper end of the middle market. but that's more of -- that's a different business.
it's more unique. that business has been growing and will continue to grow aggressively. we've got one of the top weighted -- top decile performing clo businesses in the entire market. so that market, i anticipate, and that business will continue to grow.
i like the lower middle market. i think we've created a brand. and i think we're probably the largest player in that space, and we're going to continue to take advantage of the goodwill, the trade and the brand that we built in that space, and that's where you'll see mrcc play.
aaron peck -- chief financial officer and chief investment officer
and i'll just add one thing, chris. i mean, when you think about our focus on the lower middle market, it's more important to think about what we like about the lower middle market. and what we like about that space is deals that still have covenants and good structure. we like the leverage attachment points that ted referred to earlier.
and so those are things that are most important to us. and those are the things you're seeing go out of a lot of the larger middle market deals. but if we see a deal in the larger part of the middle market with slightly higher ebitda, but it has the features we like in the lower middle market, conservative leverage, good sponsorship, low loan to value and covenants, we'll consider doing those deals, even if they might be slightly higher than what we typically do in terms of ebitda.
chris york -- jmp securities -- analyst
perfect. that's it from me. thank you for the insight and the context.
ted koenig -- chief executive officer
thanks, chris.
operator
and we have a follow-up from robert dodd with raymond james.
robert dodd -- raymond james -- analyst
hi, guys. just one question on the dividend. obviously, this year, you covered the dividend, in fact, slightly overearned the dividend. and on a quarter-by-quarter basis, you either waived, or this quarter didn't waive, in order to cover more covenant.
and when we look forward, should we kind of expect the same pattern that you will do what obviously is necessary. i think you said in your prepared remarks that to cover the dividend on a quarterly basis or a value weight what you may or may not need to do based on what you expect to do for the full year because obviously, with locked out proceeds coming back, maybe some catch-up income from there, the dynamics might be a little different about full year versus quarter to quarter?
ted koenig -- chief executive officer
good question, robert. i can tell you that we've shown you through many years of performance that management at monroe capital corp. is very, very focused on maximizing value and creating value for our shareholders. that historical focus is not going to change in the future.
we're going to do everything we possibly can to create value and maximize value for our shareholders.
robert dodd -- raymond james -- analyst
understood. thank you.
operator
thank you. and this ends our q&a session for today. i would like to turn the call back to ted koenig for his final thoughts.
ted koenig -- chief executive officer
ok. thank you very much, everyone. lots of questions today, which i thought were good. and hopefully, you've got a better feel now from a strategic focus and where we are, what we are trying to do with monroe and where we're going.
for us, a lot of this is just business as usual. there's a lot of noise in the market, whether it's rockdale blackhawk, whether it's the presidential elections, whether it's forman mills or whether it's coronavirus. i can tell you that we're very, very focused on doing what we do best, which is invest on capital and earn interest and fees and get our capital back. and particularly, the last piece of this is getting our capital back.
the rockdale blackhawk example, i think, is a very good factual experience for all of us that we are very focused on irrespective of what our marks are and what the carrying value of our loans are. we're focused on getting our capital back and all of it back. so with that, i want to thank you for joining us. i want to thank aaron and our finance team.
i want to thank our legal team. i want to thank our financial reporting teams here at monroe and investor relations for maintaining relationships and for doing everything that we do here to exemplify a first-class private credit organization, and we anticipate adding and improving to that in the year 2020, and we look forward to talking to you all on our next call. so thank you, and have a good day.

sir, you may begin.
ted koenig -- chief executive officer
good morning and thank you to everyone who has joined us on our call today. welcome to our first-quarter 2020 earnings conference call. i'm joined by aaron peck, our cfo and chief investment officer. friday evening, we issued our first-quarter 2020 earnings press release and filed our 10-q with the sec.
first and foremost, i hope you and your families are healthy and safe. this is a very difficult time for our country and the world, and we at monroe capital corporation bdc and the broader monroe capital organization, of those that have been most affected by the covid-19 pandemic in our thoughts and best wishes. we also want to thank the brave men and women, the essential workers who put themselves at personal risk every day to help the rest of us get through this pandemic. our employees remain safe, as a firm, we have seamless -- seamlessly navigated the transition to a remote working environment.
technology has allowed us to maintain close contact with all of our teams and we have been able to maintain highly collaborative in our approach, which we believe is very important to navigating the challenging economic environment we are facing as a result of the pandemic. we do not know for sure when we will be able to return to our offices, but we look forward to the day that we can return to a more normal working environment. as you all know, the uncertainty associated with the covid-19 pandemic has created concerns related to the economy, as well as, specific unanticipated challenges for many companies due to business interruptions and a slowdown in business activity. this uncertainty has caused negative implications across the financial markets with the s&p 500 down almost 20% in the first quarter of 2020.
significant price declines were also seen and traded credit investment as the s&p/lsta leveraged loan index was down over 20% at times and finished the first quarter down 14% in market value. uncertainty has also caused many of our portfolio companies across our platform to be focused on their own liquidity as evidenced by the wave of revolver draw request that we saw during march as a direct response to concerns over the covid-19 pandemic. the moroe firms including mrcc have met all borrower revolver draw request and we believe that we have appropriate liquidity to meet any future request across all of our funds. while we certainly couldn't have predicted the covid-19 pandemic due to overall concerns about an overheated economy, we have been shifting our portfolios over the past several quarters in all of our monroe funds, away from a higher risk cyclical industries.
as a result, mrcc has limited to no direct portfolio exposure in industries most effected by the pandemic such as airlines, automotive, travel, leisure, oil and gas, minerals and mining, and energy. however, the best thing about our portfolio is that we are typically a control lender. we are the agents and approximately 88% of our loan investments. we have tight baskets regarding indebtedness and restricted payments.
we have at least two and often several more financial covenant -- covenants on most or all of our deals including maintenance and occurrence test and debt leverage. this allows us to be proactively engaged with our borrowers and their financial sponsors in terms of liquidity. it also allows us to opportunistically amend and reprice our loans to constantly de-risk and rerisk our portfolio. in past calls, we have discussed the importance of tighter loan documentation in the lower middle market that we play in.
in the larger broad middle market, almost 80% of all loans are covenant light. in our markets, we are dialoguing with our companies weekly and sometimes on a daily basis to the points where, in most cases, they have to come to us to incur a ppp loan because they don't have the debt incurrence basket availability in their financial covenants. this allows us to manage risk and do many things to enhance our risk and return positions. our risk is also mitigated by the fact that we maintain conservative starting leverage and loan-to-values when we underwrite our loans, an average monroe agent of loan is between 4 times and 4.5 times leverage and below 50% loan-to-value at the time an investment is underwritten and closed.
and while with the benefit of hindsight, i am sure there are some things we would have done differently in managing our business. we believe that mrcc and the rest of the monroe capital funds are in a strong position to navigate the current crisis vis-a-vis the market and our competitors. and we expect to emerge in a strong position to take advantage of the enhanced returns that will be available as a result of the market dislocation that has occurred. also, as we discussed in prior calls, our arbitration proceeding in the rockdale blackhawk matter is now completed.
the award has been issued at [inaudible] form and will cover more than 100% of our paramaounts on this loan and is consistent with the current fair value on our balance sheet. we anticipate payments in the coming quarter which will be a materially positive result for our company. turning now to the first-quarter results. we are pleased to report that in this challenging environment, we generated adjusted net investment income of $0.33 per share, down from the adjusted net investment income of $0.37 per share in the fourth quarter.
declines and our net investment income are primarily as a result of us proactively placing three additional assets on non-accrual, in part due to challenges faced by these borrowers related to covid-19, as well as, a decline in fee income during the period. aaron will go into more detail regarding the components of our net investment income and the non-accrual assets later in the call. we also reported a net decrease in assets resulting from operations of $36.9 million or $1.81 per share during the quarter, which was primarily as a result of a decline in the fair value of our investment portfolio during the quarter. as a result, our nav on a per share basis fell from $12.20 per share at december 31st to $10.04 per share at the end of the first quarter or 18%.
as we have discussed on past calls, we maintain very disciplined valuation procedures at monroe, which rely heavily independent third-party valuations or observable market prices for 100% of our portfolio each quarter. the process employed by our third-party valuation firms is not just based on individual credit performance from a bottoms-up basis, but also includes a top-down analysis and heavily incorporates the impact of general markets spreads on our assets. as a result of this process, our average portfolio mark across the entire portfolio fell by approximately 6.8% during the quarter. the decline in our marks resulted an approximately $2.21 per share in net unrealized mark-to-market valuation losses during the quarter.
we estimate that approximately $1.25 per share of these unrealized losses or 57% was attributable solely to the widening of credit spreads during the period unrelated to individual credit performance. since quarter end, lcd first lien loan spreads have tightened by 108 basis points, already retracing around 28% of the q1 spread widening. of that $1.25 per share of nav decline attributable to spread widening, approximately $0.71 per share or 57% of that was attributable to assets held directly by us, while $0.54 per share or 43% of that number was a result of markdowns on assets held in the mrcc senior loan fund joint venture. the loans in the joint venture tend to be larger upper middle-market companies and those loans experienced higher price volatility in times of market correction.
assuming credit spreads continue to tighten, as we have seen post quarter end, an absent future permanent credit losses associated with these loans, we would expect a significant portion of these unrealized mark-to-market losses in both our lower middle-market portfolio and the mrcc senior loan fund joint venture to reverse, resulting in positive nav adjustments and positive earnings performance in future periods. approximately $0.96 per share of the $2.21 per share unrealized mark-to-market losses or 43% was attributable to specific credit deterioration in certain portfolio companies, a significant portion of which is as a result of the impact of covid-19 pandemic on these borrowers. a recovery of these unrealized losses is dependent on both continued spread tightening, as well as, improved company performance for these specific borrowers. regarding these unrealized losses associated with specific credit performance, while we believe that this quarter's increase in unrealized mark-to-market declines associated with the select borrowers were exacerbated by the covid-19 pandemic, our senior management team is continuing to spend a significant amount of time analyzing these credits and focusing on our workout and collection strategies.
we are very focused on realizing the highest possible recoveries on the assets that we have marked down, and we are engaged in several processes to execute on that strategy. one such process was undertaken with respect to rockdale blackhawk in 2019, and we are seeing the positive results of that process today. please be aware that the monroe capital organization has 135 employees with many devoted to underwriting, risk management, and workout strategies. during periods like this, it allows us to bring the very resources to bear on the portfolio that are necessary.
as many of you know, we have a long track record of significant success in managing through difficult economic environments, notably the great financial crisis in 2008 and 2009, including select workout situations with borrowers. if need be, we can come in and take over and own a business. while that is not our preferred option or outcome, we know how to do it and have done it successfully in the past. if necessary, we will roll up our sleeves with our 135 employees and get our companies through this period, and we think, achieve a good recovery.
the important thing is that we have the ability and experience to do that if needed to achieve the best recovery possible for our investors. we also announced in our earnings release last friday that the monroe management team made a recommendation to our board of directors and the board authorized a reduction in our dividend to $0.25 per share for the second quarter of 2020, payable in cash on june 30th, 2020. the decision to make a reduction in our dividend was very difficult and is the direct result of the uncertainty due to the covid-19 pandemic. it reflects our desire to maintain a conservative approach regarding distributions and liquidity.
while we do not have any specific information regarding additional assets moving to non-accrual in the future, given the uncertainties in the economy, we believe it is prudent to plan for various stress test scenarios and have made the difficult decision to reduce our dividend rate for the first time in our company's history. we will continue to closely monitor the performance of all of our borrowers, as well as, overall economic trends, activity, and future prospects. and if appropriate, we will adjust the dividend amount in the future if we see evidence of a sustained recovery, which causes the positive impact on our net investment income. we believe that by making this dividend adjustment, we are acting decisively and responsibly in light of the uncertainties and challenges we are facing as a result of the current crisis.
as always, we are focused on the long-term interest of our shareholders and we'll continue to operate with caution. as we look ahead, while there is a high bar today for investing in new capital during these uncertain times and our focus in the near-term will be then reducing our debt leverage, as aaron will discuss, we have seen many attractive opportunities to invest. our focus will be to continue to make new investments in portfolio companies and very compelling risk return investments in new situations on an opportunistic basis. just as we have done as a firm in 2010 and 2011, following the great financial crisis.
investment spreads have widened considerably, and terms and leverage have improved as well. mrcc enjoys a very strong strategic advantage in being affiliated the best-in-class middle-market private credit asset management firm with over $9 billion in assets under management and over 135 employees as of april 1st, 2020. monroe capital will continue to devote whatever resources are necessary to generate acceptable levels of adjusted net investment income and improved nav performance of mrcc going forward. i am now going to turn the call over to aaron who is going to walk you through our financial results. 
aaron peck -- chief financial officer and chief investment officer
thank you, ted. during the quarter, we funded a total of $71 million in investments, consisting of $41 million in loans to new borrowers and $30 million in new fundings to existing borrowers, including $21 million in revolver draws and $9 million in add-ons and delayed draw fundings. as we discussed earlier in the call, many of our borrowers drew on their revolvers in order to increase liquidity on their balance sheets due to the uncertainty related to covid-19. this portfolio growth was partially offset by sales and repayments on portfolio assets, which aggregated $53 million during the quarter, including four full payoffs, one asset sale and partial sales and paydowns.
all investments and new borrowers were made earlier in the quarter. prior to the market dislocation and spread widening that occurred late in the quarter related to the pandemic. at march 31st, we had total borrowings of $416 million, including $192 million outstanding under our revolving credit facility, $109 million of our 2023 notes, and sba debentures payable of $115 million. we are currently mostly focused on our portfolio and we are not expecting material new investment growth in the immediate term.
any future portfolio of growth, revolver draws, or advances to existing borrowers will predominantly be funded by the availability remaining under our revolving credit facility, subject to borrowing base capacity, and the uninvested cash held in our sbic subsidiary. turning to our results. for the quarter ended march 31st, adjusted net investment income, a non-gaap measure, was $6.8 million or $0.33 per share, a decrease from the prior quarter's adjusted nii of $7.7 million or $0.37 per share. the decrease was primarily as a result of declines in interest income as a result of overall declines in libor, placing additional assets on non-accrual status, and a reduction in fee income earned on our assets during the quarter.
these declines were partially offset by a reduction in incentive fees, as these fees were fully limited during the quarter, as a result of the total return limitation in our shareholder-friendly advisory agreement. libor rates were volatile during the period, and three-month libor, as an example, fell from approximately 1.9% at the beginning of the year to 1.45% at march 31st. during march, however, the three-month labor rate fell to a level as low as 75 basis points, 0.75% and is even lower than that today. we maintain libor floors in nearly all of our deals, which tend to be at least 1%, which insulates our portfolio from narrowing spreads in periods where libor falls below our floors.
as of march 31st, our net asset value was $205.4 million, which was down approximately 18% from the $249.4 million in net asset value as of december 31st. our nav per share decreased from $12.20 per share at december 31st to $10.04 per share as of march 31st. as ted already discussed in his earlier remarks, this decrease was primarily as a result of unrealized mark-to-market valuation adjustments in the portfolio, approximately 57% of which was solely related to the general widening of credit spreads during the quarter due to coron -- due to concerns over the covid-19 pandemic. we believe all things being equal, that a significant portion of these valuation adjustments could reverse over the next several quarters if the general level of market spreads continues to tighten.
looking to our statements of operations. total investment income decreased during the quarter, primarily as a result of a decrease in interest income due to additional non-accruals, as well as, a decrease in fee income as last period included a success fee-related to our investment in tap room gaming, $854,000 of which was not previously accrued and was realized on the payoff of our investment during the fourth quarter, and a slight reduction in dividend income from the slf during the period. during the quarter, we placed three additional positions on nonaccrual status, including the last out tranche of incipio, our investments in shi and bluestem. while total nonaccruals are now approximately 7% of the portfolio at fair value, once the expected proceeds are received on rockdale blackhawk, assuming all things remain the same and no additional nonaccruals are added, our nonaccruals would fall to approximately 4.3% based on fair value.
moving over to the expense side. total expenses for the quarter decreased, primarily driven by the elimination of incentive fees in the quarter. base management fees also declined slightly, primarily due to the lower level of assets at fair market value as a result of fair value adjustments to the portfolio during the quarter. interest and other debt financing expenses also declined during the quarter, primarily as a result of lower average debt outstanding and reductions in libor during the quarter.
at the end of the quarter, our regulatory leverage was approximately 1.47 debt-to-equity, an increase from the regulatory leverage nearly one point two at the end of the prior quarter. while this is higher than we would prefer, it is not only anticipated as a result of covid-19 related issues. the increase in regulatory leverage is as a result of a fair value -- fair market value adjustments in our portfolio, as well as, the significant amount of unanticipated revolver draws during the period. the current level of regulatory leverage is higher than the targeted leverage range we have guided you to on prior calls.
as such, our near-term focus will be on reducing leverage rather than portfolio growth. as we discussed earlier in the call, market loan prices have begun to recover, which should reverse some of the fair value marks on our assets. this, coupled with normal course principal amortization and possible repayments on recent revolver draws could contribute to future deleveraging of the portfolio. we are currently comfortably in compliance with the sec asset coverage ratio limitation and do not currently need to take advantage of the relief the sec recently provided due to the extreme volatility of asset prices during the first quarter.
as of march 31st, the slf had investments in 63 different borrowers, aggregating $217.2 million at fair value with a weighted average interest rate of approximately 6.56%. the slf had borrowings under its nonrecourse credit facility of $150.7 million and $19.3 million of available capacity under this current facility, subject to borrowing base availability. we do not expect to significantly grow the assets held in the slf at this time, and the slf continues to be in compliance with all covenants in its credit facility. as discussed earlier, the loans held in the slf saw significant unrealized mark-to-market writedowns during the period as a result of market spread widening due to the pandemic.
regarding rockdale blackhawk, as we have discussed on prior calls, there was a pending private arbitration of an accounts receivable claim with a national insurance carrier with a material amount in dispute. that claim serves as collateral for the mrcc loan of rockdale blackhawk. the underlying arbitration proceedings were completed in mid-august and final trial breached were due and submitted to the arbitrator in late september, an interim award was issued in january 2020. just recently, the arbitrator issued a final award, which updated the interim award to include certain attorneys fees, interest, and other amounts.
the final award was very positive and should result in a substantial recovery from mrcc and the other lenders to rockdale, far in excess of the cost basis of our outstanding loan balances due to the lenders' right to receive excess proceeds pursuant to the terms of a sharing agreement between the lenders and the estate. if there are any updates that could have a material effect on the value of the position, either positive or negative, we will update the shareholders at the appropriate time. another portfolio company toojay's has been in the news recently, as it recently filed for bankruptcy protection in florida. toojay's is a chain of fast casual gourmet deli restaurant down in florida.
as a result of the covid-19 pandemic, their restaurants have been closed for dine-in service and their revenues have been severely impacted as a result. in the bankruptcy filings, which are public, the company has indicated that they believe our loan is within the enterprise value of the company and we anticipate receiving adequate protection payments on our toojay's loan given our over collateralization position in the bankruptcy proceedings. i will now turn the call back to ted for some closing remarks before we open the line for questions.
ted koenig -- chief executive officer
thank you, aaron. in closing, we find ourselves in an unprecedented economic environment, which is likely to cause rising default rates and the potential for an extended recession. despite these challenges, we remain optimistic that we can weather the storm and emerge strong as we did as a firm after the great recession of 2008 and 2009. the key to our optimism is our conservative underwriting, a purposeful defensive portfolio, and our access to a large and very experienced portfolio management team with experience managing through multiple economic cycles and workouts.
we have a defensively positioned portfolio with solid loan documentation and a lot of control over our own destiny in terms of risk management. as such, we continue to believe that monroe capital corporation provides a very attractive investment opportunity to our shareholders as evidenced by the substantial amount of recent insider buying in march by members of our board, our extensive management team, and the senior management team at monroe capital. we are committed to navigating successfully through this economic crisis and are confident that we have the skills and experience necessary to manage through on behalf of all of our lending partners, bondholders, jv partners, and shareholders. we believe that mrcc is affiliated with a best-in-class external manager, which has decades of experience, 135 highly skilled employees, and approximately $9.3 billion in assets under management, which provides us the stability to steer the ship toward calmer waters.
we would like to thank our shareholders for their loyalty and confidence in us through these difficult times. i would also like to thank the entire team at the monroe capital organization for their hard work and dedication. thank you for all of your time today, and this concludes our prepared remarks. i am going to ask the operator to open the call now for questions.
thank you.

operator
[operator instructions] our first question comes from bob napoli with william blair. your line is open.
bob napoli -- william blair and company -- analyst
thank you. good morning, ted and aaron. good to hear your voice and hope you're doing well. appreciate the moves you've announced here this morning, and i think, they're appropriate.
i guess the biggest question, the hardest question to tell is, the marks that you've taken on the portfolio and the economy, the economic trends. i mean, how confident are you -- and i know it's impossible to forecast the next several quarters, but how confident are you in the current marks you that have, excluding the spreads -- changes in spread, the credit quality of the portfolio. how many of those companies have -- are on a watch list and were maybe not there three months ago because of covid? so, just some commentary around your comfort there would be helpful.
ted koenig -- chief executive officer
yeah. thanks for the question, bob. that's a great question. we -- like all bdcs, we hope, like all bdcs, attempt to do an in-depth internal analysis and review each of our marks every quarter.
we look at 100% of our portfolio. we have outside third parties that come in and look at 100% of our marks, not review management marks, not review 25% of our portfolio on a rolling basis, but 100% of the portfolio, top to bottom. so from a credibility standpoint, which is our at monroe, one of our guiding principles, is both not only for our publicly traded bdcs, but for also our privately managed funds. we try to do the best we can and we bring in outside parties to do the best they can to provide us with the most accurate information we have at the time.
we took some significant marks this quarter. hopefully, as time goes on, some of those marks will turn around. some of it was -- 57% of those marks were based on spread widening in and some factors that were beyond our control as a company. so from our perspective, management's, we're hoping that this thing -- this crisis cools and within another quarter or two goes away and we can get back to business as usual.
but we feel that we've done the very best job we could under the circumstances with the information we have and taking these remarks. aaron, do you have anything to add?
aaron peck -- chief financial officer and chief investment officer
yeah, just quickly. to the other part of your question, bob, we've been pretty aggressive in rerating our credits based on their impact of covid and how that implies on a credit rating basis movements they need to make. so we've definitely seen an increase in three-rated credit as a result of the pandemic because some of our borrowers are more directly affected than others. and so, you'll see when you look at the aggregation in the 10-q that there's more three-rated credits than there were last period and that's what you would expect, and we're very carefully looking at all of the deals in the portfolio across the entire monroe platform.
our credit teams are meeting multiple times a day on every deal, particularly the ones that are impacted by covid. and the one of the real benefits of having real scale in our investment teams is that when the new deal activity is later, which it is now due to low m&a activity. we have so many people available to make sure we're as on top of this portfolio as any firm could be. so, we feel really good about where we stand with regards to being able to manage through the prices.
bob napoli -- william blair and company -- analyst
thank you. just one follow-up question and congratulations on rockdale. that's a great outcome. but this is probably a great environment to make good loans, attractive terms.
and i know you talked about not growing the portfolio. you hope to get, i guess, the recovery from rockdale, but how many -- what do you feel like the opportunity is to make new loans in this environment, given your current leverage?
ted koenig -- chief executive officer
you know me, bob, as well as, others. we're going to play offense here. we did it after the crisis and we're going to do it now. we see some great opportunities across the firm.
we have funds that we've raised for this very purpose. we've got plenty of room across the firm and we're going to do everything we can to create some availability at mrcc. and as aaron mentioned, some of this is going to turn around. we're going to get our leverage where we want it to be.
again, but for the covid pandemic, with the spread widening and everything else, we'd be in much better shape. but again, post quarter, that's already started to reverse. so, we will be playing offense in this environment and we will be taking the best opportunities we can in the market and generating return for our shareholders.
bob napoli -- william blair and company -- analyst
thank you. appreciate it.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of tim hayes with b. riley. your line is open.
tim hayes -- b. riley fbr -- analyst
hey, good morning, everyone. thanks for taking my question and hope you're doing well. my first one here, just a follow-up on bob's. in the pipeline, what you're seeing today, what do leverage multiples and spreads look like? and are there any other characteristics that are a little bit different than what kind of your normal pipeline looks like based on the circumstances?
ted koenig -- chief executive officer
yeah. good question. if you look across the environment, just on the publicly reported lsg data, there's been a couple of hundred basis points of spread widening across the more broad syndicated and traded names. we're seeing in our markets, deals that we're getting done at l5, l550, and now at l800, l850, and l900.
we're quoting term shapes today at l800 to l1000 on deals in terms of rates. we're seeing that. we're seeing leverage that used to be in the 5s, down in the low 4s, sometimes in the mid 3s. so if you look at what we're seeing on a pipeline basis, we're seeing leverage 3.5 turns to 4 turns where we used to be 5 to 6 turns.
and the biggest opportunity, i think, that we have, which is unique to the moroe platform, we have a substantial opportunistic financing business, which is a different strategy than lending to pe firms and leverage buyouts. our opportunistic business is the combination of secondaries purchasing business where we're requiring good performing loans at less than par, substantially less than par in the 80s very often. we're doing asset-based asset-backed type financing, where we're running against pools of performing assets. we're doing bridge type lending against bridge situation, sometimes real estate, sometimes other assets, and we're doing portfolio nav type loan purchases and portfolio acquisitions.
so we've got substantial capital available for that and that is probably the lowest hanging fruit today in terms of generating double-digit yields for investors is this opportunistic strategy that we've been running for the last 10 years. so we've been looking forward to a time when the economy cools and we can start deploying alternate strategies to generate return for investors. i was just hoping it didn't cool this much and this fast. but i think, that you're going to see monroe come out of this very much stronger as an organization both our private funds, as well as, mrcc and our high net worth retail funds, just as we did after the financial crisis in 2008 and 2009.
tim hayes -- b. riley fbr -- analyst
thanks, ted. that's a good point and good color. can you give us an update on kind of credit trends so far in the second quarter. i know you said that in 1q, about over 97% of the portfolio was current.
but how has that trended with scheduled payments in the second quarter? how many companies would you say your portfolio have requested some type of forbearance? and how have you satisfied those requests?
ted koenig -- chief executive officer
good question. i will tell you that i think we've done a really good job in q1 over our companies. and because of that, we've had an exceptionally high rate of performance. i think, it's too early to tell yet in q2.
what happens, because we're way early in the quarter, and the effects of this covid-19, i think, are really going to play out in q2 for many companies. as i mentioned in our prepared remarks, we've been extraordinarily lucky. and i think, some of that luck was just based on good historical practice and we pulled out our playbook that we ran in the great financial crisis in '08, '09. we've avoided industries in a significant manner that are going to get decimated in the next quarter or two.
and those are autos, airlines, cruise, leisure, health club type things, oil and gas, minerals and mining, energy. if you look across the spectrum of private credit and other bdcs, you're going to see a drastically different type of portfolio with mrcc and in the monroe organization in general. because historically, we haven't had the expertise to lend into some of these specialized energy industries and we stayed away from the aviation, we stayed away from autos because we didn't like what happened the last time when the economy got overheated. so all things being equal, we should come out of this in much better shape than our peers.
and as i mentioned in our prepared remarks, we're not afraid to own companies. i mean, we've got a number of companies that we've taken over historically and we've generated some pretty darn good redults by replacing management teams, bringing some of our resources to bear some of our resources, to bear some of our professional staff, some of our outside professionals, consultants, combining businesses. we can do a fair amount. we've got 508 companies in our portfolio across the firm.
so that's 508 ceos, cfos, boards of directors, professionals, contacts. so when we take over a company, we put the monroe brand to bear in a situation, just like we do with rockdale blackhawk. i mean, that was a hospital, if you recall, that was closed. it was a closed hospital that basically went out of business.
we brought the resources to bear necessary to file a bankruptcy, to purchase claims in that bankruptcy, to acquire the entire rights to manage the credit out of that bankruptcy. and then, we proceeded against what we felt was a party that wronged the company, one of the insurance carriers, and we received a substantial recovery on that, way in excess of our loan. and we've got a number of other situations that are in the portfolio that we're proceeding now with similar type strategies and i would expect once this crisis passes, to again, to be a much better position vis-a-vis the markets in the portfolio versus other private credit managers.
tim hayes -- b. riley fbr -- analyst
that's helpful, ted. and yeah, congrats again on a successful outcome here with rockdale, definitely very positive and demonstrates the resources you guys have there. but just poking on the part b of that question there a little bit more was, i'm just curious if you've done anything like reducing covenants or deferring principal or interest payments or anything to satisfy forbearance request at this point? and just trying to maybe size the magnitude of that versus the companies that haven't had it request that at this point.
ted koenig -- chief executive officer
yeah. listen, we're dialoguing, as i mentioned in our prepared remarks with every company. to date, we've been lucky. and as i said, since we're not in the high-risk industries.
this hasn't been something that across the portfolio has been a significant undertaking like others. we're mostly in business services, we're in software, we're in it. we're in businesses that are in business, which is good. we look at this that if we can be a solution provider right now, that's our no.
1 goal is to stand up and protect our companies, our management teams, our private equity sponsors. so, we're there is more of a support system for them right now. as aaron mentioned in his remarks, we've been able to fund revolvers for companies. and it's -- i told a lot of the companies, it's kind of silly, companies were taking revolvers when they didn't need them just because they were afraid that the lenders weren't going to be there to fund capital requirements in the future.
we funded everything. once our borrowers saw that monroe was a strong counterparty here, we're actually seeing an interesting trend over the last two weeks. we're seeing our revolver usages start to come down again, not go up. they peaked and we're heading down.
and i think, that's going to be a continued trend in the future, which is going to help us in a number of fronts. as aaron mentioned, with a -- as we get back on the side with where we want to be with our target leverage. so to specifically answer your question, we feel pretty good that we're dialoguing with our clients, we're supporting them on a revolver basis. but across the portfolio, we're not seeing rampant needs to make drastic changes here.
and that's all a function of where we are with the assets we have.
tim hayes -- b. riley fbr -- analyst
that's good color. thanks, ted. i appreciate it. and then, just one more since you brought up the revolvers there.
just a little bit more maybe context around unfunded commitments right now. how much of unfunded commitment is approved and kind of readily available for borrowers to draw down on versus if any of that is achieved in milestone-based or needs approval?
ted koenig -- chief executive officer
well, i will tell you, i'm -- i made a comment, i'm going to turn it over to aaron for further, but i will tell you that we have reserved 100% of all revolver capacity or clients. and unlike others, we run our business on a much more conservative basis and we make sure that we have revolver commitments now. that said, we'll probably only get to 50% or 60% in terms of our usage on the revolvers. and as i also said, we're coming down now because now the companies know that they've got the ability to contact monroe and monroe will fund when we need to, there's no reason for borrowers to borrow on the revolver, put the money in bank accounts that we control, where we have liens on and pay us to excess interest that they don't need to pay.
if you think about it, that's why i tell a lot of the companies are silly. we're not going anywhere. i've got $9.3 billion at monroe as an organization. we're not going anywhere.
we're going to work. unlike the banks that folded in the last crisis, we're strong from a firm liquidity standpoint. so to borrow money, to take down revolvers that you don't need and pay us interest, it's not a really good use of thought process. i mean, aaron, do you have any other thoughts?
aaron peck -- chief financial officer and chief investment officer
yeah. just to your question around milestones and things like that. for the delayed draws, most of the committed delayed draw are set up for very specific uses. a lot of them are things like acquisitions.
and so as you might imagine, m&a activity is pretty light right now because most companies that need to buy some lot in this market would need to put up substantial equity, and it's a hard thing for sponsors to want to do right now until they start seeing things normalize. so i think of our total unfunded amount, it's something like $22 million is delayed draw. a lot of that we would not expect to fund, at least in the near term. and then the remaining, i think, it's around $18 million is remaining unfunded revolver availability, which is subject to covenant compliance and things like that is available.
tim hayes -- b. riley fbr -- analyst
sure.
aaron peck -- chief financial officer and chief investment officer
so that's how we look at it.
tim hayes -- b. riley fbr -- analyst
that's helpful. great, guys. well, thanks for taking my questions and stay well.
ted koenig -- chief executive officer
thank you, tim.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of chris york with jmp securities. your line is open.
chris york -- jmp securities -- analyst
hey, ted. hey, aaron. a couple of questions to begin on the senior loan funds. aaron, in your prepared comments, you said you are in compliance with the slf credit facility.
but can you just update us on those financial covenants with cap one?
aaron peck -- chief financial officer and chief investment officer
yeah. i mean, these are pretty standard things, chris. i think the thing that most people would be concerned about in a credit facility is the mark-to-market aspect of it. that's the -- that would be in the market right now -- that would be the nos.
1 sort of triggering concern is if you had mark-to-market calls on a fund like that that's pretty highly leveraged. that's -- unfortunately, that credit facility is not a pure mark-to-market fund. there are certain things that have to occur in the underlying borrowers to allow the lender there to look at a revaluation. so something called revaluation events for the slf credit facility and that's what would create -- any issues in that fund would be if that were to occur.
and so far, we're in pretty good shape and we've modeled out some, obviously, gone through all the names and what could happen and model that out. and between all of that, we feel like we should be in an minimal situation there but we continue to monitor it.
chris york -- jmp securities -- analyst
ok. so just to be clear, no minimum equity covenants are in that facility?
aaron peck -- chief financial officer and chief investment officer
no, there are other covenants. i'd have to get back to you on the specifics. i don't have them in front of me, but that facility, just to be clear, is nonrecourse to the parent. so there's nothing that creates a scenario that would come back to the parent.
but clearly, we've got significant equity in the sr that we want to preserve and we expect we'll be able to do that. but i'd have to get back to you on specific covenants at the slf credit facility. i don't have them all but i --
chris york -- jmp securities -- analyst
ok. and then two follow-ups. how much unfunded commitment exists in the slf? and then secondly, do you expect to fund your remaining equity? or do you expect it to be drawn in slf?
aaron peck -- chief financial officer and chief investment officer
yes. so we don't have a lot of unfunded commitments in the slf. i don't have the exact number in front of me, but it'd be very small. we don't do a lot of revolvers in there and we don't do a lot of delayed draws in there.
there's a handful. and so, there isn't a lot of unfunded risk in that slf. we do still have the ability to call some capital in order to -- in order to deal with any issues that may happen in that fund. they're still unfunded commitments in terms of equity under the original commitments.
but at this point, there's no current expectation at this moment that we would need to fund any of those. and right now, we're not growing the assets in there. so -- and we are, believe it or not seeing from time to time, a natural payoff in that fund, even in this environment. so, so far, so good.
i think, there's definitely less than $1 million in revolvers at the slf. i think it's about $800,000 of revolvers and maybe something like under $2 million is the delayed draws, i think. and as i said, those really are draws very similar to the loans we hold on the balance sheet from some of the specific uses of proceeds for delayed draw, most of which is pretty dormant right now.
chris york -- jmp securities -- analyst
very helpful. the dtls would be very small, but i just wanted to confirm. ted, i heard your comments about wanting to play offense and know you have the desire to be opportunistic, but how can monroe or mrcc participate in that from a funding perspective, given your leverage is above your target, and then, marginal capacity could be needed to support the portfolio companies?
ted koenig -- chief executive officer
good question. we're -- as we mentioned in our prepared remarks, chris, as a firm, we're going to be playing offense. we've got lots of different pockets of capital. to do that, mrcc, we're very focused on making sure that we're taking a conservative approach to managing our liquidity, to managing our leverage ratios.
we think that based upon the things that aaron mentioned, the spread widening changes, the valuations of the assets coming down, we're going to see unnatural progression of a reduction of leverage rates. and then as we continue to get payoffs, obviously, we're going to recycle capital and that's a normal occurrence for us. and we're going to do the best we can to generate -- to increase our rerisk deals every time we talk to sponsors. we're companies about leaving covenants and about making modifications to covenants.
that's an opportunity for us as a firm to, on a continual basis, rerisk and reprice the portfolio. and we're taking advantage of that opportunity to make sure that we're -- our portfolio is reflecting current market conditions across the board when companies and sponsors are asking us to assist them.
chris york -- jmp securities -- analyst
ok. and just to reiterate what i thought i heard. so, paydowns would be the principal funding mechanism to be opportunistic. and then alternatively, no other capital planning or exogenous events would drive the funding?
ted koenig -- chief executive officer
not today. not today. again, we're always looking at thoughts here and we're looking at taking advantage of market conditions when we can. but right now, let's stay the course, let's run our business, let's be conservative.
you're looking to see what we've done here in terms of valuations. i think, we've taken a conservative view here. number two, on liquidity and our plan going forward. we've taken a conservative view on what we're doing with our leverage.
and number three, on our dividend action, we've taken a very conservative view again to make sure that we're acting decisively, we're doing the right thing by our shareholders, and we're preparing here for the long term. this opportunity isn't a matter of days or weeks. this opportunity is going to last a while and we want to make sure that mrcc is positioned to be the price maker and to be the firm that can take advantage of this, the best and lower end of the middle market. this is a very fragmented market.
and when you look across the board, monroe, mrcc has always been one of the strongest players in this part of the market and we're making sure we're taking way of action we can to ensure that mrcc will continue to be one of the very strongest players in this segment of the market.
chris york -- jmp securities -- analyst
great. and those are all good points. moving on just a couple housekeeping items. in regards to the new nonaccrual loans, when did you stop accruing interest? and then, how much interest was not recognized in the quarter from those new accruals?
aaron peck -- chief financial officer and chief investment officer
yeah. so when we announced to you that loans are going on nonaccrual for the quarter, they go all the way back to the beginning of the quarter. so it's not that the part of the quarter. so in other words, the first quarter will not include any income from the new nonaccrual assets that we announced.
chris york -- jmp securities -- analyst
got it. very helpful. ok.
aaron peck -- chief financial officer and chief investment officer
yeah. i don't have a specific number for each of the three in front of me in terms of the amount of interest that would have been recognized, but there's nothing you need to back out of the first quarter because it wasn't recognized in the quarter for those.
chris york -- jmp securities -- analyst
yup. my thought process is that you stopped accruing maybe march, right? yeah, either march --
aaron peck -- chief financial officer and chief investment officer
yeah. we don't do it that way. yeah. we don't do it that way.
we just take it out for the whole quarter.
chris york -- jmp securities -- analyst
ok. and then on toojay's, i know you had addressed it there, but is that investment still accruing interest today?
aaron peck -- chief financial officer and chief investment officer
it's still accruing. it's still paying.
ted koenig -- chief executive officer
yeah. that's never going nonpay. just, chris, as a matter -- and i don't know how that works in bankruptcy, i don't know from those that may not be as familiar with bankruptcy is your loan is either continue to be lateralized in bankruptcy or not. if it's collateralized in bankruptcy or over secured, you're entitled adequate protection payments, which are your interest payments.
if it's deemed to be not adequately secured, then there is an adjustment. we expect toojay's to continue to pay us. we feel we're in a good leverage position and we're within the enterprise value and the company has stated that when their filings in court procedures.
aaron peck -- chief financial officer and chief investment officer
yeah. just to be clear on that, chris. a lot of times in the bankruptcy, there's a bit of a fight between the estate and the senior lender over this issue and there has been no fight on this particular situation. they -- the company didn't even ask us.
they absolutely said right out of the gates that we believe we were over collateralizing the intend to keep us current.
chris york -- jmp securities -- analyst
got it. ok. very helpful. i just know some bdcs, there are different nonaccrual policies.
so recognizing that toojay's is helpful. last one is just on cpk. i know you took a mark there, i think two out of two investment. another peer put it on nonaccruals and abundance of caution.
i know it's a broadly syndicated loan. do you feel pretty good about your evaluation there? and i know, there's a lot of uncertainty over the next couple of quarters, but relative to how others are thinking about it? just curious on your update.
ted koenig -- chief executive officer
yeah. look, i mean, i think we'll continue to look at it very carefully going into the successive quarters. and we'll determine that we think that there's high probability of us not receiving interest, we will make the same determination. we haven't made a determination as of march 31st.
but we're watching it closely. we hold it across a few different funds and we're keeping a very close watch on the situation and it's one that could be real careful about going forward in terms of accrual steps.
chris york -- jmp securities -- analyst
got it. that and all the data point on having it at other funds is helpful to -- from having potential more interesting. so that's it for me. thank you, guys and be well.
aaron peck -- chief financial officer and chief investment officer
thanks, chris.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of chris kotowski with oppenheimer. your line is open.
chris kotowski -- oppenheimer and company -- analyst
yeah. you actually kind of got it, my question a little bit on the last one. i was just kind of when we see these triangulating back and forth between where we see the marks, you see, right, california petition at $0.50 and [inaudible] at 60, and often you see the nonaccruals at similar kinds of marks. and if you said you put things on nonaccrual, on a proactive basis, i guess, what philosophically makes you keep some of these other heavily marked names on equitable status? is there just visibility to some interest -- to interest payments there?
ted koenig -- chief executive officer
yeah. good question. so like, in a normal environment, there is definitely some correlation between something being marked down a considerable amount and being on nonaccrual test and that's definitely a signaling effect that we also look at and we reexamine every name. we do them independently.
we look at individual credits and how they're performing and think about nonaccrual. and then, we also look at where the marks are coming in and think about nonaccrual. so it isn't lost on us that you might look at -- i mean, forman mills, i would say, marked in the 60s, should that be on accrual status or not. but what you have to look at is, we're in an environment where assets that aren't performing as completely performing high-quality performance during covid, are taking pretty aggressive marks right now, even if there is some visibility that they will improve and forman mills is a really good example.
i mean, coming into covid-19, forman mills seeing some significant improvement in same-store sales, is outperforming its budget. but it was forced to shut down all of its stores as a result of covid. and so, that's the issue with that company. but given the nature of what they do, it's a pretty countercyclical business.
historically, it's a company that's done really well in times of an economic cycle. so when those stores reopen, that company should do really well. and so, we do think -- and we believe that the market there should not be permanently down in this level and should recover once the stores open up because of the nature of what that company does, which is low-price, off-price retail.
chris kotowski -- oppenheimer and company -- analyst
right. ok. and then, unrelated issue, can you just remind us again how the limitation on your incentive fee works? because we were reading the definition of the pre-incentive fee income and we're -- is the definition of the incentive fee, does it include the base management fee or does it exclude that? you know, the 12-quarter look back.
aaron peck -- chief financial officer and chief investment officer
right. i'll try my best with this description. and then, if you need to follow off, you can do that because it is complicated.
chris kotowski -- oppenheimer and company -- analyst
ok.
aaron peck -- chief financial officer and chief investment officer
so our part one is a calculation, which is based on nii, is structured with this shareholder-friendly cloud and has a limitation in place to ensure that we don't pay a significant amount of incentive fees based on nii during periods where there has been a significant amount of realized or unrealized losses in the portfolio, right?
chris kotowski -- oppenheimer and company -- analyst
right.
aaron peck -- chief financial officer and chief investment officer
so the way it works is, is that the part where incentives are limited to the extent that our incentive fees for the last 11 quarters exceed 20% of gaap earnings, excluding adjusted incentive fees for the last 12 quarters. so to the extent we have unrealized losses like we've had here, it's going to limit our incentive fees fully until we earn a lot of that back. but it looks at 20% of gaap earnings, excluding the incentive fees. that's what it compares to.
chris kotowski -- oppenheimer and company -- analyst
ok. ok. that's what i thought. all right.
thanks. that's it for me.
aaron peck -- chief financial officer and chief investment officer
thanks, chris.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of christopher nolan with ladenburg. your line is open.
christopher nolan -- ladenburg thalmann -- analyst
hey, guys. can you give us an indication as to where you think the leverage ratios were going down? i mean, what's your -- what are you targeting 1.25 or lower?
aaron peck -- chief financial officer and chief investment officer
yeah, good question, chris. i mean, i think right now, we're just targeting lower than where we are. i think, we'd like to see ourselves below that kind of 1.3 -- 1.2 to 1.3 level that we've talked about in the past. i think still that's a reasonable level for us to get to.
and we'll see how we get -- as we move along, we'll see how the market deals. everything we do is really based on our view of the market and where the opportunities lie and what the risks are in the portfolio. so getting the rockdale money in, hopefully, coming up here in the next couple of months will help delever us a little bit. and then, we'll take a hard look at where i think we stand in the market with our names and where we see risk, and we'll make a final decision about kind of where leverage should be.
but as a general matter, i think, between 1.2 and 1.3, still seems like a reasonable place to be, particularly, when a lot of our reasonably good quality means a marked low, we think we'll recover. and that would argue that we don't need to be at even lower leverage because there's so much mark already in the names. and so, some of this is really artificial, but we have to look at it because it's based on fair value to that.
christopher nolan -- ladenburg thalmann -- analyst
and aaron, on the credit facility, what sort of advance -- has the advance rate changed at all in terms of the value -- the fair market value of the assets up against the borrowings?
aaron peck -- chief financial officer and chief investment officer
so the advances are based on fair market value. so the advances themselves don't change. the only time that advances change is that in terms of how you categorize an asset. so with certain performance an asset that was historically counted as a first lien asset might have a portion -- if the leverage goes up in the underlying asset might have a portion that's considered second lien.
and then, you do a bifurcation of the asset into two buckets when you look at advance rates, but the increase themselves are advanced rates on fair market value. so obviously, as far market value comes down, the amount that is advanced comes down in terms of the borrowing base, but it doesn't mean if the advance rate moves.
christopher nolan -- ladenburg thalmann -- analyst
ok. that's it for me. thank you.
aaron peck -- chief financial officer and chief investment officer

thank you. our next question comes from the line of robert dodd with raymond james. your line is open.
robert dodd -- raymond james -- analyst
hi, guys, and glad everybody's healthy. first, a housekeeping one, then, a couple of detailed questions. on the rockdale blackhawk, i mean, ted, in your prepared remarks, you expect that settlement to be paid in, i think, the coming quarter. does that mean the second quarter or the third quarter, just for clarity?
ted koenig -- chief executive officer
yeah. good question, robert. first of all, i'm glad you're safe and everything is good. i think it will get paid in q2 is our plan right now.
you know, our lawyers are telling us that this money should be in q2. so that's what we've been planning for.
robert dodd -- raymond james -- analyst
got it. got it. thank you. and then on -- i have some questions today.
can you give us any color on what percentage of your portfolio is, say, a cash monthly interest payout versus quarterly? and of those sho -- how many of have made the payment in april?
ted koenig -- chief executive officer
good question. i will tell you that most of our portfolio is quarterly pay. i don't have the specifics in front of me now, but we can certainly get that for you. but we set up our system, again, across our entire firm to be mostly quarterly pays.
and as aaron mentioned in his prepared remarks, i mean, we've got a 97% or higher number paid our march payments. so we anticipate -- we don't anticipate -- hopefully, much fall off, but it's early yet. this is -- we're in may. we've got another six weeks or so to go to the end of the quarter.
i can tell you that we're dialoguing with our companies on a regular basis, a weekly basis. and because of the loan documentation that we have with companies in this spot in the market, we're able to get real time information, very often, a weekly financial information from the companies, and a very high percentage of our companies also applied for and we're successful in getting the ppp loans. that's another thing that you over -- sometimes people overlook. but in our segment of the market, because of our infrastructure, we were very, very active in helping and assisting our companies with the sole ppp program.
and that's going to, i think, pay dividends to us in more ways than one with stability and liquidity, as well as, performing -- our borrowers performer.
robert dodd -- raymond james -- analyst
got it. got it. i appreciate that color. thank you.
and then one more, if i can. on the recovery process there's going to be recovery processes as we go through this, obviously. i mean, how are you going to allocate or what's the approach to maybe allocating time? it could be quite an intensive process, and in some cases, obviously, lockdown, very good recovery. the picture people, if we go back, not so good recovery, you spend a lot of time on that one.
so how is the allocation of resources going to be decided, if it's only 3% of the portfolio, it's not that bad, but we don't know how things are going to turn out. so, how is that allocation being of head count your time and some except of being allocated across the more stressed portfolio right now?
ted koenig -- chief executive officer
that's a very good question. i will tell you that given the size of our platform, we've got some inherent advantages. and not only that, we've lined a few lessons over the years. and sometimes, the best lessons you learn are from less than positive outcomes.
the picture people transaction was not a great result for us. we put forth some efforts into that and we believe that we were making progress, and we didn't have the right people in the right spots there, and we have some lessons at the time. this time, it's different. we have eight people that we brought on to the firm over the last three, four years that are solely focused on workouts, restructuring, equity optimization.
we have an equity group now at the firm. that's led by a fellow named brad bernstein, who is an old guy like the rest of us, and he's been in the business for over 30 years. and he is a team of eight people that are all 15-, 20-year experience, people buying companies, managing companies, running companies. and what we've done is we've basically taken our high-risk companies and we're monitoring them in two different ways.
one, on behalf of a lender but also, two, as an equity owner because these are businesses that we could end up owning. we looked at rockdale the same way. we went in and we bought up debt there with the intention of either operating or filing and making the claim, and in that instance, we chose to make a claim. other instances, we took over companies and i'll tell you one that we have in our portfolio.
it's a maintenance repair operation, which is an airline company that does maintenance and repair. we took over that company years ago with broader monroe capital platform and we are able to restructure that, bring people in, run that business, and it's not part of the mrcc portfolio today. but what it is, is the situation where we brought the right resources to bear and that company is going to get sold for a high multiple of earnings. so with respect to mrcc specifically, most bdcs that cover the lower part of the middle market don't have the resources, eight equity workout -- dedicated workout people.
so the good news is with mrcc, it's getting the benefit of being part of the legal platform, all of the infrastructure, all the resources to run those companies to take them over, if we need to and to manage those processes out now so that we can focus on our day jobs of running mrcc and doing the right thing on a conservative basis for our shareholders.
robert dodd -- raymond james -- analyst
i appreciate that color. thanks, ted. stay healthy.
ted koenig -- chief executive officer
you too, robert.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of troy ward with ares management. your line is open.
troy ward -- ares management -- analyst
thank you and good morning, ted and aaron, and thanks for the call. i hope you're team is staying safe and healthy. first, we'd just like to comment on the details you provided, the breakout of the unrealized marks related to credit versus spread widening. as you're aware, that's extremely helpful.
for us to understand the movement in nav and what we might expect in the future -- in the coming months and quarters. and as you correctly laid out, the spreads tightening and some amortization and some portfolio cash flow should see some natural occurrence, i think, ted, as you used to get back into a lower leverage perspective. but kind of a follow-up on what -- i feel like a lot of the questions have been revolving around is really kind of the ability to put attractive capital out in the near-term without pushing that leverage back up. so, ted, if you could speak to kind of conversations you're having maybe directly with the companies.
but maybe, the company's and their ability to access any potential government programs that could help on the lower side, but also, the private equity ability or willingness to put in additional capital. and also, the relaxation of some of the co-investment rules, is there an opportunity for other capital to come in and protect the investments in mrcc from the broader monroe platform? so any commentary around that would be really helpful.
ted koenig -- chief executive officer
yeah. good, troy. listen, i'm glad you asked that question, actually, it's a thoughtful one. the -- most people don't really understand in our market and the lower part of the middle market.
there's opportunities to play offense while you're playing offense, but there's also opportunities to put offense while your play defense. and the neat thing about our market is companies don't have the ability to go out and do bond offerings and do unsecured notes. in our part of the market, what we try to look for is ways to assist companies. it can be through a revolver draw.
it could be through a relaxation of a covenant. it could be introducing the company to go mezzanine debt provider to put additional capital in and reprice our loan. it can be leading on the private equity sponsor to do something. if we do something, then, we ask them to do something.
very often, when we make a covenant waiver or we make a combination for our borrower, it's because we're doing that in concert with something else. the private equity sponsor is stepping up, additional equity, the sponsor is guaranteeing as part of our loans, the sponsor is committed to put forth capital in the future into the company. we're, as i mentioned earlier in my remarks, we've taken a very active program in assisting our companies with ppp money. we have 53 banks in our credit facilities across the monroe platform.
the first thing that we did as a firm is, we've identified the banks that were most likely to assist each one of our portfolio companies. and then, we made the appropriate introductions to make sure that that process was set up appropriately. and then, we monitored the effectiveness of that and the staging of the applications and the approvals and the funds awarding under the ppp program. there's a couple of other programs now that are online and the regulations are being formed, the main street lending program, other loan programs were equally as active in those programs with our borrowers to make sure that they can access the liquidity.
so from a company standpoint, very often, the things that happen behind the scenes that don't show up in our earnings calls are the things that are the most effective in creating value and playing offense. and as i mentioned earlier, we're taking a hard look at all of our companies and we're being asked to make accommodations and to provide assistance. we're asking for the same benefit from our companies in terms of repricing and rerisking our portfolio and very often deleveraging as well. so, this is an interesting time in the space that we play.
we've got a number of different levers to pull that we can pull that in larger companies, they can't. and very often, in these -- the middle-market companies, too, we've got control over their income statement very often in terms of identifying areas where they can cut expenses encouraging them to make certain expense cut reductions and things to to preserve and protect cash as well. so that's a long winded answer to -- i think, your question, but it shows all the tools that we have available in our arsenal to work to bring to bear.
troy ward -- ares management -- analyst
no, that's very insightful and very helpful. one last thing. i think you mentioned, the broader mineral platform as upwards of $9 billion of aum. can you speak to the the kind of dry powder, if you're -- if you're willing, that you have available to step in and put capital to work where needed?
ted koenig -- chief executive officer
sure. sure. i will tell you that going into this crisis situation on march 1st, we had about $1.4 billion neighborhood of dry powder available at our monroe capital level. and as you know, we've got scc co-investment capability that we can do across of our funds exempt of belief.
so we were feeling pretty good. we have been aggressively raising additional capital in the low level. we have a number of funds in the market. we have private credit funds in the market.
we have opportunistic funds. we have retail funds, high net worth funds, and we've been using this as a really -- as an opportunity to continue to raise capital from both institutional investors, sovereign wealth funds, pensions, endowments, foundations, retail, high net worth retail, and others that are looking for yield. you know, when the s&p drops 20% when bonds get hit, when libor goes down, when u.s. treasuries are 30-basis points for 10 years.
investors don't really have anywhere to hide. and the best place to hide is in the private credit space generally. and within the private credit space, what investors are realizing is that you turn to the very best managers, the ones that have been around the longest, that have a track record probably with very long period of time. you know we've been doing this business 20 years now.
we've gone through four down cycles, two crisis, the dot com crash in 2000 and the great financial crisis in 2008. what will likely be the third crisis that people will look back to is the 2020 covid pandemic. so we've got a playbook for dealing with this. you know, we've got the infrastructure.
we've got the capital. and you know, in each of the last downturns and crises, if you look at our track record, we've done very well in that vintage period. during and right after that crisis. i think that 2020, '21 and very much into '22 are going to be very strong periods for private credit and the firms that are set up and have the capital and the infrastructure to manage into be active in these periods.
i think we'll do very well. and the other side of that coin is the firms that are more one dimensional that have one product or are very highly concentrated set of investors or don't have the scale to you know to have the staying power over the next few quarters are not going to do as well. and quality always rises to the top and i'm confident that the infrastructure and the organization that we've built in monroe will continue to deliver outsized returns during this crisis, after this crisis, just like it has in the last two crisis that we've experienced.
troy ward -- ares management -- analyst

ted koenig -- chief executive officer
i want to thank everyone today for joining the call. i know it ran a little bit longer than our prior calls. i think, there are a lot of good questions. again, we don't take decisions and actions lightly, and we've put forth, i think, a thoughtful and decisive manner in which we're managing mrcc.
we've made some hard decisions at mrcc, which are going to be in the long-term best interest of our shareholders. and we continue to see value where we are today, as evidenced by a lot of the insider purchases that have been made in our company. and we wish everyone health and be safe, and we will all talk to you again next quarter, sometime in early august. so with that, any follow-up questions that anyone that has, as always, we endeavor to be as transparent as we can.
please contact aaron offline and i'm sure we can give more information that is requested. so, thank you, and everyone, have a good day.

i would now like to turn the call over to ted koenig, chief executive officer of monroe capital corporation. please go ahead.
theodore koenig -- president & chief executive officer
good morning and thank you to everyone who has joined us on our call today. welcome to our second quarter 2020 earnings conference call. i'm joined by aaron peck, our cfo and chief investment officer. last evening, we issued our second quarter 2020 earnings press release and filed our 10-q with the sec. first and foremost, we hope you and your families remain healthy and safe.
we are pleased that despite the continued economic and public health challenges associated with the ongoing covid-19 pandemic, we were able to generate record net investment income and increased nav performance during the second quarter of 2020. the continued uncertainty associated with the covid-19 pandemic has created concerns related to the economy, as well as specific unanticipated challenges for many companies due to business interruptions and a slowdown in business activity. this uncertainty has caused volatility across the financial markets over the past several months. the government stimulus has buoyed the financial markets during the second quarter with the s&p 500 erasing nearly all of the 20% decline experienced in the first quarter. price increases were also seen in traded credit investments as the s&p/lsta leveraged loan index, which finished the first quarter down approximately 14% in market value, rebounded and was up approximately 8% during the second quarter.
the uncertainty that caused many of our portfolio companies across our platform to be focused on their own liquidity as evidenced by the wave of revolver draws requested that we saw during march waned considerably after april. we are back to a near normal on portfolio company revolver draws. the monroe funds, including mrcc have met all borrower revolver draw requests and we believe that we have the appropriate liquidity to meet any future requests across all of our funds.
as we discussed on last quarter's call, we have been shifting our portfolios over the past several quarters in all of the monroe funds away from higher risk cyclical industries. as a result, mrcc has limited to no direct portfolio exposure in industries most affected by the pandemic such as airlines, automotive, travel leisure, oil and gas, minerals, and mining and energy. however, the best thing about our portfolio is that we are typically a control lender. we are the agent on approximately 81% of our loan investments. we have good loan documentation with tight baskets regarding indebtedness and restricted payments with no collateral leakage potential.
we have at least two and often several more financial covenants on most all of our deals, including maintenance and incurrence tests and debt leverage. this allows us to be proactively engaged with our borrowers, and their financial sponsors in terms of liquidity. it also allows us to opportunistically amend and reprice our loans to constantly rerisk our portfolio. in past calls, we have discussed the importance of tighter loan documentation in the lower-middle market that we play. in the larger broad middle market, almost 80% of all loans are covenant light. in our market, we are dialoguing with our company's weekly and sometimes on a daily basis. this allows us to manage risk and do many things to enhance our risk and return positions. our risk is also mitigated by the fact that we maintain conservative starting leverage and loan to values when we underwrite our loans often in the neighborhood of 50% loan to value.
our arbitration proceeding in the rockdale blackhawk matter is now complete. the award was issued in final form and we received payment during the second quarter, which covered more than 100% of our par amounts, accrued interest, and fees on this loan. we are expecting an additional payment of the remaining escrowed amount once certain legal issues are resolved. assuming we recover the remaining escrowed amount at the current estimated value, we will have received $23.6 million in proceeds and investment that had a cost basis of $19.5 million. this recovery does not include the substantial interest payments and equity distributions that we received over the life of this investment including in june in conjunction with the settlement, which aggregated approximately $23.1 million for mrcc. this is a prime example of how monroe is dedicated and expert portfolio management efforts can yield outstanding results even in a difficult and delicate situation.
turning now to the second quarter results. we are pleased to report that in this challenging environment. we generated adjusted net investment income of $0.62 per share, a significant increase from the adjusted net investment income of $0.33 per share in the first quarter. the increase in our net investment income was primarily the result of receipts of proceeds related to the rockdale proceedings. approximately $7.4 million or $0.36 per share of previously unaccrued interest and fees were recognized as a result of proceeds from the legal proceedings during this quarter.
without rockdale, our adjusted net investment income would still have covered our recent quarterly dividend of $0.25 per share. aaron will go into more detail regarding the components of our net investment income later in the call.
we also reported a net increase in assets resulting from operations of $14.2 million or $0.69 per share during the quarter, which was driven primarily by the increase in the fair value of our investment portfolio during the quarter. as a result, our nav, on a per share basis, grew from $10.04 per share at march 31 to $10.37 per share at the end of the second quarter. net increases in the fair value of investments contributed approximately $0.36 per share to our book value growth during the quarter or 3.6% on a per share basis. additionally, the net impact of the settlement of rockdale contributed approximately $0.07 per share to the book value growth during the quarter.
in order to bolster our liquidity and reduce leverage, we issued 825,460 shares of stock under the atm program during the quarter, which reduced our per share book value by $0.10 per share. without this issuance, we would have experienced a $0.44 per share increase in our book value per share. we estimate that approximately $0.36 per share of the increase in book value was attributable to changes in portfolio valuation, including $0.46 per share as a result of the tightening of credit spreads during the period unrelated to individual credit performance.
during the quarter, lcd first lien three-year discounted loan spreads tightened by 365 basis points, retracing around 60% of the first quarter spread widening. of that $0.46 per share nav increase attributable to spread tightening, approximately $0.26 per share or 57% was attributable to assets held directly by us, while $0.20 per share or 43% was as a result of markups on assets held in the mrcc senior loan joint venture. the loans in the joint venture tend to be middle market -- larger middle market companies. and those loans experience higher price volatility in times of market correction. this increase of $0.46 per share associated with spread tightening was partially offset by approximately $0.11 per share of unrealized net mark-to-market valuation losses attributable to specific credits in certain portfolio companies, a significant portion of which is as a direct result of the impact of the covid-19 pandemic on these borrowers. a recovery of these unrealized losses is dependent on both continued spread tightening as well as improved company performance for these specific covid-19 affected loans.
during the quarter, we reduced mrcc's regulatory debt-to-equity leverage from 1.47 times debt-to-equity to 1.6 times, returning to approximately the same level of regulatory leverage as of the beginning of the year. the decline in leverage was primarily driven by strong repayment activity during the quarter, including the realization on rockdale. we continue to focus on managing our investment portfolio at the appropriate risk adjusted leverage level going forward and continue to target regulatory leverage in the range of 1.2 to 1.3 times debt-to-equity.
our senior management team is continuing to spend time and effort analyzing underperforming credits and collection strategies. we are very focused on realizing the highest possible recoveries on the assets that we have marked down. and we are engaged in several processes to execute on that strategy. one such process was undertaken with respect to rockdale blackhawk in 2019. and we have seen the positive results of that process now contributing approximately $0.07 of our per share book value increase during the period. there are other similar processes ongoing.
the monroe capital organization has approximately 125 employees with many devoted to underwriting, risk management, and workout strategies. during periods like this, it allows us to bring the very best resources to bear on the portfolio that are necessary. as many of you know, we have a long track record of success in managing through difficult economic environments, notably the great financial crisis in 2008 and 2009, including select workout situations with borrowers. if need be, we are not afraid to take over and hone our business. while that is not our preferred option, we know how to do it and have done it successfully in the past. if necessary, we will roll up our sleeves and do what we need to do in order to achieve the best possible recovery. the important thing is that we have the ability, experience and internal resources to do that if necessary.
as we look ahead, there continues to be a high bar for investing new capital during uncertain times. we are seeing many attractive investment opportunities to invest capital today, and we have over $100 million of liquidity on our ing led revolving credit facility in terms of availability subject to borrowing base capacity. aaron will discuss more about that later.
our focus for the balance of the year will be to maintain current leverage levels and to selectively make new investments in portfolio companies with compelling risk return dynamics, just as we have done at monroe in the years following the last economic downturn in 2010 and 2011. we are now well positioned to do this.
investment spreads have widened considerably and terms of leverage have improved as well and we have the liquidity to selectively take advantage. mrcc enjoys a strong strategic advantage in being affiliated with a best-in-class middle market private credit asset management firm with over $9 billion in assets under management and over 125 employees as of july 1, 2020. we will continue to focus on generating adjusted net investment income and nav performance, just as we have shown this past quarter.
i am now going to turn the call over to aaron who is going to walk through with you our financial results.

thank you, ted. during the quarter, we funded a total of $10.3 million in investments, which solely consisted of new fundings to existing borrowers, including $9 million in revolver draws and $1.3 million and add-ons and delayed-draw fundings. as we discussed earlier in the call, many of our borrowers drew on the revolvers in order to increase liquidity on their balance sheets, due to the uncertainty related to covid-19. this portfolio growth was offset by sales and repayments on portfolio assets, which aggregated $42.3 million during the quarter, including proceeds from the rockdale settlement and partial sales and paydowns. at june 30, we had total borrowings of $370 million including $146 million outstanding on our revolving credit facility, $109 million of our 2023 notes and sba debentures payable of $115 million. our outstandings under our revolver decreased by approximately $45 million during the quarter as we were focused on the reduction in our leverage during the period. any future portfolio growth revolver draws or advances to existing borrowers will predominantly be funded by the $109 million of availability remaining under our ing-led revolving credit facility, subject to borrowing base capacity and the uninvested cash held in our sbic subsidiary.
turning to our results. for the quarter ended june 30, adjusted net investment income, a non-gaap measure, was $12.8 million or $0.62 per share, a substantial increase from the prior quarter's adjusted net investment income of $6.8 million or $0.33 per share. the increase was primarily as a result of the recognition of previously unaccrued interest in fees received on rockdale blackhawk of $0.36 per share, which was previously recorded as part of our mark-to-market gain on our investment in rockdale.
in june, the company received $33.1 million in proceeds from the rockdale matter, of which $19.5 million was recorded as a reduction in the cost basis of the company's investment in rockdale, $3.9 million was recorded as the collection of previously accrued interest, $7.4 million or $0.36 per share was recorded as investment income for previously unaccrued interest and fees and $2.3 million or $0.11 per share was recorded as realized gains.
additionally, as an offset, the company recorded net change in unrealized losses of $8.2 million or $0.40 per share, primarily as a result of the reversal associated with the collection of proceeds from the rockdale estate. total net income associated with the company's investment in rockdale was $1.5 million or $0.07 per share during the quarter ended june 30, 2020. as of june 30, 2020 the company has a remaining investment in rockdale associated with residual proceeds expected from these state of $1.8 million or about $0.08 per share. this increase in investment income from rockdale was partially offset by declines in interest income as a result of overall declines in libor, placing three smaller additional assets on non-accrual status and a reduction in dividend income earned on the slf during the quarter.
incentive fees were fully limited during the quarter as a result of the total return limitation in our shareholder friendly advisory agreement. libor rates were volatile during the period and three-month libor, as an example, fell from approximately 1.45% at march 31 to 30 basis points as of june 30. while we maintain libor floors in nearly all of our deals with the majority of floors at a level of at least 1%, the reduction in libor did negatively impact our net investment income during the period.
as of june 30, our net asset value was $220.6 million, which was up approximately 7.4% from the $205.4 million in net asset value as of march 31. our nav per share increased from $10.04 per share at march 31 to $10.37 per share as of june 30. as ted already discussed in his earlier remarks, the increase in our per share nav was primarily as a result of unrealized mark-to-market valuation adjustments in the portfolio related to general tightening of credit spreads during the quarter and the resolution of the rockdale blackhawk matter offset partially by some specific mark-to-market adjustments on certain names in the portfolio that were impacted by covid-19 and the issuance of shares below nav during the quarter.
looking to our statement of operations. total investment income increased during the quarter, primarily as a result of an increase in interest income due to the recognition of previously unaccrued interest and fees on the rockdale matter, offset by a reduction in dividend income from the slf during the period and a reduction in income on the remainder of the portfolio. during the quarter, we placed three additional positions on non-accrual status, including our investments in california pizza kitchen, parterre flooring, and the preferred equity position in value to our products. notwithstanding those small additional nonaccruals, our overall fair value non-accrual position improved markedly in the quarter. total non-accruals now approximate 4.7% of the portfolio at fair value, which compares to 7.4% as of march 31, largely as the result of rockdale, which had been listed as a non-accrual asset in previous periods.
moving over to the expense side. total expenses for the quarter decreased primarily driven by the reduction in interest in other debt financing expenses in the quarter due to the lower debt balances. base management fees also declined slightly primarily due to the lower level of assets at fair market value as a result of repayments in the portfolio during the quarter.
at the end of the quarter, our regulatory leverage was approximately 1.16 debt-to-equity, a substantial decrease from the regulatory leverage level of nearly 1.47 at the end of the prior quarter. the decrease in regulatory leverage is as a result of positive fair market value adjustments in our portfolio as well as the paydown on our revolving credit facility during the period. the current level of regulatory leverage is consistent with the targeted leverage range we have guided you to on prior calls. we are currently comfortably in compliance with the sec asset coverage ratio limitation and actually below our previously discussed target regulatory leverage level of 1.2 to 1.3 times debt-to-equity.
as of june 30, the slf had investments in 61 different borrowers aggregating $219 million at fair value with a weighted average interest rate of approximately 6%. the slf had borrowings under its nonrecourse credit facility of $153.7 million and $16.3 million of available capacity under this credit facility subject to borrowing base availability. we do not expect to significantly grow the assets held in the slf at this time and the slf continues to be in compliance with all covenants in its credit facility. as discussed earlier, the loans held in the slf saw significant unrealized mark-to-market increases during the period as a result of market spread tightening.
regarding rockdale blackhawk as we've discussed on prior calls, there is a pending private arbitration of a breach of contract claim with a national insurance carrier with a material amount in dispute. that claim served as collateral for the mrcc loan to rockdale blackhawk. the underlying arbitration proceedings were completed in mid-august and final trial briefs were due and submitted to the arbitrator in late september of last year. an interim award was issued in january 2020. just recently, the arbitrator issued a final award, which updated the interim award to include certain attorneys' fees interest and other amounts. the final award was very positive and resulted in a substantial recovery from mrcc and the other lenders to rockdale, far in excess of the cost basis of our outstanding loan balances and unpaid interest and fees due to the lenders right to receive excess proceeds pursuant to the terms of a sharing agreement between the lenders and the estate. a small portion of such proceeds are being held in escrow pending a decision by a judge on the merits of two parties claims to receive such proceeds.
another portfolio company bj services has been in the news, as it recently filed for bankruptcy protection in texas. mrcc holds approximately $4.3 million of exposure to bj services in the form of a first lien senior secured loan. bj services is an oil service company that is a leading provider of hydraulic fracking, factoring and cementing services to upstream oil and gas companies. as a result of the decline in oil prices and as a result of the covid-19 pandemic, demand for their services has been negatively impacted. our loan is secured by a very substantial amount of equipment and other fixed assets, which we expect to be sold through the bankruptcy proceedings. we believe that our loan has significant asset coverage and we expect to remain current on all payments and we anticipate being repaid in full through the bankruptcy process. equipment sales have already started.
i will now turn the call back to ted for some closing remarks before we open the line for questions.
theodore koenig -- president & chief executive officer
thank you. aaron. in closing, we continue to find ourselves in an unprecedented economic environment, which is likely to cause rising default rates and the potential for a recession. despite these challenges, we remain optimistic about our investment portfolio and our prospects similar to what we saw in growth of the firm after the great recession of 2008 and 2009. the key is our conservative underwriting, a purposeful defensive portfolio and our access to a large and experienced portfolio management team with experience managing through multiple economic cycles.
we have a defensively positioned portfolio with solid loan documentation and a lot of control over our own destiny in terms of risk management. as such, we continue to believe that monroe capital corporation provides a very attractive investment opportunity to our shareholders. our dividend is fully covered by net investment income and we have sufficient liquidity to selectively play offense in this market. we are committed to navigating successfully through this economic period and are confident that we have the skills and experience necessary to maximize returns for all of our lending partners, bondholders, jv partners, and shareholders. we believe that mrcc is affiliated with a best-in-class external manager, which has decades of experience, approximately 125 highly skilled employees and approximately $9.3 billion in assets under management, which provides us the infrastructure and stability in times like these. it also provides us an opportunity for mrcc to outperform. we would like to thank our shareholders for their loyalty and confidence. i would also like to thank the entire team at monroe capital organization for their hard work and dedication.
thank you all for your time today. and that concludes our prepared remarks. i'm going to ask the operator to open the call now for questions.

[operator instructions]. our first question is from the line of christopher nolan with ladenburg thalmann. please go ahead, sir.
christopher nolan -- ladenburg thalmann -- analyst
hey, guys. ted, how much is the escrow outstanding for rockdale?
theodore koenig -- president & chief executive officer
i will tell you, i believe it's $1.8 million to us, for mrcc, the escrows merger, but that relates to other forms. but the mrcc portion is $1.8 million.
aaron peck -- chief financial officer and chief investment officer
and that's at fair value. so that's our expectation of recovery.
christopher nolan -- ladenburg thalmann -- analyst
got you. and by the way, great job on rockdale. i guess strategy-wise is the strategy still to further pay down revolver debt and lower the leverage ratios, and i know it's below your targeted range, but what's the leverage strategy going forward?
theodore koenig -- president & chief executive officer
good question, chris. let -- we're at where i think we want to be today. we're on leverage -- i know we've talked -- aaron has talked in the past about guiding to a 1.2 to 1.3 times. we're about a 1.1 times leverage today. so we don't have any qualms about taking it up a little bit higher, but that's going to be dependent on market opportunities and what we see. we've got the capacity for growth. we just want to make sure we're being thoughtful in how we grow.
aaron peck -- chief financial officer and chief investment officer
i'd also add, chris, what -- the portfolio naturally has some repayments that come in even in this environment, and because the market opportunities out there are attractive, we will have significant opportunity to reinvest as well, as things come in even staying within the leverage limitation. so we're hopeful that we'll be able to move some of the start-up with the market as we see repayments.
christopher nolan -- ladenburg thalmann -- analyst
great. final question, any other material recoveries in your non-accrual list, which compared to rockdale or anything similar?
theodore koenig -- president & chief executive officer
nothing that comes to mind today, but i told you on the call and prior calls, we're very committed to recovering march loans. one of the ways that good asset management firms differentiate themselves is by recovering on loans that mark -- very often we don't have control over the mark process and we've got a pretty robust third-party evaluation process that we go through, as well as internally. but what we do, we have some control over, is the message and the effort and how we strategize in recovering proceeds. so, well, from time to time i'm concerned with marks. i'm not overly focused because i know what we're doing internally and i know the companies and i know that the strategies that we have in place to collect. our dollars are sound and generally are fruitful.
christopher nolan -- ladenburg thalmann -- analyst
great, that's it from me guys. thank you.
aaron peck -- chief financial officer and chief investment officer
thanks, chris.
operator
[operator instructions]. and our next question is from the line of tim hayes with b riley. please go ahead.
tim hayes -- b. riley -- analyst
hey, good afternoon guys. hope you're doing well. my first question here, i just want to pick on the investment opportunity here, and your appetite to invest that you have brought down leverage little bit. i know you're being prudent with investment now. [technical issues] activity picking up relative to this quarter given the opportunities you're seeing, maybe if you could talk about pipeline, give us color on what you're looking at now, is it more first lien focused [technical issues] and compare to what you were seeing eight months ago?
theodore koenig -- president & chief executive officer
a good question tim. you traded in and out a little bit, so i heard most of it. but your question relates about mostly the investment opportunity set and i will tell you that we've got a strong pipeline. we did a number of add-on transactions across the firm in the last quarter. the private equity platform transactions were down, but we're seeing more and more rescue type capital opportunities and add-on deals for portfolio companies that are seeking to take advantage of the market. that seems to be where most of the deals are coming from today. what's interesting is that we're seeing leverage come down a half a turn to a turn over the last eight months or so. as you said, we're seeing pricing from 100 basis points to 150 basis points at least. so, i expect that the vintage of assets that are going to come on in our portfolio will be very, it will be accretive to both investment returns as well as overall leverage levels going forward.
as aaron mentioned, we're going to be selective, only because when times like this, it's very hard to confirm in some industries projected financial performance and add backs and things like that's we're being a little more conservative when it comes to focusing on projected results and in projected add backs. we're being very diligent on historical results impact with covid and there is a number of industries that have actually done quite well during covid and those tend to be companies that are involved in supply, logistics, technology, software, and that's where we're going to really focus more of our efforts. so i would expect that you will see performance from monroe, not only in mrcc, but across all of our funds look similar to the vintage of 2011-2012 when we came out of the crisis -- financial crisis and there were some liquidity constraints in the market and we're able, as a liquidity provider to take those opportunities and use them to our advantage and be a good partner to clients, companies, private equity firms, but get paid fairly for doing that.
tim hayes -- b. riley -- analyst
thanks for that. that's some good color and i just want to confirm you the color you provided about kind of leverage levels and spreads. is that just on the lower-middle market portfolio you're talking right now?
theodore koenig -- president & chief executive officer
yeah, that's primarily lower-middle market. upper middle market has moved as well, but we're still seeing high leverage rates. in upper middle market, we've seen pricing expand a little bit. the challenge is that the upper middle market is really competing for deals with the high yield market and the investment grade market today and the investment grade market and high-yield market have been very, very strong still because of the investors thirst for yield. when you've got 10-year treasuries hovering around 50 basis points, it creates a lot of pressure for those investment grade purchasers. so i like the overall risk return in the lower part of the middle market right now, because i think we're getting paid better for taking same kind of economic risks.
tim hayes -- b. riley -- analyst
right, got it. okay. and then i don't know if you have these stats in front of you here. but you -- would you be able to disclose the average ltv or leverage multiples on the lower-middle market debt portfolio?
aaron peck -- chief financial officer and chief investment officer
yeah, we don't have updated stats that we provide for the portfolio. specifically, but what we can tell you is kind of where things look, when we started on these loans, sort of where monroe originates middle market loans in the bdc, mrcc would have a similar starting stats and so typically you will see our portfolio around 4 times to 4.5 times ebitda on a leverage basis when we're starting a new transaction and it's typically just a hair below 50% loan to value on that basis -- on a weighted average basis across the monroe portfolios. and i wouldn't expect mrcc portfolio to be markedly different for the lower-middle market direct loans that we do in the portfolio.
tim hayes -- b. riley -- analyst
okay, got it. and then you mentioned the -- i think you have about $109 million of capacity on your revolver. can you just -- would you be able to disclose your borrowing base and how much of the capacity that you have access to at this point?
aaron peck -- chief financial officer and chief investment officer
yeah, it's difficult to disclose that. first of all, we don't disclose that. second of all, it moves, right. so if you may have a certain amount on your borrowing base today that's available based on the current assets. but if you originate an asset, it expands your borrowing base. so it's a bit of a moving target all the time, but we have capacity today. we have significant room on the borrowing base today, we're not near the full borrowing base capacity today. but we're really more focused on the overall leverage in the portfolio and the borrowing base is not posing an issue today.
tim hayes -- b. riley -- analyst
okay and then just on your comment on how that can move around a bit. i'm just curious if you've seen a -- whether it's a significant amount of assets, or maybe just a modest amount fall out of the borrowing base is leverage multiples either increase or credits have been added to non-accrual, or is that just not really been an issue for you guys?
aaron peck -- chief financial officer and chief investment officer
yeah, i mean you're not really seeing a major change in eligibility as a result of covid-19 right now and we're monitoring that very carefully. but now, we're managing through pretty well and the borrowing base is continuing to be pretty solid and we haven't seen a lot of things fall out.
tim hayes -- b. riley -- analyst
got it. okay, great. thanks for taking my questions.
theodore koenig -- president & chief executive officer
thanks, tim.
