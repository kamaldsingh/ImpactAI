michael h. carrel -- president, chief executive officer and director
thank you, lynn. good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. we hope you are staying safe and healthy as we continue to face unprecedented challenges with this pandemic. before we begin our quarterly review of our results, we want to express our gratitude to the selfless workers on the front lines who continue to rise to the occasion to keep our communities safe and functioning. thank you for taking care of us. you are the true heroes.
we are encouraged by our second quarter results despite the impact and challenges of covid-19, which we felt, especially early in the quarter. total revenue was just under $41 million, down 31% from the same period last year. we experienced the trough in april, with monthly revenue down 54%, as compared to april 2019 due to the significant debt slowdown of non-emergent procedures in response to covid-19 pandemic in the us and europe.
we began to see return, a rapid return in may followed by steady volumes throughout june with procedures coming back online and the easing of shelter-in-place restrictions. specifically, in may we saw revenue improve by nearly 50% over april, and in june, we saw a similar improvement over may. while we are pleased by the encouraging rebound of our business in the us and parts of europe, through the second half of the quarter the situation does remain fluid, especially with the recent trends indicating growing case volumes in some regions of the united states.
in the last few weeks, we began to see more volatility in case volumes and now expect july revenue to be down somewhat compared to june. as we look to the second half of 2020, we remain cautiously optimistic about our outlook while continuing to make sure we stay flexible and ready to mitigate any interruptions and we remain on track with all of our strategic initiatives. to that end, we continue to prioritize the health and safety of our employees and promote remote working wherever possible.
at the same time, we are easing spending restrictions in several areas. specifically, we lifted a hiring freeze and are actively adding to our commercial team and other critical roles. we are focused on our future, on innovation, clinical science, and education, strengthening our commercial infrastructure to ensure that we are well-positioned on all our future catalysts, such as the converge approval and amaze progress as we enter 2021 and 2022.
the strong performance in the second quarter is a testament to the resiliency of our team at atricure. our amazing group has risen to face these challenging times with an unwavering commitment to support our healthcare partners and to put patients first. i would like to highlight our clinical education team as one example of this dedication. over the past year, our clinical education team has developed a peer-to-peer education platform that is second to none. in response to covid-19 pandemic, our team quickly developed and validated a process to adapt this platform to support our customers virtually. as institutions across the country changed their policies and protocols, physicians also had to adjust to these changes.
our team at atricure was helpful and prepared with this virtual platform and reached out proactively. our customers could not stop thanking us for stepping up and showing that we care. this virtual platform for education became our outlet to continue to partner with clinicians, as we could no longer call on our customers in person.
we've been able to work with the medical community seamlessly, literally transitioning from in-persons to remote engagement with our customers and building even stronger relationships as our team has been rising to the occasion. while managing through the pandemic, we were successful in achieving several milestones during the quarter and made significant progress on our strategic initiatives.
starting with converge. as many of you are well aware, the data readout from the converge trial was presented during the virtual hrs conference in early may. the response from the medical community has been tremendous. as an example, radcliffe group recently held a virtual symposium on our convergent procedure, which was endorsed by the british heart rhythm society and accredited by the european board of accreditation in cardiology. we were excited that the seminar drew over 900 physicians, the largest group of attendees we have ever witnessed for a seminar of any atricure procedure.
further, with respect to converge, a number of clinical papers were published in the arrhythmia & electrophysiology review, a manuscript was submitted to the journal of american college of cardiology and a second analysis of converge was submitted to the american heart association. we believe this level of interest clearly demonstrates that the data is driving deeper discussions around the best treatment options for patients suffering from persistent and long standing persistent afib, which is central to our patient first mission.
there is still work ahead and our team is diligently working with the fda to complete the regulatory process to make this therapy available to patients suffering from advanced forms of afib. we've had very productive and collaborative discussions with the fda. following the data release at hrs in may, we've engaged in deeper dialogue with the agency asking additional questions and for some additional analytics. we are encouraged by these discussions and are reminded of the strength and durability of our data, both in terms of safety and efficacy. that said, there are a lot of moving parts before the regulatory process is complete.
we are still working under the assumption that the fda will convene a panel meeting, but we do not have insight as the potential timing of this meeting. at this point, our expectation is it'll be a little bit further out than we had originally anticipated. we made significant progress in our other market changing clinical study as well, the amaze trial, passing a major milestone by preparing and submitting our first module of the pma to the fda.
as a reminder, the amaze trial is a 600 patient randomized controlled trial designed to show superiority. superiority for this trial is catheter ablation plus atricure's lariat laa exclusion system versus catheter ablation alone. we completed enrollment in the trial in december 2019 and expect to have follow-up on these patients in early to mid-2021, followed by data analysis and our full pma submission.
in addition to progress with the converge and amaze trials, both of which we believe will be transformative for the company, we are making steady progress pushing forward important initiatives that augment our core ablation business. in the second quarter, our innovative cryosphere probe continued its positive upward trend in revenues. the cryosphere probe is intended for managing post operative pain in cardiothoracic patients. this unique probe demonstrates our investment in innovation and its resulting impact to our business.
to support the increasing case volume, we continue to steadily add sales and clinical resources to our thoracic teams. we believe that our cryo nerve block therapy is rapidly gaining momentum in thoracic pain management market and expect meaningful contribution in the long-term. as part of the open ablation platform, we are continuing to work toward the 510(k) clearance of our new encompass clamp, and our team is preparing for a subsequent market launch.
the encompass clamp provides a simpler and faster approach to ablating the heart in open procedures. we expect this clamp to appeal to high-volume cabg surgeons and to contribute to our open ablation revenue in the coming years. what does this all mean in the current environment? we are continuing to strengthen our clinical evidence, educating -- education and training and product innovation. and as i mentioned earlier, to further support the expansive growth of our initiatives, we continue to actively build our team, hiring strategically throughout the second half of this year.
however, our optimism to the future is balanced by the uncertainty of the present environment. we saw a possible plateau and procedure volumes as we entered into july, with increased volatility and mixed results through key markets. as a result, we remain measured in our outlook for q3 and the remainder of the year and we are not providing financial guidance for 2020 at this time. we are actively monitoring the evolving environment and trends remain flexible and we remain flexible and prepared to effectively respond to the pandemic.
while we cannot predict when we will return to normalcy, we are confident that our future is extremely bright, our team remains focused, and our business continues to be poised for long-term growth and success.
i'll now turn the call over to andy wade, our chief financial officer.
andrew wade -- chief financial officer
thanks, mike. second quarter 2020 worldwide revenue was $40.8 million, a decline of 30.7% on a gaap basis and 30.6% on a constant currency basis, compared to the second quarter of 2019. us revenue was $33.7 million, a decrease of 28.6% from the second quarter of 2019. us sales of open ablation and appendage management products experienced a slightly lower decline in sales than minimally invasive ablation due to the inherent ability to defer mis procedures. appendage management sales declined 21.1% to $13 million and open ablation sales decreased 24.4% to $15.6 million, while minimally invasive sales decreased 47.7% to $4.8 million.
international revenue decreased to $7.1 million, down 39% on a gaap basis and 38.5% on a constant currency basis as compared to the second quarter of 2019. we experienced significant variability in our international markets, resulting in a steep decline in volume across all product types.
gross margin for the second quarter of 2020 was 67.7%, as compared with 74.5% for the second quarter of 2019. during the second quarter, we temporarily reduced our production capacity and modified our manufacturing operations in order to adhere to social distancing recommendations. we have not furloughed or decreased pay of our production employees and remain committed to their safety. however, the fixed costs and reduction of production volumes to below our normal operating levels burdened cost of revenue, decreasing our gross margin by 6.8%. despite the temporary reduction in production, we ended the quarter with a strong inventory position.
turning to operating expenses, excluding the effect of non-cash adjustments to the contingent consideration liability, our operating costs decreased $7.5 million from $49.9 million for the second quarter of 2019 to $42.4 million for the second quarter of 2020. this decrease was primarily driven by lower variable compensation costs, as well as a decrease in travel, training and marketing costs due to travel restrictions imposed by covid-19, and in-person group training events and trade shows that were cancelled, delayed, or transitioned to virtual platforms.
the decrease was offset partially by the addition of approximately $3.1 million of sentreheart costs, which were not present in the second quarter of 2019. as a reminder, sentreheart operating costs consists primarily of the amaze clinical trial and supporting field team, as well as pma readiness efforts. our operating loss for the quarter was $7.3 million, compared to the operating loss of $3.8 million for the second quarter of 2019. in addition to the decreased operating expenses just noted, we recorded a $7.5 million reduction in the contingent consideration liability this quarter, which is a reduction to our sg&a expenses.
in the second quarter of 2020, we had an adjusted ebitda loss of $6.1 million, compared to positive adjusted ebitda of $1.4 million for the second quarter of 2019. our loss per share was $0.20 for the second quarter of 2020, compared to an $0.11 loss per share for the second quarter of 2019. while the adjusted loss per share each period was $0.38 and $0.17, respectively.
during the first and second quarters, we did adjust our operating plan and expect to continuously evaluate and adapt as we navigate the covid-19 pandemic in the second half of 2020. first and foremost, we are committed to our people and our plan reflects this commitment. in addition to the measures we discussed on the last call, we have implemented a program to supplement the variable compensation of our very talented field sales team.
we also remain committed to our strategic research and product development activities and are hiring in certain key roles to position ourselves for the long-term. despite limitations on travel, our team has been adaptive in finding resourceful ways to support our patient's first initiatives. through implementing remote clinical trial support and launching a virtual training platform, we continue to gather clinical evidence and partner with our physicians to bring awareness to the vastly undertreated population of afib patients.
we have also taken measures to bolster our capital structure and liquidity. on may 13, 2020, we completed a stock offering issuing 4.6 million shares of common stock and receiving net proceeds of $189 million. we believe this raise will allow us to navigate the inherent uncertainty and unprecedented impact on our results of operations during the near term, and be in a position of strength as we execute on our strategic initiatives in the next decade. we ended the quarter with approximately $248 million in cash, cash equivalents and investments.
finally, as mike noted earlier, we started to see a steady increase in activity during may and june as hospitals started to do more emergent and elective procedures where our products are used. however, the situation across our markets remains unpredictable, and early results from july activity are mixed. the rising number of covid-19 cases in some of our largest domestic sales territories and delays in international markets rebounding in the past few weeks are causing us to tread cautiously into the third quarter.
as we do not want to get ahead of ourselves and cannot predict procedural trends at this time, we are continuing to hold on providing 2020 financial guidance. we continue to believe our current cash and investments are sufficient to fund our operations and allow us to focus our efforts on strategic initiatives to fuel a promising future for atricure.
at this point, i would like to turn the call back to mike. mike, you're muted.
michael h. carrel -- president, chief executive officer and director
sorry. thank you, andy. i would like to thank the entire atricure team for their passionate commitment to working as one to help patients, our communities, and our partners through these challenging times. i'm proud to say that once again, we've been recognized as one of the top workplaces in the cincinnati enquirer, and our minnetonka office was recognized as a national standard top workplace. thank you to everyone at atricure for creating a world-class culture. i'm humbled to be part of this team, and work alongside of you each and every day. please stay safe and healthy everyone.
with that, i'll turn it over to questions.

operator
thank you. [operator instructions] our first question comes from robbie marcus with jp morgan. your line is open.
lilia celine breton lozada -- jp morgan -- analyst
hi, this is actually lily on for robbie. thanks for taking the question. you guys had previously mentioned fourth quarter resembling something close to normal, but list july now potentially below june, does this outlook still hold true? and how is your view on the recovery in the back half of the year change, given the spike in cases we've seen across the country?
michael h. carrel -- president, chief executive officer and director
i mean, i think if you look at the numbers, obviously, we did very well, better than expected in the may and the june timeframe, much better than expected. i mean, the bounce back was very strong, came close to being back to normal in the june timeframe. and as you mentioned, july was kind of -- has been basically kind of flat to down a little bit in terms of overall case volume.
i think it's unpredictable as cases kind of pop-up in big states like florida and texas, and there's shutdowns and lock downs on some of the hospitals, it's a little bit uncertain. we're not going to go back to levels that we saw earlier in the second quarter. ao at this point, that's why we're not giving specific guidance. i think that it's kind of stabilized to some degree, but it's not like it's going to -- it's not growing back necessarily as fast as it was in the second quarter.
lilia celine breton lozada -- jp morgan -- analyst
got you. and then just a quick follow up on converge. what are you guys doing now to prepare ahead of the panel and eventually approval? thanks.
michael h. carrel -- president, chief executive officer and director
yeah, great. thanks for that question. i mean, we're obviously, again, really excited. most of you heard the data that came out at hrs this year, where we won across every metric that was out there, both on safety and on efficacy in terms of beating the numbers that were previously established, and showed superiority. so, we're excited about that, working collaboratively with the fda.
what we're doing to prepare for that is that, we've got sites set up all over the country. we've done deep dive analysis, pretty much in every site around the country for all the eps. all of our marketing materials are ready to go. and in addition to that, we've kind of got a team of over 35 people on the ep side of our business that have been trained, understand the procedure very well, we've merged the team from the lariat team that we have with this, with the deep ep background. and that's where we're adding headcount as well.
so we've got broad based coverage. we've got sites ready to do training and education once we're able to get up and running and be much more proactive on that front. and we are in a really good position. the good news that we've been training for this and preparing for since we bought the company to make sure we were in this position. and now we're just waiting for that label to come through so that we can kind of really go after the market in a big way.
operator
thank you. and our next question comes from a line of suraj kalia with oppenheimer. your line is open,
lilia celine breton lozada -- jp morgan -- analyst
good afternoon, everyone. thank you for taking my question. mike, can you hear me all right?
michael h. carrel -- president, chief executive officer and director
yep.
suraj kalia -- oppenheimer -- analyst
okay, perfect. hope everyone is safe and healthy. so, a lot of information provided, mike, can you stratify the backlog versus the new patient pull-through? what are you all seeing in the market? what level of backlog cannot be converted or is being delayed? just trying to stratify the numbers we are seeing versus those two buckets?
michael h. carrel -- president, chief executive officer and director
yeah. i don't know that it's as much of a backlog issue to stratify, suraj. it's a very fair and good question to think through like what's backlog versus net new patients. what we're seeing is, because some of the backlog, so one of the -- as an example, one of the issues that you see are that patients who need to get treated are hesitant to go into hospitals during this time, and so there's a big push to try to get the -- to realize that it's a safe place to go. that would essentially be backlog, but they're not coming into the hospital.
so a lot of what you're seeing is more net new patients versus really all backlog kind of coming in and coming into the hospital, quite frankly. and so, as we look forward, i mean, i think there's a little bit of backlog, but we really got to get those patients to come back and realize it's incredibly safe place to get treated and they should get treated, or else they're going to have bigger issues down the road.
suraj kalia -- oppenheimer -- analyst
got it. and mike, in terms of -- at least if we look at the numbers, in the us, mis got hit or impacted more than open. should we expect that moving forward, and presumably the open cases are being influenced more, so by the immediacy of the procedure, i guess, and mis is being delayed? is that the right way of thinking about it for the remainder of the year?
michael h. carrel -- president, chief executive officer and director
i know if this is the right way to think about it. it's a good way to think about it, because i think naturally, that is what happens is that the open cases come back first primarily because of two reasons; one, some of the open numbers, small amount, but our cryosphere, which is basically the cryo nerve block piece, which is actually a growing part of our business. the other part of open is that, obviously, it's natural, but the patients that are -- need a cabg and need to be treated and are compromised, they've got to get back earlier. it's really not an elective procedure, quite frankly. you can only push off cardiac surgery for a valve or a bypass only so long. so you're correct in thinking that.
i was surprised, interestingly enough, that if you looked at it by month, april was almost no mis revenue and some of the comeback that happened in the may, june timeframe was actually mis coming back and there were sites that were beginning to kind of get up to speed. we actually saw a steady increase as the quarter came along on the mis side of our business. so while you're right, to think of it the way that you said, i'd also caution because interestingly enough, the mis cases have started to see some strength overall as the quarter came together.
operator
thank you. and our next question comes from the line of matthew o'brien with piper sandler. your line is open.
matthew o'brien -- piper sandler -- analyst
afternoon guys. thanks for taking my questions. just to follow up a little bit on the converge panel. mike and andy, i know with the data, you didn't want to say a heck of a lot in front of the outcome. what can you help us think through as far as the panel goes in terms of what fda may be really examining? what investors should kind of queue themselves up for to really be looking for during that panel? because those things are typically set up to really question a lot of things, but at the end of the day, they tend to be favorable. so, how do we think about the key things to really monitor with respect to the panel?
michael h. carrel -- president, chief executive officer and director
really fair question. i think that, as you've seen, the data looks great. i mean, so, we hit superiority across the board on efficacy. at the panel, i think we'll look at really the three main components, efficacy, safety, and then the net benefit of that efficacy over the safety in the trial. on the efficacy side of things, we'll probably just want to look at the cuts of the data. as i mentioned in my comments, the more that we peel back the onion on it, the more we looked at the data from all different angles, the durability of the data and the efficacy look even better, like the more questions that they ask. so we feel really good about the efficacy side of things.
on the safety side, i think they'll probably wind up talking about, really just, i mean it's a small number of cases, but we'll just want to make sure that these are items that for -- the good news, there were no deaths, all the patients actually wind up doing well and had no long term effects across any of the issues that were out there. and then they'll want to get into maybe possibly some details of, ok, well with pericardial fusion, what does that mean, and what did that look like? and how did the patient recover, etc? and just get some more specifics on it.
so, i think those are the kinds of things that they'll dive into probably. the good news is, the safety rates were within what we had prescribed. they would be with the fda when we started the trial and we feel really good about it overall.
matthew o'brien -- piper sandler -- analyst
got it. that's helpful. and then just following up a little bit. again, the data was excellent in my view. what was the commentary coming out of hrs from clinicians? what kind of feedback did you get, but i think you had a 900 doc seminar that you can talk to. i know you guys really want us to be reasonable with our expectations for what kind of contribution we get on the mis side from converge next year, but what kind of momentum or feedback or excitement enthusiasm are you hearing from clinicians coming out of the data?
michael h. carrel -- president, chief executive officer and director
i'm mostly cautious just because i don't know when we'll get -- when the exact date that you'll get the actual approval, and what's happening with covid and just kind of the ramp back up of hospitals and facilities that kind of get down that path, but i'm really excited about the data because i think the data is incredibly compelling, and you're seeing that on twitter feeds and others from really top-notch eps in the world that are talking about this procedure and talking about back wall ablation being something that is really positive.
in fact, i just -- almost every day, there's a new tweet going out from one of the leading eps in the world, whether it's dr. natale or the cleveland clinic. dr. wazni talking about converge. these are people that were not doing the convergent procedure. i've seen the data and are talking about the fact that it's really the only randomized control data that is out there, and they're having debates online about it. and they're really pushing it forward in a lot of ways.
i think that's really fascinating to kind of watch that happen. i'd say that's a typical response and the conversations we've had. and so i'm -- it's been really positive feedback we got from people.
matthew o'brien -- piper sandler -- analyst
got it. very helpful. thank you.
operator
thank you. and our next question comes from mike matson with needham & co. your line is open.
david joshua saxon -- needham & company -- analyst
yeah. hi, good afternoon. this is david on for mike. thanks for taking the questions. just a couple more on converge. i mean, it's -- i understand you're running on the assumption that you'll probably see a panel, but it sounds like that might be delayed from what you were previously thinking. so is mid-2021 approval a fair assumption? and then, also just on the data and then to the hiring freeze, has there any -- been any change in pace of hiring for that sales force?
michael h. carrel -- president, chief executive officer and director
yeah. i'll start with the last one, which is that, we feel -- we felt really good about kind of where we were looking into the back half of the year, not only on may, in june, but also even -- even though july wasn't as good as june, it was still a strong month relative to what you saw at the beginning of the pandemic, and we feel we need to invest in our long-term. and so we've lifted that and we're actually out aggressively hiring all those roles right now, and we feel good that we're going to be able to find really talented and great people on board.
in terms of timing on the fda, i just don't -- i can't and i'm not really going to give specifics on timing. we're having great dialogue with the fda. it's back and forth good questions, both over the phone and on email, etc, and really working collaboratively with them on it. and so, i'm just hesitant to say there's going to be an exact date there. i know the data, you guys have seen the data, and so, from my standpoint, i'm just trying to work through that process. and once we get that process, we get through it, obviously, we believe that we'll actually get and eventually get an approval.
to predict the exact date is really tough. the reason i said that, just given the fact that we're going back and forth with them in a really good, positive, collaborative way and knowing that we're sitting here at the beginning of august, the likelihood of us actually getting a panel done probably in the fall timeframe is just not that likely. i don't have any specific feedback that says, this is why, this is just me giving you my insights given the back and forth we've had, which again is that really positive and we feel good about the process that we're going through with the fda.
david joshua saxon -- needham & company -- analyst
okay, that's helpful. and then maybe for andy, opex was down year-on-year. so just wondering how durable these cost savings initiatives are. and then relative to the second quarter how we should be thinking about margins in the third and fourth quarter?
andrew wade -- chief financial officer
yeah. sure, david. so, on the spend, you're right. some of it is a mix -- it is a mix of temporary things like travel. some of the reduction has been in pushing out headcount, as mike mentioned, some of that we'll look to reinvest as we get into the latter part of the year, as we talked about. but it's -- this is where we're trying to watch things closely in terms of what's going on with the business and making sure that we're keep an eye on the areas where we've got some flexibility.
on the margin, a lot of that really was due to just being less productive in the second quarter, in terms of the inventory that we were producing. so we still -- like our longer-term gross margin profile, but again, we've got to flex our production capability with demand. so, i think the team is doing a very, very good job of managing that. and we'll look to -- we'll look to grow from here.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from cecilia furlong with canaccord. your line is open.
cecilia furlong -- canaccord -- analyst
hi, mike and andy. thanks for taking the questions. i guess just to start off, i wanted to continue with converge, but just ask how you're viewing the adoption potential, longer-term in persistent versus long standing persistent patients? and just any nuances around really reaching those long standing persistent patient specifically, and creating new standard of care for that patient population?
michael h. carrel -- president, chief executive officer and director
i mean, it's a really good question to piece back kind of what's happening in a persistent market. we believe that we're going to be applicable to both the persistent and the long standing persistent market. for sure the benefits are even greater in the long standing persistent market. they're more durable and that's a great patient population to start with. it's 45% of the patients that are out there. they're the ones that the eps already raised their hands up immediately and say, i can't do these. so in a lot of ways, they'll probably start with some of those more difficult to treat patients, see the great success, and then move their way into the persistent over time, depending on how well they're treating the persistence today. what you see -- i mean, i think that's kind of how it's going to progress.
i think they'll probably do the long standing persistence first, primarily just because those are the sickest patients, and they're the ones that they have no option for today. and on the persistence side, they have -- some people feel comfortable doing some aspects of persistent upfront maybe as a first line therapy with the catheter only, and then move in to convergent after that. i think we'll probably see some of that, but that'll be over time. so the good news is that, there's millions and millions of patients here and will kind of fit within both buckets and the results were strong across the board.
cecilia furlong -- canaccord -- analyst
great, thank you. and then, i guess, if i could follow up and just ask about your cryo nerve block franchise, just the market drivers and dynamics you saw during the quarter that drove the ramping adoption? and then just as you're thinking longer-term, the role of data in really opening up this opportunity further? thank you.
michael h. carrel -- president, chief executive officer and director
what's amazing about it is that, i mean, if you think about cryo nerve block, i mean, a lot of the -- what we saw was in the thoracic patients. it really falls into three major buckets that you have cryo nerve block being used for today. the first bucket is for lung cancer patients and cancer patients really don't get deferred. if they've got cancer, and they've got to take out a lung nodule, that space, they're still going to continue down that path. they don't want it to metastasize. and cryo nerve block is used quite a bit within that area. so, i'd say that's kind of one, is that, that's continuing to grow. and people are seeing the benefits of it.
two, is in trauma cases where you're coming into the er, and those cases continue to be used. now there were fewer trauma cases in general across the united states because people were driving less at the beginning of the pandemic. you saw that, come back near the end. and then finally, they're being used in other types of procedures. and we'll kind of see like the nus [phonetic] procedure is one that is being used and that's one that there's lots of data that's getting published that's out there. and we're actually seeking an adolescent label in that area as well.
operator
thank you. and our next question comes from the line of rick wise with stifel. your line is open.
andrew ranieri -- stifel -- analyst
hi, mike and andy. it's drew on for rick tonight. just to touch on surgeon -- hey, mike. just to touch on surgeon training for a moment. it's always been a critical growth driver for atricure. you mentioned on the call that you've shifted more toward interactive virtual training and case coverage. can you talk about any notable trends that you're seeing moving forward? i mean, could these drive or could these initiatives drive even better procedure recovery when covid or as covid dies down? or should we be thinking that today's education initiatives virtual or in-person should just drive even better cardiac surgery penetration over time.
michael h. carrel -- president, chief executive officer and director
i think a little bit of both. i mean, the great thing about -- it's a really good question, you can tease it back into a variety of areas. i mean, one is, if you look at our core basic maze training courses, we've been able to touch more cardiac surgeons during this period of time than really we've ever been able to, because it's been virtual. people are willing to get on the phone for a couple of hours, go through that training and have a really good interactive dialogue. they love the journal clubs that we've put together, whether in smaller group settings and have intimate conversations with their peers that we've been able to kind of run that you can't really get if you're doing it in another environment.
in addition to that, what we're seeing is, we've got these mobile cadaver labs that are going around, and there's a lot of training that's occurring there. we're getting a lot of demand that people want to, to kind of hands on technical training with the product. and that's gone really well because it bring it to the hospital and the hospital they just kind of go outside, they go into cadaver lab, and we're getting comments like that's the best kind of hands on training that i've ever had. and i didn't have to travel and train for three days.
so, those are the kinds of transformational things that are going on, that i think will be sticky for the long-term that will enable us to get in front of more people that i do think will eventually, to your point, have stickiness to kind of long-term adoption.
andrew ranieri -- stifel -- analyst
got it. thank you. and then just on encompass, you mentioned that you're still on track for 510(k) submission, just want to make sure that i have that timeline correct, and when that timeline would be? and then just touching on commercialization of the device. i mean, would you expect a full commercial launch or something -- or is there something about this particular clamp that might require a little bit more training for a surgeon?
michael h. carrel -- president, chief executive officer and director
we'll anticipate a full commercial launch sometime next year? we're in conversations with the fda. we've got feedback on our submission, and it's been a great submission so far. so from -- i don't know what the exact timing is going to be, but sometime early part of next year we'll likely begin the roll out of that.
andrew ranieri -- stifel -- analyst
thanks for taking the questions mike.
operator
thank you. and our next question comes from danielle antalffy with svb leerink. your line is open.
danielle antalffy -- svb leerink -- analyst
hey, good afternoon, guys. thanks so much for taking the question. congrats on putting up a solid quarter despite all that's happening. i was curious, mike, if you could give -- two questions, first on the back half of the year and where we're seeing some of the regional variations? i mean, can you give any color on sort of how your regional revenue breaks down a little bit to give a sense of sort of south versus west versus northeast? i mean, it sounds like maybe you have a lot of exposure in texas, for example, but just any sort of color to give comfort on how to think about the back half of the year, as we do see covid sort of spread seemingly in waves throughout the country?
michael h. carrel -- president, chief executive officer and director
yeah. i mean, it's a really fair question, danielle. i'll start with the kind of northeast that was hit the hardest in the early part of the year. the northeast is a solid region for us. it's been a solid performer for us, but it basically went down to pretty much zero in the beginning part of april. i mean, it was -- almost no cases were actually happening up there. that made a nice recovery in the last couple of months, but it's been a slow recovery and it's not back to full normal, but the good news is that, it's actually cases are happening everyday now, and people are busy, which is really good.
but you kind of alluded to it. if you look at florida, texas, and southern california, those are three of our biggest, most penetrated regions in the country, in the world. they are big aspects. so when a hospital shuts down and pushes off two weeks, you lose a couple of weeks here and then they're going to come back and that's why it's a really fluid moment that we're tracking every single day from that standpoint. that's why we're uncertain to exactly what the numbers are going to look like in the back half of the year.
we do think that, especially for right now we're getting impacted a little bit in southern florida in particular, kind of in the miami area. and then you'll -- a little bit obviously in texas and certain areas like houston and places like that where you're seeing an impact. so, it's in pockets. and what we're hopeful for is that, those begin to recover and then if others get hit, there is a little slowdown in some other areas. right now it's hitting in some of the heavier areas, where we've got the heavier volume, for sure. and that's kind of i think, a more short-term phenomenon. hopefully, everything's going to recover here and those hospitals will come back online over the coming months.
danielle antalffy -- svb leerink -- analyst
got it. okay, that's actually very helpful color. thank you for that. and then my second question is on converge and how to think about the go to market strategy here? since you are targeting not just the cardiac surgeon here, but really the ep, and just curious about how does it --i think you had about 27 us trial centers, do you go there first as a room to grow the number of procedures done in those existing trial centers and then you go to your currently implanting cardiac surgeon centers and try to get the ep buy in there? or how do we think about that?
michael h. carrel -- president, chief executive officer and director
a little bit of all the above. i mean, we've got over 100 -- we had about 100 sites or so that continuously had been using our product, not only the 27 trial sites, but really, there's about 100 sites that were ordering every quarter. they're solid sites. they've got good case volumes. obviously, covid has hit them. so things have been kind of shifted a little bit, but those are the obvious ones. we've got plans for each one of those that wants to get the approval for how to expand within those sites. get more ep referrals, and more eps to understand it besides just maybe the one or two eps that were a part of a trial that were part of initially.
we've also got a list of those that we think are sites that would be good partners for us, based on who the ep might be, what hospital coverage they've got, and if they've got a good surgeon that's going to be very interested. so we're hitting on all those and then we prioritize that on the timeframe. and so once we get the approval, we'll be ready to kind of hit the ground running within all of those hospitals. we're all taking in-bound calls to people that are very interested as well. so there have been people that have obviously seen the data and they're interested once we get the approval to kind of move forward.
danielle antalffy -- svb leerink -- analyst
thank you so much.
operator
thank you. and i'm not showing any further questions at this time.
michael h. carrel -- president, chief executive officer and director
okay. without any further questions, again, i hope everybody stays safe and healthy. appreciate your interest in atricure and look forward to talking to many of you over the coming months. have a great rest of the summer. bye now.

operator
good afternoon and welcome to atricure's third quarter 2020 earnings conference call. [operator instructions]. [operator instructions] [operator instructions].
i would now like to turn the call over to lynn lewis from the gilmartin group for a few introductory comments. lynn?
lynn pieper lewis -- founder and chief executive officer
thank you. by now you should have received a copy of the earnings press release. if you have not received a copy please call (513) 755-4136 to have one emailed to you. before we begin today let me remind you that the company's remarks include forward-looking statements. forward-looking statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties many of which are beyond atricure's control including risks and uncertainties described from time to time in atricure's sec filings. these statements include but are not limited to expectations regarding the timing of fda review expectations regarding the fda's response and whether it will approve converge the potential converge launch timing the potential market opportunity for converge and the adoption of the converge procedure.
atricure's results may differ materially from those projected. atricure undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements. additionally we refer to non-gaap financial measures specifically revenue reported on a constant currency basis adjusted ebitda and adjusted loss per share. a reconciliation of these non-gaap financial measures with the most directly comparable gaap measures is included in our press release which is available on our website.
with that i'd like to turn the call over to mike carrel president and chief executive officer. mike?
michael h. carrel -- president and chief executive officer
thanks lynn. good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us. we know that it's been a challenging time for all and hope you are remaining safe and healthy during these times. even with the backdrop of the pandemic and the difficulties that has caused many we continue to focus on the physicians we support and the patients they help. we are dedicated to our strategic priorities of helping those affected by arrhythmias strokes and post-operative pain. yes the pandemic is still with us but we have rebounded well and we are in the enviable position to have many strategic catalysts coming to fruition and expect to significantly expand our markets and growth rates in the coming years. it is truly an exciting time to be a part of atricure. for today's call i will begin with an overview of our third quarter revenue and current trends that we are seeing in hospital procedures followed by an update on converge and our other key initiatives.
total revenue for the third quarter were $54.8 million. in the u.s. the quarter began with a modest decline from the revenue trends we experienced in june as we saw regional variability due to the surge in covid cases in some key markets. as the quarter progressed we saw some growth and stabilization in september which continued into october. hospitals have become better at managing through these resurgences of covid-19 and we believe cardiac surgery procedures in most areas have returned to approximately 80% to 90% of pre-covid levels as of the end of the third quarter. internationally we experienced similar trends to the u.s. with a strong recovery in certain countries namely germany the netherlands and japan offset by countries experiencing a slower recovery including the u.k. and parts of southern europe. we are encouraged by our third quarter results and the increasing number of procedures.
through numerous discussions with surgeons electrophysiologists and hospital administrators across the united states we see a clear desire to treat afib patients. procedures in which our products are used are generally economically favorable and the clinical results are effective. however these procedures consume hospital resources specifically icu beds which must be kept available to respond to the pandemic. because of this dynamic we believe cardiac surgery volumes will remain slightly below full capacity and will experience ongoing variability through the end of the year and into 2021. that said we do expect to see continued incremental sequential improvement in our top line results as we navigate a return to normalcy. now turning to several strategic initiatives and highlights. i will begin with converge but we are closer to completing the regulatory process to allow us to market the hybrid conversion therapy for treatment of advanced forms of afib. as a quick reminder of the activity this year data from the converge trial was released as part of the late-breaking clinical trials during the virtual heart rhythm society conference this past may.
the data demonstrated superiority against the primary and secondary endpoints namely freedom from afib and other arrhythmias and a 90% or greater reduction in afib burden. since then we have engaged in active dialogue with the fda to answer questions about the data provide additional analysis and dive deeper into the real-world evidence in support of this therapy. in particular we have examined data for the long-standing persistent patients in the trial which demonstrates compelling efficacy and durability. while the trial made its efficacy endpoint for the entire population of both early and long-standing persistent patients the clinical benefit among the long-standing population was significantly greater at 12 months than the blended trial results. the improvement over the control arm of the catheter ablation only actually increased with time for the long-standing persistent patients in the trial with results almost double that of the overall trial at 18 months.
unlike patients with lone persistent afib those with long-standing persistent afib currently have no stand-alone fda-approved treatment options. additionally there have been published articles and abstracts on physician experience treating long-standing persistent afib patients using the same lesion set that was used in the converge trial. the published results from those articles are consistent with the results for the patients with long-standing persistent afib in the converge trial further strengthening our confidence in the data for this cohort of patients. as such we recently completed our final submission to the fda seeking a label for the treatment of patients with long-standing persistent afib and now await a response from the fda indicating whether or not an advisory panel will be required something we expect to know in the coming months. the collaborative manner in which our team has engaged in with the fda has been immensely valuable in the regulatory approval process. if approved we believe the hybrid convergent therapy will provide a compelling treatment option for the unmet need for stand-alone therapies for long-standing persistent afib patients.
i now want to take some time to cover a couple of important points in our converge update the data for long-standing persistent patients and the corresponding market opportunity. first to the data. as i discussed previously the deeper that we looked into the data the more convincing and differentiated the procedure looked for patients with the most advanced form of afib. the analysis of long-standing persistent patients in the converge trial demonstrated clear superiority in the hybrid convergent arm compared to the endocardially catheter ablation arm with an approximately an approximate 29% absolute difference in effectiveness at the 12-month endpoint. this is a significant improvement over catheter alone. as mentioned earlier we recently completed the analysis of 18-month follow-up and the overall trial results for long-standing persistent patients actually improved significantly over the 12 month data essentially doubling the blended results and demonstrating the durability of the procedure. looking beyond the converge trial there are journal articles reporting outcomes for long-standing persistent afib patients that were consistent with this analysis. further there is evidence in both the literature and hrs guidelines that the ablation targets that are sufficient for paroxysmal in early persistent patients may not be enough to control long-standing persistent afib.
the ablation targets that contribute to the perpetuation and sustenance of long-standing persistent afib are difficult to address with just a catheter alone. this is the premise for why we believe the hybrid conversion procedure to be effective. thus we believe the totality of the evidence from the converge trial and real-world practice is compelling demonstrating the hybrid convergent procedure has a larger more consistent and durable effect for long-standing persistent afib patients than any other clinically available stand-alone treatment alternatives today. once the regulatory process is complete we expect the strength of our data to change standard of care for millions of patients in the most expansive market opportunity. which leads us to a discussion on the total addressable market. the long-standing persistent afib population represents well over three million patients in the united states alone or nearly half of all diagnosed afib patients. this population is expected to grow to more than 4.4 million patients by 2025. these patients have no other fda stand-alone treatment options and represent a total market opportunity that is multiple billions of dollars today and expected to grow. let's dig deeper into these numbers and how we expect this market opportunity to unfold.
looking at the three million long-standing persistent afib patients in the united states roughly 25000 are being treated annually with catheter ablation alone today. based on expected growth in catheter ablations those procedures will increase to approximately 45000 by 2025. this is a clear opportunity in front of us since the hybrid convergent procedure is additive not competitive to the catheter ablation. yet today there are only 1800 hybrid convergent procedures done in the u.s. and we believe the trial results and related evidence shows that all long-standing persistent afib patients will benefit by having epi-sense added to catheter ablation procedures. this alone is a $500 million addressable market and our opportunity increases by 50% with the inclusion of left atrial appendage management to hybrid convergent procedure a trend that we have seen emerge and strengthened over the last few years. but this is merely the starting point. and our addressable markets are far more expansive when considering both the strength of our clinical data and efficiency this procedure brings to the patient treatment.
another data point we observed in the clinical in the converge trial is that the hybrid convergent procedure significantly improves electrophysiology lab efficiency by reducing procedure times by approximately 35 minutes. considering patients with advanced afib also require more extensive ablation when performing catheter ablation alone this should include improve throughput and ep lab capacity enabling more patients to be treated. applying this logic to the market we believe this will result in a higher penetration of long-standing persistent afib patients being treated. therefore if we assume an improvement in treatment to just 5% of total long-standing persistent afib patients who go untreated today for approximately 150000 incremental patients per year in the u.s. our opportunity increases to more than $2 billion. additionally as i mentioned earlier the inclusion of left atrial appendage management to this procedure will further expand the opportunity within our reach.
the market for long-standing persistent afib patients is clearly large and vastly underpenetrated and importantly there are no existing comparable stand-alone treatment options to the hybrid convergent procedure. we at atricure are leading the way in this high-growth market opportunity with a hybrid convergent procedure and we're aiming to provide care to this undertreated patient population and clear benefits for every ep lab. simply put we expect this to have the greatest impact to patients worldwide and will accelerate our growth after we receive approval. as we await the next milestone of pma approval we are investing in our sales and training teams to ensure that we are fully prepared to launch the hybrid convergent therapy upon approval. turning to additional achievements in the third quarter with respect to our upcoming catalysts. even during the pandemic we made meaningful progress on our other landmark clinical study the amaze trial a 600 patient randomized controlled trial designed to show superiority. in this trial superiority is catheter ablation plus our lariat laa exclusion system versus catheter ablation alone. following full enrollment in the trial last december the fda approved expanded patient enrollment under a continued access protocol which we began in earnest this quarter. we submitted our second module to the pma and we submitted our second module to the pma for the fda.
we have also made excellent progress on patient follow-ups. notably there have been no patient fallout to date. we expect to complete patient follow-ups in early to mid-2021 to be followed by subsequent analysis of the data and our full pma submission. switching gears now to the cryosphere probe our innovative and dedicated device for managing postoperative pain and cardiothoracic patients. we continue to see positive upward trends in sales carrying the momentum in sequential quarter growth since the launch of the cryosphere probe in the first half of 2019. our growth has been coming from a variety of procedural applications including general thoracic surgery trauma cases and pectus repair. although still in the early innings we are investing in our sales teams and clinical resources to build on this momentum and to support this long-term growth opportunity.
continuing with our open ablation platform and our focus on innovation we are progressing toward 510(k) clearance of our new encompass clamp and are preparing for market launch in early 2021. the encompass clamp provides a simpler and faster approach to ablating heart the heart in open procedures. we expect this clamp to appeal to high-volume cabin surgeons where we have minimal adoption today. as a result we expect this new clamp to be accretive to our open ablation revenue. as you can probably tell we are truly excited about the strength of our fundamental business and market expansion opportunities driven by converge amaze cryosphere and encompass which paves the way to drive accelerated growth over the long term.
with that i will now turn the call over to angie wirick our chief financial officer and will return with closing comments.
angela l. wirick -- chief financial officer
thanks mike. third quarter 2020 worldwide revenue was $54.8 million a decrease of 3% on a gaap basis and a decrease of 4% on a constant currency basis compared to the third quarter of 2019. u.s. revenue was $44.7 million a decrease of 3% from the third quarter of 2019. u.s. sales of appendage management products were $17.4 million showing improvement over 2019 with 3% growth. open ablation product sales which include our cryo nerve block business were $19.9 million which is relatively flat to the third quarter of 2019. minimally invasive ablation sales in the u.s. were $7 million down 23% from 2019 reflecting the procedural trends that mike mentioned in his opening comments. as our appendage management and open ablation products are used concomitant to procedures which are less likely to be deferred as compared to minimally invasive ablation procedures. international revenue decreased $10.1 million down 4% on a gaap basis and down 7% on a constant currency basis as compared to the third quarter of 2019. we saw increases in the appendage management franchise in our asia markets while both open and minimally invasive ablation had a slower recovery.
gross margin was 73.7% for the third quarter of 2020 consistent with our third quarter 2019 results of 73.8%. following a temporary reduction in manufacturing operations during the second quarter we returned to normal production volumes in the third quarter of 2020. and now turning to operating expenses. excluding onetime acquisition costs incurred in 2019 and the recurring effect of noncash adjustments to the contingent consideration liability our total operating cost decreased $6.5 million from $50.6 million for the third quarter of 2019 to $44.1 million for the third quarter of 2020. this decrease was primarily driven by lower variable compensation expense as well as decreases in travel training and meeting costs due to continued limitations on in person group events and trade shows that were canceled delayed or transitioned to virtual platforms. offsetting this temporary decline in operating expenses share-based compensation expense increased $1.1 million from the third quarter of 2019. additionally this quarter marks the anniversary of our august 2019 acquisition of sentreheart. incremental costs from sentreheart which are primarily the amaze clinical trial and pma readiness efforts drive the slight increase in research and development expenses in the third quarter of 2020 compared to 2019.
the resulting operating loss for the quarter was $4 million compared to an operating loss of $8.6 million for the third quarter of 2019. in the third quarter of 2020 we had positive adjusted ebitda of $4.2 million compared to an adjusted ebitda loss of $2.2 million for the third quarter of 2019. the majority of this improvement is driven by lower variable compensation travel and training and other commercial costs which we expect to be restored to historical levels as our top line improves. our loss per share was $0.11 for the third quarter of 2020 compared to a $0.25 loss per share for the third quarter of 2019 while the adjusted loss per share each period was $0.11 and $0.33 respectively. we ended the third quarter with $250 million in cash and investments. finally we would like to provide an update to our outlook by providing guidance for the fourth quarter 2020. as mike mentioned earlier we are pleased with our third quarter results which reflect a recovery across major geographies and products on a sequential basis. while cardiac surgery volumes improved significantly in the quarter and have held through october most of our customers are not yet operating at full capacity and we have seen variability as covid-19 cases spike.
we think the ongoing impact of the pandemic in the united states and other parts of the world could cause periodic disruption in our revenue until the pandemic is contained. therefore we are assuming a continued impact from the pandemic in the fourth quarter with worldwide revenue improving on a sequential basis to $56 million to $60 million. in 2021 we believe there will still be uncertainty as a result of the pandemic yet our sequential growth trends will continue. additionally we expect to achieve our original guidance for 2020 ebitda loss of approximately $10 million as certain variable operating costs remain temporarily low. we are committed first and foremost to the safety and support of our people patients and partners as we navigate the return to normalcy over the next year together.
at this point i would like to turn the call back to mike.
michael h. carrel -- president and chief executive officer
thank you angie. while this year has been challenging it has not altered our mission or vision. if anything it has solidified our conviction that we are building atricure into something truly differentiated with a world-class and robust pipeline for the next decade. we are on a great path and we are at the forefront of meaningfully expanding our addressable markets potentially treating many more patients who do not have any other options. concurrently we are adding resources across our teams to support our growth with the backdrop of ongoing focus in investments in launching hybrid therapies of converge and amaze and strengthening our penetration in open with encompass while building new markets in pain management. these investments and the progress we've made put us in a better place today than at the beginning of the year and enable us to begin 2021 from a position of strength. please stay safe and healthy everyone and thank you again for joining us.
and with that i will turn it over to questions.

[operator instructions]. our first question comes from the line of robby marcus from jpmorgan.
lilly -- jpmorgan -- analyst
this is actually lilly [phonetic] on for robby. so what assumptions are baked into this guidance range? are you guys assuming current trends hold steady? or is there the potential for a material disruption in volumes with cases on the rise? and how much visibility do you feel that you have into this range at this point?
michael h. carrel -- president and chief executive officer
yes. i think we've got pretty good visibility into the range for the quarter. we feel very confident in the numbers that we put out there. i mean what we're thinking about with it we've obviously gone through the first five weeks or so of the quarter. so we've got really good visibility to almost 1/3 of the quarter kind of behind us at this point as we kind of enter into it. and we're assuming i mean obviously case volumes are coming up. hospitals as we mentioned are doing a really nice job of being able to manage it. you do see some areas where they have a temporary slowdown for a couple of days or so as they kind of modify and go through things and we've put all that into our assumptions and guidance for the quarter.
lilly -- jpmorgan -- analyst
okay. great. and just a quick follow-up on converge. what are you guys doing now to prepare ahead of the panel and/or a potential panel i guess and eventually approval? i understand that you've been preparing for this for some time now. but is there are there any missing pieces that you feel you need to work through and finalize ahead of the launch?
michael h. carrel -- president and chief executive officer
yes. well thank you for the question. there really are no missing pieces at this point in time. we feel like we are the only missing piece is obviously getting through and getting to the approval and getting that complete. but from an operating standpoint and ready to go to market we've been building out the team for the last three plus years ever since we bought the company back in 2015. we've added significant resources to our commercial team to our education team. we've got training plans in place training centers and sites a whole education program to get more and more surgeons and sites up and running. we've also put together full marketing campaigns that we'll be ready to be able to support our customers as well. so i think we are good and ready for it as soon as we kind of make it through the process.
operator
our next question comes from the line of rick wise from stifel.
rick wise -- stifel -- analyst
and great to see the excellent quarter. just want to make sure i understood the comments. i understood the fourth quarter guidance. but angie or mike when you said 2021 did i hear you correctly you expect sequential improvement? are you talking about year-over-year or each quarter sequentially better than the quarter? i just want to make sure i understood your thinking there.
michael h. carrel -- president and chief executive officer
yes. not year-over-year but sequential growth. so we anticipate we're not giving specific guidance to next year. but as we look into next year and as we begin to kind of see the trends that are happening and anticipating that covid is going to be around and with us for a while we do anticipate that we're going to continue to see sequential growth from q4 and then into next year.
rick wise -- stifel -- analyst
right. and each quarter as we think about modeling it mike.
michael h. carrel -- president and chief executive officer
i mean there was a little bit of a i mean obviously you've got the third quarter is a little weird because it obviously we all know the summer months can be changed on that front a little bit. but i mean in general yes the sequential growth.
rick wise -- stifel -- analyst
great. and just to take a couple of points you made again maybe you could just expand a little bit. cardiac surgery volumes who knows back at that something approaching 90% maybe or 75% to 90% who knows?. but it's like in your view how long to get back to normal from your perspective? and maybe just one other laggard. obviously international some parts did better than others. how are you thinking and modeling and factoring that into your thinking for the fourth quarter and for 2021?
michael h. carrel -- president and chief executive officer
yes. i think that as we i wish i could be the one to tell you that when exactly it's going to come back to normal rick. i mean i think some of that's going to depend upon everything that's happening within the pandemic and when do we get treatment options that are going to work and the vaccines etc and the timing of that? and how when does it get mass distributed? and i don't think any of us really have a complete clear picture to that.
we do know there's going to be spikes. and as we look at this quarter and then even into next year we believe that cardiac surgery obviously is something that people have to have at some point. and so you will probably be in that kind of 80% to 90% range for a bit. and we kind of anticipate that. but hopefully we'll again see some sequential growth as the quarters kind of come out next year. that's kind of how we're looking at it right now even in the face of some of the covid because hospitals are just getting better and better at managing both the covid patients but also at kind of running their hospitals and kind of segmenting the patients so they can bring the cardiac surgery patients in as well.
rick wise -- stifel -- analyst
great. and just two last for me. maybe you could you talked about investing in the cryosphere sales team. maybe give us some color where are you now? what are your goals over the next year? what you in terms of building a team? just maybe give us some color there. but last you've been very clear on the converge and the likelihood or your assumption of a panel. have there been any recent conversations about this? is a dialogue under way? and i know this is all complicated by covid the election everything. but when do you expect to have a little better sense if you could? anything incremental obviously would be welcome.
michael h. carrel -- president and chief executive officer
there's two questions there. so i'll hit the first one rick which is cryosphere. we've built out that team and we've really built it up quite a bit this year. we're well over 10 people on the team. we're continuing to hire. you can check online. you can see the hiring that we're doing right now. we believe we've got to cover all the mass markets in the united states there. every area we go into we wind up making progress because the treatment works. and we've been very excited about that. so we're really beginning to build out that team. if you recall at the beginning of this year before the pandemic we actually put it into sales for the first time. and they've been in a market development role before that. we moved it into sales.
this was the first full year there and it just got better as the year went on and we anticipate that we'll continue to add resources there both from a selling standpoint and from a clinical support because the volume is definitely going up. as it relates to converge and the panel we did submit we had many different pre sub meetings with the fda as i had mentioned lots of great positive interactive conversations with the fda and working collaboratively on that front. from a panel standpoint we submitted and now we're kind of awaiting feedback. so as i mentioned hopefully within the next couple of months we'll have some feedback from them but i can't choose the fda time frame at this time but it should be in reasonably short order.
operator
your next question comes from the line of danielle antalffy from svb leerink.
danielle antalffy -- svb leerink -- analyst
mike i just have a quick question for you on converge. and it felt your focus it felt like the focus was shifting more to the long-standing persistent. and maybe i'm missing something but i just want to make sure two things. number one from a market opportunity perspective there's no real change here in the addressable tam at least as far as i can hear but just tell me if i'm wrong there. and then number two just if there's any more color you can give on the back end course with fda. i mean it sounds like it took a little bit longer. i think back in august you thought you'd submit the final response somewhere around then. i know you never committed to a time frame. so realistically when should we hear what's the latest i guess i would say that we'd hear about a panel?
michael h. carrel -- president and chief executive officer
yes. i mean i'll start with the latter one first which is that we've submitted to the fda. so we've now got everything's in and we're now awaiting feedback i anticipate in the next couple of months or so. obviously give or take that we anticipate kind of getting feedback. that's really all i can give in terms of it right now. but yes i do believe it's going to be in reasonably short order that's not too far away. and again as i mentioned we've had really good interactive productive conversations with the fda. so i feel like it's moving down a good path. as the addressable market the overall addressable market you're correct. overall it's the same. i really wanted to highlight because our submission was for that specific in what i'd like to call the extremely differentiated label of long-standing persistent patients because that market alone right now is we're the only ones in the world or in the market that are going to have that level of differentiation. and we're the only ones that have done a trial to show this and the results are incredibly compelling as you probably heard within that patient population.
and so i really want to focus because that is the market that we're going to really attack and really go after because we believe that's where the biggest unmet need is. we know that our products are incredibly additive to what the catheters are doing today. again as i mentioned they're additive not competitive. and already in the united states alone today there are 25000 catheters for long-standing persistent patients and we're only in 1800 of those procedures. and our trial proved and showed that they will benefit by adding on top of that catheter the epi-sense ablation. and we believe that is going to be the most robust and beginning part of the market because it's the most unmet need. it's the most differentiated and that is something that we believe provides what we like to call internally extreme differentiation.
danielle antalffy -- svb leerink -- analyst
got it. okay. so it's less about you not being able to target the persistent patient population also more about like you're going to be focused and sort of giving us a sense of the go-to-market strategy here. is that fair to say?
michael h. carrel -- president and chief executive officer
i don't know i would say that. we're focused on the label's going to be for and what we submitted for is for the long-standing persistent population. that is what the label is going to be for. that being said and that's where most of the patients that get treated today are. as i think we all know there were two products that were recently approved on the catheter side for the persistent side. i mean there's a lot of failures after that. as you know they have a lot of success and do good work which is obviously why they got approved. but then there's also the failed catheter ablations that they could lead to into the future. but our focus is going to be really on that long-standing persistent market because we believe we're additive in that environment and there are so many patients in the unmet need is biggest there.

our next question comes from the line of matthew o'brien from piper sandler.
matthew o'brien -- piper sandler -- analyst
i guess mike i'd anticipate there's going to be some investor consternation about the q4 guide. and i think it's probably helpful to unpack things a little bit there from a u.s. and then an ous perspective. so if your the volumes are still down 10% in the u.s. roughly on a year-over-year basis and that's what you're expecting for q4 but you're expecting things to sequentially get better versus q3 it would seem that there's some improvement that you're seeing from a clip perspective from an open perspective in terms of more clinicians or more utilization to get to that number? is that fair?
and then secondly the international number you had a really tough comp. there's areas of europe that are shutting down right now. and so it seems like it's more of an acute issue internationally that could be a little bit of a headwind versus anything really durable as we kind of come out of this. so just any kind of comments about that would be that long-winded question would be helpful.
michael h. carrel -- president and chief executive officer
no that's ok. i mean i feel great about our q4 number. i think in the face of everything that and i've seen what all the other companies are kind of out they're talking about right now. i think in the face of what's happening with covid the fact that we're going to see a strong sequential growth. to your point as we look at q4 we anticipate that the cardiac surgery volumes are going to be in that 80% to 90% kind of range from a procedure volume standpoint not necessarily from ours that's just kind of like cardiac surgery procedures in terms of kind of where they are from a capacity standpoint and how they're basically getting those patients back into the hospitals.
and then so you're right. i mean if we are obviously that's down 10% to 20%. and if we're closer to we're not going to be down that much as a result of that. we're obviously growing within there. it's actually across all of our franchises that you see it. we're getting more penetration in the open in the procedures that are occurring. you're getting clips and you're beginning to see some procedures come back on the minimally invasive side of our franchise as well. so kind of it crosses all barriers. we feel really good about how we're able to manage through this and understand what's happening in cardiac surgery. and that's kind of how we're going into the market. and i feel really good kind of about where we are right now. and you had a second question and i apologize. if you ask it again i can make sure i answer it.
matthew o'brien -- piper sandler -- analyst
yes that was a super long question. so just the international i mean you have the toughest comp of the year. and so with parts of europe shutting down too that's why the q4 number may ostensibly look a little softer than people had expected but you're just factoring those things in off of a tough comp.
michael h. carrel -- president and chief executive officer
yes that's correct. yes there's no question about that from a but it's i don't when you say tough comp you mean tough comp from q4 of last year?
matthew o'brien -- piper sandler -- analyst
exactly. yes.
michael h. carrel -- president and chief executive officer
yes. and i mean right now i mean i think the best way for analysts and investors to not just look at atricure but to look at most companies is really are you seeing improvement in case volumes every week? growth year-over-year is we've got to get cardiac surgery volumes back to normal and get that kind of but we're improving penetration and we're seeing that sequential growth happen. so year-over-year comparisons are just tough to do.
matthew o'brien -- piper sandler -- analyst
and then just next few questions i'll ask them together because i'm getting long here. but the mis piece of the business has been slower to recover. can you talk about why that is? it's just again it's a different patient population but just why is that slower? and then have you made any incremental investments on the mis side of the business in anticipation of converge that you can talk to? if it's more and more sales reps you're adding now or back office folks anything along those lines?
michael h. carrel -- president and chief executive officer
sure. yes. mis we is coming back slower per se because it came from a lower base. when the pandemic hit back in april that got hit the hardest. those are the most elective procedures those are the ones that could push out the most. a lot of cardiac surgery you just can't push out. so you tended to see the volume get hit the hardest on mis. it did have a faster recovery. but obviously it's coming from a lower point back in the april may time frame and it is still the most elective portion of our procedure base. but obviously once things kind of get back to more normal that should kind of come back nicely. it is economically viable for it. there are a lot of patients that need it. and obviously we're going to build off of when we get the approval from that standpoint.
in terms of adding and investing yes we've been investing in our team a lot of team on the field. the big areas are the ones i talked about earlier. first is not only having the team out in the field and making sure that they're trained and well prepared but also making sure we've got the educational platform in place. we've got sites ready to go. we've moved to a very creative mobile cadaver lab where we can begin to train people around the country during covid and we will be rolling that out quite extensively after we get the approval as well to make sure that we can effectively train people all over the place without having everybody have to get on airplanes because docs can't get an airplane etc. so we've been making some investments in those areas so that when we get to that we are ready to go.
operator
your next question comes from the line of mike matson from needham & company.
mike matson -- needham & company -- analyst
just given the potential for the long-standing persistent label with convergent are you aware of any other trials for any other devices or products out there for these patients? this category of the af patients.
michael h. carrel -- president and chief executive officer
there are no trials out there right now for this category of patients. there are trials that are for the persistent patient population. so for that 12 months or less. we are the only trials out there for more than 12 months are three trials run by atricure. the first trial is converge which is the one obviously we're part of right now. but we've already got the data. we've seen as i mentioned earlier how compelling that data is for that patient population and there are no other treatment options for those patients. the second trial is the amaze trial because the amaze trial is also for patients that are out to three years in afib. so it kind of covers two of those years as well. and that will be additive to what we're talking about with converge. and then our deep trial is the other one as well that also takes in the long-standing persistent patients. so we're the only ones. that's why it's a lot of differentiation. there's nobody else that's in the market with a clinical trial going on today.
mike matson -- needham & company -- analyst
okay. and then assuming that you do get the fda approval how do you see this being used for that particular group of patients? because i think i've heard some discussion of patients being treated with a catheter first and then seeing how they do. and then if they don't get enough improvement then they'd be brought back for the surgical portion. but that maybe that's more for kind of this persistent as opposed to the long-standing persistent. so are you guys going to kind of push for just doing a true hybrid and really doing both just upfront?
michael h. carrel -- president and chief executive officer
yes. i mean what our trial showed was that you should do this on de novo patients upfront as the first-line therapy. i mean that is essentially we achieved superiority. as i mentioned the delta at 12 months in the long-standing persistent patient population was 29% at 18 months. it was even greater than that in terms of the delta between the catheter and the convergent arm. so our obviously what we're going to be talking about is saying look at that delta. it tells you you should be doing this all upfront. so all 25000 of those patients in our minds should be getting the convergent procedure this hybrid procedure at the same basically de novo and as the first-line therapy. and we think the file shows that data. i mean that's what we will be talking about from that standpoint.
mike matson -- needham & company -- analyst
okay. and then on the amaze trial is there any possibility we could see the results of that in 2021? if it's going to the file's going to be done i think you said mid 2021. or is it really going to be more realistic in '22?
michael h. carrel -- president and chief executive officer
we anticipate data coming out at the end of 2021. for the amaze trial. absolutely.
operator
your next question comes from the line of suraj kalia from oppenheimer. all right. next question comes from the line of marie thibault from btig.
marie thibault -- btig -- analyst
i appreciate it. i'll ask just one more on converge. really focusing we're moving past fda approval really focusing on the launch. i know in the past you've said 2021 would be kind of a building year and we'd see more in 2022. with the time lines now i know they're a little bit up in the air but how do you envision this launch rolling out? how long after fda approval do you think it might be before we start seeing material uplift in the sales?
michael h. carrel -- president and chief executive officer
yes. i think we think the same. obviously we're in the face of covid in 2021. so there's just a lot going on at hospitals and at sites and getting programs up and running. but we do believe that we'll get the approval. and then like we said before we do see an acceleration happening in 2022. i mean that doesn't mean that next year we're not going to get new sites up and running and then we're not going to begin to get some revenue. but to predict the exact time frame of that it's difficult to do kind of sitting here right now until i know exactly when the approval comes in and everything is going on with covid. but we're very confident that by 2022 we'll be things will begin to really get going at that point in time.
marie thibault -- btig -- analyst
okay. so no change there. great.
michael h. carrel -- president and chief executive officer
no change.
marie thibault -- btig -- analyst
and then i wanted to ask one on encompass. you mentioned that a clearance would get you into kind of the high-volume cabg surgeons where you don't have a whole lot of penetration so far. are you needing to build out a new small sales force for that? is there anything necessary in terms of standing order to make that a successful launch?
michael h. carrel -- president and chief executive officer
not at all. i mean we actually have relationships. that's actually one of the things that we've built over the many years here is that we've got wonderful relationships pretty much with every cardiac surgeon in the country cabg mitrals aortics. this is just a new and innovative clamp that allows them and makes it easier for them to not have to open up the atrium to do the ablation. and so we're really excited about it. we've got relationships with most of them. and so it's not going to be any kind of additional add from that standpoint in terms of head count or needs.

last question comes from the line of bill plovanic from canaccord.
bill plovanic -- canaccord -- analyst
a couple of questions just on the fda discussions regarding convergent. one in terms of the label it sounds like you've pretty much gone through all the label discussions and you have final label at this point. am i reading that correctly?
michael h. carrel -- president and chief executive officer
i wouldn't say that we've got final label at this point. we've submitted for that. we've had lots of conversations with them about the label but we submitted it and now we have to kind of wait for final feedback as to whether or not it will go to panel or not at this point. we have a lot more conversation but we've submitted they gave us a list of questions back earlier in the year. we responded we basically worked with them over the summer. that was a lot of the back and forth on the additional analysis that we did. and a big part of that was actually looking at this long-standing persistent patient population because the difference was so dramatic and so compelling had lots of conversation with them and then we submitted recently for that long-standing persistent label.
bill plovanic -- canaccord -- analyst
right. but i mean the actual wording of the label in the ifu has that been worked through yet? or where are you in that process?
michael h. carrel -- president and chief executive officer
no we just submitted. i mean we literally we've just recently submitted that. so what i'm suggesting is that we will be i mean we might be in conversations with them and we anticipate that could happen but that's not happened yet.
bill plovanic -- canaccord -- analyst
okay. and then in terms of just manufacturing and have they done a site audit? or would you expect them to come and audit manufacturing prior to launch?
michael h. carrel -- president and chief executive officer
we've gone through lots of site audits. at this point we've gone through many manufacturing audits with the fda. we've gone through customer site audits. i can never guarantee that we're not going to get audited again but i think we're in a very good place.
bill plovanic -- canaccord -- analyst
and then have you started building inventory for the launch yet?
michael h. carrel -- president and chief executive officer
we have enough inventory built. we've been building inventory for a long time and we're in a very solid space from that standpoint.
bill plovanic -- canaccord -- analyst
great. and then i think just in terms of a distribution standpoint have you've talked i think pretty detailed about being prepared for the launch. should we assume just as we look at the operations of the business that you now it's more of a normal cadence going forward in terms of adding your direct reps and your clinical reps and all those different components of your field force? how should we think about that cadence going forward?
michael h. carrel -- president and chief executive officer
i'm not sure when you say normal what normal would be. i mean what we will do is we've built out a robust team right now which has both a management layer and also kind of our direct reps and clinical specialists out in the field. we will be adding quite a few more as we roll out. we've got open headcount right now. we'll be opening up more into next year. we'll continue to expand. we think this is a very large opportunity. so we're going to continue to expand and build out that team. i'm not sure what normal is. i'm not going to give a specific number yet because some of that depends on kind of the timing of what happens and the approval etc. but i mean we're in a really good spot right now because we spend a lot of time and energy building out a big portion of that team over the last three years.
bill plovanic -- canaccord -- analyst
great. okay. that's all i had.

2020-Q4,ATRC,2021-02-23 16:30:00,"prepared remarks:
operator
good afternoon and welcome to atricure's fourth quarter and full year 2020 earnings conference call. my name is kevin and i'll be your coordinator for the call today. at this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. we will be facilitating a question-and-answer session toward the end of today's call. as a reminder, this call is being recorded for replay purposes.
i would now like to turn the call over to lynn lewis from the gilmartin group for a few introductory comments.
lynn lewis -- investor relations
thank you. by now you should have received a copy of the earnings press release. if you have not received a copy, please call 513-755-4136 to have one emailed to you.
before we begin today let me remind you that the company's remarks include forward-looking statements. forward-looking statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties many of which are beyond atricure's control including risks and uncertainties described from time to time in atricure's sec filings. these statements include but are not limited to financial results guidance, expectations regarding the timing of fda review, expectations regarding the fda's response and whether it will approve converge, the potential converge launch timing, the potential market opportunity for converge, and the adoption of the converge procedure. atricure's results may differ materially from those projected. atricure undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements.
additionally, we refer to non-gaap financial measures specifically revenue reported on a constant currency basis, adjusted ebitda and adjusted loss per share. a reconciliation of these non-gaap financial measures with the most directly comparable gaap measures is included in our press release which is available on our website.
with that, i'd like to turn the call over to mike carrel, president and chief executive officer. mike?
mike carrel -- president & chief executive officer
thanks, lynn. good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining us. we hope that you are remaining safe and healthy.
as you look back on 2020, i want to begin by recognizing the dedication of our team at atricure and the resilience and durability of our business. in spite of the dynamic and challenging nature of the past year, we made meaningful progress in all areas of our business. in 2021, we will continue building for the future with many key catalysts on the horizon. total revenues for the fourth quarter were $58 million, representing a 5% sequential revenue growth over the third quarter. following solid growth in the early part of the quarter as covid cases and hospitalizations increased after the holidays, we experienced volatility both in the u.s. and in europe. this led to reduced cardiac procedure volumes at the end of 2020 and put pressure on our volumes as a result. these trends continued into january, and some areas began to worsen driven by return to quarantines and diversion of medical resources to covid patients.
with that said, we are starting to see some strong positive trends and experience an uptick in volumes as hospital constraints subside. while we expect this upward trend to continue, we believe that cardiac surgery volumes will remain slightly below full capacity, and that we will experience some variability for the first half of the year.
now turning to some of our accomplishments through the year, beginning with converge. last year, we made our final submission to the fda seeking a label for the treatment of patients with long-standing persistent afib. this brings us closer to completing the regulatory process, which will allow us to market the hybrid convergent therapy, providing a compelling treatment option in a large and vastly underpenetrated patient population. on our last call, we discussed the differentiated clinical trial results of long-standing persistent afib patients in the converge trial. since then the clinical results for long-standing persistent patient group were presented last month at the 26th annual afib symposium. the analysis demonstrated clear superiority in the hybrid convergent arm compared to the endocardial catheter ablation arm with 29% absolute difference in effectiveness at 12-month period. while this alone is a significant improvement over catheter ablation, the data was even more convincing at 18 months where for long-standing persistent patients returned a 35% absolute difference in effectiveness. we are incredibly encouraged by these results and firmly believe the hybrid convergent procedure has a more pronounced, consistent and durable effect for long-standing persistent afib patients than any other clinically available stand-alone treatment alternatives today.
while i know the exact timing of panel and/or approval is top of mind for all investors we do not give that today. however, we are making excellent progress on the regulatory front and the pma process with the fda has both -- been both, productive and collaborative. we look forward to providing an update on this milestone soon.
the anticipated approval of converge marks the culmination of many years of tireless work by so many atricure employees and physicians in pursuit of a therapy for this underserved patient population. i am incredibly proud of the partnership throughout our company which brought us to this point, we have a clear and extensive opportunity in front of us, and in preparation for the anticipated approval of converge we have built a dedicated sales team and developed training programs and infrastructure to support the launch of this therapy. currently, our u.s. sales and training team consists of more than 200 individuals in the field, including 35 dedicated reps and clinical specialists in our ep-focused hybrid sales team, and over 30 professionals supporting nationwide training and education courses. we look forward to a future where we champion the hybrid convergent therapy to become the standard-of-care for the millions of patients with long-standing persistent afib.
we also took significant steps on the amaze, our other landmark clinical trial. the amaze study is a 600 patient randomized-controlled trial designed to show superiority of catheter plus our lariat laa exclusion system versus catheter ablation alone. we have submitted 3 of 5 modules of the pma to the fda and made excellent progress on patient follow-ups. to put this into perspective, 127 patients completed final primary endpoint visits during 2020 and we now have only 11 patients to complete follow-up; this is a testament to our clinical trial team and the amaze investigators and study teams who strongly believe in this therapy. we expect to complete patient follow-ups in april, after which we will conduct our analysis of the data. we are targeting our pma submission and the amaze trial for the second half of this year and expect to release trial data following next submission. as a reminder, the lariat system is the first atricure solution directly in the hands of electrophysiologists. and we believe the amaze clinical trial will show this therapy, much like the hybrid convergent procedure, is complementary, not competitive to catheter ablation. by adding the lariat system to the toolkit, eps will be able to offer a solution, which both mechanically and electrically isolate the appendage without leaving anything in the bloodstream. this complementary technology not only diversifies our portfolio, but it's also an opportunity to further leverage our existing commercial channel in the ep market that has been built up in anticipation of the converge approval.
adding to the many achievements of 2020 we made strides toward 510(k) clearance of our new encompass clamp in addition to our open ablation platform where we are the market leader in cardiac surgical procedures for the treatment of afib. the encompass clamp provides a simpler and faster approach for ablating the heart in open procedures, and we expect this device to feel the high volume cabg [phonetic] surgeons. as a result, we expect this new clamp to deepen our penetration in the cardiac surgery market. our 510(k) submission to the fda is currently under review, and we anticipate clearance later this year, followed by concentrated commercial launch at certain key centers and broad commercial launch shortly thereafter.
finally, while our strong history of revenue growth was interrupted due to covid, there were 2 products; cryosphere and the atriclip flex-v, which both grew over 2019. starting with cryosphere, our innovative and dedicated device for managing post-operative pain in thoracic patients. our unique cryoice technology used a differentiated freezing method to block nerves from transmitting pain signals for several months. the cryosphere probe continues to resonate in the market following it's launch in the first half of 2019 with a positive trend of consistent sequential quarterly sales growth. we ended 2020 with a cryosphere probe accounting for approximately 5% of our total revenue. we recently expanded our 510(k) label for cryo nerve block therapy to include the treatment of adolescent patients of at least 12 years or older. adolescent patients undergoing invasive surgery of the chest wall can experience severe pain and have limited options for pain management after surgery. this label expansion provides an opportunity to help these younger patients manage post recovery pain. we have heard inspiring stories about patients, young and old, who are going home from the hospital with absolutely no pain and are excited to further build our presence in the pain management field with the cryo nerve block therapy. this therapy is to continue to drive accelerated revenue growth in the coming years.
the atriclip flex-v was first launched in early 2018, and it was a novel addition to our atriclip franchise. despite the impact of the pandemic, the flex-v clip delivered year-over-year growth in 2020 versus 2019 indicating strong and steady adoption by physicians since launch. we have also seen the increased use of our minimally invasive atriclip devices and hybrid conversion procedures, a trend which we expect to boost revenue growth with the expansion of this therapy over the next decade. the cryosphere probe and the atriclip flex-v are both shiny examples of the engineering and efforts of our product development team, and the innovative spirit on which atricure was founded.
now, looking ahead we are incredibly encouraged by the many catalysts on the horizon, which we believe will further accelerate our revenue growth in 2022 from our historical rates of growth. we remain laser focused on the many activities under way to drive our market expansion including converge, amaze, cryo nerve block, and encompass; all mentioned in this discussion. i'm proud to be part of a team with such a pivotal moment at atricure and we are strongly positioned and poised for the future.
with that, i will now turn the call over to angie wirick, our chief financial officer, to discuss more detailed results and our guidance for 2021.
angie wirick -- chief financial officer
thanks, mike. our fourth quarter 2020 worldwide revenue of $57.7 million declined 6% on a gaap basis, and 7% on a constant currency basis when compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. u.s. revenue was $47.4 million, a 4% decrease from the fourth quarter of 2019 reflecting the deferral of procedures using our minimally invasive ablation products. international revenue was $10.3 million, down 12% on a gaap basis, and down 16% on a constant currency basis, as compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. we experienced more pressure in our international revenue with conditions in europe stalling and a tough comp to the fourth quarter of 2019. on a sequential basis, we experienced growth of approximately 5% in our worldwide revenue from the third to fourth quarter. as mike mentioned earlier, the sequential increase results from procedure volumes stabilizing at the onset of the quarter followed by increased variability in december in the u.s. and in europe based on the resurgence of covid-19 cases.
touching briefly on a few key metrics for the fourth quarter; gross margin was 73.5%, up 50 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2019, largely driven by geographic revenue mix. we had positive adjusted ebitda of $1.7 million compared to an adjusted ebitda loss of $5.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2019; this improvement to the bottom line reflects -- results reflect lower variable compensation, travel and training costs, all which were impacted by covid, and we experienced a decrease in clinical trial spend related to amaze activity each year. our loss per share was $0.42 for both fourth quarter 2020 and 2019, while the adjusted loss per share each period was $0.18 and $0.37 respectively. fourth quarter 2020 net loss and the resulting loss per share includes a one-time charge of approximately $6 million related to a legal settlement. given the extraordinary nature of this expense, it is excluded from both, our adjusted ebitda and adjusted loss per share metrics.
to recap our 2020 fiscal year; worldwide revenue was $206.5 million, a decrease of 11% on both, a gaap and constant currency basis. this decline reflects a significant contraction in cardiac surgery and elective procedures worldwide as a result of the pandemic. u.s. sales decreased 9% to $169.2 million, while international sales decreased 17% to $37.3 million. gross margin which was impacted in 2020 by a period of reduced production activity, as well as the absorption of a full year of center heart operations was 72.3% in 2020 compared to 73.8% in 2019.
now turning to full year operating expenses; for comparability i will exclude sentreheart acquisition costs incurred in 2019, the legal settlement recorded in the fourth quarter of 2020, and the recurring effects of non-cash adjustments to the contingent consideration liability from my comments. total operating expenses decreased $16.5 million or 8% from $204.4 million in 2019 to $187.9 million in 2020. the decline results mainly from reduced variable compensation and travel costs along with discretionary spend for trade shows and physician training, offset slightly by an increase in stock-based compensation. we do believe most of the areas where we experienced cost savings were impacted by the pandemic and expect spend to be restored to historical levels as our top-line improves and travel, training and event activities increase.
full year 2020 adjusted ebitda loss was $6.3 million as compared to $6.7 million in 2019. our loss per share was $1.14 in 2020 and $0.94 in 2019, and the adjusted loss per share was $1.01 and $1.07 respectively. we are proud of the efforts across our company to manage the bottom line through the instability of the past year. while we repeatedly adjusted our operating plans in 2020, we never strayed from our employee and patient first focus; ensuring there were no job or pay cuts or furloughs. we adjusted our manufacturing operations to enable our team to continue production of inventory in a safe, socially distant manner, and ended the year with a strong inventory position. outside of our facilities, field-based employees supported customer needs virtually or in person where possible. we maintained investments in several critical projects and later in 2020 resumed strategic investments with the expansion of our team and other initiatives such as our mobile lab training and preparation for the many growth opportunities ahead. last year also strengthened our balance sheet with $189 million of net proceeds from our financing in may, and we ended the year with $258 million in cash and investments.
and finally, turning to our outlook for 2021; we expect to achieve roughly $250 million in revenue for the year. while we would normally provide a range of expected revenue results given the continued dynamic environment with covid-19, there are several unknowns that could meaningfully drive our revenue upward or downward from this level based on macro trends. with our current outlook, we expect stronger performance in the second half of the year as the pandemic subsides. we are continuing to experience procedural volumes generally operating in the range of 80% to 90% of normal, and expect this metric to improve steadily through the year, resulting in sequential quarterly revenue growth for the remainder of 2021. while we do not expect to provide quarterly guidance on an ongoing basis, given the timing of this call with nearly 2/3 of the first quarter behind us, and quickly changing dynamics due to the pandemic; we also want to offer guidance for the first quarter.
we expect first quarter revenue to be in the range of $55 million to $57 million, down slightly from fourth quarter 2020 but up year-over-year. at the forecasted first quarter revenue range of $55 million to $57 million, we expect an adjusted ebitda loss of $5 million to $6 million for the first quarter. this adjusted ebitda loss translates to an adjusted loss per share of approximately $0.36 to $0.39. we typically experience heavier losses in the first half of the year and anticipate adjusted ebitda to be a loss of approximately $10 million for the full year 2021. with improvements to the top line throughout 2021, we should realize a corresponding and meaningful improvement in quarterly adjusted ebitda. adjusted loss per share for 2021 is expected to be approximately $1.15. as we thoughtfully manage our business for long-term success, we continue to make investments in numerous strategic initiatives in support of our catalyst rich future.
at this point, i will turn the call back to mike for closing comments.
mike carrel -- president & chief executive officer
thank you, angie. while this past year was undoubtedly a challenge for everyone, we are optimistic and confident about our road ahead and the pathway to accelerating revenue growth. to that end, we are fueling our investments for our future and our focus on executing the many catalysts for growth that we discussed today.
thank you for joining us today. and with that, we'll turn it over to the operator for questions.

[operator instructions] our first question comes from robby marcus with jpmorgan.
unidentified participant
hi, this is actually lilly [phonetic] on for robbie. thanks for taking the question. so to start, could you just share a little bit more details on how your conversations with the fda regarding converge have been progressing? i think we were expecting to hear something with regards to timing of a panel, or whether a panel would even be needed by now; so is it still realistic to expect a panel or approval without one in the first half of the year? so, any color you could add on timing would be really helpful. and this guidance assumed any benefit from converge? thanks.
mike carrel -- president & chief executive officer
sure. i mean it's a fair question and we do understand the interest in the timing everything. as we've talked about before with many of you and a little bit on this call, there really are those two decision points; the panel or no panel. we're not in a position give any more details on what we gave on the call today. we do know that it's a catalyst, we're excited about the conversations that we're having; they've been very productive with the fda. and as i've said, we view these as very positive and collaborative discussions, and we'll look forward -- looking forward to updating everybody in the very near future. as we look at our guidance for the year, our guidance really is much more impacted by covid. covid is really the big one because elective procedures are having to have to come back, and so we did start to see some strong growth or coming back in the february timeframe after a very weak january that i believe most companies we're experiencing; as things are beginning to come, we do anticipate that that is going to continue. and so hopefully, we'll continue to see kind of covid subside and we'll be able to kind of move forward from that standpoint. that has a much greater impact than timing or anything associated with converge at this time of the revenue for 2021.
unidentified participant
great, thank you. and just a quick follow-up, can you talk us through what this guidance outlook assumes in terms of the cadence of the recovery, both throughout -- both on the top line and down the p&l? are you assuming any sort of material impact beyond first quarter? is it through the first half of the year? any color you could give there would be helpful. thank you.
mike carrel -- president & chief executive officer
yes. we believe that the pandemic will continue to be with us through the first quarter and into the second quarter, even with the back half of the year to some degree; but we think that the back half of the year will be much stronger, we're already starting to see signs of light today, but it's not going to be a bounce back all of a sudden overnight, it's going to be an incremental growth, kind of, as the year progresses. therefore the back half of the year we're anticipate much stronger than the first half of the year, given what we're seeing today, and as we're starting to see things open up.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from mike matson with needham & company.
mike matson -- needham & company -- analyst
yes, thanks for taking my questions. i guess i'll start with convergent. so, you mentioned that you have -- so i think you said 35 hybrid reps now focused on that -- those products or that procedure. so, how many of those were hired in 2020-2021? so how many of those are recent hires? and then, how should we think about the launch of convergent? how quickly the sales can ramp? is it something that could be material this year or is it really going to be more in 2022?
mike carrel -- president & chief executive officer
yes. so that -- the -- it was about 10 people or so that were hired over the course of -- say, over the last 12 months, give or take; maybe a little bit less than that. we're going to continue to add to that team. some of that team came over from the lariat team as well, where they were already very familiar with ep world, and kind of gave us a great insight into the relationships there. so, and then we've kind of cross-trained everybody from that standpoint. so we're in a really good and solid position, we'll continue to grow the number of reps for the year for sure. the biggest impact on issue is really about covid. i mean covid's really going to be the bigger one, not relative to converge. converge, we do anticipate that we -- once we get that approval, it's going to take time to begin to kind of build that market; we're ready, we've got everything prepared for it but we also need to go to build out the market. and so we've got to get the new sites up and running, we've got to create the awareness that's there, train the surgeons; it will have a great impact on 2022. as i mentioned in my comments, we do anticipate you'll be seeing accelerated revenue growth over our historical -- our historic double-digit revenue growth that you've seen in the past.
mike matson -- needham & company -- analyst
okay, thanks. and then, just the guidance on ebitda is a little more negative than i would have expected. are you -- it's your investments or something that you are making to prepare for convergent or lariat launch or are there other things happening that are causing that to -- to be a little more negative this year, just given that kind of path you're on, at least prior to covid?
mike carrel -- president & chief executive officer
yes. i mean, last year -- if you look at our last year number; at the beginning of last year when we gave our numbers, we said we'd lose about $10 million on about $260 million of revenue. obviously covid hit us, we're now saying it's about the same loss that we had anticipated from last year; so the investments are actually very similar that we thought of last year as we are going to begin to accelerate into this new market. the investments that we've got to make to rollout on converge and getting ready for amaze; we've got a very strong balance sheet to be able to handle it, and really there is just kind of money around the edges from that standpoint. obviously, this year we're going to have the full year of commissions and the full year of bonus but we anticipate that we're going to be doing much better from that standpoint; that was a lot of savings from last year that we had. and so obviously, as we kind of get ourselves back on to that growth trajectory and we will get ourselves ready to accelerate in 2022, there is some level of investment. but again, it's around the edges; we've got an incredibly strong balance sheet of $258 million in cash, and so we feel like this is a loss that we can obviously handle while we're making those major investments in our team, and to be ready for the catalyst coming on the pipeline over the next several years.
mike matson -- needham & company -- analyst
okay, great. thank you.
operator
our next question comes from matthew o'brien with piper sandler.
matthew o'brien -- piper sandler -- analyst
good afternoon, thanks for taking the questions. mike, just to be clear, the guidance that you have laid out today doesn't include any kind of incremental benefit from the convergent approval this year. i know you're already selling into that channel but there is no incremental revenue this year. and then, along those lines; can you just give a little bit more color as far as the discussions with the fda, is it the move to long-standing persistent that they're asking more questions about? is there anything that they really pulled forward that they are incrementally more concerned about; anything along those lines? thanks.
mike carrel -- president & chief executive officer
matt, our overall guidance -- i didn't say this, it didn't include any incremental. what i said was that our numbers include what we believe to get to be the impact for the year. i mean, so -- and covid's getting much stronger impact then incremental revenue growth associated with an approval. covid's what's going to happen, it's all baked into the number right now. and what we anticipate to happen with converge is all sitting in the number that you see today at -- around $250 million. so that's kind of within what we've got today. we feel, again, like that's a very good solid strong number for the year, coming off of last year; and that we're in a great position. overall, you're seeing it's 21% growth on the year-over-year basis. and in terms of the conversations with the fda, i mean -- as i mentioned, it's really kind of going out with one of two paths [phonetic]. the two paths are obviously panel no panel; we are having very positive and collaborative discussions with the fda, and hopefully, we will be able to update everybody very soon.
matthew o'brien -- piper sandler -- analyst
okay. i won't push any further then. and then mike, as far as the volumes that you're assuming; again, coming back this year, i know last quarter you had talked about -- i think it was 70% to 80%. looking in that range, are you expecting a little bit better than that this year as far as the volumes go for the rest of the business? and we'll just love to hear any kind of underlying commentary on the clips and what you're seeing as far as new account adds etcetera?
mike carrel -- president & chief executive officer
yes, so -- we anticipate -- what we're seeing is about 80% to 90% of cardiac surgery volumes that are kind of happening. it obviously got hit a little bit when there was a resurgence that came back, that you're at the lower end of that range; we're now getting back up and we're working through the 80s. from our standpoint, i don't think we'll get to 100% by the end of the year, but i do think we'll make incremental improvement as the year goes on. things are opening up for sure, we're starting to see that; i don't see it being a hockey stick, but it will impact all aspects of our business, that's the biggest impact on this year is to continue to see incremental improvement in the hospitals to treat these cardiac surgery patients.
matthew o'brien -- piper sandler -- analyst
okay. i'm sorry, just to be clear on that and so essentially, and i'm just using averages here. you're saying that 250 [phonetic] is and basically at about 90% of what you typically saw over the course of the year. so -- so to adjust for that in a normalized time it would be meaningfully higher than that; is that fair?
mike carrel -- president & chief executive officer
i'm -- what i'm saying is, i'm not equating it to the 250 [phonetic], i think you're doing math it -- you're probably going to put yourself into a quandary around that. what i'm saying is that -- that cardiac surgery -- and cardiac surgery volumes at the hospitals today are between 80% and 90%, and they are incrementally improving, they were probably closer to that kind of 80% or so during -- when the surge came back and they're beginning to kind of come back a little bit for sure, and you're moving throughout that, that's the end cardiac surgery volume that is there. and so if you try to do that math on what is all that -- kind of back into and equate; and remember, we've got multiple types of businesses, it gives you a sense for beginning to kind of move in and the hospital is getting more busy. and so, i -- hopefully that gives you some context. obviously, if things get back to normal, they get back to 100%, but -- that would be upside to our revenue, that would be upside growth for us as a business for sure.
matthew o'brien -- piper sandler -- analyst
okay, thank you.
operator
our next question comes from rick wise with stifel.
unidentified participant
yes, this is actually don [phonetic] on for rick. thanks for taking the question. just one kind of follow-up on the covid trends you're seeing in the quarter so far. if you could give any more color just on five business, what you're seeing; just for modeling kind of 1q? and then also any geographical differences that you're seeing between the ous and ous impact into a recovery?
mike carrel -- president & chief executive officer
yes, i mean we're -- in general, what you see is that the cardiac surgery part, the actual open chest valve cabg [phonetic], that portion of our business -- that portion kind of has the least volatility, but it also has the least kind of upside for growth as we kind of rebound out of things. and so i'd say that's kind of giving you one context to that. elective procedures are coming back, they were the ones that got hit the hardest back during the initial covid, they slowly but surely come back a little bit, but they also got the hardest during this period of time as well because of the elected portion of it, and that will be kind of mis portion of our business. clips and cryo nerve block continue to be very strong players for us and we anticipate that to be the case as we move throughout the year.
unidentified participant
got it. thank you. and then, just one on the encompass clamp. just trying to get a sense once approved, how quickly we may see a positive impact in growth in the open business? i think in prior quarters you've said that you already have relationships with a lot of these higher volume cabg [phonetic] accounts and sales teams have been in place. so if it's the case that they're kind of looking for an easier to use faster tool like this, it seems to me like it could be pretty quick uptake. so, just kind of any color around that?
mike carrel -- president & chief executive officer
yes. i mean the way we're describing the encompass clamp is, it's really more about once we get to a normalized volume and that's critical because obviously got to get you a more normalized volume of covid. once you get to that, we do anticipate that the encompass clamp enable us to continue to grow at the solid growth rates that we've achieved before; kind of in that mid to high single digits have been kind of our core open business. and we've got quarters that we've been in the low double digits, but in general, it allows us to continue that growth rate and penetrate into the market because those are -- these were the surgeons that we're not doing any cases before. so we're basically opening up that market, and we think that's what that will do for us, is that it will enable us to continue that growth. the growth accelerators force are going to be -- i mean, that -- the encompass is foundational to us as a business for sure but that's not the faster growth aspect of our business, the faster growth aspects are going to be the clip, the cryo nerve block, and then the minimally invasive therapies that we have, and then eventually, obviously when lariat gets approved many years from now, but that will also be another accelerant [phonetic] to the growth rate as well.
unidentified participant
got it, makes sense. thank you.

our next question comes from marie thibault with btig.
marie thibault -- btig -- analyst
hi, thank you for taking the questions this evening. i had one, possibly for angie on the sales build and some of the sg&a it certainly seem to step up a bit in q4 and i'm guessing that had to do with some of the preparations for converge. but just wanted to get some thoughts on perhaps the cadence of how to think about the sg&a line as some of those bonuses and commissions and things get built in throughout the year? and whether you would look to expand further at the end of the year in preparation for lariat as well?
angie wirick -- chief financial officer
sure. thanks, marie. i think the way to think about sg&a costs looking into 2021, we typically see an uptick at the beginning of the year, that's when we reset plans and you're marching to new orders. there are other kinds of timing items such as tradeshows where they are heavier in the first half of the year, and a little bit in the second half of the year. in terms of investments, we expect to continue to make investments throughout the year in preparation for the converge launch, the encompass launch, and some of the other catalyst longer term. so, i'd say kind of declining over the course of the year but look to historical levels when you're thinking about spend overall.
marie thibault -- btig -- analyst
okay, that's really helpful, angie. i appreciate it. and then just one on converge; i'm certainly not going to try to ask more on fda but i did want to ask, what you're seeing from current users in terms of the impact of that as symposium data? i'm sure some of them more aware of some of that large benefit to 35, absolute benefit there. if you're seeing that show up in procedures at this point, that benefits. and then, maybe more importantly, you mentioned new sites that would be targeted; do you -- can you give us an idea of how many new sites we might see with the rollout of converge?
mike carrel -- president & chief executive officer
yes., i mean the [indecipherable] is relatively new, it's the first time that was presented and kind of peer-reviewed at a scientific session with -- so that was -- it just happened several weeks ago where i wouldn't say it's affecting our volumes yet but there is definitely a lot of chatter and discussion among -- within the ep community about the significant benefits for the long-standing persistent patient. dr. delurge [phonetic] was the one who presented the data; it's obviously compelling and you're getting a lot more conversations for sure that didn't happen before, both with surgeons and with the electrophysiology community. so, i'd say it kind of generated some discussion along that group but that's really about it at this point in time, not necessarily procedural volumes.
and remind me, can you ask the second question, marie?
marie thibault -- btig -- analyst
new sites, beyond kind of the current users what you hope to target, no more less [phonetic]?
mike carrel -- president & chief executive officer
yes. so what we did -- so every one of our reps have targeted new sites within that area. we've also targeted those that are existing sites that they know that they can expand; so once we get the approval, we'll be able to kind of go after the market from that standpoint, we'll be able to add them on in a very kind of methodical way as we kind of get them trained and up and running. so you can imagine that they've prioritized sites within each one of their different territories, so that they can get them right, they can kind of build best-in-class, we can learn from those, we get up at running first, and then we can kind of accelerate from there. that's what we keep talking about that we believe that 2022 we looked at -- that's when we started -- we will enable and start to see some accelerated growth for sure, and then that will continue for many years. the great thing about this is that we've got lots of sites to go after, we're going to prioritize and get them right, get them doing the procedure right, make sure that they're safe and effective with their patients, seeing good results, and then kind of begin to move on to other and additional sites at that time.
marie thibault -- btig -- analyst
all right, thank you so much.

our next question comes from suraj kalia with oppenheimer.
suraj kalia -- oppenheimer -- analyst
good afternoon, everyone. mike, can you hear me all right?
mike carrel -- president & chief executive officer
yes.
suraj kalia -- oppenheimer -- analyst
thanks. that's perfect. hey, mike. so, i know a lot of questions have been asked; i just want to go on to converge. mike, forgive me, did i hear you wrong when you said there was a 35% absolute delta between the two arms at 18 months?
mike carrel -- president & chief executive officer
that is correct. it was basically approximately in the convergent arm, it was approximately 61% success at 18 months. and in the catheter-only arm, it was around 26%.
suraj kalia -- oppenheimer -- analyst
so the convergent arm, and forgive me for belaboring this, and the reason i ask mike is, i've never seen a 40% delta; that's a big deal, at least clinically. so help me understand the treatment arm went from, let's say, 68% to 61% within a span of six months, right, from 12 months to 18 months. and what you are saying is the endo-arm went from, let's say around 50% to 27% something?
mike carrel -- president & chief executive officer
[indecipherable].
suraj kalia -- oppenheimer -- analyst
wow, that's interesting. and mike...
mike carrel -- president & chief executive officer
and that's why we talk about the durability of the procedure, and that's what we've seen; that's one of the compelling pieces to it. as that -- and it's -- remember the catheter is -- the catheter and the conversion are complementary, we really kind of play to each other's strength when they work together, it's about the two procedures or the two devices really working well together to get a better result.
suraj kalia -- oppenheimer -- analyst
right. mike, i'll be in a position to make any assessments about long-standing persistent af, and more recent, persistent af within the context of this 35% absolute delta?
mike carrel -- president & chief executive officer
i'm not sure i understand the question when you say...
suraj kalia -- oppenheimer -- analyst
so...
mike carrel -- president & chief executive officer
i guess the data that we presented to the fda and obviously, that was discussed at the afib symposium; so that's -- that is for long-standing persistent.
suraj kalia -- oppenheimer -- analyst
got it. okay. and mike, in terms of the initial centers and maybe i'm just asking the same question in a different flavor and i'll hop back in queue. for converge i know you talked about the reps, but how many of your existing centers would you consider as low-hanging fruit? whatever metric you want to use; centers, cases, whatever -- just trying to understand. i know you're putting feet on the ground, but what do you think is the low hanging fruit in your existing client base? thank you for taking my questions.
mike carrel -- president & chief executive officer
on the long-term this harvest is huge. and then, because in most of our existing client base you only have one ep or maybe a small group of cardiologists to referring; and so it's -- because they believed in this, they started going down that path. now that we've got very compelling data, once we get that approval and we're able to kind of actually market to that which we cannot do today, it allows us to expand the expand it -- expand to the referral network, expand to the eps within that community; and so we do feel like there is -- i don't -- i know low-hanging fruit is the wrong word per se, but what do think that there is a significant expansion opportunity within the existing base, it already has a trained surgeon. and for sure we've prioritized those sites that we already know are good sites, and already have at least one few ep champions in that group. so we're definitely going after that; we will go after that for sure.
operator
thank you. your next question comes from rebecca wang with svb leerink.
rebecca wang -- svb leerink -- analyst
hi, this is actually rebecca for danielle antalffy. i just want to shift gears a little bit to value-add because i think that is an important data catalyst coming up later this year. to begin with, how should we think about lariat into business, especially is this complementary or competitive with minimally invasive [indecipherable] business? will that be cannibalized? and more importantly, what we should -- we look for from the amaze trial data as it relates to efficacy and safety that will be mainly for two fda approval or adoption? thank you.
mike carrel -- president & chief executive officer
yes. so, thanks for the questions, rebecca. so as it relates to clip, the way we approach the market is; we believe it's complementary because it allows us to talk to a physician community, the eps, and give their options for their patients. and whatever it is, in the best interest for their patients, we let them assess it. now we're giving them -- we will be able to give the lariat, which is a less invasive percutaneous approach or you've got the clip; they both worked exceptionally well at closing off the appendage. they both are epicardial, and have the advantage of both, mechanical and electrical isolation. and so those are benefits of both of the devices. it really comes down to how do they want to use it; and it allows us to have that conversation. the pricing is different, lariat gets more money per procedure; so we would benefit from that, but that's not how we're going to sell it. we are going to sell it as an option and give them the choice based on what's going to be best for their institution and for their patients.
as it relates to data for lariat; also i know a question that's on top of mind for many people. the data that we're looking for -- the trial was designed to be a superiority trial, we're not giving exact numbers because it obviously fluctuates but that benefit would be provided to that particular trial. so we're looking at it as a superiority trial, that's what we're looking for, we believe that will go both clinically and relevant for kind of our fda submission. and so that's going to be the -- i think you're going to want to look for much like what we do with converge where we talk about superiority was critical, we did achieved it with converge, that's what we're hoping to achieve with this as well. it's a 600-patients trial, and -- so you can kind of get a sense in a randomized 2.1 [phonetic].
rebecca wang -- svb leerink -- analyst
thank you.

and i'm not showing any further questions at this time. i'd like to turn the call back over to mike carrel.

great. well, again, everyone thank you for joining us tonight, and your interest in atricure. as i mentioned before, we're really excited about the progress that we've made with the fda, and where we're going right now in the future and the catalyst in front of us, both with converge, amaze, encompass and cryo nerve block, and the many clips that we've got in the market. we've got an exciting future, not just for this year but for the next decade.

good afternoon and welcome to atricure's first quarter 2021 earnings conference call. my name is snell, and i'll be your coordinator for the call today. at this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. we will be facilitating a question-and-answer session toward the end of today's call. as a reminder, this call is being recorded for replay purposes.
i would now like to turn the call over to lynn lewis from the gilmartin group for a few introductory comments. ma'am?
lynn lewis -- investor relations, gilmartin group
thank you. by now you should have received a copy of the earnings press release. if you have not received a copy, please call 513-755-4136 to have one emailed to you.
before we begin today let me remind you that the company's remarks include forward-looking statements. forward-looking statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond atricure's control, including risks and uncertainties described from time to time in atricure's sec filings. these statements include but are not limited to financial guidance, expectations regarding the timing of fda reviews and expectations of product approval, expectations regarding the fda's response and whether it will approve converge, the potential converge launch timing, the potential market opportunity for converge, and the adoption of the converge procedure. atricure's results may differ materially from those projected. atricure undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement.
additionally, we refer to non-gaap financial measures, specifically revenue reported on a constant currency basis, adjusted ebitda and adjusted loss per share. a reconciliation of these non-gaap financial measures with the most directly comparable gaap measures is included in our press release, which is available on our website.
with that, i'd like to turn the call over to mike carrel, president and chief executive officer. mike?
michael h. carrel -- president and chief executive officer
thanks lynn. good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining us. we hope that you are safe and doing well. we're off to a strong start in 2021, with $59 million in total revenue for the first quarter. this represents 3% sequential revenue growth over the fourth quarter of 2020, and largely reflects improving patient flow in the united states.
at the start of the quarter, we experienced headwinds from the decreased cardiac surgery procedures following the spike in covid-19 cases, which resulted in extended quarantines and a reallocation of resources within hospitals. however, in march, most areas in united states began to stabilize, and we saw steady growth across all of our franchises.
while we believe this recovery reflects some pent-up demand, we also saw improvement in procedure volumes in march. encouragingly, we finished the quarter with momentum and this has continued in april.
internationally, our performance was not as strong, especially in parts of western europe due to covid-19 resurgences and slowing vaccine rollouts. similar to the experience in united states, we began to improve in march. however, trends in our international markets have not been as consistent, and we expect continued volatility in the coming months.
as we begin the second quarter, we expect the upward trend to continue in the united states. while we're hopeful that international markets will improve, the outlook is less flair. we believe that worldwide cardiac surgery volumes remain below pre-pandemic levels. conditions are improving, but this healthcare crisis is not fully behind us yet. therefore, we expect that we will experience some variability in the second quarter, and further recovery, as the year progresses.
turning now to an update on our growth initiatives; beginning with converge, while we're closer to completing the pma process, we cannot provide details of either a panel meeting or approval at this time. however, we are confident that we remain in a pathway to eventual approval, and look forward to providing an update on this milestone shortly. additionally, we continue to build a dedicated sales team and develop a robust infrastructure, to support the commercial steps ahead.
currently, our u.s. sales and training team consists of more than 200 individuals in the field, who are all critical to supporting our hybrid therapy growth. this includes 35 dedicated reps and clinical specialists, and our ep focused hybrid sales team, and over 30 professionals supporting nationwide training and educational programs.
the opportunity ahead of us is very clear, and our goal is for the hybrid convergent therapy to become the standard-of-care for the millions of patients with long-standing persistent afib.
we're also making significant strides on amaze, our other landmark clinical trial. the amaze study is a 600-patient randomized-controlled trial, designed to show superiority of endocardial catheter plus our lariat suture delivery device, versus endocardial catheter ablation alone. we successfully completely patient follow-ups in early april, and are now focused on analysis of the data. we remain on track for pma submission of the amaze trial during the fall of this year, and expect to release trial data following the submission.
in our open franchise, we continue to make progress toward our 510(k) clearance of our new encompass clamp, in addition to the open ablation platform, where we are the market leader in cardiac surgery procedures for the treatment of afib. we anticipate clearance later this year, followed by a concentrated commercial launch at certain key centers in 2021, and a broad commercial launch thereafter.
as a reminder the encompass clamp provides a simpler and faster approach to ablating the heart in open procedures, and we expect this device to appeal to high volume cabin surgeons. as a result, we expect this new clamp to deepen our penetration of the cardiac surgery market starting in 2022 and beyond.
the collective opportunity and addressable markets for our open and minimally invasive ablation platforms is well into the billions of dollars, representing hundreds of thousands of patients annually. this opportunity is complemented by the continued rise in less atrial appendage management procedures. we saw a record number of atriclip laa exclusion devices sold in the first quarter, and our left atrial appendage management franchise accounted for 40% of worldwide revenue. our track record of delivering laam solutions over the past several years has contributed to revenue growth, along with increasing interest in managing the left atrial appendage. we're encouraged by the growing awareness at society meetings, where the laa management is the focal point of both sessions and discussions.
switching gears to cryosphere, our dedicated device for managing post-operative pain in thoracic patients. the cryoice cryosphere probe is gaining traction in the market. with sequential quarterly sales growth since launch and continuous addition of new accounts. cryo nerve block, which is included in our open franchise revenue, is one of the fastest growing parts of our business and accounted for approximately 6% of total revenue in the first quarter. our unique technology uses a differentiated freezing method, to block nerves from transmitting pain signals after cardiothoracic surgery, providing a long-standing form of pain relief for these patients. we believe this therapy will drive accelerated revenue growth in the coming years.
looking ahead, while the pandemic is still impacting our lives, we are beginning to see some return of normalcy with the rollout of vaccines and the gradual lessening of socially restricted measures. the momentum with which we are moving forward gives us hope. we're in a pathway toward recovery. our team continues to execute and make achievements toward our strategic initiatives and we remain confident in our future, that we're strongly positioned with multiple catalysts we have under way to accelerate our revenue growth.
in closing, i would like to take a moment to thank scott drake and mark lanning for their dedicated service and leadership on our board of directors. during their tenure, atricure has experienced tremendous growth and advancement of our mission to reduce the global afib epidemic. we're grateful for their guidance over the years to our entire management team.
with that, i'll now turn the call over to angie wirick, our chief financial officer, to discuss more detailed results of the quarter.
angela l. wirick -- chief financial officer
thanks mike. our first quarter 2021 worldwide revenue of $59.3 million increased 11% on a gaap basis and 10% on a constant currency basis when compared to the first quarter of 2020. on a sequential basis, we experienced growth of 3% in our worldwide revenue from the fourth to first quarter. the sequential increase results primarily from our u.s. business and improving trends in elective and non-elective procedures throughout march.
in the first quarter 2021, u.s. revenue was $50.3 million a 16% increase from the first quarter of 2020. we realized double-digit revenue growth in each franchise in the u.s. from the improvement in underlying procedure volume. u.s. sales of appendage management products were $20.6 million, up 18% over the first quarter of 2020. open ablation product sales, which include our cryo nerve block business were $21.1 million up 10% over 2020. minimally invasive ablation sales in the u.s. were $8.4 million, up 28% from 2020, reflecting increased elective procedures year-over-year and growth in epi-sense revenue.
international revenue was $9 million, down 8% on a gaap basis and down 13% on a constant currency basis, as compared to the first quarter of 2020. as mike mentioned earlier, we experienced more pressure in our international markets, largely related to conditions in western europe, as a result of covid-19.
touching briefly on a few key metrics for the first quarter of 2021, gross margin was 75.1%, up 200 basis points from the first quarter of 2020. this improvement was driven by both geographic and product revenue mix. u.s. activity accounted for 85% of our worldwide sales, compared to a range of 80% to 82% historically. specific products contributing to a more favorable gross margin include heavier epi-sense and atriclip flex-v and pro-v device sales. we have an adjusted ebitda loss of $4.7 million compared to an adjusted ebitda loss of $6.1 million for the first quarter of 2020. while operating expenses increased year-over-year the improvement to the bottom-line results show revenue growth outpacing our investments. our loss per share was $0.38 in the first quarter 2021 compared to a $0.42 loss per share in the first quarter of 2020, while the adjusted loss per share each period was $0.32 and $0.36 respectively.
now moving to detail and operating expenses for the quarter. for comparability, i will exclude recurring effects of non-cash adjustments to contingent consideration liability from my comments. total operating expenses increased $6 million or 12% from $51.9 million in first quarter of 2020 to $57.9 million in first quarter of 2021. the change results mainly from increased variable cash and stock-based compensation, offset partially by lower clinical trial expenses, reduced travel and discretionary spends for trade shows and internal meetings. certain areas of spend, where we are currently experiencing savings such as travel and meetings, are influenced by the pandemic and we expect costs to restored to historical levels as our top line improves and travel, training and events increase.
we ended the first quarter with $236 million in cash and investments. as a reminder our first quarter cash burn is typically higher than the remainder of the year, based on cash tax payments, due upon stock vesting and annual variable compensation payout. we expect our quarterly cash burn to reduce significantly for the remainder of the year. and lastly, we are pleased with a recent development in the department of justice investigation, specifically, their decision to decline intervention in the underlying case.
and finally, turning to our outlook for 2021. we now expect to achieve approximately $252 million to $256 million in revenue for the year. given the momentum we observed exiting the first quarter, we project a reduced impact from covid in the second quarter. as mike mentioned earlier, we continue to experience procedural volumes generally operating below normal, with regional variability. in addition to reiterate our view for the remainder of the year, we expect cardiac surgery procedure volumes to continue to improve steadily through the year, resulting in sequential quarterly revenue growth for the remainder of 2021.
while we're pleased to report 75% gross margin in the first quarter, this result was largely driven by very favorable geographic mix, which we believe was unique to the quarter. as we scale our operations in the coming years, we do expect our business to reach and maintain a 75% gross margin consistently. and we continue to expect adjusted ebitda to the loss of approximately $10 million for the full year 2021. with improvements to the top line throughout 2021, we should realize a corresponding improvement in quarterly adjusted ebitda. we also continue to expect adjusted loss per share for 2021 to be approximately $1.15.
at this point, i will turn the call back to mike for closing comments.
michael h. carrel -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, angie. we want to end by thanking healthcare workers and the scientific community for helping the world overcome this pandemic. as we move toward recovery, we're excited about the path forward for atricure. we're also pleased with the appointment of kris johnson as our board chair. her extensive experience in medical device and growth oriented companies will be invaluable, as we deliver on many of our catalysts that we've talked about earlier today. our outlook remains bright, and with accelerated and sustainable growth over the long-term.
thank you again for joining us today. and with that, we'll turn it over for questions.

[operator instructions]. the first question comes from the line of robbie marcus from j.p. morgan. your line is now open. you may ask your question.
lilia-celine breton lozada -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
hi. this is actually lili on for robbie. thanks for taking the question. so first on converge. it sounds like you guys already know what path they'll be progressing approval or approval without a panel. so what's helping you that fact from moving forward here. what have your conversations with the fda been like recently, and is it still reasonable to assume some sort of update in the first half of the year? and then i just have one quick follow-up. thanks.
michael h. carrel -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, i will start with the anda. it's very reasonable to assume that we're going to have an update very shortly, as i mentioned in my comments. and you're right, we do know the answer to the question you did ask relative to that. what's holding up is just, we just need paper in hand from the fda. once we have that, we'll be able to announce, whether or not it's going to panel or we've got the approval. as i mentioned in my comments though, obviously you've seen all the data. we feel very confident in our eventual chance of getting approval there. so that's really what we can say about the converge piece at this time.
lilia-celine breton lozada -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
okay, great. thank you. and then one just quick follow-up there.
michael h. carrel -- president and chief executive officer
sure.
lilia-celine breton lozada -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
any color you could provide on the exit rate coming out of march, and how that's continued into april and what sort of cadence over the rest of your guidance range assumes? thanks so much.
michael h. carrel -- president and chief executive officer
sure. we exited strong. i don't know if i understand exactly what exit rate per se means, but we exited the month of march and march was very strong. it really picked up at the end of february and continued into march. that rate has continued into the month of april, as well as i mentioned during my remarks.
we do anticipate that we'll have a-i think if you think about the revenue, we'll be better in the second quarter than we had initially anticipated and in the back half of the year we'll continue to be strong, as we had anticipated. we had already put into our numbers in our guidance originally, really having a strong back half of the year. so most of that is going to probably come into the second quarter, which is where we kind of had some of the softness in our original guidance that we've now updated and increased.
operator
okay. next question comes from the line of rick wise from stifel. your line is now open. you may ask a question.
frederick wise -- stifel -- analyst
hi. good afternoon mike. hi angie. maybe i will focus on a couple of your major growth drivers and just sort of -- i guess my question is sort of what's next? i mean, maybe just help us appreciate given the amazing left atrial management performance. what's next that separate from recovery might help sustain it's -- continued new product rollout? just if you could give us a little more granular sense of your confidence in that area specifically?
michael h. carrel -- president and chief executive officer
yeah i mean -- i appreciate the question, rick. we're at a great point in afib history in my mind. we have got some considerable catalysts coming down the pipeline over the next several years, that are going to drive the growth. we are hearing some [phonetic], and you're seeing some of it in our numbers to some degree. first and foremost, obviously converge, that will drive our mis business. you saw, we had a really strong mis quarter. part of that is because of the impact of covid, but part of that's also because the data has been out there since may of last year and people have seen that data at hrs and other places and lots of inbound inquiries and comments and people that are very interested in kind of adopting that. we think that's going to be a significant driver to our growth.
you add left atrial appendage on top of that. we're actually seeing an increase in the percent of attachment of the atriclip to the converge procedure specifically, and so that's also driving some of the short-term growth and we think that's going to continue, so that as the converge or the hybrid therapies grow, you're going to get the clip on top of that, and eventually possibly even some lariat's with the amaze data.
so getting to the second piece, which is on left atrial appendage. we've got a rich pipeline of not just great products with the atriclip, but obviously with amaze having fully enrolled and followed up on that trial. now we're compiling the data. we're in a great position, that within a couple of years of getting approval on that and then move that forward, as well as another standard of care. you combine that with converge, and really, we're the only ones that will be out there with that kind of robust ability to serve this huge market, which is the long-standing persistent patient population.
on top of that, we do have other catalysts coming down the pipeline. i mentioned encompass getting clearance on that. the penetration rate still is ridiculously low in cardiac surgery for treating the afib patients. we believe encompass will help with that for sure, and then on top of that, you've got your pain management franchise, where we're really building up that team quite aggressively right now. we plan on almost doubling it probably over the next 12 or so months -- 12 to 18 months. every time we add somebody in a new area, there's great interest and it continues to drive growth, as you've seen we've had sequential growth every single quarter since rolling out that product.
frederick wise -- stifel -- analyst
yeah, thanks for that. and maybe one for angie on gross margin. you're very clear that the first quarter -- i think that must be a record gross margin for atricure, or certainly in my memory. but how do we think about -- i guess two things really is that, i want to make sure i understand -- was it that international was so weak or that the products were so strong and that won't sustain because international is going to recover and so that'll be the drag? i'm not sure i understand -- of course, i'd like the dynamics there. and again, how do we think about for the rest of the year, are you suggesting we should be thinking about sort of 72%, 73% and then roughly that for the year, is that the right way to think about it, angie?
angela l. wirick -- chief financial officer
rick, you have a great memory, 75% this quarter is one of our best in most recent history. the unique mix that we saw was the u.s. contributing 85% of total revenue. we typically are 80% to 82%, with the u.s. contribution, and so what you will see, what you will expect for the rest of the year, is international to rebound and play a bigger percentage of the overall revenue, and that's headwind when we think about margins coming down from 75%.
our full year outlook i think will show some modest improvement of where we've been historically, and continue to target and progress toward 75%. but that on a consistent basis, is a more long-term target in the coming years.
operator
thank you. your next question comes from the line of mike matson from needham. your line is now open. you may ask your question.
david saxon -- needham -- analyst
yeah. hi mike and angie. this is david saxon on for mike. thanks so much for taking the question. i guess first, on the hybrid sales team, if memory serves, there weren't any new hires this quarter. so i guess are you guys happy with that team, going into a potential convergent approval, or do you expect to make additional hires? and then other than approval, anything else that needs to be accomplished before you launch?
michael h. carrel -- president and chief executive officer
we're actually adding -- we'll be adding significantly to the hybrid team over the coming years. we feel like we're ready for the launch. we're in a great position with a number of reps. we have actually added kind of a management layer, where we've converted some of the reps into area directors. so we have now got six areas around the country. that team is fully staffed now and then we have fully backfilled them. so actually we have been hiring, but it's more being kind of backfilling some people that have been promoted to take on larger management roles on that front, and we'll continue to hire in that area. but we're well positioned. we've got the country covered. we feel like we're in a really really good place on that front. on top of that, i mentioned about the education and training team. in order to really roll this out effectively, we've got to have a robust team there, and we'll continue to add to the number of people we've got on the education and training team as well. and so yes, we'll continue to add headcount over the course of the year.
david saxon -- needham -- analyst
okay, great. and then, i guess just one on guidance. you are raising revenue but maintaining ebitda. so i mean i guess, other than the new hires, any other investments that you want to call out, that -- i guess, is resulting in maintaining that ebitda loss guidance? thanks so much.
michael h. carrel -- president and chief executive officer
sure, i mean -- go on angie. you got it.
angela l. wirick -- chief financial officer
we typically see a heavier loss in the first quarter and some of the project spend has shifted out. i mean you called it out, we're leaning into our catalyst for the future, and adding to the team and adding training and education programs, anticipating pretty sizable launches the rest of this year. that's the kind of the thought behind the $10 million and managing to that bottom line number.
operator
thank you. your next question comes from the line of danielle antalffy from svb leerink. your line is now open. you may ask your question.
danielle antalffy -- svb leerink -- analyst
hey. thanks so much everyone. thanks for taking the question. mike, i just wanted to follow-up on a prior question, as it relates to the revenue guidance. maybe this is just the street sort of mismodeling q1. but you mentioned, you now are seeing potentially better momentum than previously expected heading into q2. you beat the consensus number by a couple of million dollars, but you're only taking it up by about the beat, it looks like at the midpoint of the range. so just curious about, if you could help bridge us there this just sort of normal conservatism. i know you guys tend to be on the more conservative side, and then i have one follow-up?
michael h. carrel -- president and chief executive officer
sure. i mean, i've looked at this. we do anticipate that we'll have strength in the second quarter. we're just making sure that this continues, it has continued in strength in april. obviously with just some uncertainty, as you kind of come out of the pandemic here, just making sure that q2 is in a solid place from that standpoint overall. and then the back half shouldn't change much, from what we had previously guided to.
danielle antalffy -- svb leerink -- analyst
okay, that's fair. and then i guess my follow-up question is -- it's on converge, and sort of you mentioned you are fully prepared to launch. but i guess just from a strategic perspective, how should we be thinking about the early days of the launch, and how quickly this can ramp and how much upside there could potentially be, to your guidance, depending upon when we get news on converge and when this actually comes to market?
michael h. carrel -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, the upside this year is going to be -- obviously there's always the potential for upside on converge. but it's mostly really due to covid. as covid comes back, and i think that's what we saw in march and has continued into the april timeframe, just as hospital beds open up and they're allowing these procedures to occur. that's what going to drive the upside for us in 2021. both on -- both sides of our business, inclusive of our pain management side and obviously on the ablation side of our business as well.
so that's really what's going to drive the upside in 2021. converge will clearly be a driver for significant growth in 2022. that's really where we see converge and the clip on top of that, because of the attachment rate that we anticipate getting with it. that's where you'll start to see kind of some acceleration from those two in 2022.
operator
thank you. next question comes from the line -- from matthew o'brien from piper sandler. your line is now open. you may ask a question.
matthew o'brien -- piper sandler -- analyst
all right. afternoon, thanks for taking the question. mike, just to push a little bit on converge. i think coming out of the q4 call, a lot of us kind of expected hey, it's going to be soon, in terms of the decision one way or the other. so i think for investors, it might be helpful just to talk a little bit more about -- i think you said you had a best sense for it back then and you felt pretty good about it back then. and now fast forward a couple of months and it's much of the same. is there something that's a little more tangible, that we can bite down on, that helps us understand what -- the delay from how we see it might be, in terms of getting that paperwork. is it an administration change? is it a reviewer? a slow down at the agency? is there something specific that's a little bit more tangible that we can look to?
michael h. carrel -- president and chief executive officer
a little bit of all the above. i would say -- it's all administrative at this point in time. i mean, i feel really good about kind of -- i wish i could say, that i have the approval on one hand or i had something to kind of announce to on a date. but i don't, and i can't -- and i think it's an administrative thing more than anything else. if you think back to the quarter, there were a panel meeting, that definitely took -- it was the same team that has been on top of ours, that was a part of the panel meeting that occurred this quarter, that definitely obviously was in the level of, i think review and time that they had to spend and that was probably more than they had expected, which obviously causes some aspect of delay on our side.
the interim branch chief did leave, but the person that came in has done a wonderful job. again, we had really good collaborative pieces, but it has been mostly on the administrative side to your point, in terms of any kind of delay from your perspective. again, i wish i could say something today, obviously i can't. i understand why you're asking that question. but i'd say it's much more of an administrative thing than anything else. there's nothing fundamentally wrong in any way, shape or form other than that.
matthew o'brien -- piper sandler -- analyst
okay, that's very helpful. appreciate that. and then on the u.s. mis business, i know there has been catch up. although it sounds like january for pretty much for everybody was pretty soft. so i'm sure there was some slowdown there, but some catch up maybe in march. but if you look at things on a two-year stack, you have not put that level of growth in the mis business over the last 2.5 years. so clearly something is going on outside of -- just maybe some catch up in procedural volumes. is there any point to, in terms potentially new clinicians or going deeper in existing accounts or anything along those lines, it has taken a while for people to look at the data, process it, get their programs up and running and now they're starting to do more cases, anything along those lines?
michael h. carrel -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. you're definitely seeing a combination of two things. i mean one is that, the first thing that got impacted by covid, was for sure the mis side. so you've got a really weak end of march in 2020. but your point is valid, we do have -- the data has been out there now. it has been presented. it has been presented at hrs in may of last year. hrs did a special session on it in november and then the long-term data came out in january. i'd just say the totality of evidence that continues to come out, they put out and published around this procedure, continues to show that it is an incredibly durable procedure that works very well in these sick patients, and so you're starting to see more and more programs for sure get up and running, and those that were doing it, begin to come back and say, wait a second, i'm willing to take a second look at that and begin to go down that patent. so i think that you're definitely starting to see the beginning of that happening for sure. thank you. your next question comes from the line of bill plovanic from canaccord. your line is now open. you may ask a question.
william plovanic -- canaccord -- analyst
great. thanks. so, on converge just to clarify, i know three questions have been asked. there is no final data or any animal or any type of data you need to provide. it's truly admin you're just waiting on at this point. and then my follow-up question is just relative to your r&d spend, and angie spoke about the investment a bit. but i was wondering if you could provide a little more granularity on kind of what you're really working on there? thanks.
michael h. carrel -- president and chief executive officer
sure. yes, just to clarify it is admin, and there's no additional work to be done on data for animals or anything else relative to this. it is purely at this point in time, an administrative piece. i'll turn it to angie, maybe to give some more details on the r&d spend.
angela l. wirick -- chief financial officer
sure, bill. couple of the key areas of spend are the continued work on the amaze trial, patient follow-up during the quarter. we also have the continued access protocol with amaze, that includes new patient enrollment in that particular study. couple other clinical trials ongoing, ice-afib and deep, and then from a product development perspective, you're seeing pretty heavy spend with encompass, that's the new open clamp, and then few other projects that are in the pipeline that you'll hear about from us in the coming years.
william plovanic -- canaccord -- analyst
okay. and if i could throw a follow-up in there, just i think one of the questions we get is, as we talk about the amaze trial and lariat coming is, how is that going to fit into the portfolio, if you think about having the atriclip out there? you got the converge procedure, and then now you're going to have the lariat as well?
michael h. carrel -- president and chief executive officer
yes, it's in -- number one, is it's our product, that's actually going to be used by the interventionals. whether it's the electrophysiologist or an interventional cardiologist. primarily eps at this point in time. but it really kind of gets us into that realm, has a product for them to put into their hand, to serve in the same way that the atriclip does. i mean it has gotten obviously very similar characteristics and that it's epicardials from the outside. it's less invasive, and so there's obviously trade outs both ways.
our strategy is that, we believe that in combination with other ablation techniques, can really improve the afib outcomes, you can take the appendage out completely. it does not leave anything inside, and is a superior technology overall. and so we feel like we're going to be in a really good position to be able to offer that. that you're going to be able to reduce the afib, and we've already shown that with the clip, from an electrical standpoint, we're suited [phonetic] to prove that out with the amaze trial, and that's going to position us well to have really kind of a holistic robust solution and give them the choice to make.
operator
thank you. your next question comes from the line of suraj kalia from oppenheimer and company. your line is now open. you may ask a question.
suraj kalia -- oppenheimer and company -- analyst
good afternoon mike, angie. can you hear me all right?
michael h. carrel -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. hey suraj.
suraj kalia -- oppenheimer and company -- analyst
perfect. so congrats on the quarter. mike, two questions from my side. just piggybacking on bill's question. so mike, it's a foregone conclusion, amaze will show positive outcomes in stroke prophylaxis and af burden reduction with the use of lariat. so i guess when you're looking at the complete portfolio right, i'm more interested in atriclip versus lariat. like you said, the end user is different. the reimbursement pathway for the physician is different. help us understand, should we expect a product bifurcation within the appendage management itself? moving forward how should we think about -- will there be a pull through for the atriclip, or is it going to be loss to lariat? because lariat is going to be the one with the tangible data, i would say within the framework of the amaze trial?
michael h. carrel -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, i think it's going to be a little bit of both. it's a very good question and i actually think it's one of our differentiators, and that we're going to actually offer up for the physician to provide with their patient choices. and what's going to work best for that particular facility, in terms of how they best want to treat their patients. some physicians are going to be very comfortable, they are going to go down the lariat pathway and we'll be able to support them. some really like what they get out of the clip, and we'll be able to support them there. right now, the clip is what we have that's in the market, and so that's what's becoming and getting attached. lariat really is not out there yet. once we get the amaze data, we get the amaze approved, that will obviously change several years down the line, and then we'll -- they'll probably have some questions asked, which way do they want to go, do they have the skill sets and do they want to go down to lariat?
either way you're talking about managing the appendage, and we're providing them with both options and both are really good options for them. and we're not going to dictate to them which they go. we just want them to manage the appendage, because we think it's in the best interest of the patient. and so we're going to leave that up to them, and it's interesting depending on the ep that you talk to, some really want you to put on a clip, and they don't ever see themselves going into the lariat world. many others are like, they can't wait to see the lariat come down, and then they'll move down that pathway. and again we're going to be indifferent. we're going to do what's in their best interest in how they want to build that program out.
suraj kalia -- oppenheimer and company -- analyst
got it. mike, on converge, if i listen to your comments, logic dictates approval is imminent and we're going to bypass the panel. help us understand the low hanging fruit, let's say for the next three to four quarters? and the reason i ask is, in the past you guys have reported about -- at least memory tells me, 3,000 or so procedures in converge have been done? correct me if i'm wrong there. but should we expect a step change in converge demand post approval, or should we expect a gradual uptick, because it is being used technically off label? thank you for taking that questions.
michael h. carrel -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. well it's actually being not used off label. so i just want to make sure, i was to going to address that. i mean we do have a very strong label today for cardiac tissue ablation, and so that is how the parts are being used today, it is absolutely an on-label use of the product today, even before the approval does happen.
now that being said, in terms of the question you asked, relative to what does this mean for an uptick. you put it out three or four quarters. we really view this as -- you'll start to see some accelerated growth in 2022. 2021, whenever the time is that we actually get there, again led by panel or by an official approval before hand, what that's going to look like is, getting sites up and running. we've got them segmented. every territory has picked up key sites they're going to go into. make sure that they've utilized a beachhead in every area of the country. we're being very strategic about going after them, building up those programs, learning from that and then kind of building out and accelerating. we think that we want to take the rest of this year regardless of when we get that approval to really kind of build that up. and we're starting to see some of that happen organically already even before the approval, because we're getting approached by certain sites.
that being said, 2022 we do anticipate that's when you'll begin to see the ramp and maybe, i don't know that i would call anything the that low hanging fruit. but i would say that, you'll start to see the ramp in terms of having programs that are more established and able to kind of take advantage of the training and education we're providing.

[operator instructions]. next question comes from the line of marie thibault from btig. your line is now open. you may ask a question.
marie thibault -- btig -- analyst
hi, good afternoon. thank you for taking the questions. i'll ask both of mine here right upfront. on two new products that we haven't really touched on too much today in the discussion, the first is on cryo nerve block, i think you said in your prepared comments, 6% of total revenue, which is certainly material and impressive. wondering what in terms of the investments you mentioned you're making, what more are you going to be doing there to expand use of cryo nerve block, and sort of where you see that product to go, in terms of helping the open market grow faster? and then secondly on encompass, it sounded like this could be something that's material to revenue in 2022. what are sort of your early plans to, once that's approved get that into the hand of the cardiac surgeons and encourage use there? and appreciate the question.
michael h. carrel -- president and chief executive officer
great. well thank you marie, appreciate the question. on pain management or cryo nerve block, you're right it's an exciting part of your business that we have invested and we've added significantly the headcount on that team. we've got around 20 or so people on the field right now, that continues to grow. so the number one major investment is to get people to cover the united states. we need to get coverage in all major cities and areas, because when we do do that, not only we've learned the pattern for how to actually open up a city, and get the right person and get them trained, but training is less than what you would see on the afib side of it. so we can kind of have an impact a little bit more quickly. and we do anticipate that that will continue to accelerate, as this year goes on and into the next year. it's going to continue to be a big part of our business and a growing part of our business for years to come. the key to us is again getting more and more people out there to gain coverage. that's where the major investment is.
the second piece that we need to invest in, is really continuing to get clinical data. you've heard me talk about all of our therapies. we really believe clinical data matters. it does change the way that people can treat, and so as a result of that, we will probably continue to invest in various different trials. not necessarily ide trials, but we'll invest in trials, so that we can get data to prove out the therapy even further than what the data already suggests and shows.'
the third piece really is, eventually getting it into europe, and we have applied for and are looking to try to get that into europe over the coming years, and so that's going to be another one that we anticipate being somewhat upside to us. they're chomping it a bit over there, to use it -- to hear about it at conferences from the u.s., and they definitely want access to the cryosphere products.
as it relates to encompass it's a great question. encompass is a great product. we're really excited about it. as i mentioned on the call earlier. what we see is, we believe that's going to enable us to continue to grow into that kind of mid-to-high single digits in the open franchise for years to come. that really kind of helps ups build upon it, so that cardiac surgery isn't necessarily a growing area. but we believe through penetration and getting more people to use products, that's what encompass allow us. you're not going to have a hockey stick kind of growth curve you're going to see with the clip or the lariat or the cryo nerve block or the encompass -- not the encompass, excuse me the in-contact product that is now epi-sense. and so that is really where you're going to start to see those are going to be big inflection points, encompass is going to be kind of steady as she goes.

2021-Q2,ATRC,2021-08-04 16:30:00,"prepared remarks:
operator
good afternoon, and welcome to atricure's second quarter 2021 earnings conference call. [operator instructions]
i would now like to turn the call over to lynn lewis from the gilmartin group for a few introductory comments.
lynn lewis
by now you should have received a copy of the earnings press release. if you have not received a copy, please call (513) 755-4136 to have one emailed to you. before we begin today, let me remind you that the company's remarks include forward-looking statements. forward-looking statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond atricure's control, including risks and uncertainties described from time to time in atricure's sec filings. these statements include, but are not limited to, financial guidance, expectations regarding the timing of fda reviews and expectations for product approvals, expectations regarding the potential market opportunity for converge and the adoption of the converge procedure. atricure's results may differ materially from those projected.
atricure undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements. additionally, we refer to non-gaap financial measures, specifically revenue reported on a constant currency basis, adjusted ebitda, and adjusted loss per share. a reconciliation of these non-gaap financial measures with the most directly comparable gaap measures is included in our press release, which is available on our website.
with that, i'd like to turn the call over to mike carrel, president and chief executive officer. mike?
michael h. carrel -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, lynn. good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. we hope that you're doing well. as you saw in this afternoon's press release, we are continuing the strong momentum from the first quarter with over $71 million in total revenue for the second quarter of this year. this represents 75% growth compared to the second quarter of 2020 and 20% sequential growth over the first quarter of 2021.
our strong top-line performance was driven primarily by the recovery of procedure volumes in major markets with some small portion due to patient backlog. more encouragingly, against a backdrop of stabilizing patient flow, we experienced robust growth in each of our franchises with many new sites and increasing penetration in existing facilities. the desire among patients and physicians to have access to these critical treatments continues to rise. to that end, we saw accelerating growth throughout the quarter across all platforms in the u.s., complemented by a solid rebounding of activity in europe and asia.
as we begin the third quarter, energy remains positive across our business, and july started strong. while we have seen -- while we have started to see some slowdown in procedures in areas where covid is surging, we continue to expect a strong back half of the year.
now we will start with an update on the amaze clinical trial. as a reminder, we finished enrollment in the trial shortly after the august '19 acquisition of sentreheart, then began the pma modular submissions in late 2020 and completed final patient follow-up this past april. more recently, we were unblinded to the amaze clinical trial data.
while we are not sharing details of the results today, in summary, despite achieving the primary safety goal, the primary efficacy endpoint of the amaze trial was not met. we are still learning more as we evaluate the trial data and engage in discussions with our medical advisory board and the fda. however, the pathway for pma submission is uncertain at this time.
although we hope for a different outcome from the amaze trial, we are encouraged by the safety results and believe there is an underpinning of value from the investment in sentreheart that we will continue to leverage going forward. this includes an experienced team with unique technical and clinical knowledge in the ep space, relationships we have since built with an ep lab setting and community, and a robust portfolio of ip that complements our core technologies.
as we move forward, our conviction for innovation supported by clinical science across all of our businesses remains unchanged. therefore, we will continue building a differentiated portfolio of products, expanding treatment options for the vast and growing population of afib patients.
let's now turn -- let's turn now to the many advancements in our key growth initiatives. the second quarter was transformative for atricure with pma approval of the epi-sense system for treatment of patients with long-standing persistent afib. this approval resulted from the groundbreaking converge trial, which demonstrated superiority of the hybrid af therapy using the epi-sense device to endocardial catheter ablation alone. patients with long-standing persistent afib, the most advanced and difficult-to-treat form of the disease, represent nearly half of the more than 33 million patients affected by afib worldwide. the epi-sense system is the first and only to receive fda approval for stand-alone treatment of these patients, providing critical and sustainable differentiation in the market. our opportunity is clear and this achievement marks a pivotal moment in our company. the approval provides us the ability to help educate and train physicians on the benefits of hybrid af therapy with the epi-sense system to improve the lives of millions of underserved patients.
our u.s. sales team is now executing on our commercial launch, engaging both new and existing sites and driving awareness within ep and cardiology communities. in late june, we hosted our first hybrid af training therapy event, where expert faculty-guided peer-to-peer discussions and addressed clinical questions. leading to a rich dialogue on hybrid af therapy and emphasizing the patient benefit that results from close collaboration between the specialties. this inaugural training event was just one of many activities throughout the quarter following fda approval in late april. our goal is for the hybrid af therapy utilizing the epi-sense device to become the standard of care for the millions of patients with long-standing persistent afib.
moving to our open franchise, we are pleased to announce that we've got a 510(k)clearance for the encompass clamp. this device is an innovative addition to our open ablation platform, where we are the market leader in cardiac surgery procedures for the treatment of afib. the encompass clamp provides a simpler and faster approach to ablating the heart in open procedures. and we expect the device will have broad appeal to high-volume cardiac surgeons, deepening our penetration in the cardiac surgery market over the next decade. we have begun a limited launch at a small number of centers and expect to move to full commercial launch later this year. it was nearly a decade ago that atricure's isolator synergy system was approved by the fda for the concomitant surgical treatment of persistent and long-standing persistent afib. with the recent approval of epi-sense system for hybrid af therapy, atricure has the only two devices in the world with fda approval for the treatment of long-standing persistent afib, providing a clear advantage for our open and minimally invasive ablation platforms.
so let me pause here to reiterate a message from our first quarter. the collective opportunity and addressable market for our ablation platforms is well into the billions of dollars, representing hundreds of thousands of patients annually. and while the ablation opportunity alone is meaningful, it is further boosted by the steady rise in left atrial appendage management procedures.
worldwide, our left atrial appendage management franchise delivered 23% sequential growth over the first quarter. we continue to be excited by increasing awareness of the need for left atrial appendage management and the growing body of clinical evidence, including a recent independent laa occlusion study that was published in the new england journal of medicine and presented as a late-breaker in may at the american college of cardiology annual meeting. this was the first randomized controlled study to demonstrate that surgical laa management for afib patients undergoing cardiac surgery with surgical approaches or atriclip significantly reduces ischemic stroke and systemic embolism.
over 4,700 patients were part of the study at 105 different centers in 27 countries. surgical left atrial appendage management occlusion was found to reduce ischemic stroke by 33% overall and by 42% after the first 30 perioperative days. importantly, there were no significant safety issues identified in the study.
additionally, we welcome positive reimbursement news for surgical left atrial appendage management with the proposal by the cms for the new current procedural terminology, or cpt codes. we believe this change reflects a groundswell of support from key societies and positions, creating another tailwind for the atriclip franchise when the proposed rates take effect in 2022. and finally, touching on the cryosphere probe, our dedicated device for managing postoperative pain in thoracic patients.
our unique technology uses a differentiated freezing method to block nerves from transmitting pain signals after cardiothoracic surgery, providing a long-lasting form of pain relief for patients. cryo nerve block, which is included in our open franchise revenue is one of our fastest-growing therapies and now represents approximately 7% of worldwide revenue year-to-date. nearly 400 facilities in the u.s. are changing their standard of care to incorporate this unique approach to pain management. we are pleased with the traction we are seeing in the existing accounts and the ongoing expansion to new customers. yes, this is great progress, but we believe the market for cryo nerve block therapy still remains widely underpenetrated.
as a result, we are continuing to increase our investments in our dedicated commercial and education teams as we drive therapy awareness and adoption. in closing, we are truly excited by our broadening portfolio and bright future ahead. while we continue on a pathway toward recovery, we remain confident in the underlying strength of our business the resiliency of our team, and our many catalysts to accelerate growth in 2022 and beyond.
i will now turn the call over to angie wirick, our chief financial officer, to discuss more detailed results of the quarter.
angela l. wirick -- chief financial officer
thanks, mike. our second quarter 2021 worldwide revenue of $71.4 million increased 75% on a reported basis and 74% on a constant currency basis when compared to the second quarter of 2020. as a reminder, we experienced the most severe impact from covid-19 during the second quarter of 2020 when our revenues declined 31% from the second quarter of 2019. on a sequential basis, this quarter, we experienced growth of 20% in our worldwide revenue from the first quarter. the sequential increase was seen in all of our major markets as procedure volumes stabilize.
in the second quarter 2021, u.s. revenue was $60.1 million, a 78% increase from the second quarter of 2020, reflecting robust activity across product lines and promising growth trends. u.s. sales of appendage management products were $25.2 million, up 93% over the second quarter of 2020. u.s. sales of open ablation products, which include our cryo nerve block business, were $24.8 million, up 60% over 2020. and minimally invasive ablation sales in the u.s. were $9.7 million, up 104% from 2020 as elective procedures resumed year-over-year, and we saw some early momentum from the epi-sense launch. international revenue was $11.3 million, up 58% on a reported basis and up 50% on a constant currency basis as compared to the second quarter of 2020. similar to our u.s. results, we experienced rebounding activity in our major international markets and across our franchises.
let's turn to key metrics for the second quarter, beginning with gross margin. our gross margin was 75.8%, up more than 800 basis points from the second quarter of 2020. in the second quarter of 2021, gross margin benefited from both increased revenue as well as strong production volume as compared to the fixed cost burden to 2020 due to a temporary reduction in production activity. additionally, we continue to see beneficial geographic and product mix this year with our u.s. business accounting for 84% of our worldwide sales in the second quarter of 2021 compared to a range of 80% to 82% historically.
specific products contributing to a more favorable gross margin include heavier epi-sense, atriclip flex v, and pro v device sales. we are pleased with the improvement to our gross margin in 2021 and continue to look for durability in our results regardless of mix. as we begin the second half of 2021, we are making incremental investments to expand production capacity in support of our long-term growth and remain focused on key partnerships throughout the supply chain.
now moving to operating expenses for the quarter. for comparability, i will exclude recurring effects of non-cash adjustments to the contingent consideration liability from my comments. total operating expenses increased $24.2 million or 57% from $42.4 million in the second quarter of 2020 to $66.6 million in the second quarter of 2021. while operating expenses rose significantly, this increase is in light of top-line revenue growth of 75% over the same period. the change results mainly from personnel costs, driven by increasing headcount and variable compensation programs, travel spend returning to normal, and expanding training activities as we launch our hybrid af therapy and continued awareness across our platforms, with the combination of mobile cadaver labs and training courses.
we had an adjusted ebitda loss of $2.7 million compared to an adjusted ebitda loss of $6.1 million for the second quarter of 2020. our loss per share was $0.36 in the second quarter of 2021 compared to $0.20 loss per share in the second quarter of 2020 and while the adjusted loss per share each period was $0.30 and $0.38, respectively. our balance sheet position remains solid, and we ended the second quarter with approximately $230 million in cash and investments.
so finally, turning to our outlook for 2021. with stronger-than-expected second-quarter results, we are raising our revenue guidance for the full year and now expect to achieve approximately $270 million to $275 million in revenue. we anticipate returning to historic growth patterns, which we see a seasonal impact on procedure volumes during the third quarter. therefore, we expect third-quarter 2021 revenue to be down slightly from our strong second-quarter results, followed by an acceleration in the fourth quarter.
as mike detailed earlier in the call, tailwinds for growth across our franchises are clear. however, we remain cautious of the potential impact from a resurgence of the pandemic and its continued burden on the healthcare system globally. touching briefly on the potential financial impact of the amaze trial outcome. while it's too early to determine the full effect in our financial results because our review of the trial data is ongoing and the path forward is uncertain, we anticipate that during the second half of 2021, we may recognize material non-cash adjustments to the related intangible assets and the contingent consideration liability, which represents success-based milestone payments.
these potential adjustments will be excluded from both adjusted ebitda and adjusted loss per share metrics. we continue to expect adjusted ebitda to be a loss of approximately $10 million for the full year 2021 as we invest in strategic growth drivers across the business, expand the atricure team and continue our focus on education, innovation, and clinical science. with the rise in share-based compensation expense for the year, we now expect an adjusted loss per share for 2021 to be approximately $1.20.
at this point, i will turn the call back to mike for closing comments.
michael h. carrel -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, angie. we want to end by recognizing our healthcare workers and our scientific community. thank you for your unwavering commitment to patients and the resolve to help us all recover from the covid-19 pandemic. stay well, everyone, and thank you again for joining us today.
with that, we will open it up to questions.
",":
operator
[operator instructions] and our first question is from rick wise of stifel. please ask your question.
rick wise -- stifel -- analyst
good afternoon, mike and angie. thanks for the great quarter. maybe -- i guess i'm just going to do that. i hate to start off with amaze there's so much good news this quarter, but let me just go ahead and ask the question. i mean, i've heard angie talk about some of the financial potential adjustments ahead. maybe you could frame it, angie, how big that might be. but what are -- just not asking what next steps will be, mike, but what could they be? what are the possibilities as you look ahead and think about this? and how would you have us think about it?
michael h. carrel -- president and chief executive officer
yes. i mean, i think the best way to think about it is that the technology had great safety profile but did not meet the efficacy endpoints -- the primary efficacy endpoints. and so it's really uncertain, quite frankly, in terms of what the path forward is to -- with the technology from that standpoint, from a pma, etc.
so from our standpoint, obviously, we're going to talk to the fda. we're also going to talk to our medical advisory board. but i think as investors, i mean, this is something that everybody we should just consider. we did not meet the primary efficacy endpoint. i think that's what should be in everybody's head. and from that standpoint, anything that we get out of it is really the things we're getting out of it today and the leverage we're getting. number one is that we got a great ip portfolio; number two, the team we brought over is just spectacular. they understand the ep space. we've learned a lot about cardiology. we've learned a lot about the catheter-based technologies. we've learned a lot about manufacturing in that area.
so we've got a lot of great learnings that have come from that. and in terms of building relationships with the eps and the advisory board we have and also the help that we had with our converge and kind of confluence of kind of bringing two specialties together, i believe that we will -- it will be viewed positively from that standpoint. obviously, we're disappointed with the results, like i mentioned on the call, we were hopeful that they would be much better. but we structured the deal in a way that it was a success-based outcome on the back end of it. and unfortunately, the primary endpoints did not hit where they were supposed to hit.
rick wise -- stifel -- analyst
got you. and just as a separate follow-up. i was really intrigued, mike, with your comments about -- you opened many new sites, you're penetrating deeper in existing, i think, you said existing accounts or facilities. when i think about the incredible portfolio of technologies you have, recent launch, etc., maybe help us understand, is it everything together that's driving this greater penetration, this new account opportunity. can you quantify that at all in any way, the key drivers that are sort of tipping people over the edge, maybe talk through that, if you would?
michael h. carrel -- president and chief executive officer
sure. pretty much every one of our franchises had really different but great growth trajectories to them. so if you kind of break down the different areas that we have, let's start with kind of converge, which is the most top of mind, that's the one where we have the most upside in terms of number of net new accounts and penetration in accounts. it's obviously a much larger market opportunity for us. and the team was ready to go better than i expected, even though you kind of know you're ready, they are ready. they are talking to customers. we had a great hrs last week. there is a tremendous amount of buzz out there and a long-standing persistent label has really differentiated us in a way even better than i had expected, and really opening up conversations that -- with pretty much any site -- even the greatest skeptic that's out there.
so it's been a wonderful opening of new sites and the backlog of those sites kind of coming online are things that we're focused on right now is to how do we make sure we've got the right resources and adding those resources and bringing them on and making sure they're really well trained, so they do the procedure right. again, we're in a really good spot from that standpoint.
on the flip side of things, we continue to see great growth. you saw a 23% kind of sequential growth in that part of our business. and that's in both open and mis. both teams are just doing a wonderful job of really bringing that technology to pretty much every facility in the united states and even more so globally as well. and so we're starting to see some opening up there with people just recognizing that managing the appendage is really important and that the clip is just an outstanding technology that works incredibly well and is very safe and has been implanted in over 300,000 patients in totality.
so it's really impressive to kind of see how that just continues to build upon itself. and then on the open side of the business, you're starting to see a little bit of a rebound. we're in most sites in the u.s., but what you're starting to see is more people talk about treating. more people getting their cardiologist telling them you must treat. the data is just continuing to kind of build up over and over again, and that's allowing us to get to more surgeons within those sites who are now saying, i really do need to treat, and they're actually thinking about that. so i'd say that those are some of the things that i could share with you.
and then the cryo nerve block, which -- there's just a lot to talk about that's positive like you said. on the cryo nerve block side, you heard that we're at -- we're in almost 400 sites now. i mean, think about this, this was a nothing -- not -- we didn't have anything really about three years ago, and now we're in almost 400 sites around the country. we've got over 30 people out in the field today, either salespeople or supporting those cases. and so we're really expanding that group and we'll continue to invest to make sure we've got coverage.
operator
and our next question is from robbie marcus of jpmorgan. please ask your question.
allen -- jpmorgan -- analyst
hi, guys. this is allen [phonetic] on for robbie. i just wanted to say first congratulations on a great quarter. i'll just get both of my questions out of the way here. but to start off, your guidance range for the year looks really healthy. coming off of a very strong quarter.
so i guess what really gets you to the top of that range? and how much of that is benefit from the converge approval? and then second, diving deeper into converge, what has been the physician feedback that you've been hearing so far? thanks so much.
michael h. carrel -- president and chief executive officer
sure. i'm going to start with the second question because i think physician feedback has been -- i mean it's been incredibly positive. i mean first, most of the conversations now, the new sites aren't seeing results yet because they're just getting trained. and so it's not like we're selling a lot of net new product. what we're doing is we're getting them up and running doing their first couple of cases, training them, proctoring them, etc.
so that part has actually gone reasonably well. but the real physician feedback has been around the data. it's been presented. it's been presented over and over again at hrs at other different conferences, at different scientific sessions over the last several months. and the more people digest the data, the more they get excited about it and they start really talking about it and it really drives a really good discussion around how epicardial and endocardial combined has tremendous benefits for the patient and for the long-term effects on afib for them.
so that conversation, i mean, it just -- it continues to spawn throughout the country, and it's been really an exciting time to be part of those discussions. and our teams are really well trained to have those conversations as well. and so all the prep that was happening in advance enabled them to really kind of have deep and rich discussions to kind of get those sites up and running.
in terms of our guidance and as we kind of think about the back half of the year, nothing's really changed per se in terms of the revenue coming from converge. we're starting to get net new sites but as we've talked about before, it's really important to get them trained, get them doing the procedure right, understanding what the workflow is in their hospital, and then building upon that. and so as we kind of look to the back half of the year, there obviously is some converge, but it's really de minimis.
overall, all of our franchises are just performing incredibly well. and we've talked about this before. we've got multiple catalytic drivers to this business. yes, converge is a great foundational piece for us -- but we've got so many other different things coming down the pipeline and that are already there, whether it's -- you're starting to see the benefits of the innovation we did on clip two or three years ago. and people are really shifting over to our v clip product and technology. and as they use that more and more, and they see the benefits of that as an example.
so what's going to help us get to the top end of that range really just continued outperformance relative to what we're doing right now. i don't want to get too far ahead of ourselves because we did increase guidance quite a bit. obviously, it's more than just the $10 million beat. we increased it by almost $8 million to $10 million on top of that. and so you're -- like you said, it's a healthy guidance from that standpoint, and we feel good about it.
operator
and our next question is from matthew o'brien of piper sandler. please ask your question.
matthew o'brien -- piper sandler -- analyst
good afternoon. thanks for taking the questions. so mike, you're kind of touching on a few things here that are quite compelling but what i'm curious about is, if i look at your numbers for domestic clip and domestic mis, they are two of the better quarters you've had when you adjust for covid over the last couple of years. and that is before the real impact of the converge approval and that's really before the [indecipherable] data earlier this year as well.
so what i'm wondering is, i think you're just seeing the impact of the data from last year on the mis business and then still seeing some newer products on the clip side. are we going to get another wave here into '22 and '23 from the converge approval and then from the [indecipherable] data for those businesses? is that the momentum you're talking about specifically?
michael h. carrel -- president and chief executive officer
yes, matt, i think it -- start with the converge, yes, i mean i think when you look at '22, '23, '24, and we're just at the beginning of this. i like to say -- we always likes to use kind of baseball analogies and they say, ""what inning are you in?"" quite frankly, we're really kind of in the pregame warm-up at this point in time from my standpoint. we're just beginning to kind of get this. we're really underpenetrated. and there are a tremendous number of patients that are out there that we can treat. and we've got to make sure that we do it right and that we warm up properly to kind of go back to that analogy so that we're ready for game time. and even though we've got the approval, we've got to get these sites up and running in a good place.
so yes, i do think that's the case. i'd like to also look at -- when you look at tavr, i use this as an example a lot to our team, which is: it's taken tavr to get to the point that they are today, where it's 65,000, 75,000 procedures and patients that benefit from the technology every year in the u.s. well, 10 years ago, that was zero. and it didn't happen overnight. it happened over a decade, and it kind of builds upon itself to kind of build that kind of momentum. they got the first centers done right. they got good results and good performance and they kept building on top of that. converge, i think, is going to be the same. there is a -- and there are more long-standing persistent patients than they are patients with aortic stenosis. so we're pretty excited about that being a growth driver for many, many years to come and really building that foundation and that standard of care of practice into the future.
on top of that, you mentioned kind of the clip data that continues to come out. it's -- there's a lot of clip data that is out there. and the more and more data that gets published, obviously, the [indecipherable] data that i referred to here is incredibly positive toward treating the appendage and the benefits of it worldwide. it was a large study. and i'd say that i'm sure it's having a benefit and an impact. but i think it's really the -- you actually said, well, it's a series of data that's come out over the course of the last four to five years that have built on each other that people just now believe managing the appendage is the right thing to do.
matthew o'brien -- piper sandler -- analyst
got it. and then as a follow-up, lots of really good updates here, but i think people are going to focus on amaze as well. and obviously, that's disappointing. i'm sure you're disappointed. how do you balance the impact of that versus all of these other drivers that you have in terms of investors think about atricure, is it a massive potential headwind two or three years from now? because amaze it's going to really help you with the ep patient population -- or sorry, clinician community. just help us kind of frame up the impact of this being a negative outcome on the efficacy side. thanks.
michael h. carrel -- president and chief executive officer
yes, matt. i mean i think as i mentioned in my comments, we are hopeful this is going to have great results, but we structured the deal to be a success-based deal on purpose because we didn't obviously know it -- know what the end game was going to be on the results there. we were hopeful like everybody else, and we really wanted there to be great results there. from that standpoint.
that being said, we've built the business to be incredibly robust with a lot of catalysts, and we are going to lean into our future and continue to be innovative across every one of our platforms. and sometimes we're going to take shots and they're not going to come to complete fruition for us. we're going to take a lot of shots on goal, but we're going to be smart about those. we're going to be smart about how we take those shots and be efficient with it, which i think we've been in the things that we've done. but if you look at many of the shots we've done, whether it's cryo nerve block or converge, or the new encompass clamp that just got clearance, i mean, these are things that i think are going to drive meaningful growth for us into the next decade. and sometimes the things we think aren't going to come to complete fruition and we've got to recognize it, learn from it, and kind of continue to move forward and continue to innovate and find ways to help patients out.
we really weren't counting on any revenue from this in the, call it, the midterm over the next two to three years until we got the approval on it. so it doesn't have any meaningful effect on that. as you look beyond that, i think we're going to continue to think creatively about other innovative things we're going to bring to the table to make sure that we can continue to hit high growth that we expect and that you come to expect from us.

our next question is from mike matson of needham & company. please ask your question.
mike matson -- needham & company -- analyst
yes. thanks for taking my questions. i guess i wanted to ask one about encompass. so obviously, it sounds like it makes the procedures easier to do, but is this also going to be something where you're going to be able to get a price premium over the other types of ablation products you're selling?
michael h. carrel -- president and chief executive officer
it's a really good question. the answer is, over the clamp? yes. so if somebody is using a single clamp in a procedure, it's going to be more than that. however, depending upon what an individual surgeon, if they start using a clamp, plus cryo, plus a pen to test and other products on top of that, it's probably relatively equivalent.
so the good news is you're not going to see -- i mean you might see some small upside in some cases, over time, like those that might use it if it's somebody who's replacing what they were doing before or mostly and really the focus is going to be on-net new physicians that are going to be using it. and so those net new physicians are the ones that we're really focused on long term, and those are the ones that are going to drive really more penetration.
so while it might affect a little bit on the existing physicians, it's really going to have a much bigger effect on penetration. so long term, it's just going to help us get from 25% to 50% penetration, if not more, in the cardiac surgery market.
mike matson -- needham & company -- analyst
okay. got it. and then i just want to ask about atriclip attachment rate to the epi-sense convergent procedures. what are you -- i know it's early days since it was approved, but what are you seeing there in terms of the use of atriclip with that procedure?
michael h. carrel -- president and chief executive officer
we're continuing to see the same numbers that we've seen really for the last 18 months or so, which is kind of in the 60%, 70% range on attachment in any given week or month, or quarter. that's really been fairly consistent. the new sites that are coming on board, they have an interest in atriclip, but we're really first and foremost focused on, we're really -- we want them to do a really good job on using epi-sense and getting that down first, getting the workflow with that first, and then they can add the clip after they get really good at that.
and so we're not seeing much attachment to the net new sites at first. eventually, that is likely probably going to happen because people, a lot of who want to use the clip with it, but were being very diligent and disciplined about making sure they don't do it, especially in their first five to 10 cases because we really want to make sure they're getting the convergent part down. they understand the maps. they understand how to work collaboratively with the ep.
mike matson -- needham & company -- analyst
okay. great. thank you.
operator
our next question is from bill plovanic of canaccord. please ask your question.
bill plovanic -- canaccord -- analyst
yes. great. thanks. so i'm going to ask one on guidance and the other on the cryo business. and i'll start with the cryo business. given it was 7% of revenues this quarter, 6% last quarter. i mean, you have -- it's such a massive quarter. the math tells me that business almost doubled sequentially, and that's a pretty big bump from kind of the run rate it was going at. i just wanted to get your thoughts on that first.
michael h. carrel -- president and chief executive officer
so it's a good question, bill. and my comments in the script may have been a little misleading. it's 7% for the year-to-date. so actually, it's, i think, around 10%, 11% for the year -- i'm sorry, for the second quarter. so it's even a bigger jump from q1 to q2 than you were talking about.
bill plovanic -- canaccord -- analyst
okay. that's helpful. and then as we -- for angie, on guidance as we think about the q3 summer seasonality, i think, consensus now is about $65 million. that's about 10% down from where you were in q2. and as i think of the $8 million to $10 million incrementally, should we think about sprinkling some of that into q3 and then the balance in q4? or is that kind of all q4? i mean, we've heard from other companies heightened vacations as we go into august. and i just want to get kind of your thoughts on that.
angela l. wirick -- chief financial officer
sure. we are definitely conscious with what we're hearing about vacations and more than anything with just a really strong second quarter, we do expect some of the seasonality to resume. and i'll reiterate what i said in my comments, bill, which is we would expect a step down from what we did in the second quarter, less than the $71 million and then an increase in the fourth quarter, a 10% drop from the second to third quarter historically for atricure is not normal for us. it's typically a couple of percentage points without giving kind of specific numbers of how you should think about the second-half guidance increase. but that's what i would expect, a step down in the third quarter and then an increase in fourth.
bill plovanic -- canaccord -- analyst
great. and then if i could sneak one more in just on lariat. i know you've been -- had some kind of ongoing residual revenues from that product line. would you expect that to go away and discontinue sales of that product with the u.s. data? or would you believe you'd continue to sell it?
michael h. carrel -- president and chief executive officer
i don't expect to discontinue sales of that product. as i said, the safety profile was excellent. we'll continue to sell in europe. we'll continue to sell it in the u.s. we've got many physicians that use it and really like the product and get great benefit from it and feel like they're helping their patients out in many different ways. and so we'll continue to sell it. obviously, it's a very small portion of our revenue, but we'll continue to sell it and support it, at least for the foreseeable future. we don't have any plans at this point in time to change that.
bill plovanic -- canaccord -- analyst
thanks for taking my questions.

our next question is from marie thibault of btig. please ask your question.
marie thibault -- btig -- analyst
yes. thank you for taking the questions and congrats on a good quarter. i wanted to dig a little bit more on your comments in the prepared script about some regions that are getting hit a little harder by some of the variants -- the covid variants. so i would like to hear a little more detail on that. i know that you do have volume that comes from places like texas and florida.
michael h. carrel -- president and chief executive officer
yes, i'd say that it's what you would expect. you're starting to see, and you probably heard this from many other companies, is that kind of the northern part of florida, starting with jacksonville and now moving into kind of southern georgia, alabama, and the state of mississippi, they're basically pushing off as much as possible elective procedures.
now they're typically giving kind of a two-week kind of moratorium on them as they kind of digest the covid patients that have come in and kind of think through about the icu beds. this is all about icu beds at the end of the day. that's why they shut them down as they don't have enough room in the hospital for those elective procedures. right now, it's mostly -- and everything we're seeing is in that region of the country, where they tend to be the most hot spots for us. we're hopeful that it gets contained there, like everybody else, i think. but of course, none of us know for sure what that spread is going to look like. so i'll just put my plug in to make sure everybody gets vaccinated.
marie thibault -- btig -- analyst
that's very helpful, mike. thank you. then i guess my follow-up here on converge. i realize we're quite early in the launch, but i would like to hear your plans on how you plan to go after the referral network and make sure that cardiologists and doctors up the chain are aware of converge and also make sure that patients are hearing about the option. thank you.
michael h. carrel -- president and chief executive officer
yes, it's a really insightful and good question, marie. like, as we look at longer-term, i'd say our first goal is to get those sites that the ep and the surgeon and get them working together and get them doing the procedure really, really well and get enough sites that we've got critical mass across the country on that front. and we're starting to work with them on helping them understand what the cardiologists think about these patients and why they're not referring them to date. i'd say we're piloting and learning on that front. that's probably going to be the case for the next six to 12 months. then we'll build upon that once we have many more centers and we've learned from what is that referral community looking like and how many patients have they been holding back from the little that we've done so far in that area.
what we're starting to see is that there are a lot of patients that are still being held by internists and cardiologists because they were not getting good results when they were referring on the long-standing persistent side. and so our plans would really be learn now, make sure we got centers that can do this procedure really well. and then as we look to maybe the back half of next year into the year after that, we'll start to look at more aggressively getting after and educating kind of the cardiology community in a more aggressive way at that point.
marie thibault -- btig -- analyst
okay. thanks for the detail.

our next question is from suraj kalia of oppenheimer & company. please ask your question.
suraj kalia -- oppenheimer & company -- analyst
hey, mike, angie, congrats on the quarter. can you hear me all right?
michael h. carrel -- president and chief executive officer
thank you. yes, we hear you great. thanks, suraj.
suraj kalia -- oppenheimer & company -- analyst
perfect. so mike, i have to ask the obvious question and forgive me for belaboring this. so on amaze, was the issue just a confounding impact of including atrial flutter stroke or systemic embolism? i guess i'm trying to at least just see, was there a residual effect of ligation with lariat? and the curve has eventually overlapped over time? just since you all have seen the data, do we have any sense of where the primary efficacy endpoint went off the rails?
michael h. carrel -- president and chief executive officer
yes. so a couple of things. again, i'll try to reiterate that. maybe i'll first define the trial, so everybody just has a good -- the trial was pvi in one arm and pvi plus the lariat in the other arm. and the endpoint of it was a reduction in afib and that one was going to have a greater reduction of afib in that patient population. and so it was meant to be -- it was designed to be a superiority trial. so it had to hit a net benefit, it was a very high bar for that to hit much like converge where the superiority trials, it hit a really high bar in differential to win the trial at the end in superiority.
so given that, when with the primary safety endpoint, we did incredibly well with, all good. and so that was actually something that we were very pleased with. it showed that the team at lariat and sentreheart, the team that when we bought the company, had done an incredible job of training the physicians to make sure that this is a very safe procedure and done well, it can be done safely.
and then on the primary efficacy, we didn't quite meet the superiority endpoint. and so it's -- and it's across the board. there's no one signal on that. it's just we did not meet the primary endpoint. there's not a lot more data that we can share at this time relative to that. but it did not hit the same, again, high bar that it needed to hit in order to kind of get statistical significance of benefit there.
suraj kalia -- oppenheimer & company -- analyst
yes, mike, in terms of the appendage business overall, right? you guys have been on a really good cliff sequentially, year-over-year, however, you want to look at it. and one of the things that we -- and you and i have talked about this, that we consistently picked up in the field was the incremental af burden reduction thesis has seeped into the field, which was driving a number of atriclip pull-throughs. given -- do you expect any collateral issues with amaze seeping into the atriclip business moving forward? or you think -- just kind of walk us through how at least for the next few quarters, you're thinking about any collateral impact and/or mitigating that impact.
michael h. carrel -- president and chief executive officer
it's a really fair question. but the atriclip and lariat are actually very different devices. they're both put on epicardially, but they're actually very different in terms of both the closure mechanism. i mean the atriclip is put on during cardiac surgery, so it's obviously a much larger device. the closure rates are near 100% at complete closure on it. and so it's a different device than the lariat from that standpoint.
again, the lariat is a wonderful device. it just didn't get to the same net benefit on the afib reduction. that doesn't -- i'm not suggesting that it didn't have good closure or anything like that. it just didn't get to the same benefit on the afib reduction from that standpoint. but i will say that atriclip is an excellent device. it's proven to actually -- we've actually tested it out, and we're seeing great benefit with that device. and so i don't see any collateral damage in any way.
suraj kalia -- oppenheimer & company -- analyst
got it. and angie, forgive me if this was mentioned, just hopping a bit in the calls. what was the incremental contribution of converge in the quarter? thank you for taking my questions.
angela l. wirick -- chief financial officer
thanks, suraj. i know everyone is interested in specifics on converge and that franchise revenue. we're not giving that information at this time. i think just as a reminder of our mis business, it's a combination of both the converge business and the deep procedure. and we've talked about the deep procedure in that particular business line in the past. and while it's have some small growth. it's not the same expectations as we would see out of converge.
so majority of the growth in the quarter would come from converge, but not giving specifics on the revenue dollars for the quarter.

our next question is from danielle antalffy of svb leerink. please ask your question.
danielle antalffy -- svb leerink -- analyst
hey. good afternoon, everyone. thanks for taking the question. congrats on a really strong quarter. mike, i know you alluded to this in your prepared remarks. but as it relates to converge, i'm curious what you're seeing. obviously, that launch is gaining momentum. i know you're not breaking that number out. it feels like maybe a little bit more than we thought. but just curious about what you're seeing at the centers that are adopting converge.
are you seeing any uplift in your open ablation and clip products and sort of how -- based on what you're seeing, is there any change in your view of how that could play out going forward?
michael h. carrel -- president and chief executive officer
yes, i'd say from a clip standpoint, yes, we continue to see people wanting to manage the appendage. we're anticipating getting it from that standpoint. from the open business, i would -- i couldn't correlate kind of what's happening on converge to a benefit that we're seeing on the open side of our business. i'd say maybe that's something longer term, maybe you get people that are more interested in treating afib. i think it's a really good question and possibility, but i wouldn't say it's too early to tell whether or not that's going to happen since we've really kind of only been approved since late april.
danielle antalffy -- svb leerink -- analyst
yes. okay. that's fair. and then i guess my next question is, again, amaze is disappointing, but likely, you have so many shots on goal and you're in a new product cycle now. but amaze was another product targeting the ep physician population. i mean, do you think this is going to impact the footprint you have at the ep? or no, you think you have enough of their mind share with converge? thanks so much.
michael h. carrel -- president and chief executive officer
i think that -- obviously, we wanted to have products that we will put in the hands of the eps. we'll continue to, i think -- and we still have the product. and as i mentioned, it's an excellent product on many different fronts. that being said, the converge itself with the differentiation and the collaboration that's going on there. we've got great growth drivers in that area for many years to come, and we're building great relationships with eps in that area.
so i feel really good about the work that we're doing in converge and then kind of ancillary products that may be built around it that the eps might be able to kind of leverage or use in that collaboration.
danielle antalffy -- svb leerink -- analyst
thank you.
